"The new flat-rate State Pension - how will you be affected? Paul Lewis takes your calls. Travelers quarantined in a Hong Kong hotel for a week after a Mexican guest tested positive for H1N1 flu expressed frustration on Saturday at the tough steps and a medical expert said authorities had over-reacted. Mexico announced on Sunday that its swine flu epidemic had passed the worst and experts said the new H1N1 virus might be no more severe than normal flu, although it could still impact on world health."

"The new strain of H1N1 flu that has killed 56 people in Mexico and has been carried around the world by travelers acts more like a pandemic strain than regular seasonal flu, researchers reported on Monday. They said it was transmitted more easily and affects young adults more often than annual flu strains, justifying the World Health Organization's stepped-up level of pandemic alert, currently a 5. The 1918 influenza pandemic was the worst of the 20th century, killing anywhere between 25 million and 100 million people, depending on estimates. Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent."
