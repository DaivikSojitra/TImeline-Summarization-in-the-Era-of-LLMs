"BP has failed to stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico using so-called top kill and junk shot techniques, prompting an exasperated response from Barack Obama.

In its latest attempt to contain the worst oil spill in US history, it is to launch a four - to seven-day operation that will involve more oil leaking into the Gulf even if it works. Obama described the setback as enraging '' and heartbreaking '', as documents revealed safety concerns dating back to last June."

"WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP dampened hopes that it could plug its leaking Gulf of Mexico well sooner than forecast on Thursday, while a battle between the U.S. government and the oil industry over a deepwater drilling ban heads to court. BP stuck to its August target to complete a relief well to halt the worst oil spill in U.S. history, after a press report raised hopes the company could stem the 80-day-old leak sooner. The head of BP's Gulf Coast restoration unit, Bob Dudley, told the Wall Street Journal that it could be possible to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 in a perfect world with no interruptions ''. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has killed more birds than any other oil spill in U.S. history, according to a study published in Nature. The study found that a small spill in the Baltic Sea in 1976 killed more than 60,000 long-tailed ducks. The BP spill has killed more than 1,200 birds so far. The Obama administration has given BP 24 hours to provide a detailed description of what they will do in the weeks ahead and how they will do it."

"The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has reawakened painful memories for people who lived through what was America's worst spill - until now - in the once-bountiful waters of southern Alaska. The Obama administration is calling for environmental reviews for all new deepwater oil drilling, spelling an end, for the time being at least, to the kind of exemptions that allowed BP to drill its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico with little scrutiny. The White House is facing a growing challenge to its claim that most of the oil from the Deepwater disaster has disappeared from the Gulf of Mexico, as at least two independent teams of scientists reported new evidence of oil persisting deep under the surface of the sea."
