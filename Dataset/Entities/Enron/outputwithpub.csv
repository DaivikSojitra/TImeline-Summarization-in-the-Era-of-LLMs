1999-07-21,"A full - blooded bidding war for Europe 's largest energy market , the International Petroleum Exchange ( IPE ) in London , moved closer yesterday as a high - powered US team threw down the gauntlet to the exchange 's management .
New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) chairman Daniel Rappaport said : "" We mean to close this transaction "" .
Hinting at an increased offer for control of the exchange , Mr Rappaport and Nymex president Patrick Thompson urged IPE members to vote down a management plan to sell 70 % of the IPE to a five - strong corporate group - BG , Distrigas , America 's Enron , Nordpoool of Scandinavia and Sweden 's OM Gruppen - and instead to throw in their lot with Nymex .
Until now , the cash value of the Nymex bid and the management plan has been identical , valuing the whole of the IPE at £ 35.7 m .
But yesterday , Mr Rappaport left the door open for an increased bid .
Even before any such increase , Nymex was yesterday wooing IPE members with a number of tempting "" extras "" , including a commitment to carry on the IPE 's cherished "" open outcry "" floor trading , in contrast to management plans to shift to electronic screens , and a share of Nymex 's own board seats for IPE members , in addition to the seats to which they would be entitled .
IPE members will vote on the exchange 's future at an extraordinary general meeting on July 30 ."
2000-10-02,"A part - built gas pipeline in Tibet threatens to become a major embarrassment for several multinational oil companies after the Dalai Lama urged them to withdraw their support for Chinese firms involved in the huge project .
The Tibetan government in exile has called for an immediate halt to the construction of several oil and gas schemes that are being backed by multinationals such as BP Amoco , Enron and Agip .
It argues that the pipeline is of no benefit to the Tibetan people and will merely accelerate the influx of Chinese migrants into Tibet .
The exiled administration , based in India and headed by the Dalai Lama , urged the corporations last week to withdraw their investments from "" Chinese entities engaged in these activities "" .
They include China 's two largest oil firms , PetroChina and Sinopec .
This is the first time that the government in exile has taken a position on oil and gas development in Tibet , which was invaded by the Chinese in 1950 .
"" Our position with respect to development is clear : we support projects which benefit the Tibetan people and oppose those which cause harm , "" Kalon TC Tethong , minister for international relations in the Dalai Lama 's government , said .
"" This project represents a significant escalation of China 's exploitation of oil and gas on the Tibetan plateau and will accelerate China 's policy of transferring Chinese settlers into Tibetan areas . "" The controversial 953 km ( 592 mile )
Sebei - Lanzhou pipeline is part of China 's "" western development plan "" .
After pressure from human rights groups and Tibetan supporters worldwide , BP Amoco decided not to participate in a joint venture around the pipeline .
But last month it announced a £ 400 m investment in Sinopec .
The BP Amoco is now the largest foreign oil investor in China , having pumped in $ 2.5bn ( £ 1.7bn ) .
Last night a BP spokesman said the company had no direct interests in Tibet .
But he added : "" China is a very fast - growing market - one of the biggest in the world and an area where we wish to be a significant player . ""
At a press conference in New Delhi on Friday , Mr Tethong said that China 's "" hardline policy "" on Tibet threatened the "" total destruction of an entire civilisation "" .
Beijing 's assumption that the issue of Tibet would resolve itself after the Dalai Lama 's death was "" fatally flawed "" , he added .
The World Bank was forced recently to scrap a contentious $ 160 m ( £ 109 m ) loan to China which would have been used to resettle some 58,000 Chinese farmers in Qinghai province .
Pro -
Tibet campaigners argued that the loan would have had a devastating impact on the region 's remaining 6 m Tibetans , and the prospects for the survival of their ancient culture and Buddhist religion ."
2001-04-29,"Utility giant Scottish Power is considering a move to bolster its American West Coast operations by swooping on Oregon 's Portland General in a deal that could total $ 3bn ( £ 2.17bn ) .
Portland 's owner , Enron , last week broke off talks with US utility Sierra Pacific over a deal said to be worth $ 3.1bn .
This opened the door to Scottish Power .
A City source said Portland , which sells power to 725,000 customers in and around the state capital of Oregon , would be a perfect fit for the Pacificorp business in the north - west US , which Scottish bought in 1999 for £ 4.7bn .
Scottish has consistently said it wants to build up its business in the US .
PacifiCorp has some 1.5 m residential , commercial and industrial customers spread over six states : Oregon , California , Washington , Wyoming , Utah and Idaho . '
Portland sits in the middle of PacifiCorp territory in Oregon , ' he said .
' There would be added customers and big synergies in infrastructure , operations , and head office functions .
It would make sense . '
Scottish Power 's management will be quizzed about the move when it sets out its strategy in the UK and US at a results meeting this week .
There have been concerns over PacifiCorp after the shutdown of the Hunter power plant in Utah forced the company to buy in electricity at prices vastly inflated by the California power shortage .
The problem cost Scottish Power £ 160 million in the first nine months of last year .
It would also come up against regulatory issues if it embarked on a bid .
Earnings from PacifiCorp are expected to come in at around £ 349 m before exceptionals .
Peter Atherton , utilities analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney , said : ' I would expect Scottish Power to be looking very closely at PGE , given their stated strategy of adding to their PacifiCorp assets . '
 Analysts will also be keen on a progress report on the sale of Southern Water , valued at £ 1.7bn with £ 1bn of debt , on Thursday .
They are expecting pre - tax profits to fall from £ 737 m last year to £ 616 m this ."
2001-05-26,"Applicants for jobs on the commission regulating the US energy market have been vetted by the Enron Corporation , the country 's biggest electricity power company and a significant contributor to George Bush 's election campaign , according to a report published yesterday .
Soon after being appointed chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , Curtis Hébert told the New York Times , he received a telephone call from the Enron president , Kenneth Lay , offering the company 's backing to help him keep his job if he adapted his views on deregulation .
Mr Hébert said he was offended by the approach and turned down the offer .
His appointment as chairman , which was provisional pending the nomination of other members of the commission , has since been called into question by Vice - President Dick Cheney .
Mr Hébert 's chief of staff , Walter Ferguson , confirmed the newspaper account yesterday . ""
[ Mr Hébert ] has always been forthright and he 's been a straight - shooter with folks in the industry , "" he said .
Mr Lay , a close friend of the Bush family , confirmed that the telephone call took place , but said it was Mr Hébert who asked for Enron 's backing to keep his job .
Either way , environmentalists and other critics of President Bush argue , the fact that the conversation took place at all demonstrates the leading role corporations like Enron have in making energy policy in Washington under the new administration .
According to a joint investigation by the New York Times and Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) , Mr Lay and other Enron executives interviewed other candidate members of the regulatory commission and supplied the president 's personnel adviser , Clay Johnson , with a list of the company 's preferred candidates .
The two commissioners Mr Bush chose to fill the vacant Republican seats both had the backing of Enron and other power companies .
"" It just confirms what we believed and what we 've been saying , that the Bush - Cheney energy plan is written by corporations and it 's in the interests of the corporations , "" said Kevin Curtis , vice - president for government affairs of the National Environmental Trust , a Washington pressure group .
Enron , a $ 100 billion behemoth in the energy trading market , was a significant backer of Mr Bush in last year 's election .
It contributed $ 1.7 m to Republican candidates , 72 % of its total campaign spending .
It is a strong supporter of deregulation in the electric power market , in particular the opening up of state markets to outside suppliers .
At the time of the phone call from Mr Lay , Mr Hébert had launched an investigation of the pricing policies of big electricity traders , such as Enron . ""
One of our problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex arbitrage activities of a company like Enron , "" he told the New York Times , adding : "" We 're trying to do it now and we may have some results soon . ""
Mr Ferguson confirmed yesterday that the investigation would continue .
The large - scale deregulation of regional electricity markets since 1996 has failed to reduce prices in many states , and since the chaos and power shortages produced by the botched deregulation in California , the pace of market reform has slowed down , much to the frustration of Enron .
In their telephone conversation , a few weeks after Mr Hébert 's appointment , he said Mr Lay told him that "" he and Enron would like to support me as chairman , but we would have to agree on principles "" .
Those principles would involve the pace and nature of deregulation .
Mr Lay said that there was "" never any intent "" to link Mr Hébert 's employment with the commission 's policies .
When Mr Hébert , a former Mississippi state regulator , was given the chairman 's job in January , the White House told him he would keep it at least until Mr Bush 's other nominees , Pat Wood and Nora Brownell , were confirmed by the Senate .
Their appointment was confirmed this week , and Vice - President Cheney told PBS that Mr Wood , head of the Texas public utility commission , should now get Mr Hébert 's job .
Mr Ferguson said yesterday that the president was the only one who could decide whether Mr Hébert should keep his job .
Other candidates for seats on the commission also say that Enron played a role in the selection process .
Joe Garcia , a Florida regulator and now a leader of the Cuban - American National Foundation , an exile pressure group , said he was interviewed by Mr Lay and other Enron officials ."
2001-08-09,"Two men died yesterday and two others were seriously injured when an explosion and fire ripped through a power station .
The blast happened in a transformer room at the Enron power station near Middlesbrough , Teesside , causing fire to break out .
The injured workers were taken to Middlesbrough general hospital with burns .
Hundreds of staff were on site at the time of the blast and they were all evacuated .
Hospital staff said one of the men was in a critical condition with severe burns and the other patient is stable with moderate burns .
The power plant began commercial operations in 1995 and it generates electricity from natural gas and produces steam for companies including BP , Du Pont , ICI and Union Carbide .
It is owned and operated by the US multinational company Enron .
A statement from Enron Teesside Operations said : "" We can confirm there was an explosion and subsequent fire at Teesside power station at around 2.40pm .
Emergency services were called and it is now under control and there is no danger off site .
The area surrounding the power station has been evacuated .
The company has set up an incident room and we are liaising with emergency services .
"" The power station was off - line last night .
An inspector from the health and safety executive is on site and more inspectors will be sent there today .
The HSE said there was no risk to outsiders from the explosion .
If there was a manslaughter case to answer , the investigation would be passed to Cleveland police .
Inspector Sue Coates said the cause of the blast was not yet known .
Damage was confined to a small area of the site and four people were in the area at the time ."
2001-10-04,"BG yesterday put India at the core of its operations by spending $ 388 m ( £ 270 m ) on the purchase of upstream assets there from US energy group , Enron .
The demerged international arm of the former British Gas hopes to solve India 's growing energy shortage by developing new fields as gas demand in that country grows by 50 % over the next 10 years .
The latest deal - which must still be ratified by field partners and the Indian government - involves Enron 's 30 % stake in Tapti gas scheme and the Panna - Mukta oil and gas field north west of Mumbai .
It also involves a 63 % stake in the CB - OS/1 exploration licence in Gujarat .
BG hopes to take over field operatorship from Enron but could face opposition from the local Indian group , Oil and Natural Gas Corporation which bid unsuccessfully for the same assets .
BG chief executive Frank Chapman said the deal "" significantly enhanced BG 's position as a leading player in the large and rapidly growing Indian energy market .
"" It also underlined the company 's desire to build an integrated gas company - involving both upstream and downstream operations - as it has been a distributor of gas in India for 10 years .
In August BG bought a liquified natural gas terminal in Gujarat for $ 80 m .
Analysts broadly welcomed the Enron deal .
They said it was an obvious move at a "" sensible "" price though they warned that India was never an easy place to operate .
Enron has been keen to sell off assets "" not integrated into our wholesale or retail energy businesses "" but the disposal to BG does not include its 65 % holding in the Dabhol Power Company which is owed $ 64 m by the Maharashtra state electricity board .
A dispute over this non - payment has been going on for nine months ."
2001-11-09,"Enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main British assets under the terms of an $ 8bn takeover being considered by Dynegy , its smaller rival .
The two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see Houston firm Dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a "" fire - sale "" price worth about a tenth of Enron 's $ 70bn value a year ago .
The outcome would be a humiliation for Enron , America 's largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the Republican party and the presidential campaign last year .
It has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as Shell in the past few days to keep it afloat .
Enron 's shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director Andrew Fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet .
These forced it to take a $ 1bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1.2bn .
Two other senior officials , including Enron 's treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky Fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission .
Pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between Enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status .
ChevronTexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of Dynegy , would inject up to $ 2.5bn if the deal goes ahead .
Enron , also based in Houston , owns Wessex Water , for which it paid £ 1.4bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in Britain , including the high - performing 1900MW Teesside plant .
It recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of Sainsbury and Guinness .
Dynegy is paying £ 421 m for BG 's gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its "" stingy "" financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of British power stations on offer because of inflated prices ."
2001-11-29,"As recently as March this year , analysts were singing the praises of Enron , the US energy conglomerate .
"" The company is controversial because its valuation is very high , "" said Lawrence Fuller , a money manager at Merrill Lynch .
"" But they have a tremendous lead over their rivals and a mastery of their business . ""
Controversial seems an understatement now .
Last year , Enron was in exalted company , rubbing shoulders with corporate titans such as IBM , Citigroup and General Electric .
It ranked No . 7 on the Fortune 500 , with $ 100bn ( £ 70.2bn ) in revenues .
At its peak share price last year of around $ 90 , Enron had a market value of over $ 66bn .
Now , it is worth about $ 400 m and faces bankruptcy after its smaller rival , Dynegy pulled out of a rescue merger .
Dynegy said that it pulled out of the deal because of "" misrepresentations "" on Enron 's part .
Enron 's fall constitutes one of America 's most spectacular corporate collapses .
Enron started unravelling in October , when it revealed a $ 35 m charge to reflect losses in two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to move debt off its balance sheet and hide losses .
It was also forced to knock $ 1.2bn off shareholder equity .
The company 's share price plunged 60 % .
Worse was to follow when the company acknowledged earlier this month that it had overstated profits by $ 586 m over the past four years .
Formed in 1985 as a result of a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth of Omaha , Nebraska , Enron was transformed by its chairman , Kenneth Lay , from a regional natural gas pipeline company into the world 's largest energy trading company .
Under Mr Lay , Enron 's market capitalisation shot up from $ 2bn to $ 70bn as the company reached its zenith last year .
It received praise for its "" innovative "" approach in bringing high - tech and complex finance to energy trading .
Enron specialised in contracts to deliver natural gas , electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities in the future .
It also sold financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices .
By last year , Enron was involved in a quarter of all electricity and natural gas deals in the world and it had big operations in Brazil and India .
"" When the heat is on literally , "" said one analyst earlier this year , "" people need a company like Enron for physical delivery because it has so many ways to get them that resource .
"" From energy , Enron branched out into trading various industrial and telecommunications products and financial contracts linked to these commodities .
Its aggressive expansion did not impress everyone and its opaque finances set off alarm bells with some financial analysts .
But Enron just brushed off criticisms of its murky finances .
When an analyst once challenged Enron 's chief executive officer , Jeffrey Skilling , in a conference call to produce the company 's balance sheet , Mr Skilling called him an "" asshole "" .
The heir apparent to Mr Lay , Mr Skilling suddenly resigned in August , citing "" entirely personal reasons "" .
In an interview with Business Week , Mr Lay was adamant that there were no "" issues "" behind the resignation .
"" There are no accounting issues , no trading issues , no reserve issues , not previously unknown problem issues .
The company is probably the strongest and best shape that it has ever been in , "" he said .
That has proved be so much tosh and Mr Skilling 's hasty exit was a warning of things to come .
Enron employees have suffered massively as their retirement plans were stuffed with Enron shares .
As Enron 's share price plummeted , employees were forbidden to change their investments .
Those losses contrasted sharply with the profits by top Enron executives , who sold company shares during the last few years .
Mr Lay made $ 20.7 m during the first months of this year by exercising stock options - and more than $ 180 m by exercising stock options during the three previous years .
Calamitous as it is for its employees , Enron 's collapse is not expected to have the same repercussions as the fall , three years ago , of Long - Term Capital Management , the hedge fund .
Individual banks such as Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland , which hold Enron debt , will take a hit , but the broader effect is limited as much of the debt has been parcelled out in small chunks to many lenders .
But Enron 's collapse will raise questions about the wisdom of letting market forces - in reality a handful of energy companies - manage prices .
At the very least , regulators will have to watch more closely the energy markets and insist on more transparent financial practices to prevent another Enron debacle ."
2001-11-30,"Enron Corporation , the US energy group embroiled in allegations of financial irregularities and saddled with $ 15bn ( £ 10bn ) of debt , was last night poised to file for the biggest bankruptcy reorganisation in corporate history .
The firm employs 4,000 workers in Britain at Wessex Water and power stations on Teesside .
It is a big trader on the London Metal Exchange .
The company , whose main business is energy trading , is in crisis following the termination of a multi - billion pound rescue bid .
Rival company Dynegy pulled out of merger talks to save the debt - ridden company , which has seen its shares collapse by 90 % since mid - October .
As reverberations were felt across the world 's energy and financial markets , administrators were called in at the group 's London - based European arm .
Some markets halted Enron operations and Wall Street braced itself for a blizzard of litigation .
The Houston based group , of which former energy secretary Lord Wakeham is a non - executive director , is facing the prospect of a barrage of lawsuits from investors who fear their savings and pensions will disappear if Enron goes under .
Lord Wakeham , who joined the Enron board in 1994 , was yesterday unavailable for comment .
If Enron is forced under , lawyers said they will target its senior management , accountants and financial advisers in their quest for compensation .
In New York yesterday , Enron shares plunged still further on the expectation that the firm will seek protection from its creditors within days .
In Europe administrators have warned of job losses among 5,000 European workers .
Water watchdog Ofwat said it had been assured it was "" business as usual "" for services delivered by Wessex Water , so customers would see no changes in service .
An official at Wessex Water , which employs 1,400 workers and serves millions of customers in Wiltshire , Dorset , Somerset , Hampshire , Devon and Gloucester , said whatever happened at Enron would have no effect on Wessex 's services or its financial position ."
2001-11-30,"ING , the Dutch financial group , today said it would lose $ 195m(£136 m ) if Enron , the US energy trader , went bankrupt .
Shares in ING fell 1 % after the Dutch group said it has total unsecured exposure to Enron of about $ 195 m , most of it in bank loans .
Enron is expected to file for bankruptcy proceedings next week , and other international financial institutions , including JP Morgan Chase , have already disclosed their exposure to the US group .
ING 's exposure is less than JP Morgan 's $ 500 m , but more than the UK 's Abbey National $ 164 m , and analysts said it was greater than expected .
Meanwhile , hundreds of Enron employees in London were kept on tenderhooks , after accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers said hundreds of jobs in London would be lost by the end of the day following Enron 's financial collapse .
Tony Lomas at PwC , which was appointed administrator yesterday to the European holding company of Enron , said : "" We have to decide if we ask people to come into work next week , whether we can pay them .
There are limited funds available
so it 's inevitable that we shall have to release a large number of people .
""
Enron , which employs 3,700 workers in the UK - in London , at Wessex Water , and power stations on Teesside - faces bankruptcy after Dynegy , a rival company , pulled out of a rescue merger .
Dynegy said that Enron , America 's seventh largest company , had "" made misrepresentations "" .
Enron 's failure would be America 's largest bankruptcy ever .
Mr Lomas was today more reassuring about the group 's jobs in the power stations .
"" There are some businesses in this group that are not in the administration process and those people 's jobs are intact for the time being at least , "" Mr Lomas said .
Enron 's European arm yesterday went into administration , after its parent company cut funding to the trading operation in London .
Meanwhile , Abbey National bank disclosed that it had loans to Enron of £ 115 m .
But the bank said that its retail credit quality remained robust .
Abbey National said it would make a provision of up to £ 95 m for its exposure to Enron in the second half of its financial year . ""
Excluding the impact of Enron , the group 's overall performance is in line with market expectations , "" it said in a trading update ."
2001-11-30,"Until a few weeks ago , a huge banner was strung across the headquarters of Enron in Houston , emblazoned "" The world 's leading company "" .
There were plenty who endorsed the claim and the corporate culture of ambition , arrogance and rapid money - making which lay behind it .
Enron 's revenue growth had been spectacular , from $ 7.6bn in 1986 to $ 101bn in 2000 .
The accolades from analysts , management consultants and internet gurus poured in : as recently as last June , the Economist praised Enron for creating what might be the "" most successful internet venture of any company in any industry anywhere "" .
But , the banner was recently taken down and in one of the biggest corporate collapses in US history , Enron 's shares fell 85 % on Wednesday ( and more yesterday ) .
The corporation is now expected to file for bankruptcy in the next few days .
But this is more than a spectacular corporate saga , it also represents comeuppance for a form of aggressive capitalism and political manipulation which earned Enron many enemies .
A combination of borrowing heavily and concealing it in "" off - balance sheet "" deals , meant that the crisis only became apparent a month ago .
The repercussions are now beginning to emerge as the company 's "" aggressive accounting "" - as the Wall Street Journal put it - is unravelled , and major lenders such as JP Morgan Chase are likely to be vulnerable .
Not to mention the damage to thousands of Enron employees ' pensions , and the holdings of many investors in the US , who saw it as one of the surest bets of the dot.com mania .
But the energy markets have not been as shaken as was first feared possible a month ago .
Losers apart , there will be many dancing on Enron 's grave .
In the US , it had attracted a degree of notoriety for its part in the bungled privatisation of California 's electricity , which led to black - outs earlier this year .
But it was in the developing world that Enron had a near unparalleled reputation for corporate irresponsibility .
It has been the only company to warrant an entire Amnesty International report , a chilling catalogue of human rights abuses from India to Latin America .
The anti - corporate movement accused Enron of subverting the political process of virtually every country in which it operated to advance its interests .
Enron was in the thick of one of India 's biggest corruption scandals in which huge sums were paid to politicians in the privatisation of electricity firms .
Such deals abroad relied on close co - operation from friends back home in Washington , and once again Enron lavishly paid into election campaign funds , most notably of George W Bush .
Key political figures were signed up as lobbyists and advisers .
All the political manoeuvring served the company 's ideological vision of the primacy of free markets , deregulation and privatisation .
Enron was described as an "" evangelical cult "" for the fervent advocacy of this vision by Enron founder and chairman , Kenneth Lay - a vision from which he personally profited by millions .
The fact that the finance director is also now being investigated for possible irregularities suggests a culture of hubris and greed at the company 's core .
For the anti - corporate movement , Enron is a major scalp ( though exposure of its wrongdoings was not the cause of the collapse ) .
More importantly , it is a reproof to stock traders who continued to boost Enron 's shares long after they had lost their understanding of its balance sheet .
And it trounces for ever the idea that public utilities can be subject to light regulation amid such speculative profiteering ."
2001-11-30,"British companies yesterday began to count the cost of the Enron debacle as administrators moved in to the US group 's European headquarters in London to begin the task of salvaging subsidiary operations on this side of the Atlantic .
The US - based group , whose UK interests include Wessex Water and one of largest traders on the London Metal Exchange , employs around 4,000 people in Britain and a further 5,000 in mainland Europe .
Enron had nearly 20 % of the British energy trading market and a number of UK companies may face losses because of contracts with the US group .
Centrica , the British gas group , said its exposure to Enron totalled around £ 30 m .
PricewaterhouseCoopers , appointed administrators to the European holding company and a number of operating companies , yesterday following the US group 's downgrading , warned that job losses were inevitable .
Joint administrator Steven Pearson was unable to say where the axe might fall but said the administrators would be working through the night before speaking to the 2,000 employees affected by the administration order today .
Wessex Water , acquired by Enron three years ago and recently put up for sale , is sheltered from the parent company 's financial woes as a result of strict ring - fencing arrangements put in place at the time of the takeover .
But the company reassured customers and staff that services will not be affected .
With City analysts predicting that the parent company collapse could hasten the proposed sell - off Wessex insisted it would continue to operate independently whoever owns the business .
PwC said that Enron had built up "" an extraordinarily complex network "" of businesses that would take some time for the administrators to work through .
The group 's metals business has already attracted interest , while two Teesside power stations and the retail power supplier Enron Direct are unaffected by the collapse ."
2001-12-01,"Fallout from the collapse of the US energy trading company Enron resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 jobs within the group 's UK operations yesterday .
During a day of meetings at the company 's European headquarters in London , administrators from PricewaterhouseCoopers informed staff that 1,100 of the 1,400 staff there were to lose their jobs .
About 300 employees have been told they will be retained for the time being . ""
This is a complete tragedy .
These are all fine people and they are having to leave their friends , "" said one staff member .
The cutbacks came amid growing concern in financial markets about the knock - on effect on banks and other institutions which have exposure to the Houston - based concern .
Abbey National stunned the City yesterday by announcing it had a £ 115 m exposure to the company , which would require it to take a £ 95 m provision to cover possible losses .
Mark Pain , head of Abbey 's treasury business , said the exposure was to bonds issued by Enron which had been relatively safe investment grade until the company 's debt was reduced to junk status .
Others to admit being caught up in Enron 's troubles include National Australia Bank , owners of Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank , which has secured an unsecured exposure of about £ 140 m , and ABN Amro which says it may have to make a € 110 m ( £ 66 m ) provision .
Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are also thought to be affected but believed that market rumours that their exposure could run to £ 1bn and £ 850 m respectively were wide of the mark .
PwC were called in to run the group 's European holding company and a number of subsidiaries earlier this week after the downgrading of Enron 's debt to junk status .
The parent company is expected to file for protection from its creditors under the Chapter 11 procedure early next week , becoming the largest bankruptcy in American corporate history .
A number of the group 's UK operations - including Wessex Water and power supplier Enron Direct - are continuing to trade as normal but are expected to end up with new owners as a result of the parent company 's demise .
Rumours that Enron 's troubles could have led to black - outs in Britain were scotched yesterday by the National Grid and industry regulator Ofgem .
"" We always make sure there is spare capacity in the system and there is no truth in the suggestion this could have led to a blackout , "" a National Grid spokesman said yesterday .
The collapse of rescue merger talks with smaller rival Dynegy left Enron in crisis .
Earlier this week , the SEC subpoenaed a number of documents from the company 's auditors Arthur Andersen as it widened its examination of the events leading up to Enron 's failure .
On the New York stock exchange yesterday Enron shares continued their fall , dropping another 25 % to less than 30 cents ."
2001-12-01,"Corporate contagion is spreading fast .
As banks and energy companies lined up yesterday to confess their varying exposure to the Enron debacle , the main interest lay with all those who were not known to be creditors in the first place .
Common sense said Abbey National , with exposure of £ 115 m , had to be there , although the mortgage bank had previously failed to make it on to the hit lists of those monitoring this corporate implosion .
In fact , the size of the wholesale banking division at Abbey , with £ 108bn of assets , means it probably has a piece of every sizeable corporate bond issue over recent years .
In Europe , it was ING bank of the Netherlands which raised eyebrows yesterday .
Its local rival , ABN Amro , is up to its neck in Enron paper -
but then everyone already knew that .
ING 's $ 200 m ( £ 141 m ) exposure came out of the blue .
Just toting up the declared exposures yesterday - roughly $ 3bn - suggests we are possibly less than 20 % into this process .
The shocks over the coming days could be very nasty indeed .
Meanwhile , other potential corporate failures are creating unexpected collateral damage .
ICI has been hit because Huntsman , the private American chemical concern to which ICI sold a good chunk of its bulk chemicals business , is running out of cash while it still owes the British firm about £ 300 m .
Again , no one saw this coming .
Huntsman was founded by a philanthropist , Jon Huntsman , who used to donate a huge portion of profits to charity .
Maybe the company will get its just rewards in corporate heaven .
Skin care The noose is tightening around Bioglan , the debt - laden skincare company which has gone from hero to zero in less time than it takes to squeeze a blackhead .
Creditors led by Royal Bank of Scotland had already given the firm two month - long extensions to £ 110 m of breached banking covenants .
Hours before yesterday 's midnight deadline , Bioglan was given just one more week .

In many respects , the affair is a small - scale version of the Enron crash . ""
Aggressive accounting "" has played a big part in both .
With hindsight , there was a glaring lack of financial expertise on the board - none of the executives had an accountancy qualification , and for a long period there was no finance director .
Annual results tended to be opaque , with lumpy licensing deals disguising a pallid performance by the firm 's drugs .
Auditor KPMG has declined to endorse the firm 's most recent accounts .

Investors will be keen to identify those responsible .
They should start with Bioglan 's underwhelming non - executives , who seem to have taken a relaxed attitude towards supervision .

The message from Wall Street is that the US economy has leapt across to the other side of the V - shaped downturn that began a year ago .
Forget the fact that yesterday saw the growth figure for the third quarter revised down from minus 0.4 % to minus 1.1 % .
Forget that the world 's biggest energy company has just gone belly up .
Forget that consumer confidence is cracking under job losses .
The mood in the markets is that September 11 provided corporate America with the short , sharp shock it needed to repair its balance sheets , aided and abetted by big cuts in interest rates .
But the breakdown of yesterday 's GDP data is even more worrying than the headline contraction in the economy .
In the end , stock markets are all about profits .
The bottom line for Wall Street is the bottom line .
And profits in the US were 4.1 % of GDP in the third quarter - lower than at any time since the early 80s recession .
The truth the dealers are finding so hard to swallow is that the US economy is still suffering from overinvestment in hi - tech .
Belief in the productivity miracle was so strong that firms went on a hiring spree underwritten by the boom in equity prices , leading to real annual wage growth of 4 % .
Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research thinks there may be a short - term suckers rally based on lower interest rates , cheaper energy and a couple of quarters in which stocks are rebuilt .
But sooner rather than later , it will be obvious to the most stubborn bull that the sums do not add up ."
2001-12-01,"I 've always subscribed to the KISS principle of investing - Keep It Simple , Stupid .
Not because I ca n't see the benefits offered by , say , derivative instruments , but because I recognise that , up against the collective intellect of the market , I am indeed stupid .
The spectacular collapse of Enron at least reassures me that I am not alone .
A derivative need not be a complex financial instrument .
It need not be a dangerous one .
But in the hands of criminals and cretins it is often both .
Whether Enron 's management were one or the other - or both - will doubtless become clear over the years that it will take for litigation to work through its course .
What is certain is that derivative contracts formed a Gordian knot at the financial heart of a company that was once America 's seventh largest and is now its biggest bust .
Those who have chuckled at the regulators ' apparent obsession with the threat posed by the phenomenal growth in the use of derivatives should recollect their jibes and blush .
Not that regulation comes out of this affair with any credit .
Derivatives are nothing new .
As the old textbook I used when first grappling with the concept of traded options tells us , 16th century merchants could buy and sell options on commodities while the ships carrying them were still at sea .
Then , as now , the risk lover could bet aggressively on future price moves , the risk averse could hedge against possible price volatility .
I doubt whether , 400 years ago , merchants calculated an option price after consideration of its delta , gamma , theta , or rho , but the underlying principles are timeless .
To bottom the risks involved in entering into an option or futures contract , one must model the dynamics of the relationship between the price of the contract and the underlying asset upon which it is based .
Much of the trade in plain vanilla derivatives based upon the most popular underlying assets - such as the big currencies , government bonds and equity indices - takes place through derivatives exchanges .
In providing a standardised framework for contracts , exchanges are able to create a trading environment that encourages liquidity and hence fine pricing .
This "" on market "" trading of derivatives allows regulators to sleep easy at nights .
Foolish investors always need protecting from themselves - hence the more onerous requirements placed on private investors before they buy and sell derivatives than ordinary shares - but at least the regulatory audit trail through recognised exchanges is straightforward .
By contrast , "" off market "" derivative transactions - in effect , non - standard direct contracts between bilateral parties - are the cause of much regulatory insomnia .
Over the past decade or so , the volume of such transactions , across a wide swath of asset classes and instruments , has been extraordinary .
As with all markets in goods and services , this growth reflects an increase in both willing buyers and sellers .
The end buyers are often "" real "" businesses seeking to smooth their risk and revenue streams .
The sellers are typically financial institutions , and particularly investment banks , eager to exploit higher margin opportunities to deploy their capital .
Industrial buyers of derivatives have risk management requirements specific to their own businesses .
Hence the bespoke structuring of "" off market "" contracts .
The investment bank facilitating the transaction will typically assume some of the countervailing risk in the trade itself , and will lay the rest off with other investors .
It will seek to build its own "" book "" of contracts whose risks offset rather than compound each other .
Stark reminder In this world of meaty , bilateral transactions , an assessment of counterparty risk is critical .
The major derivative exchanges typically have some system of guarantees to protect the integrity of trade .
But "" off market "" , you 're on your own .
It would certainly be foolhardy to rely on the authorities to concoct behind the scenes support should a counterparty collapse .
Although they have been known to do so - remember Barings and LTCM .
Enron 's implosion constitutes a stark reminder of counterparty risk .
The world 's largest energy trader stood on the other side of vast numbers of derivative contracts .
In many , many cases , the only guarantee behind the contract will have been Enron 's own name and balance sheet .
These are now revealed to be worth nothing .
It is at times of greatest stress in the financial system that derivatives - related disasters are most likely to occur .
This is partly because it is then that asset prices tend to move outside the "" normal "" ranges factored into the original derivatives price setting process .
It is also because at extremes liquidity tends to dry up .
Just when you need a buyer to close down a trade , everyone is a seller , or vice versa .
The seeds of Enron 's downfall were sown over many years as it pursued its aggressive growth plans .
It is surely no coincidence , though , that its collapse coincides with the sudden , juddering halt to the global economy .
Its legacy - at least while memories last - will be a higher price for risk .
And maybe a few New Year resolutions to keep it simpler .

2001-12-02,"The Enron horror story worsened this weekend after it emerged that the US energy company believes its accounts may have to be revised down even further .
This makes it almost certain Texas - based Enron will have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this week .
The company 's accountants , Andersen , is already being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for its part in failing to spot how three separate Enron subsidiaries were kept off the company 's books .
But Enron , in previously unpublicised documents , has warned the SEC about further financial black holes ahead : ' It is possible [ our ] investigation will identify additional or different information concerning these matters which will require additional or different restatements . '
Enron has conceded that because the three companies - one linked to Enron 's former Chief Financial Officer , Andrew S Fastow who was sacked earlier this year - were not included in its accounts , previous financial figures ' did not meet accounting requirements ' .
The failure forced Enron to take a $ 1 billion charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1.2bn , a move which precipitated the company 's rapid decline : it is expected to end in the biggest bankruptcy filing in US history .
The SEC is investigating Enron and the role played by Andersen , which earned $ 1 million a week working for the Houston company .
Andersen is reported to be braced for a string of lawsuits from disgruntled investors .
In a bid to understand its dramatic demise , Enron recently launched its own investigations by establishing a special committee of independent directors whose role is to conduct an internal audit and liaise with the SEC .
Because of the uncertainty about what the committee will find , Enron will not amend its accounts for 1997 to 2000 until it reports its findings .
This could take many months , making it difficult to calculate the company 's liabilities , a move which will concern Enron 's bondholders , attempting to salvage some value from the wreckage .
Experts say the collapse of the company - which despite its roots in energy production was really a finance house engaged in complicated deriv ative - based transactions - is most likely the result of fraud . '
It looks like some rogue trading brought it down .
It 's another Nick Leeson , ' said one .
Enron was once one of the most admired companies in the US , with very close links to the Bush administration .
Its shares may be worthless following the failure of a last - ditch attempt to agree a takeover with its smaller rival Dynegy .
Talks broke down between the two firms when Dynegy pulled the plug on the deal after studying Enron 's books .
The fact that it walked away suggests Enron 's problems are worse than was previously thought .
Enron 's European subsidiary has already filed for bankruptcy .
More than 1,000 energy traders working for the company in London have lost their jobs , with thousands more redundancies expected across Europe in the coming weeks ."
2001-12-02,"In many ways , the spectacular collapse of Enron can be seen as a further bursting of the internet bubble .
The similarities run deeper than the online system Enron uses for trading : the business of trading in energy was cultivated upon a speculative model of business similar to those that flourished during the years of the now disgraced New Economy .
Before the Houston - based giant collapsed last week after its smaller rival Dynegy pulled out of a merger deal that might have saved it , few could have predicted just how far or fast the company could fall .
Enron 's failure is what one analyst termed last week ' the perfect financial storm ' .
Only a few months ago it was the world 's largest energy trader , setting the market in gas and electricity prices .
It is now a ghost , its share prices crashed down from a high of $ 90 to just 0.36 cents .
On Thursday , the company 's vast trading floor in Houston recorded just over 850 transactions - a fraction of the millions that once flowed through it .
It was not always thus .
In early 2000 , the then CEO Jeffrey Skilling was the Sun King at a conference for traders , bankers and Wall Street analysts .
He wowed the crowd with talk of Enron 's online capabilities , especially its market - making business of electronically matching buyers and sellers of commodities from gas and electricity to network bandwidth .
Over the following months Enron 's shares jumped 50 per cent to $ 90 .
This was the e - commerce future - the promise of limitless , internet - driven growth .
To even question the business was itself an act of heresy .
Skilling was known to swear at analysts for asking pointed questions .
But the company operated as a mirage , reporting huge profits while generating relatively little cash and holding few assets .
It specialised in risk - swapping contracts that enable companies to hedge their exposure to changing energy prices and supply fluctuations .
Enron was able to capitalise on the newly deregulated US market in electricity and natural gas , making much of its profit buying and selling energy many times over , capturing the difference between buyers ' bids and sellers ' offers .
But unlike traditional commodities exchanges , gas and electricity are traded privately , with many transactions involving just two players .
By last year , Enron was in the middle of about one quarter of the electricity and natural - gas deals done by energy producers , traders and utilities .
Throughout the late nineties , Enron enjoyed ever - higher earnings .
Fortune magazine called it the most innovative company in America and ranked it number seven on the Fortune 500 .
For a time Enron 's revenue of $ 100bn eclipsed IBM and AT&amp;T.
But the company also borrowed heavily .
Employing unusual accounting methods , it recorded debts on separate operations off Enron 's balance sheets , obscuring liabilities .
It used the money to invest in new markets , buying utilities as far afield as India , Bolivia and China , and began trading in everything from commodities to exotic financial businesses , such as ' weather derivatives ' .
The same creative financial structure and accounting methods that bought apparent success ultimately contributed to its collapse .
Last week , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it was looking to apply tough new rules to the semi - regulated wholesale energy markets . '
If you do n't have the Ten Commandments , it 's hard to find a sinner , ' noted the Commission 's Nora Brownell .
On Thursday , a congressional commerce committee began an investigation into the company 's use of pension funds for stock purchases . '
It
[ Enron ] apparently lied for years in its financial statements , ' charged Republican John Dingell of Michigan .
One focus of a parallel SEC investigation will be the failure of Enron 's auditor , Arthur Andersen .
The regulator has already subpoenaed records from the accounting firm to determine why it failed to report problems in Enron 's financial structure .
Last month , Enron disavowed its financial statements going back to 1997 , triggering its $ 75bn collapse in market capitalisation .
Andersen will also face questions about whether it was unduly influenced by the unusually large fees Enron paid .
In 2000 alone , the company paid Andersen $ 52 million , including $ 27 m for consulting services .
But not all of Enron 's accounting problems are complex .
Andersen , for instance , failed to alert investors that Enron had boosted its shareholder equity by $ 1.2bn by swapping shares of its own stock for a note receivable from a limited partnership tied to one of its former directors .
Investigators will also want to probe Wall Street 's now - familiar loss of objectivity .
The investment banks that backed Enron made far more from underwriting merger deals than they did from brokerage fees and thus had an interest in treading lightly around Enron 's financial structure .
JP Morgan Chase alone had $ 900 m invested , Citigroup $ 500 m .
But the long - term effects of Enron 's collapse are still hard to gauge .
The sheer complexity of its business dealings are going to take months to unravel .
It is not even clear how much the company owes .
Bankers estimated that liabilities could total more than $ 40bn .
That sum includes $ 13bn of direct debt ( $ 4 billion to banks and $ 9bn to bondholders ) and a further $ 27bn in off - balance - sheet transactions .
Since many of Enron 's assets , such as its natural gas transmission pipelines , already act as collateral against sizeable loans , individual and corporate bond holders are unlikely to see their investments recouped .
But many Enron executives are set to walk away with big pay - offs : Kenneth Lay , the chairman , collected $ 132 m last year in bonuses and options and is set to receive a lifetime $ 500,000 per annum pension protected from any bankruptcy ; last year , Skilling cashed in $ 62 m worth of stock and options .
Corporate watchdogs , already crying foul over widespread ethical violations in Enron 's boardroom , have Lay and Arthur Andersen in their sights for deals in which seven directors were given lucrative consulting contracts .
In contrast , thousands of Enron employees have had their retirement nest - eggs ravaged .
They have filed lawsuits alleging that Enron misled them , inducing them to buy stock that company executives knew was overvalued .
There is something mysterious even about the way in which Enron unraveled .
In August , Skilling abruptly resigned , citing personal reasons .
But it was not until October that revelations began surfacing about its dealings with partnerships run by Enron officials .
Then Enron was forced to restate earnings , admitting that it had over - reported profit by more than $ 580 m since 1997 .
But there may still be beneficiaries from the debacle .
Dynegy used $ 1.5bn of funding provided by its part - owner , ChevronTexaco Corporation , to help provide liquidity to Enron .
Dynegy says it plans to claim the collateral on that investment - all of it stock in an Enron subsidiary , Northern Natural Gas , which owns 16,500 miles of natural - gas pipelines between Texas and the Great Lakes .
That in turn could give ChevronTexaco ownership of the highly valuable pipeline .
In California , where officials blamed Enron for the state 's energy crisis two years ago , many regard Enron 's rapid downfall as long overdue and may hasten the state 's ill - conceived experiment in energy deregulation . '
Enron was the flagship for deregulation , ' said Carl Wood , a member of California 's energy commission .
Enron , he said , proved to be ' all hat and no cattle - that 's their Texas expression , and it applies here ' ."
2001-12-02,"A year ago this month Kenneth Lay , chairman and chief executive of energy giant Enron , was about to see his longtime buddy George W Bush become the most powerful man in the world .
Now , as the oil and gas trader crumbles under a financial mountain , there is little Dubya can do to help .
Indeed the White House seems disinclined to mount any kind of ' rescue ' for Enron .
Few companies or individuals have courted the US political establishment - both Republican and Democrat - as assiduously as Enron and Lay .
Using the legitimate channels that fill party and presidential coffers , the company dished out $ 2.4 million in the bitterly fought presidential campaign last year .
Records kept by the Washington - based Centre for Responsive Politics show that although Enron hedged its bets , its largesse heavily favoured the Republicans .
Donations through Enron 's ' Political Action Committee ' saw Democrat congressional candidates receive $ 87,089 in the year before the presidential elections , while Republicans got $ 188,104 .
Enron also gave $ 4,850 towards Bush 's expenses - the limit is $ 5,000 .
Gore got nothing .
But these figures are the tip of the iceberg .
Individual donations from Enron employees saw the total from the company going to the Bush campaign rise to nearly $ 114,000 .
Lay and his wife have donated a total of $ 793,110 to the Republicans since 1989 . '
Soft money ' donations , which are not targeted at individual congressmen or presidential candidates , swell the total .
Of $ 1,671,555 of soft money donations from Enron , the Republicans received $ 1,138,990 ; the Democrats $ 532,565 .
It seemed that Lay 's efforts had been well rewarded .
Lay was invited to Bush 's glittering inaugural gala - to which the company donated some $ 100,000 .
He was appointed as an adviser on Bush 's ' transitional ' energy team , the group of experts who give advice to the President as he moves into office .
He has remained an important adviser .
Enron 's donations were carefully targeted at influential congressmen .
Texans , unsurprisingly , are well - funded .
Among them is the senior Republican Senator Phil Gramm , who received $ 3,000 in the year leading up to the 2000 election .
His wife Wendy sits on the Enron board .
Republican Dick Armey , the majority leader in the House of Representatives , and Tom DeLay , a highly influential figure there ( both are again from Texas ) received $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 .
DeLay has had nearly $ 29,000 from Enron since 1989 .
Texas Republican representative Joe Barton has had $ 28,909 .
Why ?
Because Barton is head of the House Commerce Energy and Power Sub - Committee , which scrutinises energy legislation .
Barton , like Enron , was keen for states to deregulate as they saw fit without Federal intervention .
Botched electricity deregulation caused the California blackouts earlier this year .
Now Enron , despite all its giving , seems to be heading for a blackout of its own ."
2001-12-03,"Barclays today said that the bankruptcy of Enron , the US energy company , would not have a "" material "" effect on its business .
Barclays had been mentioned as one of several high street banks with exposure to the US energy group , which filed for bankruptcy in the US last night .
In stating that losses will not be material , Barclays indicated that they would be under £ 50 m .
Barclays said it was keeping its provision against bad debts this year at £ 1.1bn as it reported continued strong growth in the third quarter .
A Barclays official added : "" Enron is not mentioned in the trading statement and while we can not comment on individual cases I think that tells its own story . ""
Although Barclays ' investment banking arm , Barclays Capital , has been one of the biggest arrangers of debt for Enron - raising around $ 4bn ( £ 2.8bn ) over the past two years - most of this is thought to have been syndicated out to other investors .
On Friday , Abbey National said it had £ 115 m in Enron and would take a £ 95 m hit in the second half of its financial year .
In one of the largest corporate bankruptcies in US history , Enron last night filed for bankruptcy protection and sued its rival , Dynegy , for $ 10bn for pulling out of a last ditch rescue merger .
Enron 's bankruptcy filing became inevitable after its credit rating collapsed and Dynegy pulled out of its merger deal last week .
Enron listed $ 24.7bn in assets - $ 38bn less than it had two months ago - and $ 13.1bn in liabilities , according to the filing yesterday .
Under chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code , a company is sheltered from creditors ' lawsuits while it reorganises its finances .
The debtor usually retains control of the business and its assets .
In the lawsuit against Dynegy , Enron asserted that its fellow Houston company breached a merger agreement by backing out of its November 9 deal to buy Enron .
Dynegy chairman and chief executive , Chuck Watson , called the lawsuit "" frivolous and disingenuous . ""
He said it was an example of Enron refusing to take responsibility for its decline . ""
The reality is , Enron invited Dynegy to participate in merger negotiations .
Dynegy entered those negotiations in good faith and provided $ 1.5bn in cash to Enron .
Despite assurances that Enron 's liquidity situation had stabilised , the cash was gone in less than three weeks , and Enron has had difficulty providing an accounting as to where it went , "" Mr Watson said .
Meanwhile , Enron said that an unspecified number of workers , mostly among the 7,500 in Houston , would be laid off .
Several energy companies have stopped making trades with Enron for fear they will not be paid .
Some have revealed they have multimillion - dollar exposures to Enron .
Shares of Enron had plunged to 26 cents Friday on the New York stock exchange , in sharp contrast to a year ago , when they stood at $ 85 .
Enron unravelled remarkably quickly last month , when it disclosed that its former chief financial officer was running partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books .
In early November , Enron restated its profits back to 1997 , shaving off more than $ 580 m in reported income .
Congressional leaders are calling for hearings into the Enron fallout , while the securities and exchange commission is investigating Enron 's finances .
Both investors and employees have filed several lawsuits ."
2001-12-04,"Companies face total losses of about $ 4.8bn from exposure to Enron .
Some of the biggest victims JP Morgan Chase : $ 500 m ( £ 351.4 m )
John Hancock Financial Services : $ 320 m
Aegon : around $ 300 m
ING : $ 195 m Barclays Bank : £ 88.5 m Abbey National : £ 115 m Chase Manhattan : $ 113 m UBS : $ 74.3 m Credit Suisse First Boston : $ 70.7 m Royal Bank of Scotland : about £ 600 m , according to unconfirmed reports ."
2001-12-04,"Electricité de France today expressed an interest in buying Enron Direct , the European retail arm of Enron , the failed US energy giant .
"" We are talking with PricewaterhouseCoopers to buy Enron Direct , "" Gérard Wolf , an EdF director said .
Enron Direct sells gas and electricity to small and medium - sized businesses mainly in Britain , where it has 150,000 customers .
"" Enron Direct would fit well with our London Electricity business , "" Mr Wolf said , but he declined to comment on whether EdF was interested in acquiring Enron 's interest in Teesside 's gas - fired power station .
EdF has said that it is looking for more power stations in the UK .
With Enron filing for bankruptcy protection , companies are circling to pick off the company 's best assets .
In the Philippines , the state - owned generator National Power company , is looking at buying Enron 's two power plant contracts in the country .
As for Enron Direct , apart from EdF , other companies said to be interested in include Britain 's Centrica and Innogy groups and US - owned TXU Europe and Germany 's RWE .
Unlike Enron 's trading activities in the US , Enron Direct is not legally under administration but PricewaterhouseCoopers is supervising the sale of the retail business as part of its efforts to wind up Enron Europe .
Enron Europe went into administration on November 29 , three days before its US parent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the biggest corporate failure in American history .
Enron , once America 's seventh largest company , yesterday gained some breathing space when it secured an $ 1.5bn emergency round of financing .
Arranged by Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase , the money will be syndicated and is secured by substantially all of the company 's assets .
Enron needs money to ensure delivery of commodities it had already paid for and to avoid eviction from its new 200,000 sq ft Houston trading floor ."
2001-12-05,"Centrica , the gas and electricity supplier , has beaten off competition from the French state - owned power utility , Electricité de France , and the Npower firm Innogy to snap up Enron Direct - the British retail arm of the collapsed US energy trading company .
As bargain hunters circled the global wreckage of the Enron empire yesterday , Centrica , which trades as British Gas , said it was paying £ 96.4 m in cash for a business that supplies energy to 160,000 small and medium sized businesses across the UK .
The company has grown rapidly since starting to trade in 1996 .
In the first 10 months of this year it generated turnover of £ 190 m - almost double the £ 97 m recorded during the whole of last year .
Its customers for the most part are on five year contracts .
Mike Alexander , managing director of British Gas Trading , said the acquisition provided "" an ideal platform "" for advancing the group 's plans for the commercial market . ""
These longer term contract customers represent an attractive additional market segment for Centrica with higher than average usage and annual bills of approximately £ 1,300 , more than five times the average domestic bill .
"" Centrica clinched the deal less than a week after PricewaterhouseCoopers were brought in as administrators of Enron 's European operations .
EDF , which owns London Electricity and Sweb , and Innogy , which is vying with Centrica for dominance of the UK market , confirmed they had also held talks on acquiring the business .
The administrators , who last week announced 1,100 redundancies at Enron 's European headquarters in London , are also believed to be close to clinching the sale of Enron 's european metals business .
The Houston group 's European arm was placed in administration following the humiliating downgrade of Enron 's debt to junk status and the collapse of a rescue takeover bid from the smaller energy group Dynergy .
On Sunday the parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors prompting a frenzy of interest from companies keen to benefit from any fire sale of assets - likely to include power stations in Italy , Spain and Poland .
Enron 's collapse is expected to hasten the sale of its ring fenced Wessex Water business with an acquisition by financial institutions seen as the most likely outcome .
Severn Trent and United Utilities are both known to be keeping a close eye on the situation in the hope of picking up contracts to manage Wessex assets following a sell off .
Elsewhere , the Royal Dutch Shell oil company said it was keen to acquire a liquefied natural gas terminal from an Enron offshoot in India ."
2001-12-07,"Enron , the American energy company which collapsed at the weekend , has quietly paid bonuses totalling $ 55 m ( £ 38 m ) to 500 staff members in an attempt to keep trading while it is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
The payments , averaging $ 110,000 apiece , have caused outrage among both the 5,000 workers already laid off by Enron and its creditors , who are chasing debts of more than $ 30bn .
Those who have already lost their jobs received payments of just $ 4,500 each , while members of the Enron pension fund have seen their savings slump since much of the fund was invested in Enron shares .
The handling of the pension fund , where some members have seen 70 % of their retirement assets disappear , is now being investigated by the US labour department .
Separately , investigators from the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee in Washington were planning to visit Enron 's headquarters in Houston , Texas , yesterday to quiz executives .
Billy Tauzin , the Republican chairman of the committee , said hearings would begin next month and would extend beyond Enron to issues such as financial regulation and the role of auditors .
Earlier this week the big five accounting firms , including Enron 's auditor Andersen , put out a joint statement promising a full review of their own procedures in the wake of the Enron collapse .
With financial backing from creditor banks such as JP Morgan , Enron hopes to reconstitute itself as a slimmed - down commodity trading company .
However , speculation is growing that a number of big insurance companies may be facing substantial losses due to their heavy involvement with so - called credit derivatives .
These informally traded instruments allow banks to insure the risk that a creditor may default and in the case of Enron many of its creditors are believed to have offset their liabilities by using credit derivatives .
Swiss bank UBS , for example , has said it insured its entire $ 74 m exposure to the energy company in this way ."
2001-12-08,"Off - the - peg office group Regus continued its fight back yesterday as fears subsided that the collapse of Enron , the US utilities corporation could cost the company a substantial sum .
Enron 's European arm , which called in PricewaterhouseCoopers as administrators last week , uses Regus offices in seven countries .
The Enron contract is worth many thousands of pounds , but Regus is understood to be fully covered for any loss of business .
Shares in Regus fell over the summer after the company warned that it would not make a profit this year .
Since then Regus has clamped down on costs , axing a quarter of its workforce , and concentrated on retaining its tenants .
Further support is expected next week as Regus announces a clutch of new contracts in the UK believed to be worth several million pounds .
Regus closed up 5p at 57p ."
2001-12-09,"Former gas regulator Clare Spottiswoode resigned as a vice - president of Enron 's water subsidiary because she had grave concerns about its financial management , she told The Observer .
In remarks that throw further light on the disastrous fall of the Texan energy giant , Spottiswoode said she quit as senior vice president of regulatory affairs in Europe for Azurix , Enron 's global water business , after four months because of her worries .
Azurix has a controlling stake in Wessex Water , the south of England utility , which it wants to sell following the collapse of its parent company in Houston .
Spottiswoode said she was worried about the high price investors paid at the flotation , or initial public offering ( IPO ) , of Azurix in 1999 and about the Texas - based management , led by Rebecca Mark , paying too much for overseas assets . '
I had serious concerns about the way it was being run , ' said Spottiswoode . '
The IPO was a way of offloading the Azurix investment onto other banks . '
The price of the IPO was very high , and I could not see how , even if the investments were good , it could work .
It was practically bound to fail . '
It was also clear that Azurix in Houston was over - paying [ for international water businesses ] and that the returns to investors were never going to match them . '
The acquisitions repre sented a ' failure of due diligence ' , she said .
Azurix shares were floated at $ 19 in June 1999 .
Enron took Azurix back into private ownership in October 2000 for $ 7 a share .
Spottiswoode said she did not realise then the extent of the mismanage - ment .
She believes the company 's lawyers and accountants matched the letter of the law in recommending that it shift assets off its balance sheet , which led to its demise .
But the change was wrong , she said ."
2001-12-12,"JP Morgan Chase , one of Enron biggest creditors , yesterday sued the energy trader for more than $ 2.1bn ( £ 1.5bn ) .
The bank claimed in a suit filed in the US bankruptcy court in New York on behalf of itself and related parties that it has rights to Enron assets such as accounts receivable , commercial paper , cash and other property , which allegedly are not protected in Enron 's bankruptcy proceedings .
Enron ran into trouble after it restated results and disclosed a series of questionable financial transactions .
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said he had not seen the suit yet so could not comment .
Enron holds the assets in dispute only as a servicer for the alleged owners , under two accounts receivables deals , the suit claims .
The assets are not property of Enron because they were sold before Enron 's December 2 bankruptcy filing .
JP Morgan acted as an agent in two credit facilities , whose proceeds helped fund two accounts receivables transactions between Enron and Sequoia Financial Assets , a special purpose , bankruptcy - related entity , the suit said .
Sequoia allegedly bought the receivables from Enron and reinvested the money collected on the bills in short - term paper issued by Enron and its Enron North America unit .

2001-12-13,"Enron hopes to raise $ 6bn ( £ 4bn ) from sales of assets including its Azurix water subsidiary and businesses in developing markets as part of a wider plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within a year .
The strategy was outlined by the chief financial officer , Jeff McMahon , at a meeting of creditors and came as its accountants , Andersen , told congressional hearings it had warned the Houston - based energy trader about possible illegal acts .

2002-01-10,"Enron executives face the possibility of prosecution after the US justice department launched a criminal investigation into the financial collapse of the energy giant .
In an unusual move , the justice department has created a task force to look at Enron , once the world 's largest energy trading company .
Legal experts said the decision to create such a body to look at single company was rare . ""
This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent , and while it does n't guarantee an indictment , it certainly raises the stakes , "" John Coffee , a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case , told the New York Times . ""
Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate .
"" Enron 's attorneys put a brave face on the move , saying it would simplify life for the company , which is under multiple investigations .
"" I 'm pleased that there now appears to be some centralisation and coordination , because it is very difficult and expensive to deal with half a dozen different entities , "" said Robert Bennett , a lawyer representing the company .
"" When this investigation is finished , a lot of the things that people are reading and hearing will be proven to be not true . ""
The Houston - based company once formed part of America 's corporate elite , ranked seventh on the Fortune 500 list of companies .
A major contributor to the election campaign of the US president , George Bush , as well as many other lawmakers in Washington , Enron also advised the Bush administration on energy policy .
Enron 's world collapsed last December when it filed for bankruptcy , after a failed takeover bid by rival Dynergy .
Enron dug a financial hole for itself by creating complex financial partnerships that were used to keep large debts off the company 's books .
The company was forced to set aside $ 1bn to cover losses when some of the deals involving the partnerships came unstuck and it cut shareholder equity by $ 1.2bn .
The moves undermined investor confidence , led to a collapse in share prices and eventually to the bankruptcy courts .
Thousands of Enron employees , including traders in Europe , lost their jobs , while top executives allegedly pocketed large profits by selling ahead of Enron 's collapse .
The White House has stressed the importance of getting to the bottom of the Enron collapse and developing new policies to protect workers and pensioners .
"" It 's important for the investigation to proceed to determine what was done and why it was done .
The president also believes it 's important to explore new policies so it [ a similar collapse ] can never happen again , "" said Air Fleischer , the White House spokesman .
But some past efforts by the justice department to take a lead role in a criminal investigation of politically well - connected companies have raised concerns over conflict of interest .
The head of Congress ' investigative arm yesterday said he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met last year while drafting its new energy policy ."
2002-01-11,"President Bush moved rapidly yesterday to distance himself from the collapsed Enron Corporation as speculation grew that the bankruptcy of the giant energy trading company could turn into his administration 's most dangerous scandal .
Hours after the justice department announced it was setting up a nationwide team of prosecutors as part of a criminal inquiry into Enron , the White House ordered a review of rules affecting pension rights and corporate disclosure .
Mr Bush told reporters he had not seen Enron 's chairman , Kenneth Lay , since last spring and had never discussed the company 's financial problems with him .
However , it emerged last night that Mr Lay had contacted the US treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , in late October to propose a bail - out for Enron , which suggested the White House had been aware of the company 's problems before they were made public .
Enron , the seventh ranked company on the Fortune 500 , collapsed last month , the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history .
About 6,000 workers were laid off , many also losing their pensions because they subscribed to a retirement plan based on Enron shares , which dropped from $ 90 ( £ 62 ) to pennies in a year .
The list of creditors runs to 54 pages but senior executives were able to sell their stock before the price plummeted .
Enron accountants Arthur Andersen , already under the microscope , admitted last night that a "" significant but undetermined number "" of documents relating to its audit of the energy company had been destroyed .
It said employees working with Enron had disposed of papers , emails and other correspondence , although it is unclear when they were destroyed .
Investigators have issued subpoenas to obtain files from Enron and Andersen and described the development as "" very serious "" .
Enron is believed to be the largest donor to Mr Bush 's campaign funds over the course of his career , and Mr Lay is an old Texas friend of the president .
He was named as one of the president 's energy advisers last year .
The links between the administration and the company operate on many levels .
Marc Racicot , Enron 's Washington lobbyist , was named last week as chairman of the Republican national committee .
The president 's chief economic adviser , Lawrence Lindsay , and the trade negotiator Robert Zoellick were advisers to the company .
Vice - president Dick Cheney is known to have met Mr Lay in April to discuss energy policy and staff from Mr Cheney 's energy taskforce met Enron executives at least six times .
The administration insists the meetings covered only policy matters .
The White House spokesman , Ari Fleischer , was peppered with questions yesterday about whether Mr Bush and Mr Cheney were aware of the situation and if not , why not .
""
Conversation is routine be tween people in this country and government , "" he said at the daily briefing .
"" There 's a difference between corporate contact and wrongdoing . ""
A justice department investigation on this scale into a single entity is thought to be unprecedented .
Officials would not say whether the attorney general , John Ashcroft , was involved in the decision , though , Mr Ashcroft , himself a recipient of Enron political largesse , said last night he would not have any future involvement in the case .
Congressional Democrats , conscious of the efforts poured into the largely abortive investigation of Bill Clinton 's property dealings at Whitewater , are beginning to crank up their own investigations .
"" Enron makes Whitewater look like peanuts , "" the syndicated columnist Bill Press said ."
2002-01-11,"One man is ideally placed to give President George Bush advice as sleuths circle the White House asking awkward questions on the collapse of Enron , the energy giant .
That man is Bill Clinton , who was hounded by special prosecutors and congressional investigators over an obscure property deal when he was governor of Arkansas , that subsequently became known as the Whitewater affair .
It 's not hard to imagine the advice that Mr Clinton would give Mr Bush - get it all out in the open as quickly as possible or face the corrosive drip - drip effect of a protracted scandal .
Even Republican officials are wondering why the White House is playing coy . ""
By not getting it all out , it makes it look like they 're covering something up , "" said one congressional Republican .
Enron , once the seventh largest company in America , is now embroiled in the largest US bankruptcy ever .
It filed for bankruptcy on December 2 after a crisis in investor confidence that triggered a share collapse .
The case has raised a host of troubling questions from the way the company used partnerships to move huge debts off its balance sheet to its connections to the Bush administration .
One red flag has already been raised with the admission from Andersen , the company that audited Enron , that in recent months , a "" significant but undetermined number of documents "" connected with Enron had been destroyed by its employees .
After announcing a criminal inquiry into the Enron collapse by its justice department , the White House can take another crucial step to dispel impressions that it has anything to hide .
Mr Bush should order his vice - president , Dick Cheney , to start cooperating with investigators .
Inexcusably , the vice - president , who is known to have met Kenneth Lay , Enron 's chairman , in April to discuss energy policy , has refused to release records on the contacts between Enron and the White House energy taskforce while the administration was formulating energy legislation now before Congress .
As long as officials such as Mr Cheney are afforded the privilege to stonewall , the Bush administration will only reinforce public impressions that its favoured posture to big companies is on bended knee .
Enron was indeed a big contributor to the Bush campaign .
Mr Bush raised almost $ 114,000 ( £ 79,000 ) in donations from Enron , while company employees poured nearly $ 800,000 into his campaign between 1999 and 2001 .
Despite Enron 's generosity towards the White House , it would be a stretch to think that administration did the company any favours as Enron 's fortunes unravelled .
After all , the company was allowed to go under , in which case the administration would have nothing to hide .
The Democrats do not emerge pristine from the Enron story either .
Enron rose to prominence during the Clinton years as it successfully pushed its free market agenda for energy well before Mr Bush was elected to office .
If anything , the Enron debacle makes a clear case for campaign finance reform , a cause that was taken up by John McCain , who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Bush for the Republican nomination .
Until America seriously tries to minimise the influence of big money in politics , the public will harbour suspicions that companies like Enron can bend the political agenda to suit their purposes , even if they eventually come a cropper ."
2002-01-12,"The latest chapter in the story of the collapse of energy company Enron must make for uncomfortable reading for George Bush .
The story 's racier details - so far - include crucial documents being destroyed , a series of phone calls from a political donor to the White House begging for a bail out and Mr Bush 's top law official recusing himself from a criminal investigation after it emerged he accepted $ 57,000 in campaign contributions from Enron .
Washington scents a scandal and the carefully - phrased denials only lend credence to the accusation that influence has been bought by big business .
America 's largest bankruptcy has bared the Bush agenda - which emphasises the concerns of corporates .
Houston - based Enron specialised in trading electricity - and led the call to deregulate America 's electricity markets .
Mr Bush , whose campaigns have received more than $ 500,000 from Enron executives , was willing to listen .
Vice president Dick Cheney , when formulating the nation 's new energy policy , held six meetings with the company in just eight months .
Like a sprawling octopus in Washington , Enron 's tentacles suckered themselves on to the new administration .
Both Mr Bush 's economic adviser and his trade representative had been employed as consultants by Enron .
Then there was the disturbing dismissal of regulator Curtis Hébert , who was told by Enron 's boss Kenneth Lay to change his views on electricity deregulation - or the company would not continue to support him .
Politically impervious since September 11 , Mr Bush should be concerned by the latest disclosures .
Enron 's employees had more than half their pension fund assets invested in the company 's shares , which are now worthless .
The implications of being too close to executives who pocketed $ 1bn from selling Enron stock before the company collapsed , while thousands of workers were barred from selling , could be politically disastrous .
The Bush administration has been too quick to dispense favours to business , which promote inequality , under the cover of "" compassionate conservatism "" .
Perhaps it should recall the words of another youthful Republican president , Theodore Roosevelt . ""
To destroy this invisible government , to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day . """
2002-01-12,"US politicians spent yesterday trying to digest the implications of the sudden chill wind blowing from Texas and threatening the warm adulation in which President Bush has bathed for the past four months .
In a small way , January 11 could also be a turning point .
The Enron Corporation 's collapse a month ago was overshadowed by the noise of collapsing Taliban .
But this week 's announcement that a criminal inquiry will be held into its failure , and the political consequences for the White House , have swept the war out of the headlines .

Its president , Lawrence Whalley , spoke to a senior treasury official up to eight times , apparently pleading with him to use the administration 's political influence with the banks to help get extended credit , it was revealed .

A year ago businesses queued up to help fund President Bush 's inaugural parties , to secure their influence with the new regime .
For decency 's sake donations were limited to $ 100,000 .
But Enron surpassed itself : it gave the full $ 100,000 and its chairman , Kenneth Lay , did the same as an individual .
These figures , and the hundreds of thousands Enron , Mr Lay and other executives had given to Mr Bush 's past campaigns in Texas , pale into insignificance compared with the billions lost in the company 's fall and the millions lost by pensioners whose money was tied up in Enron shares .
But they illustrate the status Enron had as what the Washington Post called "" the nation 's largest power broker "" .
It was a pun : power as energy was its business ; political power a sideline .
"" I do have a good personal relationship with the new president , "" Mr Lay said at the time .
"" That 's not to say it in any grand way .
I 've just known him a long time , just like I 've known his parents for a long time .
"" Enron was so deeply embedded in Texas life that the entire US attorney 's office in Houston has had to excuse itself from the case because so many of its 100 lawyers have connections with the company or its employees .
Ken Lay was a very big player in the economy and politics of Texas .
By yesterday , as the Houston Chronicle headline put it , he was "" Ken Who ? ""
Every administration has its scandals .
And when one headed by two former oil executives - the president and Vice - President Cheney - promises policies for which the oil industry has been begging , it is not difficult to predict where they may lie .

The economic scandal is not even a matter of debate .
Enron 's treatment of its staff , the cupidity of its executives , the shredding of documents : this is a trail that will lead either to the penitentiary or to changes in the law , or both .
And today the familiar phrases of political scandal are being heard round Washington : "" influence - peddling "" , "" smoking gun "" , "" what did the president know and when did he know it ? ""
Possibly this president 's acknowledged difficulty in focusing on multiple issues may help him : everyone knows he was rather distracted in the autumn .

2002-01-13,"Lord Wakeham , former Tory Energy Minister and now chairman of the Press Complaints Commission , is to appear before a United States Senate committee to explain his role in the £ 55 billion Enron collapse - the largest in US corporate history .
The Observer has learnt that the Senate 's governmental affairs committee has subpoenaed Wakeham and another 50 individuals to appear .
Senators want to question Wakeham about his role as an Enron board director for the past eight years .
In particular , they want to grill him over the part he played as a key member of two of the energy giant 's board committees that were supposed to protect shareholders ' interests and prevent any financial malpractice .
The Senate committee 's decision will be a huge embarrassment for the former Minister and leader of the House of Commons who was known as Margaret Thatcher 's ' Mr Fix - It ' .
While he was Energy Secretary in 1990 he helped privatise the UK 's electricity industry and gave consent for Enron to build Britain 's largest private power plant on Teesside .
In 1999 Tony Blair entrusted Wakeham with the job of investigating reform of the House of Lords .
Since 1994 , Wakeham has been a non - executive board director of Enron earning more than £ 80,000 a year from the company .
He also owned almost 21,000 shares in the corporation worth £ 130,000 at their peak .
Most crucially , Wakeham was a member of Enron 's audit and compliance committee that was supposed to scrutinise its financial dealings .
In particular , this committee was supposed to conduct annual reviews of the complex transactions between Enron and two partnerships set up by the company 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
It is these two partnerships which are now the focus of inquiries by the US authorities , including a criminal investigation .
The criminal probe focuses on allegations that these partnerships helped some Enron directors - not Wakeham - orchestrate a complex fraud by hiding billions of dollars of debt from Wall Street investors .
The Enron crisis threatens to escalate into a major scandal for Bush following the disclosure of close contacts between members of his team and officials from the firm , which also donated large sums of money to key political leaders .
Wakeham , who has refused to answer any questions from The Observer about his role at Enron , also faces questions over his job as chairman of another Enron board committee designed to protect shareholders ' interests and guard against corporate wrongdoing .
Wakeham earned £ 7,000 a year for chairing the nominating committee that was responsible for choosing independent non - executive directors .
Since Enron 's collapse the independence of these directors has been questioned after it emerged that a number of them had been given lucrative consultancy contracts on top of their director 's pay .
Damon Silvers , of the main US trade union organisation AFL - CIO which represents thousands of Enron employees , said : ' At best it appears Lord Wakeham was incompetent .
He and the other independent directors bear a particular responsibility for the spectacular collapse of Enron . '
When Enron filed for bankruptcy on 2 December , thousands of employees lost their jobs and billions of dollars when the company prevented them from selling shares .
Executives , meanwhile , drew out more than $ 1bn in stock when the company was near its peak .
In Washington , the scandal expanded yesterday .
The Treasury was forced to reveal that Undersecretary of State , Peter Fisher , was repeatedly called by Enron 's President , Greg Whalley , who , according to the government , pleaded for help in securing bank loans .
The chairman of the executive committee of one of two banks backing Enron , Citicorp , is Robert Rubin , former Treasury Secretary to Clinton .
It emerged yesterday that he , too , made representations to the current Treasury on the company 's behalf , asking the administration to intervene ."
2002-01-13,"As he approaches the first anniversary of his inauguration , George W Bush is under siege .
He has won the war in Afghanistan , but finds himself engaged in a new battle against a scandal that is threatening to dog his administration and tarnish his reputation .
Bush and his administration have been revealed as entwined in a story of corporate greed and political manipulation by an energy firm called Enron , now under double criminal investigation .
The scandal - in which the life savings and retirement funds of tens of thousands of employees vanished while a number of executive directors lined their pockets - reaches so high that John Ashcroft , the Attorney - General , has had to withdraw from the investigation because he received Enron money , and lawsuits are the pipeline to force Vice - President Dick Cheney for details of his contacts with the company .
The day Bush took office - a year ago next Saturday - was as cold and comfortless as his victory ; his motorcade braved driving rain and a gauntlet of demonstrations marking the most contested and ugliest election result in US history .
After 11 September , the world changed and so did America 's view of Bush .
He became the only President since Franklin Roosevelt to maintain the support of over 80 per cent of Americans for weeks on end .
But now the White House is laid bare by what rivals call ' Enronomics ' - the political fable of the Enron corporation .
It has long been reported how the Bush administration and family is beholden to the energy industry .
Before the Afghan war , an ' Energy Task Force ' favourable to the industry was the main concern for Cheney , who himself came to office from the biggest oil equipment firm in the world .
Enron was just the kind of scandal a war would hide .
The company plunged from a stock rating worth $ 60 billion - seventh on the Fortune list of US companies - into the biggest bankruptcy filing in US history , registered on 2 December .
The ethical - maybe criminal - core of the scandal is that Enron trapped its employees into a ' stock - lock ' , whereby they were not allowed to sell share options bought by way of savings .
When the company collapsed , they lost everything .
Meanwhile , Enron 's executives - blessed by inside information and foresight - made a killing by scrambling to sell shares before the price collapsed .
The victims of Enron 's rise and fall were regular employees who opted to join a savings plan by investing in their employer - and why not ?
With soaring energy prices and giddy profits , the share value quadrupled between 1997 and January last year .
The catch was they were not allowed to sell .
They were people like Pat Betteridge , of the subsidiary Portland General Electric company in Oregon , who remembers grand claims by Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay on a visit north : ' We like to think of ourselves , ' he bragged , ' as the Microsoft of the energy world . '
Betteridge used his $ 300,000 retirement savings to buy 3,500 shares - now worth not a cent . '
If I was hired to do electrical work and I botched it as bad as them , ' he says , ' I 'd either be doing time or get my licence yanked . '
The beneficiaries of the company 's surge to power were those who boarded the wheel of perpetual motion that binds the Bush administration to the energy industry .
Then the company 's brass even tried to make their fortune out of its fall as well .
The Observer has dug into Enron 's past to find that intimate connections with Bush and his Texan Republicans started long before the campaigns that brought them to Washington
Enron is a Houston - based utility trading company that sells energy to consumers , industrial and domestic .
It is one of the biggest of its kind in the world - a standing it owes in no small part to Bush 's governorship in Texas .
Texas 's 1992 Energy Policy Act opened a regulatory black hole into which Enron moved and thrived , forcing established utility companies to buy energy from it .
Meanwhile , in Washington , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , under the presidency of Bush 's father , allowed for an exemption in trading energy subsidiaries .
The practice would be Enron 's downfall .
The 1992 trading commission was chaired by Wendy Gramm , wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm , close friend of the Bush family and recipient of $ 97,350 in political donations from Enron .
Once the exemption was accomplished , Mrs Gramm resigned to join the Enron board .
As a member of its current audit committee , she is expected to play a key role in the forthcoming lawsuits and criminal investigation into bankruptcy and document destruction .
In 1997 , Enron was anxious to break into Pennsylvania , one of America 's biggest energy markets , with its huge consumers in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh .
The company was having difficulty , and Lay asked Bush ( who liked to call him ' Kenny boy ' ) tohelp .
Bush duly called the then state governor , Tom Ridge , to pitch for Enron , whose bid duly succeeded . '
I called George W to kind of tell him what was going on , ' said Lay at the time , ' and I said it would be very helpful to Enron if he could just call the governor and tell him Enron is a serious company ' .
Ridge was made Secretary of Homeland Security - Bush 's new White House office - after 11 September .
Lay and Enron have been bountiful contributors to George Bush Jnr .
Since 1993 , company executives have donated nearly $ 2 million to him personally .
Lay also donated $ 326,000 in soft money to the Republican Party over the three years prior to Bush 's presidential bid and his wife added $ 100,000 for the inauguration festivities .
The administration is splattered with senior officials owning stock in Enron .
Economic adviser Larry Lindsay and Trade Representative Robert Zoellick went straight from Enron 's payroll into office .
The biggest holding is that of Army Secretary Thomas White , who as a former Enron executive holds stock and options totalling $ 50 m to $ 100 m .
Rove himself holds as much as $ 250,000 in stock , and other holders include Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , his assistant William Winkenwerder , Assistant Treasury Secretary Mark Weinberger , Economic Undersecretary Kathleen Cooper , Education Undersecretary Eugene Hickock , the ambassadors to Russia , Ireland , the Emirates and officials in the energy department , including its chief financial officer Bruce Carnes .
It is not known which - if any - of these privileged stockholders sold their shares along with the Enron bosses , or suffered the same loss as everyone else .
Such details will appear when they make this year 's filings - leaving any that did so open to ethical , if not criminal , inquiry .
Bush has pursued the aggressive deregulation policies preferred by Enron and its kind , including legislation that exempts key elements of Enron 's energy business from oversight by the federal government - pushed by none other than Senator Phil Gramm .
Lay 's hand can meanwhile be found behind such episodes as the sudden replacement of Curtis Hebert as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Texan Pat Wood , a friend of Lay .
According to one source , the sacking after only weeks in the job came after ' an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth Lay ' in which he was ' prodded to back a faster pace in opening up access to the electricity transmission grid ' .
For all its troubles , Enron continued to benefit from Bush policies - markedly a refusal to step in and help California during the energy crisis last year , leaving consumers to pay the price ... to Enron .
Enron was so close to the bosom of the administration that Lay and other executives were called to the White House for six meetings with Cheney and his staff - the last one only a week before the company made the staggering announcement that it was slashing shareholder equity by $ 1.2bn .
For Enron was playing a double game .
In the run - up to the announcement , its president , Greg Whalley , was frantically lobbying another wing of the administration for help in arranging loans .
His point man was Undersecretary Peter Fisher .
Lay discussed the upcoming bankruptcy twice with Commerce Secretary Don Evans - one of the Texan ' Iron Triangle ' that propelled Bush to power .
Later , he also twice pleaded Enron 's case to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill .
But the Republicans were not the only political heavyweights to benefit from Enron 's greed .
The company has made donations to many Democrats too - some 27 per cent of its political contributions , according to the Centre for Responsive Politics in Washington .
And among Enron 's top point men in Washington during the bankruptcy saga was Clinton 's former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , who was revealed by the Washington Post yesterday as having made a representation last November to the current Treasury on behalf of the company .
Rubin is now chairman of the executive committee of the Citigroup bank , one of Enron 's principal backers , trying , with the JP Morgan bank , to raise $ 1.5bn in an effort to see the company through the bankruptcy crisis .
These are matters for the six Congressional committees preparing to investigate Enron .
But they will have to wait for the two criminal investigations launched this week : one into Enron 's bankruptcy , the other into the admission by the company 's auditor , Arthur Andersen , that it destroyed thousands of documents about the bankruptcy .
Andersen had good reason to destroy the papers .
The reasons for Enron 's destruction when all the winds seemed to blow behind the company 's fortunes are associated with the labyrinth of subsidiaries built up by Chief Finance Officer Andrew Fastow , fired on 24 October , and other executives .
Fastow created partnerships with what were described as outside , independently - run companies with names such as ' Chewco ' or ' Jedi ' - after characters in Star Wars - that were owned by him or others with Enron backing .
As a result , hundreds of millions of dollars were slushing overseas to tax havens as Fastow and other executives - so they said - sought to shore up the company against a possible fall in energy prices .
What they were allegedly doing was amassing personal fortunes .
The ensuing gaps in the balance sheet became a gaping abyss which could not be hidden and down which the company finally fell .
Enron admitted that it had overstated profits by $ 400 m in reports issued since .
However , Chewco alone enabled Enron to be able to keep some $ 600 m of debt off its books .
The crucial criminal issue is whether executives misled investors by inflating revenues and minimising debts .
The political issue is how closely entwined is the Washington elite - and the immediate circle around Bush .
Seven months of Bush 's oil - friendly presidency was driven out of the spotlight by 11 September .
It had pleased the industry for its isolationism and determination to withdraw from world affairs - the Kyoto Accords on global warming or arms reduction with Russia .
Domestically , Bush 's cause was an articulate one : a tax cut worth $ 1.3 trillion , of which nine - tenths went to the 1 per cent of wealthiest Americans , and ambitions to drill for oil across the Alaskan wilderness and deregulate controls over the oil and energy industries .
By the afternoon of 11 September , Bush had become the vanishing president during his people 's hour of need , cowering underground beneath an Air Force base in remote Nebraska .
But by the end of that week , Americans saw in Bush not a spoiled brat , but the man they wanted to lead the nation to war .
Now the Enron scandal brings the presidency home , with Bush as Winston Churchill preparing for the 1945 election in Britain .
The would - be Clement Attlee is Tom Daschle , leader of the Senate Democrats , who last week left the unity of war behind to unleash his congressional campaign for November 2002 with an offensive over welfare , tax policy , health care , energy and the environment .
The elections are critical to Bush and the Republicans : no US president apart from Nixon and Reagan has not lost ground at the mid - term polls , and the Democrats , even without making substantial gains , can keep control of the Senate while taking over the House and state governorships .
For the State of the Union address Bush will give on the twenty - ninth of this month , White House staff are scrambling to entwine the war in Afghanistan with the continuing domestic agenda .
But the minefield they must cross is named Enron ."
2002-01-13,"· Enron , worth $ 80 billion and the seventh largest corporation in America , became the biggest bankruptcy in history when it collapsed last month .
· Shares in the Texas energy trading company have fallen from $ 82 to less than $ 1 in a year .
· Executives were able to sell their shares before Enron crashed .
More than $ 100 million of bonuses were paid to about 600 senior employees during Enron 's final days .
· But about 6,000 Enron workers have been laid off , including 1,000 in Britain .
Thousands have lost their life savings because they subscribed to a pension plan based on Enron shares .
They were not allowed to sell the shares before the company collapsed .
· ' We have been lied to and we have been cheated , ' said Janice Farmer , a retired Texas employee who held nearly $ 700,000 in Enron shares before the crash .
· The list of Enron creditors , who have legal priority over the pensioners , runs to 54 pages and includes big banks JP Morgan and Citigroup .
· Once a traditional gas company , Enron ran into trouble after moving into the risky new field of energy trading , which sprang up as governments deregulated , and then privatised , state energy companies .
· Enron employees are suing Andersen , Enron 's accountants , for $ 1bn .
They say the firm help Enron to hide its debts .
· Congress and the US Justice Department are also investigating . ·
But some of those in the US government are there partly thanks to donations from Enron .
In the last elections Enron donated $ 2.4 m to federal candidates , making it one of the top 50 corporate donors ."
2002-01-14,"Most American leader writers do not think that the Enron collapse poses a real political threat to President George Bush .
The Washington Post , for one , argues that financial practices are the issue . '
Concealment is the real scandal ' Enron appears to have sought help from the administration in securing fresh credit from its bankers and in staving off a downgrade by a credit - rating firm , but no help seems to have been given .
The real scandal about Enron is different .
It is that a public company , with a legal obligation to report accurately on its finances , concealed the true state of those finances from its owners .
International Herald Tribune
In a story focusing on the financial aspects of the scandal , the New York Times says one of the biggest casualties from the Enron collapse is Enron 's auditors , the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen . '
Andersen 's survival at stake '
After months of damaging revelations about its relationship with Enron , capped by the acknowledgement Thursday that it had destroyed a large number of Enron documents , Andersen is facing congressional investigations , a federal criminal inquiry and lawsuits from shareholders that could cost it billions of dollars .
Perhaps even more seriously for a company that lives and dies by its reputation , the Arthur Andersen Co. name is in tatters .
International Herald Tribune
In more light - hearted vein , the Wall Street Journal compares Enron with Whitewater , the obscure property deal that got the Clintons into trouble .
While calling for a proper financial investigation , the Journal wonders what revelations will come next if Enron really is another Whitewater .
Most of the editorial is devoted to a tongue in cheek rewriting of the Whitewater affair , filled with names from the current administration . '
Another Whitewater ?
Yippee ! ! '
Two Whitewaters is just too much to ask .
In our sober moments , we suspect that political contributions had little to do with the rise and fall of Enron .
Its ascendancy under Democrats and bankruptcy under Republicans does n't exactly fit the current pressie axiom that money tends to corrupt and political money corrupts absolutely .
Wall Street Journal ( susbcribers only )
Robert Scheer at the Los Angeles Times , however , has no truck with such sentiments .
A ferocious columnist , Mr Scheer tears into the Bush dynasty for paving the way for Enron 's rise . '
Enron is a cancer on the presidency '
The fact is that there would be no Enron as we know it were it not for Republican - engineered changes in government regulation that permitted Enron its meteoric growth .
It 's true that the corporation had its allies among the Democrats ; campaign finance corruption and influence peddling are generally a cover - all - your - bets bipartisan activity .
But in this case , the amounts given to Democrats were puny and late , and there 's no doubt that Enron rode to power primarily on the strength of Kenneth Lay 's [ The Enron chairman ] influence with the Bush family .

2002-01-14,"Congressional investigators are looking at the possibility of obstruction of justice after it emerged that a lawyer at Arthur Andersen , the accountancy firm , ordered the destruction of thousands of documents in connection with Enron , the failed US energy company .
The order to destroy records came in a memo dated October 12 and has raised further questions over Arthur Andersen , the auditors of Enron , which filed for bankruptcy last December .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , the chairman of a US senate committee investigating the Enron collapse , said he was troubled that a lawyer at Arthur Andersen had directed the destruction of Enron documents at a time when Andersen and executives of the energy giant "" knew that Enron was in real trouble , and the roof was about to collapse on them . ""
Mr Lieberman said the timing of the memo raises the serious possibility of obstruction of justice .
The memo was uncovered by congressional investigators and first reported by Time magazine .
Andersen , one of the world 's leading accounting firms , disclosed last week that some documents related to Enron , once America 's seventh largest company , had been destroyed but the company gave no additional details .
After the memo came to light , Andersen admitted that "" there were internal communications that raise questions "" in connection with the Enron documents . ""
Andersen is committed to getting the facts and taking appropriate actions in the Enron matter , "" the company said , adding that "" it would be inappropriate to comment further . ""
The Enron bankruptcy , the largest in American history , could prove highly damaging to America 's political class amid suspicion that the company 's generous political donations resulted in special favours .
"" There 's absolutely no evidence that the Bush administration in any way did anything improper , "" said John McCain , the Republican senator who has been an ardent advocated for campaign finance reform .
But Mr McCain and Mr Lieberman said Enron 's vast campaign contributions to the US president , George Bush , as well as to members of Congress , did raise questions .
"" We 're all tainted by the millions and millions of dollars that were contributed by Enron executives , which ... creates the appearance of impropriety , "" Mr McCain said .
Since 1990 , Enron and its employees had contributed $ 5.77 m to political campaigns , about three - fourths of it to Republican candidates .
About half of the money was spent in the 2000 election , with Mr Bush a major beneficiary .
The US justice department last week announced a criminal investigation into Enron to see how such a huge company could have collapsed so quickly , destroying the life savings of thousand of employees whose retirement plans were stuffed with Enron shares .
According to court filings , a group of 29 Enron directors and senior executives sold 17.3 m shares before the company 's collapse .
But staff with pensions invested in pension shares were prevented from selling even as the price plunged from $ 90 to $ 1 ."
2002-01-14,"The former Conservative cabinet minister , Lord Wakeham , last night signalled his willingness to answer any questions asked by US Senate committees investigating the £ 55bn collapse of the Enron energy corporation .
But , as US sources revealed that Enron executives cashed in $ 1.1bn ( £ 750 m ) worth of shares between 1999 and mid-2001 - leaving ordinary employees to lose their savings in the crash - it emerged that Lord Wakeham , a non - executive director of Enron who has both share holdings and a reported £ 80,000 a year from the firm , had not sold any .
The former energy secretary was a member of Enron 's audit and compliance committee , whose job it was to see that proper procedures were in place , including legal advice and auditing .
They relied upon expert advice .
The role of accountants Arthur Andersen , who did the Enron audit , is bound to be a central focus of congressional inquiries , as the US justice department ploughs through a mountain of paperwork and other evidence in search of criminal activity .
If any were found , it would acutely embarrass President George Bush whose early supporters include top Enron executives now under suspicion .
Enron was America 's seventh largest company until it collapsed at the end of November , saddled with £ 10bn of debt and embroiled in allegations of financial irregularities .
The oil company , based in Mr Bush 's home state of Texas , has caused controversy at the highest level of the US political establishment that is expected to reverberate for many years to come .
Enron executives cashed in $ 1.1bn ( £ 750 m ) worth of shares in 1999 - 2001 .
According to court filings a group of 29 directors and senior executives at the company sold 17.3 m shares .
The figures will further enrage workers at Enron who in many cases have lost their life savings through the company 's collapse .
Staff whose pensions were invested in the firm 's shares were prevented from selling even as the price plunged from the region of $ 90 to less than $ 1 .
One of the most prolific sellers was Kenneth Lay , the Enron chairman , who was a major contributor to the Bush election campaign .
Mr Lay pocketed $ 101 m over the period .
The former chairman of an Enron subsidiary , Lou Pai , received $ 353 m from selling shares .
Lawyers for Enron said the share sales , compiled in yesterday 's New York Times , were entirely proper and that the directors had no special inside information or advantages over other investors .
Lord Wakeham is saying nothing in public and has not yet been asked to appear before any Senate hearings .
If asked , he will willingly attend .
The US government again moved to distance itself from any assumption of responsibility for the largest bankruptcy in US corporate history .
The Treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , who was contacted by Enron in a plea for help in the weeks before the collapse , said he had known nothing more about the situation than what was already in the public arena .
"" Everyone knew from what Enron had disclosed that they were struggling , "" he said .
"" We did n't have any knowledge that was n't general public property "" ."
2002-01-14,"Short of offering a blank sheet of paper , it is difficult to convey the supreme indifference with which the fate of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay is being greeted in the United States .
The Sunday newspapers , given the chance to stick their teeth into the story not related to terror since September 11 , were full of the Enron affair .
The talk shows , even the serious ones , used the issue mainly for light relief .
"" I think the idea of being sedated for a 27-hour flight ought to be an option the airlines might want to start offering , "" said a speaker on CNN 's Capital Gang .
US policy seems to be guided by three main considerations , none in itself reprehensible .
First public safety , which is one reason why holding the prisoners at Guantanamo , where escape offers a choice between Castro 's Cuba and the sea , is a political masterstroke .
Second is the wish to avoid any trial turning into a legal circus .
Third is simple uncertainty about how to handle an unprecedented situation .
The draconian rules for military tribunals , already softened in some crucial respects , were almost certainly intended for the extreme case of the forces finding themselves in possession of Osama bin Laden or one of his senior aides .
Now the administration does have to decide how to deal with real prisoners in a real jail .
Politically , there is no problem : most Americans are only interested in keeping them out of sight and preferably out of mind .
Camp X - Ray , with no media , legal or consular access , is ideal .
Legally , the situation may be less clear - cut than the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , tried to make out .
Human Rights Watch is adamant that under the Geneva conventions a distinction must be made between Taliban fighters , who qualify as prisoners of war , and al - Qaida members , who do not .
It says the onus is on the US to prove that detainees are not PoWs . ""
Even if they are unlawful combatants , the convention requires humane treatment , "" its US programme director , Jamie Felne , said .
"" Putting them in cages does not qualify . ""
The US is a signatory to other treaties that might be easier to invoke in court .
"" There are quite low levels of the definition of torture , "" Neil Durkin of Amnesty International said .
"" Hooding could well be a breach of it . ""
It is also questionable whether US law applies at Guantanamo Bay .
If such issues get to court , the ironies may start to hit home .
One crucial distinction Americans have always made between good guys and bad guys is their treatment of prisoners ."
2002-01-15,"Enron Corporation and Switzerland 's largest bank , UBS are to split profits from Enron 's energy trading business , the most valuable part of the bankrupt US company , in a rescue plan unveiled today .
Under the deal , UBS Warburg , the investment banking arm of UBS , will not pay any money up front to acquire Enron 's trading arm nor assume any of the troubled company 's debts .
UBS would take over the unit and pay Enron 33 % of the profits over a period of up to 10 years .
Enron 's energy trading business , which generated about 90 % of the company 's $ 101bn ( £ 70bn ) in revenue in 2000 , has been the subject of a bidding war between UBS Warburg and US banking giant Citigroup , a large Enron creditor .
A creditors ' committee approved the plan , but other Enron creditors have raised questions , saying they want more information about how the agreement was reached and how the proceeds will be allocated .
The deal must be approved by the bankruptcy judge , Arthur Gonzalez , and a hearing is set for Friday .
Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal judge Gonzalez 's ruling .
Before its collapse late last year , Enron was the world 's largest energy trader and America 's seventh largest company by revenue .
It is now under investigation by several congressional committees as well as a criminal investigation from the justice department Newly - released documents from a congressional committee revealed today that the Enron chairman , Kenneth Lay , was warned last summer by a company vice president that the energy company 's financial practices might cause it to "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
The vice president , Sherron Watkins , warned in an August letter to Mr Lay and other senior officials that a "" veil of secrecy "" surrounding the company 's "" funny accounting "" of complex partnerships had not been adequately disclosed to the public and merited further investigation .
The seven - page memo was found by congressional investigators trawling through 40 boxes of Enron documents obtained from the company after it filed the largest bankruptcy suit in US history on December 2 .
They said the document raises troubling questions about the extent to which Enron officials and their auditor , Andersen , were aware of the financial transactions and accounting practices that contributed to the company 's downfall .
Investigators said they plan to interview Ms Watkins , whom they declined to name publicly but who was confirmed as the author by her attorney , Philip Hilder .
Ms Watkins worked for the Enron chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , as vice president of corporate development .
She wrote the memo anonymously , and then sought out Mr Lay to express her concerns directly .
Enron collapsed amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business .
In her August memo , Ms Watkins wrote : "" It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate with Enron stock in the future .
I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals . ""
Robert Bennett , Enron 's Washington lawyer , said Mr Lay took the concerns seriously and met her and ordered an investigation .
He said that the review by an outside law firm found that "" no further investigation was necessary "" ."
2002-01-15,"The inquiry into the Enron collapse , the biggest bankruptcy in US history , focused yesterday on the energy trading firm 's auditors , Arthur Andersen , and an October 12 memo ordering the destruction of potentially incriminating documents .
As evidence surfaced of a concerted cover - up of Enron 's problems in the months leading up to the bankruptcy on December 2 , it also emerged that the Texan company , once worth over $ 80bn ( £ 55bn ) , had more intensive contacts with the Bush administration than the White House had previously admitted .
Enron executives were in contact with administration officials 14 times last year , mostly to ask for help , it was reported yesterday .
The commerce secretary , Don Evans , said the company 's chief executive , Kenneth Lay , called him five times . ""
He was looking for all the possible ways he could stabilise his company , "" Mr Evans said , but he insisted that he did nothing to help the struggling corporation , which was the biggest sponsor of George Bush 's career .
Other administration officials contacted by Enron last autumn as the scale of its losses emerged included the treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , his deputy , Peter Fisher , and the energy secretary , Spencer Abraham .
All deny intervening on the company 's behalf .
As at least two criminal inquiries and six congressional committee hearings began to delve into Enron 's complex business dealings , increasing attention is being paid to the role of Arthur Andersen , one of the world 's biggest accounting firms .
According to congressional investigators quoted in the US press , an internal memorandum on October 12 from one of the firm 's lawyers ordered Arthur Andersen workers to destroy documents from Enron files .
Time magazine reported that supervisors at Arthur Andersen sent repeated reminders to their auditors about the memo in the weeks leading up to the issue of subpoenas by the federal regulatory agency , the security and exchange commission .
It is thought thousands of emails and files , paper and electronic , were destroyed which could have proved significant in the investigation of Enron 's dealings .
Destruction of the documents may also have continued after the issue of the subpoenas , in which case those involved could face criminal charges .
The accounting firm yesterday conceded that "" a significant but undetermined number "" of documents had been destroyed , but it did not confirm the October 12 memo , arguing it would be "" inappropriate "" to discuss it before the firm had completed its own internal enquiry .
Arthur Andersen only revealed that it had destroyed the documents early last week , just before the arrival of four congressional investigators at the company 's Houston offices .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , the Democrats ' vice presidential candidate in 2000 , who also received some Enron financial backing for his campaign , expressed concern over Arthur Andersen 's actions , saying that by October 12 , executives at Andersen and at Enron "" knew that Enron was in real trouble and the roof was about to collapse on them "" .
Enron , which traded oil and gas supplies and other commodities , disguised its growing losses in shell companies it set up as partnerships , boosting Enron 's apparent profits and its share price .
Between 1999 and 2001 , 29 of the company 's top executives sold off $ 1.1bn in Enron shares .
At the same time , the pensions funds of its rank - and - file employees , over 60 % of which were made up of Enron stock , eroded to near worthlessness .
At the weekend , John Dingell , the senior Democrat on the House of Representatives commerce committee , one of the six congressional panels mounting investigations , said : "" There 's pretty strong evidence of insider trading , there 's clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct reports . """
2002-01-15,"The familiar paraphernalia of political scandal is being assembled in Washington .
At the last count , two criminal inquiries and six congressional hearings were scheduled on the Enron scandal .
In the legislature , reduced by the war on terrorism to the role of cheerleader , everyone wants to be a part of it .
Both parties know how the rituals of scandal can define a presidency .
Reagan managed to shrug off most of the damage caused by the Iran - contra affair , while Clinton was overwhelmed by the Monica Lewinsky saga and is unlikely to have an airport named after him .
Now it is George Bush 's turn .
Enron , a gigantic Texan energy trading firm and the biggest single sponsor of his political career , collapsed dramatically last month amid allegations of fraud and insider trading .
The inquiries will ask familiar questions : what did the administration know and when did it know it ?
Was there a cover - up and did the Bush team help ?
These are the staples of Washington scandal , but this time they may be the wrong questions .
They focus on whether anyone in the administration broke the rules .
The whole point of the Enron affair is that it discredits the rules of the game .
It exposes the institutionalised corruption at the heart of US politics - a casual exchange of money and power that Bush has made his trademark .
The seamy subject of campaign finance briefly captured the attention of the US electorate in the early months of the Bush presidency when it was apparent that big campaign contributors were being paid back one presidential decree at a time .
Enron will bring it back into focus .
Investigators are poring over Enron 's contacts with the administration last autumn , when the company was fighting for its life , looking for signs of illegal meddling in the market .
In fact , the big trade - off for the company 's campaign contributions was made months earlier .
Enron executives had six meetings with the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and his staff when he was drawing up the administration 's energy plan in the spring , a fact that has surfaced only since the company went bust .
The White House has refused to tell Congress which other industrial magnates it consulted in drawing up the plan , which is broadly speaking a polluters ' charter .
Few , if any , environmentalists were invited .
This is precisely how Bush mixed business and politics when he was governor of Texas .
The oil and gas companies who supported his candidacy were given free rein , at secret meetings with Bush officials , to write their own rules when it came to state policy on emissions control .
They , not surprisingly , chose a voluntary scheme with equally unsurprising consequences for air quality in Texan cities .
Governor Bush introduced sweeping tort reform , making it harder for ordinary Texans to sue corporations .
And he appointed Pat Wood , nominee of Enron 's chairman , Ken Lay , as head of the state 's public utility commission , where he promptly pushed ahead with the deregulation the energy companies had been asking for .
Last year , after Lay failed to persuade the head of the federal energy regulatory commission to agree to Enron 's views , Bush gave Wood the chairman 's job .
Of course , this constant barter of cash for influence represents politics as usual .
Some Democrats also took serious amounts from Enron , but as a party they are also beholden to other interest groups , like unions and minorities , tempering corporate control .
In the president 's case , corporate influence appears almost unmitigated .
Bush has pushed through the biggest tax cuts in a generation , heavily weighted to the wealthiest 5 % , and backed an economic stimulus package brimming with corporate tax breaks and amnesties .
This was marketed along with the old palliative , the trickle - down effect : tax - breaks for corporations and the wealthy create jobs further down the economic food chain .
Bush portrayed his policies as anti - recessionary before September 11 , and as downright patriotic afterwards .
The message was a familiar one .
What 's good for Enron ( or insert your corporate name here in return for the appropriate campaign donation ) is good for America .
The Enron debacle is potentially so dangerous for Bush because it makes it painfully clear that the old equation does not hold .
The Enron executives got rich even as their company was plunging into the abyss , taking its employees with it .
It is the ultimate nightmare for the corporate welfare state , for which Bush has made himself flag - carrier in chief .
The executives in this case have shown themselves to be anything but patriotic .
They were revealed instead as rapacious asset - strippers .
The Democratic party has to seize the Enron affair with both hands .
With the mid - term congressional elections about to take off , it might just shake the nation out of its patriotic trance and revive a debate over how US politics is bought and paid for .

2002-01-16,"The Enron scandal has pushed US politics to the brink of a fundamental overhaul after more details emerged yesterday of the intricate web of relationships built up between the bankrupt energy trading corporation and the Bush administration with the help of millions of dollars of campaign cash .
Sponsors of a campaign finance bill , aimed at curbing the influence that heavy - spending companies wield in Washington , claimed yesterday that the controversy was almost certain to force a vote on the legislation in the House of Representatives where it has been stalled since last summer by Republican leaders .
That bill needs just four more signatures to put it on the floor of the House , where its sponsors - the Republican Christopher Shays and the Democrat Marty Meehan - believe it commands a majority among congressmen shamed by the debacle .
The Senate has already passed a virtually identical bill , and President Bush , the biggest single beneficiary of Enron 's largesse and a staunch opponent of campaign finance reform , would find it difficult to block .
Enron 's fall , Mr Meehan said , "" makes it all the more likely the president will sign our bill "" .
"" This has helped push the issue over the edge , "" said Jeff Cronin , a spokesman for Common Cause , a pro - reform pressure group .
"" The only way for congressmen to absolve themselves of the Enron taint is to support the bill . ""
The Enron scandal has illustrated how widely the taint has spread .
According to figures compiled by a Washington watchdog , the Centre for Responsive Politics , Enron spent a total of $ 5.8 m ( £ 4 m ) on federal elections over the past 12 years , 73 % of the money going to Republicans .
The company 's donations went to 71 out of 100 senators and 188 out of 435 House members .
Enron 's deep financial roots on Capitol Hill helped insulate it from government attempts to regulate its business dealings .
In 1996 and 1997 , the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday , the Clinton administration attempted to persuade Congress to close a financing loophole , known as "" trust - preferred securities "" , which was helping Enron conceal some of its debts while avoiding tax .
Congress refused and the Internal Revenue Service had to drop a legal challenge to Enron 's broad use of the dodge , which might have forestalled the company 's meltdown last year .
Cash and politics jigsaw Enron 's links reached deepest inside the Bush administration , packed with former Enron officials , major Enron shareholders and large - scale recipients of Enron campaign funding .
President Bush himself received $ 826,000 from the Texan company in the eight years since he first ran for governor of that state .
The corporation 's CEO , Kenneth Lay , was in many senses his political godfather and the president used to refer to him chummily as "" Kenny Boy "" until the scandal broke .
Since then it has been "" Mr Lay "" .
The question at the centre of the US political stage now is what Enron got in return for its investment .
No evidence has yet emerged that the Bush administration attempted to throw a lifeline to Enron as it fell into spectacular collapse .
But the focus is shifting to the influence Enron wielded before the collapse .
That appears to have been far - reaching and powerful .
The latest piece of the cash - and - politics jigsaw emerged yesterday in the form of a reported conversation between Mr Lay and the White House budget director Mitch Daniels in October to discuss the president 's proposed economic stimulus package .
Enron stood to gain millions of dollars from tax cuts in the stimulus package that was blocked at the senate .
Another significant recipient of Enron 's campaign help was the right - wing Texas Republican Senator Phil Gramm , one of the strongest advocates of deregulation on Capitol Hill .
His wife Wendy , as the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , pushed hard to have a rule adopted which would exempt energy swaps ( Enron 's stock - in trade ) from federal oversight .
After Mrs Gramm got her way on the rule - change , she promptly resigned from her regulatory role and joined Enron 's board of directors .
Her husband , who has just announced his retirement from the Senate , has received $ 233,000 in campaign funding from Enron .
Enron executives also held a total of six meetings last year with the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and his staff , who were responsible for the drawing up of one of the administration 's most important initiatives , the energy plan , which advocates expansion and deregulation of US production , including the opening up of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling .
The Bush team also changed the law on derivatives trading in a manner that was directly beneficial to Enron . ""
Enron 's woes are n't really a scandal at all - instead , they 're a magnifying glass allowing us to see clearly exactly how government and business operate today , "" the commentator Andrew Leonard wrote in the liberal online magazine Salon.com .
"" You spend enough money on campaign contributions and lobbyists to buy influence and get the laws changed on your behalf , and then you sit back and count your stock options .
"" Enron did it on a bigger scale than anybody else in recent memory , and ultimately , on a more incompetent scale than everybody else , but that does n't make it exceptional . ""
Politicians from both parties are now falling over each other in the rush to return Enron donations .
The taint of the Enron disaster may just prove to be deep enough this time to bring down a long - entrenched system .
The main barrier to its passing in the House is now the Republican whip , Tom DeLay , who has vowed to fight the Shays - Meehan bill tooth and nail .
At last count , Mr DeLay received a total of $ 28,900 from Enron 's generous coffers ."
2002-01-17,"Arthur Andersen , the accountancy firm , today confirmed holding discussions on whether to retain Enron as a client nine months before the US energy company filed for bankruptcy .
The discussions among executives at the "" big five "" accounting firm were detailed in a memo dated February 6 2001 and reveal that Andersen executives were aware of the accounting techniques Enron used to conceal its level of debt .
The memo reported that Andersen executives discussed the amount of debt Enron kept off the books through a private partnership called LJM .
The use of partnerships to disguise Enron 's massive debts is one of the areas on which investigators are focusing .
Enron is the subject of a US justice department criminal investigation as well as several congressional inquiries .
The memo also mentioned conflicts of interest issues surrounding that partnership as it was controlled by Enron 's then chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
But Andersen , itself under investigation for possible misconduct , said the meeting described in the memo was simply a standard annual review meeting .
"" We routinely have a meeting every year on every single client to determine whether to retain them , "" an Andersen official said .
LJM and other similar partnerships played a key role in the rise and fall of Enron .
At its zenith , the energy company was valued at $ 70bn and was America 's seventh - largest company .
But once it emerged that the little - known partnerships were used to keep debts off Enron 's own balance sheets , Enron was forced to declare a $ 1.2bn reduction in shareholder equity .
The move precipitated a crisis in investor confidence and a collapse in share prices .
Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2 , the biggest bankruptcy in US history .
Piling on Andersen 's woes , an auditor fired for destroying documents in the Enron collapse is laying the blame squarely on the accountancy firm .
He has told congressional investigators he was just following advice from company lawyers .
David Duncan , the former chief auditor for Andersen 's Enron account , said the firm 's lawyers suddenly began emphasising Andersen 's policy allowing for the destruction of some documents .
He told investigators with the House of Representatives ' energy and commerce committee that general discussions began at Andersen in September 2001on what Enron - related documents to discard . ""
It was unusual "" to emphasise the document destruction policy , Mr Duncan told the investigators , according to congressional sources .
An Andersen spokesman declined comment .
According to congressional officials , Mr Duncan told investigators that an October 12 memo from one of Andersen 's lawyers was the beginning of an effort to discard many records .
Andersen said Mr Duncan organised a two - week effort to destroy documents that began in late October .
The accounting firm fired Mr Duncan on Tuesday , put three other Enron auditors on administrative leave and stripped management responsibilities from four partners in its office in Houston , Enron 's headquarters .
The auditor was questioned for several hours yesterday as the White House disclosed that President George Bush 's chief economic adviser , Lawrence Lindsey , was asked to study the impact of an Enron collapse after presidential aides were alerted to the problem last autumn .
Mr Lindsey concluded late last year that Enron 's collapse would not hurt the US and global financial markets .
It was the same finding reached by Peter Fisher , the treasury undersecretary in charge of financial markets who opened a review , after two phone calls from the Enron chairman , Kenneth Lay , to the treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , in October asking for help ."
2002-01-17,"The fall - out from the collapse of US energy group Enron deepened yesterday when JP Morgan Chase said it had written off $ 807 m related to both the bankrupt company and bad debts in Argentina .
The hit caused the Wall Street bank to fall into its first quarterly loss for five years - $ 332 m - against a profit of $ 708 m in the same period a year earlier .
The confluence of Enron and Argentina , where the economy has been plunged into crisis , was described by one analyst as "" the perfect storm "" .
Full - year profits fell by 71 % to $ 1.7bn . ""
2001 was a challenging year for JP Morgan Chase and our financial results clearly reflect that , "" said William Harrison Jr , the chairman and chief executive .
JP Morgan advised Enron , which became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history last month , on its failed attempt to merge with rival Dynergy .
More than half the write - off announced yesterday relates to Enron .
The bank is trying to recover money from the failed energy firm and is suing its insurance companies to recover $ 965 m in payments related to oil and gas contracts .
Citigroup is also heavily exposed to Enron and US financial regulators are examining the bank 's role in the Enron collapse .
Diana Yates , finance analyst at AG Edwards , said she remained positive on JP Morgan despite the losses .
"" They had a very strong fourth quarter in credit cards and a record year on new mortgages .
On the investment banking side , equities are improving .
You have to look past the venture capital in Argentina and Enron , which we knew were there . ""
The venture side of JP Morgan was also likely to recover this year , she added ."
2002-01-17,"The American energy trading company Enron has already left one indelible mark on business history .
In June , the Economist praised it for creating the "" most successful internet venture of any company in any industry anywhere "" .
By December Enron had become the biggest bankrupt in any industry anywhere , losing a record $ 60bn - or 99 % of its stock market worth ( another record ) - in the process .
It left thousands of employees who invested their pension funds in the company in difficulties - while the top brass flogged off their own holdings .
The full ramifications will not be known for years .
As of now , though , it does not look as though the close ties between Enron and the White House will lead to a major scandal , but these are early days .
What is very clear is that we are also witnessing the world 's biggest accounting scandal .
Accountants trade on one essential commodity : their integrity .
They examine company books to decide whether they contain a fair and accurate account , and they are paid handsomely for their work .
Arthur Andersen , Enron 's auditors , were paid $ 52 m in 2000 for auditing and consultancy work .
Somehow , though , they failed to tell shareholders that Enron was consistently overstating its profits and salting hundreds of millions in debt - which would have hit its credit rating - into offshore partnerships from which top executives benefited .
Either the auditors did not know - in which case they were incompetent - or they did know and kept quiet to safeguard their fees .
The fact that Andersen has destroyed not dozens , but thousands , of documents and emails suggests they could have something big to hide .
Such activities - again , unprecedented , if proved - would be criminal and almost certainly lead to shareholders and employees suing for huge sums .
Some lessons should be learned quickly .
First , accounting firms should be either auditors or consultants - but not both ; conflicts are easily generated when the company goes easy on an audit to protect revenues from consultancy .
Second , auditors should rotate , so they do not audit the same company for more than , say , four years to avoid making soft judgments out of fear of losing the audit income .
Andersen must rid itself quickly of its cancer .
Part of the former Andersen empire changed its name to Accenture .
But Andersen itself will need more than a name change before the stench arising from this case is eliminated ."
2002-01-18,"Bankrupt Enron has fired its longtime auditor , Arthur Andersen , amid a welter of recriminations about the destruction of financial documents .
The once - close relationship between the US energy trading company and the big five accountancy firm foundered acrimoniously as it emerged that the Enron chairman , Kenneth Lay , sold shares just days after receiving a letter warning him about accounting problems at the company .
According to newly released documents , Mr Lay was told of those problems in a letter written by Sherron Watkins , a senior Enron employee , on August 15 2001 .
The letter sparked an investigation by Enron 's outside law firm , which concluded that Enron 's accounting practices could be embarrassing to the company .
On August 20 2001 , Mr Lay sold stock options for $ 2 m .
A lawyer for Enron disclosed earlier this week that some shares had been used to repay a previously undisclosed loan from Enron .
One of the key issues for federal and congressional investigators is whether Enron executives used their inside knowledge of the company 's problems to sell shares for millions , while employees were locked into pension plans stuffed with Enron shares .
Amalgamated Bank of New York , which invested the pension money of union members in Enron shares , has sued Enron precisely on this matter .
The lawsuit says Enron insiders knew of the company 's financial problems but concealed them from the public .
As congressional investigators sifted through Enron 's paper trail , the company parted company with Andersen , its longtime accountancy firm .
"" We ca n't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events , including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of Andersen 's partners working in its Houston office , "" Enron said .
Earlier this week , Andersen sacked David Duncan , the lead Andersen partner in charge of auditing Enron , for destroying documents .
Mr Duncan , who was questioned by congressional officials on Wednesday , claims he was only following company policy as laid out in an Andersen memo from October 12 2001 .
Andersen , itself under investigation for possible misconduct , responded to Enron 's sacking by saying : "" As a matter of fact , our relationship with Enron ended when the company 's business failed and it went into bankruptcy .
Andersen is committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner . ""
While Enron has come under fire for its "" aggressive "" accounting practices , which involved moving debt off its balance sheet and transferring it to special partnerships , Andersen has been criticised for looking the other way .
Memos showed that Andersen did express concern about such practices as early as 10 months before Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2 2001 , but decided to stick with its client .
A memo from a meeting dated February 6 2001 cited the large fees - $ 100 m a year - that Enron was expected to generate .
Enron paid $ 52 m in fees to Andersen in 2000 ."
2002-01-18,"Arthur Andersen lurched deeper into crisis yesterday after it emerged that the accountancy firm may have been aware of the problems at the collapsed energy firm Enron as much as one year ago .
It also became apparent that the Enron employee who had warned the company 's chief executive Kenneth Lay of an impending crisis in August had made her concerns known to Andersen at the same time .
The accountancy firm faces billions of dollars in potential lawsuits from disgruntled investors and there is growing speculation that it may not survive the Enron debacle .
Enron 's descent into the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history yesterday led to changes in the way accounting firms are regulated in the US .
The securities and exchange commission announced plans for a new independent regulatory body to oversee the accounting profession .
Chairman of the SEC , Harvey Pitt said the industry was "" crying out for repair "" after a decade of neglect .
Congressional investigators discovered a memo dated February 6 2001 that recounted a meeting between Andersen executives where the question of whether or not to retain Enron as a client was discussed .
The memo said that Andersen executives had talked about the off balance sheet ventures that were carrying much of Enron 's debts and which eventually lead to its collapse .
It also detailed a discussion about a potential conflict of interest for Enron 's then chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , who controlled one of the ventures .
Andersen confirmed the contents of the memo but said it was simply a regular annual review and retention meeting .
The company also said it had been assured by Enron that an outside firm of lawyers was examining the claims of the whistleblower in August ."
2002-01-18,"One of the key issues in the Enron scandal is how top executives managed to sell Enron shares for enormous amounts of money , while many lower - level employees were locked into retirement plans full of Enron stock .
More than half of Enron 's employees retirement funds , or about $ 1.2bn , were invested in company stock , which is now worthless .
A detailed accounting of trades by Enron executives is contained in a lawsuit against top Enron management brought by Amalgamated Bank of New York , which invested the pension money of union members in Enron shares .
The lawsuit says Enron insiders knew of the company 's financial problems but concealed them from the public .
According to court documents , a group of 29 Enron executives and directors received $ 1.1bn by selling 17.3 m shares from 1999 through to mid-2001 .
They continued to sell in the run - up to bankruptcy - unlike employees , who were not allowed to do so .
Here are the top money makers from the list .
Kenneth Lay , the Enron chairman , sold Enron stock 350 times , almost daily , receiving $ 101.3 m .
It is not known how much he or the others paid for their shares .
In all Mr Lay sold 1.8 m shares between early 1999 and July 2001 , five months before Enron filed for bankruptcy .
Sometimes Mr Lay sold in amounts as small as 500 shares , other times as many as 10,000 .
Lou Pai , a former chairman of an Enron subsidiary , received $ 353.7 m for his 5 m shares .
Ronnie Chan , a director , sold 8,000 shares for $ 337 m .
Rebecca Mark - Jusbache , a director , received $ 79.5 m for 1.4 m shares .
Ken Harrison , a director , sold 1 m shares for $ 75.2 m .
Ken Rice , president and chief executive office of Enron broadband services , sold 1.1 m shares for $ 72.7 m .
Jeffrey Skilling , a former chief executive , began to sell his holdings at a pace of 10,000 shares about every seven days and received $ 66.9 m .
Robert Belfer , director , sold 1 m shares for $ 51 m .
Mark Frevert , chairman of Enron North America , sold 830,620 shares for $ 50 m .
Stan Horton , chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Transportation Services , sold 734,444 shares for $ 45.4 m .

2002-01-19,"Legal action against Arthur Andersen for its role in the collapse of the disgraced US energy company Enron increased yesterday as investors who lost billions of dollars turned their anger on the accountancy firm .
Separately , in what could prove a dangerous precedent for firms , the state attorney general in Connecticut asked the local accountancy board to consider whether Andersen 's licence to work for companies in the state should be revoked .
The attorney general , Richard Blumenthal , said : "" The issue is simply one of trust .
Public auditors have a duty to protect the public .
When they fail in that duty , the public must be protected from the auditors . ""
He said there were striking similarities to Andersen 's role in the collapse of Colonial Realty Company in 1990 , which his office had investigated .
Connecticut has lost $ 15 m in state pension funds because of Enron 's collapse .
The latest lawsuit to be filed in New York comes from Canadian investment group Silvercreek Management , which claims to have lost $ 120 m on Enron bonds and alleges that Andersen ignored signs of Enron 's fragile financial position . ""
No reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts , "" it says .
The Silvercreek suit also names a number of investment banks including Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney .
The Samson Investment company , a Tulsa Oil and natural gas explorer and now an Enron creditor , sued Andersen on Wednesday saying it relied on the accounting firm 's audits .
Legal experts have suggested that Andersen could face ruin from billions of dollars in damages .
The bankruptcy hearing to approve the sale of Enron 's core energy trading business to the investment bank UBS Warburg opened yesterday against opposition from a number of creditors .
UBS is paying no cash for the division and is taking none of Enron 's significant debts on board .
Andersen has not admitted any liability in the collapse of Enron .
An email found by investigators refers to a meeting that suggests Andersen may have been aware of the problems being stored up by the complex web of offshore ventures masking Enron 's levels of debt .
Andersen denied it was aware of any irregularities .
"" Nothing in the meeting or the memo indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected , "" it said .
As the scandal drags on , relations between Enron and Andersen have fallen into bitter recriminations .
Enron fired the accountancy firm late on Thursday triggering a rapid trade of barbed comments .
In a statement , Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay said he had been willing to give Andersen the "" benefit of the doubt "" during the investigations into the collapse of Enron .
But , he added : "" We ca n't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events , including the reported destruction of documents taken against several of Andersen 's partners working in its Houston office "" .
Mr Lay referred to the actions of Andersen partner David Duncan who was sacked this week for ordering the shredding of Enron - related documents after financial regulators requested the auditor 's files as part of an investigation .
Andersen hit back and said the contract with Enron had already been terminated . ""
As a matter of fact , our relationship with Enron ended when the company 's business failed and it went into bankruptcy . """
2002-01-20,"The Enron scandal was set to deepen yesterday as congressional investigators considered legal action that will force Vice - President Dick Cheney to disclose the agenda of talks he held with the bankrupt company .
The chairman of Enron , Kenneth Lay , faced fresh allegations that he deliberately urged employees to buy doomed stock in his company , knowing that its books had become ' an accounting hoax ' , and after selling off his own shares .
Democrats Henry Waxman and John Dingell are proposing civil litigation to break Cheney 's silence on six meetings he held with Lay and other Enron executives to discuss America 's emergency energy plan .
The plan , they say , contained 17 detailed points , all ' virtually identical to positions Enron advocated ' - mostly concerned with deregulation and increased capacity , rather than conservation .
Cheney has refused to disclose the contents of the meetings , citing executive privilege .
There is furious debate in the White House over whether the Vice - President should remain silent or obey the normal rule of wise scandal management in Washington : full and fast disclosure .
Cheney took office amid concern that he was too close to the energy industry .
He left the government of Bush 's father to become chairman of Halliburton , the world 's biggest oil drilling equipment manufacturer , and later returned to politics declaring a personal fortune worth tens of millions .
On Friday , it was revealed that Cheney stepped in to try to help Enron collect a $ 64 million debt from a giant energy project in Dabhol , near Bombay , owned primarily by Enron .
The highest level contact was at a meeting between Cheney and the leader of India 's opposition , Sonia Gandhi , on 27 June .
Emails obtained by investigators show that Lay was expected in Washington about that time , but they do not specify whether the visit coincided with one of his meetings with Cheney .
The White House counters that it is not unusual for Presidents to make such representations , citing contacts between the company and Bill Clinton 's trade secretary , Ron Brown .
But documents and emails show that Cheney 's meetings not only wentwell beyond trade department duty , but also were co - ordinated with the President 's National Security Council .
An incriminating email of 28 June , written by an aide to the NSC , reads : ' Good News is that the Veep [ Vice - President ] mentioned Enron in his meeting with Sonia Gandhi yesterday . '
As late as November , President Bush was ready to urge the cause of Enron at a meeting with the Indian Prime Minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
But , suddenly , the plan was scrapped . '
President Bush can not talk about Enron , ' reads an email , the sender and recipient of which have been blacked out .
On the same day , 8 November , Enron filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission revising its financial statements to account for $ 586 m in losses .
It was also the day the company decided it could no longer hide the dirty secret that it had been slushing millions of dollars to tax havens offshore , and Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to plead for help ."
2002-01-20,"Investigators probing the accounts of collapsed energy giant
Enron are examining what happened to more than $ 5 billion in loans and investments the company made to subsidiaries kept off its balance sheet .
The scale of the black hole opening up looks as if it could dwarf previous estimates .
Investigators are already examining a series of unde clared transactions between the US company and two Cayman Islands firms - LJM1 and LJM2 - set up by the firm 's former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
Now it has emerged that by 31 December 2000 Enron had also invested , or loaned , $ 5.3bn to a number of companies in which it had stakes , according to papers filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission .
These included two ailing firms that had been harming their par ent 's financial performance , water specialist Azurix and the Dabhol Power Company of India .
The subsidiaries - part of a network of more than 3,000 firms linked to Enron - were claimed by the company to be ' unconsolidated affiliates ' , which do not have to be shown on balance sheets .
Fastow 's activities have already forced Enron to restate its accounts so that they show a $ 1.2bn reduction in shareholders ' equity .
And a special committee Enron established has concluded that further black holes may be found .
Now investigators are believed to be turning their attention to one key ' unconsolidated ' subsidiary , WhiteWing Associates , which itself has 75 subsidiaries .
WhiteWing crops up throughout Enron 's SEC filings .
In 2000 and 1999 , respectively , Enron sold ' $ 632 million and $ 192 m of investments and other assets to WhiteWing ' , the papers say .
Enron refuses to discuss WhiteWing , which in turn was involved in several transactions with LJM1 and LJM2 .
WhiteWing lists an investment vehicle , Osprey Trust , as a limited partner .
The trust is owned by a number of anonymous financial institutions - which suggests the investigators will have to cast their net far wider to understand the true complexities behind Enron 's downfall ."

US accounting standards and SEC regulations are as strict as any in the world .
What we undoubtedly have is a failure in compliance and a failure in corporate governance .
To lead on from this to suggest that organisations such as the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry , in urging Government and Brussels to reduce red tape , are doing so in the hope of creating some kind of anarchic , deregulated state of business free - for - all is quite outrageous .

It comes as the accountancy firm
Andersen faces a US investigation after failing to report Enron 's debts .
Gerry Acher , senior partner at KPMG , opposes the plan . '
It takes years to build up knowledge of a client .
Rotating auditors would not benefit business . '"
2002-01-21,"Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm which has seen its reputation savaged by the Enron scandal , came out fighting yesterday , pinning the blame for the company 's collapse squarely on management of the energy group .
Andersen 's chief executive Joseph Berardino said he was not aware of any illegal behaviour behind the spectacular implosion of Enron last month .
The failure of the company , he added , was simply a matter of economics and had nothing to do with the rigour of Andersen 's accounting . ""
This is a company whose business model failed , "" he said .
Relations between Enron and Andersen deteriorated last week when the firm sacked the auditor for destroyed Enron - related documents .
The comments were made as pressure on Kenneth Lay , Enron 's chairman and chief executive , continued to mount .
Over the weekend , a lawyer acting for workers who lost their savings in Enron released the transcript of a damning online discussion in which Mr Lay advised members of staff to buy more shares just weeks before the events that sparked the company 's collapse .
Mr Lay , who pocketed millions of dollars from the sale of stock , had already been warned by an employee that the company might "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
In the online chat session last September , he said the third - quarter results were "" looking great "" and suggested employees "" talk up the stock and talk positively about Enron to your family and friends "" .
Mr Lay was reported to have said : "" My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices .
"" Three weeks later , Enron reported a quarterly loss of $ 618 m ( £ 430 m ) and wrote down $ 1.2bn of its net worth .
Time magazine today reports that a second employee at Enron had raised suspicions about the complex web of ventures and partnerships that hid the company 's debts .
Company treasurer Jeff McMahon is said to have been transferred to another part of the business after complaining of the "" veil of secrecy "" to Enron 's former number two , Jeffrey Skilling .
The amount of cash loaned or invested by Enron in off - balance sheet ventures looks likely to have been far higher than originally thought , with one weekend report putting the level as high as $ 5bn .
The volume of litigation against Enron and Andersen is growing rapidly .
With the company 's collapse wiping out around $ 1bn from the retirement funds of public workers in the US , including teachers and firefighters , a number of states have joined a class action due to be filed this week .
"" We owe it to these public servants to get back as much of their money as we possibly can , "" said Ohio attorney general Betty Montgomery .
Andersen 's attempts to limit the damage from the fallout of Enron 's collapse will face further challenge later this week when a number of top executives from the accounting company face the government 's energy and commerce committee .
They will include David Duncan , the Andersen partner fired last week for destroying documents related to Enron even as financial regulators investigated the company .
Mr Berardino , speaking on NBC , admitted there had been an error of judgment at Andersen but said information had also been held back from the auditors .
"" We have acknowledged in one case , we did make an error in judgment and that was corrected .
And in another case , some information had been withheld that was extremely important to the decision on accounting .
"" This is a company whose business model failed .
The accounting reflects the results of business activities .
And the way these events were being accounted for were clear to management and to the board , obviously in less detail to the board .
But at its base , this is an economic failure .
"" The spotlight is also back on vice - president Dick Cheney who is under pressure to reveal the details of meetings with Enron executives last year , which may have helped to shape the Bush administration 's energy policy .
Democrats Henry Waxman and John Dingell are proposing civil litigation to break Mr Cheney 's silence on six meetings he held with Mr Lay and other Enron executives .
Mr Cheney , it has emerged , also met with a top Indian official in June to intervene on Enron 's behalf over the fate of a project in Dabhol ."
2002-01-21,"A congressional panel this week is expected to focus on the destruction of thousands of documents at Arthur Andersen , the accountancy firm employed by Enron .
The House energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations has scheduled a hearing for Thursday .
The panel plans to issue subpoenas if necessary to top Andersen executives as it seeks to find out why reams of Enron - related documents were shredded at the accountancy company .
The destruction of the documents has proved to be a red flag for investigators , who are trying to determine whether it was ordered by Andersen 's top brass , or the action of overzealous executives in a massive corporate cock - up .
Several federal agencies , including the justice department , along with congressional committees , are investigating Enron 's sudden collapse , the largest bankruptcy in US history , and one that cost many employees their retirement savings .
The tentative witness list for Thursday 's hearing includes David Duncan , the auditor in charge of destroying the documents , Andersen attorney Nancy Temple , and Joseph Berardino or another top - ranking Andersen official .
Mr Duncan , who was fired by Andersen last week , has told congressional investigators he was simply following the advice of Andersen 's legal department when he directed the shredding .
Another Andersen executive in the Houston office has told the same story to congressional investigators , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Michael Odom , the head of risk management for the Houston office , has said that an email from Andersen headquarters reminding employees of Andersen 's document - disposal policy was unprecedented .
Ms Temple , a lawyer at Andersen headquarters in Chicago , emailed a copy of the firm 's document destruction policy on October 12 to the Houston office where Mr Duncan and other accountants worked on the Enron account .
She sent the email just four days before Enron announced more than $ 600 m ( £ 418 m ) in third - quarter losses .
At the same time , the energy company took the first step to fully disclose details of partnerships that had kept hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt off the company 's balance sheet .
Enron subsequently filed for bankruptcy on December 2 .
In a TV news show yesterday , Mr Berardino defended the sending of the email , saying "" Nancy just told people to use their judgment .
She did not instruct them to do anything , to my knowledge . ""
Andersen has portrayed the shredding of documents as a case of poor decision making and has disciplined several people in the Houston office .
Besides sacking Mr Duncan , Andersen stripped Mr Odom of his management responsibilities .
But Mr Odom and Mr Duncan reportedly told congressional investigators that they had never been sent such a reminder .
Ms Temple was a member of an "" extended review team "" of Houston and Chicago officials created to take a closer look at Enron as questions arose about its condition .
Mr Duncan told investigators he did not think there was anything wrong with destroying Andersen - owned documents because an inquiry begun in late October by the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) , the financial watchdog , concerned Enron , not Andersen .
The shredding stopped on November 9 when Ms Temple left a telephone message for Mr Duncan telling him that the SEC had issued subpoenas and that all documents had to be preserved ."
2002-01-22,"Documents at Enron were being destroyed at its Houston headquarters as recently as last week , according to executives at the bankrupt US energy company .
The revelation came from Maureen Castaneda , who was Enron 's director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk management until two weeks ago .
She told ABC News and several US newspapers that documents were shredded in the accounting department in Houston after federal investigators had begun an investigation last October into possible illegalities at the energy giant .
In interviews with ABC and the Wall Street Journal , Ms Castaneda , whose office was across from the accounting department on the 19th floor , said shredding of documents apparently continued through the middle of January , when she left the company after losing her job .
According to Ms Castaneda and another employee , the shredded documents appeared to be connected to controversial partnerships used by Enron to camouflage debts and inflate profits .
Ms Castaneda reportedly has in her possession shreds of Enron accounting documents marked "" confidential "" and dated December 2001 .
Some of the strips contain the names of the secretive partnerships such as Jedi and Raptor .
Ms Castaneda , who said she had planned to use the shredded paper for packing material , is a plaintiff in one of the dozens of employee and shareholder suits against Enron .
Once America 's seventh largest company , Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2 .
The largest bankruptcy in US history has triggered soul - searching in the accounting business about proper financial procedures , the need to maintain distance with clients , and a wider debate on the influence of corporate money on US politics .
Enron shot to prominence as an energy trading company when George Bush was the governor of Texas and Bill Clinton was in the White House .
Enron contributed heavily to Mr Bush 's political coffers , while he was governor and when he ran for president in 2000 .
The US justice department and several congressional committees have launched investigations into Enron and the destruction of documents has emerged as a key issue , not only at Enron but at its accounting firm , Arthur Andersen .
Enron last week fired Arthur Andersen as the two blamed each other for Enron 's financial meltdown .
Congressional hearings begin tomorrow with key Andersen executives expected to appear in an effort to cast light on the destruction of thousands of documents .
Robert Bennett , the high - powered Washington lawyer hired by Enron , said the company was investigating the latest allegations on shredding documents .
"" In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron employees worldwide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation , "" Mr Bennett said .
"" If anyone violated those directives , they will be dealt with appropriately . ""
The company said that it had sent employees four email messages on document retention since October 25 , most recently last Monday .
In a separate development , the New York Times reported an internal Andersen document showed as early as November 2000 that it had concluded Enron 's internet services unit , considered to be crucial to the company 's growth , had poor controls .
There was a "" high risk "" that financial results in the unit would be misrepresented because of them , it said ."
2002-01-23,"President George Bush has expressed outrage over the Enron scandal as Congress prepares to question key figures on the destruction of thousands of documents .
Seeking to distance himself from the company that contributed generously to his political campaigns , Mr Bush said he was "" outraged "" that employees did not know all the facts about Enron .
The president disclosed that his mother - in - law , Jenna Welch , lost $ 8,100 ( £ 5,700 ) after a financial meltdown forced the energy company into the biggest bankruptcy case in US history .
"" Employees did n't know all the facts about Enron .
My own mother - in - law bought stock last summer
and it 's not worth anything now , "" Mr Bush said .
"" A lot of the stockholders did n't know all of the facts .
And that 's wrong . ""
But the president stuck to his guns in his refusal to release details of Enron contacts with the White House aides who developed the administration 's energy plan .
If "" somebody has an accusation of wrongdoing , let me know , "" a defiant Mr Bush said .
He pointed out that , when top Enron executives contacted administration officials for help , all they found was "" no help here "" .
Nevertheless questions have been raised as to whether the Bush and Clinton administrations were swayed by Enron 's political contributions to push the company 's agenda for deregulating the US energy market In his comments yesterday to workers at a machinery company in Belle , West Virginia , Mr Bush pointedly did not mention Kenneth Lay , Enron 's chief executive .
Mr Lay , nicknamed Kenny Boy by Mr Bush , made the largest single contribution to Mr Bush 's campaigns in Texas and when he ran for president .
Mr Bush 's display of outrage over Enron came as congressional committees move to question several figures on the company 's financial implosion and particularly on the shredding of thousands of documents .
Four people have been subpoenaed to appear before the House energy and commerce committee tomorrow , including Joseph Berardino , the chief executive of Andersen , the company that audited Enron .
Another Andersen executive , David Duncan , who was fired for destroying documents on Enron , has said that he may invoke his fifth amendment right against self - incrimination to avoid having to give testimony during tomorrow 's hearing .
An Enron executive earlier this week said that documents were being destroyed by Enron as recently as last week despite an order from the financial watchdog the securities and exchange commission .
The disclosure came from Maureen Castaneda , who was Enron 's director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk management until two weeks ago .
The FBI yesterday became the latest government agency to step into the Enron mess by beginning to interview Enron employees in Houston , Enron 's headquarters .
As Mr Bush revealed his mother - in - law 's loss , senator Phil Gramm , one of Congress 's biggest recipients of Enron funds , disclosed that he and his wife lost more than $ 600,000 in the Enron collapse .
Mr Gramm 's wife , Wendy , is on Enron 's board and audit committee and has been named in a lawsuit by investors against Enron executives and directors .
Before her appointment , Ms Gramm chaired the US commodity futures trading commission from 1988 to 1993 .
Mr Gramm told the Dallas Morning News he did not know of Enron 's precarious financial position because he and his wife do not discuss her business activities .
"" When all the facts are known , people will find she did nothing wrong , "" Mr Gramm said .
"" But this thing 's going to be around for a long time . ""
Because of his wife 's connections to Enron , Mr Gramm has removed himself from some of the wide - ranging congressional investigations .
The Texas Republican will absent himself from hearings focusing on what went wrong at Enron , but will take part in more general inquiries into accounting standards and investor protection ."
2002-01-23,"FBI to launch inquiry at Enron Federal investigators were poised yesterday to enter bankrupt US energy group Enron 's Houston headquarters where a former executive said sensitive documents were shredded as recently as last week .
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer told Reuters news agency that staff from the Justice Department and the FBI were set to enter Enron 's headquarters to investigate the latest allegations that documents have been destroyed .
A former senior Enron employee , Maureen Castaneda , told ABC television on Monday that documents were shredded in the Enron building until her departure from the company in the second week of January .
Consignia staff in strike ballot The postal workers ' union is to press ahead with a planned strike ballot today after pay talks broke up without agreement at the conciliation service Acas last night .
Union officials said they had committed themselves to two more days of talks but would proceed with the ballot of 140,000 members after failing to persuade Consignia to raise its 2 % offer .
Commerzbank stake at risk Cracks in Commerzbank 's defensive perimeter widened yesterday as a key partner said it was willing to sell its stake in the German bank and speculation rose that a domestic merger was in the works .
Commerzbank 's Spanish partner , Santander Central Hispano , said its 4.8 % stake in Commerzbank could be sold to the right buyer .
The move comes amid mounting speculation that Commerzbank , Germany 's third - largest listed bank , may eventually find a home under the rapidly expanding roof of German reinsurer Munich Re .
Lucent loses more than $ 1bn Lucent Technologies , the US telecoms equipment producer , yesterday posted a fiscal first - quarter loss of $ 1.28bn amid a severe telecom spending slump and said it would cut at least another 7,000 jobs .
CSFB pays $ 100 m penalty Credit Suisse First Boston yesterday agreed to pay $ 100 m to settle federal charges of mishandling the allocation of hot stock offerings during the last bull market .
CSFB , which neither admitted nor denied guilt , was accused by the securities and exchange commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers of charging big customers high trading commissions .

Revenues fell 15.6 % to ¥ 223.2bn ."
2002-01-24,"Kenneth Lay has announced his resignation as chairman and chief executive of Enron , the company he ran since its creation in 1986 .
Mr Lay said criminal , congressional and US regulatory investigations into Enron 's financial meltdown were taking up much of his time and making it difficult for him to "" concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron 's stakeholders "" .
The investigation of the giant US energy firm moves up a notch today as Congress holds public hearings into the collapse of what was once America 's seventh largest company .
Mr Lay will remain on the board of directors but will retire with a lifetime pension of $ 475,000 ( £ 334,000 ) a year , according to Enron 's 2001 proxy statement .
His resignation late yesterday comes less than two months after Enron filed for bankruptcy , the biggest in US history .
His position has become increasingly untenable amid an avalanche of damaging revelations in recent weeks .
There is mounting evidence that Mr Lay , 59 , knew of Enron 's precarious financial position even as he was telling the public that all was well and advising employees to buy Enron stock .
Enron 's board of directors and the bankruptcy creditors committee said they favoured replacing Mr Lay with an acting chief executive to steer the company out of bankruptcy .
The decision was mutual , Mr Lay added .
"" I want to see Enron survive , and for that to happen we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 % of his efforts on reorganising the company and preserving value for our creditors and hard - working employees , "" Mr Lay said in a statement .
Congress held hearings on Enron immediately after its bankruptcy filing on December 2 , but the latest round promises to be more explosive after recent disclosures .
Congressional panels are expected to focus on the destruction of thousands of documents - as recently as last week , according to some Enron employees .
But a key witness , David Duncan , the auditor at Arthur Andersen who handled the Enron account , is expected to claim his fifth amendment right to remain silent to avoid self - incrimination at today 's hearing of the House energy and commerce investigations subcommittee .
Mr Duncan was fired by Andersen for destroying Enron - related documents at the accountancy firm .
Meanwhile , the Senate governmental affairs committee planned to question former regulators and other experts on possible government failure to exercise proper oversight of Enron ."
2002-01-24,"A Washington hearing will today try to establish whether senior management at Arthur Andersen are implicated in the shredding of Enron documents at the accounting firm .
Four key players in the Enron debacle will appear in front of congressional investigators , including the embattled chief executive of Andersen , Joseph Berardino .
The energy and commerce committee will also question David Duncan , the Andersen partner fired for destroying thousands of Enron paper files and emails while an investigation into the firm was ongoing .
The hearing will focus on whether the buck stopped with Mr Duncan , although a lawyer acting for the former Andersen employee has indicated he may invoke his fifth amendment right against self - incrimination .
Chairman of the oversight and investigations committee , James Greenwood , said : "" Mr Berardino is blaming David Duncan .
What we want to find out is if he acted alone or whether he had explicit or implicit instructions from above . ""
The other two Andersen employees due to appear at the hearing are Nancy Temple , an Andersen lawyer , and Michael Odom from the Houston office that worked for Enron .
The four executives have been subpoenaed to appear .
The alleged cover - up through the destruction of documents relating to the collapse of Enron has spread from Andersen to the company itself .
FBI agents have raided Enron offices after a former worker claimed that documents were still being shredded at the company little more than a week ago .
The employee , Maureen Castaneda , discovered the documents after taking boxes of shreds home to pack household goods for an impending house move .
George Bush has meanwhile stepped up efforts to distance the government from Enron , once one of his chief backers .
The president said on Tuesday that he was "" outraged "" by Enron 's failure to keep investors apprised of the company 's true financial position . ""
My own mother - in - law bought stock last summer
and it 's not worth anything now , "" he said .
The revelation was viewed by some political strategists as a cynical attempt by the president to show even he had been touched by the Enron collapse .
The beginning of hearings is expected to be used by Democrats to turn the heat up on the Bush administration .
Meanwhile , Enron has been forced to sell its stakes in three oil and gas fields off India for a knock - down price of $ 350 m ( £ 250 m ) to BG Group .
The US company agreed a price tag of $ 388 m in October with the former exploration arm of British Gas but has been forced to accept a lower price after its financial woes .
Some analysts believe a "" fair value "" price of the assets would be as much as $ 500 m and say BG has got a real bargain , even though the new deal for a 30 % stake in the fields no longer guarantees operatorship .
Local Indian partners Oil and Natural Gas Corporation , which holds a 40 % stake , and Reliance Industries , which holds 30 % , want ultimate control of the Panna , Mukta and Tapti fields and are fighting with BG to secure this .
BG shrugged off the issue , saying discussions with partners on operatorship were ongoing . ""
This revised agreement secures strong producing fields at a price attractive to both BG Group 's shareholders and Enron creditors , "" said BG chief executive Frank Chapman .
"" These assets are important to the group 's long - term strategy for India and will enable us to build a material gas position . """
2002-01-24,"Just 10 years ago , Enron was an obscure pipeline company , generating 85 % of its revenues through the transmission of natural gas .
By last year , 80 % of its revenue came from Enron 's trading activities , although it still controlled 30,000 miles of pipeline .
Enron made markets in everything from energy to paper to broadband capacity .
The man who transformed Enron from a small pipeline outfit into America 's seventh largest company and a Wall Street favourite was Kenneth Lay .
In 1985 , Mr Lay sowed the seeds of Enron 's expansion by merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth .
As Enron grew , it became a fervent propagandist for deregulation of America 's energy markets , reflecting Mr Lay 's belief in open markets honed as a PhD economist at the federal energy regulatory commission and a college economics professor .
Along the way , Mr Lay made friends with people in high places , including George Bush , the governor of Texas , Enron 's home state .
He cultivated Mr Bush as the latter rose through the political firmament and the president , before distancing himself from the company , referred to Mr Lay as "" Kenny Boy "" .
Mr Lay and Enron poured money into Democratic and Republican coffers , but especially Republican ones .
During the 2000 presidential race , Mr Lay contributed more than $ 290,000 ( £ 204,000 ) to Mr Bush 's election campaign .
Mr Lay 's largesse was rewarded , when Mr Bush named him as one of 474 people to advise his presidential transition team .
Enron 's generosity came to naught when the company imploded .
Mr Lay 's phone calls to top administration officials , including the commerce secretary , Don Evans , and the treasury secretary , Paul O'Neill , appealing for help went unheeded ; Enron was allowed to go under only months after it was called in by the White House to help it draw up its energy policy .
Questions have been swirling about Mr Lay 's culpability ever since Enron filed for bankruptcy last December .
He had recommended that employees buy the stock in September when it was trading at around $ 20 after hitting a peak of $ 90.56 in August 2000 .
"" My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have , "" Mr Lay wrote on September 26 on Enron 's "" ethink "" intranet chat site .
Weeks later , revelations of murky accounting and massive debts started a crisis of investor confidence from which the company never recovered .
Thousands of employees have seen their pensions wiped out , filled as they were with Enron shares .
Investors , including Mr Bush 's mother - in - law , have also received a mauling with Enron shares now worth less than a dollar .
In response to the brickbats , Mr Lay has indicated that he was not fully aware of the details of the secretive partnerships that were used to conceal Enron debts .
The disclosure of those controversial partnerships was a key factor in triggering a collapse in Enron shares that precipitated America 's largest ever bankruptcy .
But Mr Lay was present at board meetings where some of the partnerships were approved and where a waiver of the company 's conflict of interest policy was discussed to allow former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow to run them .
As the partnerships attracted the attention of regulators , Mr Lay defended them , saying the transactions were fully vetted and approved by the board and had been set up to benefit Enron .
When Mr Lay 's heir apparent , Jeffrey Skilling , suddenly resigned in August last year , citing "" entirely personal reasons "" , Mr Lay was adamant that there were no "" issues "" behind the resignation .
He told Business Week at the time : "" There are no accounting issues , no trading issues , no reserve issues , no previously unknown problem issues .
The company is probably in the strongest and best shape that it has ever been in . ""
Mr Lay is due to testify on February 4 before the Senate commerce committee , one of at least eight committees investigating the fall of Enron .
He will find it a lonely ordeal , shunned by those he once courted and who once courted him ."
2002-01-24,"Top executives from the Andersen accounting firm today accused one of their own colleagues of destroying substantial amounts of documents on Enron .
An Andersen partner , CE Andrews , and Andersen managing director , Dorsey Baskin , blamed David Duncan , the lead partner for auditing Enron , for shredding thousands of documents sought by government investigators .
The destruction of documents , as recently as last week , has emerged as a crucial issue as the government regulators and congressional officials step up their investigation into America 's biggest bankruptcy .
They are trying to determine whether the shredding of documents at Andersen was an order from the top or stemmed from overzealous executives lower down the pecking order .
In written testimony to Congress , the two senior Andersen executives said the disposal of documents by Mr Duncan was wrong and that the auditing firm has taken steps in response .
"" Our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents - and in doing so , he gave every appearance of destroying these materials in anticipation of a government request for documents , "" they said .
Mr Duncan , who was fired by Andersen last week , has said through his lawyers he did not do anything wrong but was simply following instructions from an Andersen in - house lawyer and is co - operating with government investigators .
"" The case of Mr Duncan was clear enough to allow us to draw conclusions about his responsibility at an early stage of the inquiry .
That is not true of other Andersen personnel who were involved with the destruction of documents , "" the two Andersen executives told the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations .
As Congress stepped up its investigations into the Enron collapse , Kenneth Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive from the company he created in 1985 and transformed into America 's seventh largest company .
Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2 after a crisis in investor confidence that sent its shares plummeting .
Investors dropped Enron after it emerged that the company used secretive partnerships to conceal large amounts of debt .
Thousands of employees lost their pensions , filled as they were with Enron stock .
Mr Lay and other Enron executives face several myriad lawsuits .
Some allege that Enron 's top brass concealed the company 's precarious finances from the public , while pocketing huge profits by selling shares before the company 's financial meltdown ."
2002-01-25,"A former Enron executive who resigned last May was found shot to death in a car in an apparent suicide , authorities said today .
Police in the Houston suburb of Sugarland confirmed the death of Clifford Baxter , 43 , a former Enron vice chairman .
He was shot in the head .
"" We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague , Cliff Baxter .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends , "" the company said in a statement .
Mr Baxter was vice chairman of Enron when he resigned in May 2001 , several months before the energy company 's collapse .
At the time of his resignation , the then - president , Jeff Skilling , said Mr Baxter had made "" a tremendous contribution to Enron 's evolution , particularly as a member of the team that built Enron 's wholesale business "" .
Enron said the main reason for the resignation was Mr Baxter 's wish to spend more time with his family .
Mr Baxter joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman and chief executive officer of Enron North America prior to being named chief strategy officer for Enron in June 2000 and vice chairman in October 2000 .
His apparent suicide came as federal and congressional authorities this week stepped up their investigations into America 's biggest bankruptcy .
In congressional hearings yesterday , top executives from Andersen , Enron 's auditor , put the blame for the shredding of thousands of documents squarely on David Duncan , the Andersen accountant who led the Enron audit in Houston , Enron 's headquarters ."
2002-01-26,"A former top executive of the failed US energy firm Enron who had strongly criticised the company 's murky accounting methods was found dead in his car yesterday from a gunshot wound to the head .
John ( Clifford ) Baxter was found by police on a routine patrol in the affluent Houston , Texas , suburb of Sugar Land at about 2.30am yesterday morning .
He was alone in his Mercedes and a suicide note was found .
His death deepens the mystery surrounding the collapse of Enron , which has threatened to engulf the Bush administration , left thousands of workers without jobs or savings and could bring down one of the oldest names in the accounting profession , Arthur Andersen .
Baxter , 43 , the company 's former vice - chairman , was said to have "" complained mightily "" about the Enron transactions which hid its vast debts in offshore ventures and eventually led to the company 's collapse .
Police said yesterday there were no signs of foul play but would not release the contents of the potentially explosive suicide note until an investigation was complete .
Baxter had been identified by congressional investigators as a potential key witness in the efforts to uncover how the spectacular collapse of Enron , once ranked the seventh largest company in the US , came about .
He had reported directly to Kenneth Lay , the former chairman and chief executive of Enron who is a friend and financial backer of President Bush .
Despite reservations about Enron 's methods Baxter , who left the company in May , was among the company 's top executives who made their fortune from the sale of Enron shares .
He sold $ 35 m in stock options , $ 9 m of that in 2001 .
He was one of 29 executives who made a total of $ 1.1bn in the space of a few years and now face a class action brought by former workers who lost their life savings in the collapse .
Baxter , who joined Enron in 1991 , was named in a prescient whistle - blowing letter written by a former colleague last August , which warned the company could "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
The letter 's author , Sherren Watkins , wrote that he had complained "" to anyone who would listen about the inappropriateness "" of dealings with the offshore ventures being used to hide Enron 's debts .
Through her lawyer , Ms Watkins said she was "" stunned "" by Baxter 's death and had received no indication that he was depressed or suicidal .
She called him a "" straight shooter and a man with high moral ethics "" who was not comfortable with what he saw going on at Enron .
The calamitous fall of Enron has had a huge impact , stretching from the rules governing the accountancy profession to the policy on funding political campaigns .
The collapse is the subject of at least 10 investigations .
Links between the Bush administration and Enron have come under intense scrutiny .
Enron was Mr Bush 's biggest single backer during his election campaign and played a role in shaping the government 's energy policy .
As the company began to sink , senior executives made a number of direct appeals for aid from the US government , although there is no evidence that anyone within the administration offered to help .
According to research published in the New York Times , of the 248 senators and House members on the various committees investigating Enron 's collapse , 212 have received contributions from Enron or Arthur Andersen since 1989 .
Baxter was described by another former colleague , Michael Miller , as a "" straightforward , honest kind of guy , very interested in doing what was right for the organisation "" .
Enron said it was "" deeply saddened "" by his death ."
2002-01-27,"International Power , the British - based electricity group , is ready to buy assets from Enron , writes Richard Wachman .
Peter Gillar , the German - born chief executive , said : ' We are interested in a number of its businesses in Turkey , North America and Italy , although we will have to see whether we will be able to pick and choose . '
Gillar said the company was in ' expansive mood ' and had a war chest of about £ 1.3 billion in total . '
Our balance sheet is very strong , ' he added ."
2002-01-27,"The Enron scandal has rocked not only the financial world , but a wider public that does not normally show much interest in ' energy futures ' or ' off balance sheet ' transactions .
It signals not only the biggest bankruptcy in history , but also the greatest accountancy scandal on record .
The cavalier behaviour of Enron itself - in dealings with business , government and the financial markets - is reminiscent of the worst nineteenth century robber baron capitalism , neatly updated with sophisticated modern techniques including a Maxwellian raid on the pension fund .
Enron spent more than $ 2.5 million in America and abroad buying influence in the year 2000 alone .
In the US , many politicians are repaying the donations so there is some cash for shattered staff and pensioners .
Both the Labour Party , which received £ 27,000 from the company , and Tory peer Lord Wakeham , who was on its board , should repay what they received .
But the biggest shock of all is the involvement of multinational accounting firm Arthur Andersen .
Andersen was Enron 's auditor .
It saw the new millennium in at a healthy , not to say indecent , rate of a million dollars a week from Enron alone .
Unfortunately Andersen , once considered a world leader , seems to have missed the millennium fireworks going off all over Enron 's international network .
Enron was fiddling its profit and loss account - claiming false profits and hiding away massive debts in offshore accounts , far away from the gaze of the credit ratings agencies and shareholders .
It was Andersen 's job to spot this , and it failed lamentably .
This was either negligent incompetence on a massive scale - or something far worse .
And revelations about documents shredded , indecently soon after the audits themselves , raise many uncomfortable questions too .
One obvious problem is that Andersen was not only auditor to Enron , but also consultant .
The move into lucrative consultancy work appears to be a neat way of augmenting earnings from boring old routine accountancy .
But it is a direct conflict of interest and should now be outlawed in Britain .
Strict rules were imposed on the financial system after the fragility shown during the Great Depression .
But the modern trend towards ' deregulation ' has blurred many vital distinctions .
Who watches those who watch ? -
Quis custodes custodiet ?
- asked Juvenal .
Do n't ask Arthur Andersen ."
2002-01-27,"Sherron Watkins was in a determined mood as she left her impressive mansion on the outskirts of Houston in Texas on the morning of 22 August last year .
After the short trip to the headquarters of the huge energy company Enron , she settled down to write a memorandum to her boss Kenneth Lay - known to his friend and US President George Bush as ' Kenny Boy ' .
It was something that had been weighing on her mind for weeks .
Now it was time for action .
In her memo , Watkins wrote : ' I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals . '
There was no reply .
Before she handed the six - page note to Lay , Watkins was a woman executive whose every dream as a good corporate high - flyer , wife and mother had come true .
She had made it from a small Texas town called Tomball to the boardroom of the most powerful company in the state .
She had recently given birth to a daughter , Marion , and took pride in dropping her off at nursery school on her way to work .
Her husband Richard was a loving spouse and her sister Julie was her best friend , whom she invariably called for a quick exchange of news each morning on her mobile phone after each had done the school run .
Her house was in the upper - class outskirts of the oil city that her company had made its own , and she was valued and respected by her employer .
But Watkins was troubled .
And the memo she wrote as a result of her anxiety changed her life forever - although she did n't know it at the time .
It turned the unsuspecting businesswoman doing what she thought was the loyal thing , into the latest in a tradition of great American whistleblowers .
Suddenly , the corporate high - flyer was recast as a heroine who stood up to the corrupt , greedy men who had cashed in their shares to make millions of dollars while their deceived employees were trapped in a ' stock - lock ' which prevented them from doing the same , thereby losing their hard - earned savings and pension funds .
On the employees ' website - ' Laydoff.com ' ( as in Lay ) - Watkins is heralded as ' Our Hero ' on a T - shirt offered for sale .
She gets letters from mothers saying they hold her up as a role model for their teenage daughters .
Watkins 's mother Shirley said her daughter ' knew she had to say something ' about Enron 's tricks while they were hidden from hapless employees who continued to buy the company 's doomed shares - ' but never imagined that she was going to be the only one ' .
However , she was . '
Now she 's out there in the field all by herself , ' says her cousin , Joe Klein .
Not until 15 January this year was Watkins revealed to the world as the woman who had warned Lay - the now resigned and disgraced chairman - of major irregularities in the company 's accounting months before the company collapsed into bankruptcy and into the arms of congressional and criminal investigators .
The remarkable thing is that Watkins decided to go into work that morning , expecting to be fired , but instead found herself moved into an even bigger , more luxurious office . '
I do n't know the motivation for the move , ' said her lawyer , Philip Hilder . '
It might be because they have a lot of room there now . '
Watkins - who is not giving interviews - explained to her sister that she had come to the office because ' work is a haven ... because of the security ' .
Her mansion in the suburbs was surrounded by a noose of reporters and TV outside broadcast trucks . '
Here , ' she told Julie , ' no one can get past the parking garage . '
Meanwhile in Oklahoma , Julie had just dropped off her children and while waiting for Sherron to call , switched on the car radio .
The newscaster was talking about her sister . '
I Was Like , "" Oh my God ! ""
, ' she told the Washington Post newspaper . '
I drove the rest of the way home with my chin on my chest .
[ The newscaster ] kept talking about her all the way until I pulled into the driveway . '
As well they might - for ever since , she has been the toast of America .
Tomball is a town 30 miles from Houston , and full of Kleins - the maiden name of Watkins 's mother .
Her Uncle Richard runs a local supermarket , family- managed , in defiance of the megamart age .
Cousin Matthew runs the funeral parlour .
Shirley is now married to the mayor , ' Hap ' Harrington ; she was born there , like her mother before her and her mother before her .
And Sherron 's father , Dan Smith III is the descendant of another mayor from Civil War days .
Sherron had a strict Lutheran upbringing - the family had originally come from Germany in the 1830s . '
Lutheran school stressed that you do your best , ' said her mother .
Sherron studied accounting at Texas University in Houston and joined the Andersen accounting firm , now coincidentally under fire for its work as Enron 's auditor .
A transfer to the New York office was a relief from provincial life , with an apartment in Midtown and summers in the Hamptons .
Sherron joined Enron eight years ago , hired through a recruitment programme as the firm boomed , having conquered the energy industry thanks to deregulation in Texas by the administration of its then governor , George Bush .
In 1997 , aged 37 , she married Richard Watkins , another executive in the energy business , whom she met in church .
She climbed the company ladder to the level of vice president , not quite high enough to become one of those to luxuriate in the slushing off of millions to so - called ' part nerships ' of Enron , many of them offshore . '
Look at that management team , ' said her colleague Jessica Uhl . '
There 's not a lot of female faces up there and never has been .
Sherron 's a vice - president , so she 's obviously not an outsider .
But there is a dividing line up there .
If you 're not part of the boy 's club , maybe that makes it a bit easier to take a big risk . '
Last July , Sherron became an executive in the office of the chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
Fastow is the man who ran those ' partnership ' firms set up by Enron , allegedly connected to the $ 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity Enron suddenly announced last October .
He was fired on 8 October .
Before then Watkins asked to be re - assigned , ' because ' , her lawyer told the Washington Post , ' she felt there were severe questions with the accounting and did not want to work with Mr Fastow ' .
Enron was visibly falling apart , and Watkins seems to have started panicking . '
Has Enron become a risky place to work , ' says her memo to Lay , ' for those of us who did n't get rich over the past few years , can we afford to stay ? '
Watkins was afraid , however , to contact the then chief executive officer , Jeffrey Skilling .
But on 14 August , Skilling inexplicably and suddenly resigned , and his replacement , Lay , invited senior employees to proffer any views they had on company matters , by email , either signed or anonymously .
Watkins left her thoughts - anonymously - in a drop - box Lay had posted .
Two days later , there was a company - wide meeting , which came and went without any mention of what Watkins had said .
She called a friend who worked at Andersen , who in turn wrote her own memo ( which has also turned up in the investigators ' box files ) .
Worried , she drafted her memo , and sent a copy to her mother . '
I thought it was the right thing to do , ' Shirley told the Post , ' there was no option about whether or not she was going to send it .
She knew she had to say something . '
Watkins remains at Enron , and has made no reported plans to move .
But , says Hilder , the atmosphere surrounding her is ' awkward ' .
She visited her pastor last week , and asked to be added to a prayer chain looking to the church for support in their lives .
And there is a chilling twist to the Sherron Watkins story , which suggests that her lawyer 's advice to keep quiet - lest she be called to testify at financial or criminal proceedings - is sound .
It emerged on Friday night : after the apparent suicide of Cliff Baxter , the former vice chairman of Enron .
Baxter had resigned in May last year , but remained as a consultant to the company .
However , when Watkins wrote her memo to Lay , she made a point of telling him that Baxter had been unhappy about Enron 's dealings with one of the limited partnerships , LJM , which was run by her former boss , Fastow . '
Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM , ' she said .
Now , Baxter will complain no more .
Sherron Watkins , however , is still around ."
2002-01-27,"Cliff Baxter , whose life was the first to be claimed by the Enron debacle , left a note when he committed suicide on Friday , saying he ' could not stand the pain ' of the scandal , police sources said yesterday .
The former company vice - president , who was 43 , left Enron last May , apparently unhappy about irregular and possibly criminal accounting practices .
He was cited in a crucial memorandum written last August by a fellow vice - president , Sherron Watkins .
In her whistle - blowing memo , she said that ' Cliff Baxter complained mightily to ( then chief executive )
Jeffrey Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM ' - a subsidiary operated by Enron to pump up its earnings and to hide losses .
It was confirmed yesterday that Congress will take the unprecedented step of suing the White House to secure details of meetings between Vice - President Dick Cheney and Enron executives .
Not even the Watergate scandal brought about legal action between the US government legislative and executive branches .
Investigators want to know how much influence the bankrupt company - now under congressional and criminal investigation - had over deregulation and taxation policies drawn up and highly favourable to them ."
2002-01-27,"An investigation into the Government 's links with Enron auditor Andersen will be demanded tomorrow by MPs .
They want the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration to probe hundreds of millions of pounds worth of government contracts awarded to the firm .
The demand for an investigation is being led by Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Matthew Taylor , who will table questions in the Commons tomorrow .
Last night Taylor said : ' Clearly , Andersen in the States sought to build close political contacts on Capitol Hill .
It may have taken exactly the same approach in the UK . '
An inquiry will prise open the close relationship between the accountancy giant and New Labour , which developed after Andersen was effectively blacklisted from government contracts during the Eighties following its work as auditor to collapsed carmaker De Lorean .
Andersen supplied key staff and researchers to develop Labour 's fiscal policies while in Opposition .
Patricia Hewitt , now Trade and Industry Secretary , was the firm 's director of research prior to Labour 's election victory in 1997 .
Since then Andersen has worked on some of the Government 's highest profile private finance initiative projects and provided audit services for the doomed Millennium Dome .
The threat of an investigation into the relationship between Labour and Andersen comes as dark clouds gather around the ' Big Five ' practice .
Last Friday , the US government confirmed it would review all its contracts with the firm .
A senior Andersen auditor refused to answer questions at a Congressional hearing about the shredding of key Enron documents last Thursday .
The firm denies wrong - doing over its work with the collapsed energy company .
Taylor said : ' In view of the Enron scandal , Labour needs to spell out its links with Andersen .
Labour needs to come clean .
Clearly the House of Commons Select committee on Public Administration will have to consider looking into this . '"
2002-01-27,"It may not be Marconi or Enron , but there was only one topic of conversation in the gossip - addicted world of City spin - doctoring last week : the sudden and so - far unexplained sacking of two of the Square Mile 's best known PR men : Nick Miles and Hugh Morrison .
Both were put on six months ' gardening leave ' after a hastily convened meeting of the board of Financial Dynamics , a top City PR firm , owned by the Cordiant advertising conglomerate .
Neither FD , nor Cordiant , nor the sacked pair , gave any explanation for their dismissal .
In the information vacuum , speculation spread like wildfire .
There was talk of financial irregularity ; suggestions that FD had failed to meet its budgets ; rumours of a bust - up over bonuses ; and gossip that the two had been caught planning a management buyout .
The wilder stories were soon dismissed .
College Hill , the PR firm acting for Cordiant , said there was no suggestion of any financial wrong - doing .
Miles left the talking to his wife Suzie , who said : ' The children are thrilled to have him at home , but the dogs are wondering who this strange man is . '
But the affair will drag on , partly because of the threat of legal action by Miles and Morrison , but also because it is another sign of the malaise that has overcome Cordiant .
In the space of a year , the company has seen its share price collapse as the markets digested profit warnings , news of urgent talks with bankers , and unfulfilled takeover speculation .
Cordiant , under chairman Charles Scott and chief executive Michael Bungey , is in the process of preparing its financial figures for 2001 , which threatens to be a disastrous year .
Even before 11 September the company had been hit by the global downturn in advertising .
A profits warning last month was its third of the year , and not even bid speculation could lift the share price for long .
But at Cordiant there were other factors that exacerbated the global slump .
Some 16 months ago , Cordiant splashed out £ 315 million in cash and shares for Lighthouse , a marketing and PR outfit that a year previously had bought FD for £ 50 m .
It was here that the first strains became apparent between FD and Cordiant .
FD 's directors , including Miles and Morrison , had become very wealthy under the terms of the Lighthouse deal , which gave them cash sums , guaranteed future cash earn - outs , or shares in Lighthouse if it ever floated .
Cordiant 's purchase of Lighthouse changed that .
Most of the purchase price was in Cordiant shares , which were subject to the vagaries of a declining market .
Many FD executives saw their future earnings tied up in Cordiant shares of dubious value , rather than hard cash . '
The problem , as always with a people business , is how you incentivise senior staff .
If they walk , so does the business , ' says an FD insider .
Miles and Morrison found themselves increasingly at odds with the Cordiant board .
They had been taken away from day - to - day business to take charge of a new entity , Business Communications International , which was to oversee the global PR businesses of Cordiant .
In particular , they fell out with Arthur Dangelo , the Cordiant finance director , who , it is claimed , knocked back their proposals for incentive packages for FD staff .
By this time , Dangelo had his mind on other problems .
The Lighthouse deal , in hindsight , had been a bad one ; Cordiant had overpaid massively for assets of dwindling value , and his balance sheet was looking stretched .
That problem is still high on Dangelo 's agenda as he struggles to put a number on the write - down Lighthouse will inflict on the Cordiant balance sheet in a few weeks ' time .
For FD , under chief executive Charles Watson , the predicament is different : how to replace two high - profile executives and win new business in a competitive market , while continuing to serve its existing 260 clients .
It will be a challenge ."
2002-01-28,"The long - running controversy over Geoffrey Robinson 's role in Tony Blair 's government threatens to break out again this week when opposition MPs press for an inquiry into ministerial relations with Enron , the crippled US energy trader , and its accountants , Arthur Andersen .
It was the former paymaster - general Mr Robinson who used his City contacts to persuade Andersen to help the then - shadow chancellor , Gordon Brown , draft his £ 5bn a year windfall tax on the utilities in opposition .
Mr Robinson 's memoirs praised Andersen 's work , which was done for nothing , and prevailed against what Mr Robinson called the "" negative "" reaction of the inland revenue .
MPs on the all - party Commons public administration committee also want access to Whitehall records to establish the nature and extent of dealings between Enron and ministers and officials , after the firm spent £ 36,000 sponsoring Labour events in a charm offensive .
The former Tory minister , Lord Wakeham , is expected to give evidence to US Congressional committees in his capacity as a non - executive director of Enron .
But the firm 's UK links are only slowly emerging , and raising questions about its lobbying practices .
Matthew Taylor , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , will get Tory support this week when he tries to persuade the Labour majority on the public administration committee that openness about Enron 's lobbying is in their party 's best interests too .
"" It could all have been perfectly proper .
But a select committee should be allowed to look at the files and see what meetings took place about the [ energy industry ] regulator , because that 's how Enron made its money , "" said Conservative MP David Heathcoat - Amory , a former Tory energy and treasury minister .
Newspaper reports yesterday claimed that the morato rium on building gas - fired power stations in Britain , which had been imposed when Labour 's Margaret Beckett ran energy policy , was lifted after Enron chiefs met her successor as trade and industry secretary , Peter Mandelson .
One pro - Labour lobbyist recalled last night : "" Enron had a reputation for being aggressive , even more than most American corporations , in demanding meetings once they 'd paid their money for sponsorship . ""
Mr Mandelson later resigned as trade secretary over his £ 373,000 home loan from Mr Robinson .
But in the wake of the spectacular collapse of Enron , amid suspicion of corruption and political manipulation , there is also curiosity about Whitehall 's relationship with auditors Andersen - deeply involved in the Enron scandal .
It may also reopen the question of Labour 's links with Robert Maxwell , the disgraced tycoon whose suicide led An dersen to administer his network of private companies .
Labour 's election in 1997 ended Andersen 's decade - long exile from British government contracts , after the firm had been disgraced in Margaret Thatcher 's eyes for not preventing the US car maker , John de Lorean , from fleecing her government of millions over his car plant in Belfast .
In his book about Geoffrey Robinson , The Paymaster , the investigative writer , Tom Bower , reports that an Andersen partner blocked efforts by Mr Heathcoat - Amory , a professional accountant , and by Sir Gordon Downey , the then - parliamentary commissioner for standards , to trace a disputed £ 200,000 cheque involving Robert Maxwell and Mr Robinson . ""
Andersen refused rather deviously and on rather spurious grounds to give me access to the papers , "" Mr Heathcoat - Amory recalled last night .
He called Andersen "" a very political firm .
They have a habit of backing everybody in order to have influence with everybody "" .
A DTI inspector later discovered an invoice from Mr Robinson for the £ 200,000 without difficulty .
Though his report remains unpublished Sir Gordon 's successor , Elizabeth Filkin , decided it proved that Mr Robinson did receive the money as a fee from Mr Maxwell .
He denied it , but was suspended from the Commons .
No 10 insists that neither it nor the Labour party have anything to fear from the Enron implosion , not least because the firm 's donations to fund - raising dinners were already in the public domain .
DTI officials say that Enron executives have not met their current cabinet head , Patricia Hewitt .
She once worked for Andersen Consulting , but only after the management wing of the firm split from its accountancy side ."
2002-01-28,"As a veteran of Washington politics the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , should know better than to pick a fight with Congress over the Enron scandal .
The latest opinion polls bring scant comfort for the White House , which must have been hoping that George Bush 's lightning war in Afghanistan would override any negative fallout from the Enron collapse .
But the voters smell something fishy .
A new poll by CBS and the New York Times found that 45 % of those surveyed believed that Enron had closer ties to the Republican party than to the Democrats , and more than half said the Bush administration was either hiding something or lying about Enron .
But Mr Cheney still refuses to reveal to the general accounting office ( GAO ) , Congress 's investigative arm , what was discussed in six meetings he and his staff held this past year with Enron 's executives while the vice - president 's office was drafting the administration 's national energy policy .
In his appearances yesterday on the news chat shows , Mr Cheney tried to dress up his refusal on constitutional grounds .
If he gave in to congressional demands , he argued , it would further erode the power of the presidency vis - à - vis Congress and it would make it difficult for administration officials to consult outside groups in the future on a confidential basis .
The administration has tried to distance itself from the financial meltdown of Enron , the largest bankruptcy in US history .
Mr Bush last week described it as outrageous that employees did not know all the facts about Enron .
He also disclosed that his mother - in - law , Jenna Welch , lost $ 8,100 ( £ 5,700 ) in the Enron collapse .
But these efforts to keep the whiff of scandal from drifting into the White House will be ineffectual as long as the administration digs in its heels over congressional requests for information .
By refusing to come clean on those White House meetings with Enron , the administration will only reinforce public perception that it has something to hide .
Mr Cheney has also accused the Democrats of making political hay out of the scandal .
Well , they would be a miserable excuse for an opposition party if they failed to make a big stink .
The Republicans were none too shy in going after Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal , which seems tame stuff compared to thousands of Enron employees seeing their savings wiped out .
Besides , the charge of partisanship is a red herring .
As the head of the GAO , David Walker , points out , there are plenty of Republicans who are seeking information .
They have to - it would be a gross dereliction of duty if they showed no curiousity about the destruction of thousands of documents at Enron 's auditor , Arthur Andersen .
Mr Walker also points out that the GAO is seeking information from Mr Cheney not in his constitutional role as vice - president but as chairman of the interagency task force that consulted executives and others from outside government .
Incidentally , Mr Walker has impeccable Republican credentials , having been a delegate to a Republican national convention and having served as an official in the Reagan administration .
Mr Walker plans to begin court action if the White House refuses to budge , setting the scene for the biggest legal battle between an administration and Congress since Watergate .
On that particular occasion , Richard Nixon won a case against a Senate committee that was seeking information related to campaign contributions and executive actions .
But we all know that it was a pyrrhic victory .
No one is suggesting that the Enron will have the same calamitous outcome for Mr Bush .
However , the administration 's stubborn refusal to hand over information requested by Congress can only sully the president 's reputation and could damage the Republicans ' prospects in the November midterm elections , when almost everything except the presidency will be up for grabs .
A third of the 100 Senate seats will be contested this year , all the house seats , and most state governorships .
The Democrats hold the Senate by one seat and need just six to get control of the House of Representatives .
The results will be crucial in setting the tone for the second half of Mr Bush 's term .
If the Republicans are perceived as the party of corporate fat cats , they could pay a political price for Enron .
That is why even veteran Republicans are grumbling that the White House is picking the wrong fight over Enron .
Mr Cheney was around in Washington when Mr Nixon 's world caved in over Watergate .
He should know that a bunker mentality in such situations does no good in the long run ."
2002-01-28,"The death of the former vice - chairman of the bankrupt US energy firm
Enron was officially ruled a suicide at the weekend .
A coroner in Texas said that John ( Clifford ) Baxter had died from a self - inflicted "" penetrating gunshot to the head "" .
An autopsy had been called for because of the intense interest surrounding the Enron collapse , which has reverberated on former workers , the Bush administration , auditor Arthur Andersen and Wall Street .
Vice president Dick Cheney yesterday reiterated his refusal to detail contacts with Enron executives , opening the potential for congressional investigators to file a lawsuit forcing him to cooperate .
If the General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress , decides to lodge a suit it will be the first ever between the executive and legislative branches of government .
Mr Baxter , 43 , was found in a parked Mercedes Benz on Friday morning by police on a routine patrol in an affluent Houston suburb .
Police have not yet released the contents of a suicide note which was found .
He had been subpoenaed to appear in front of two congressional committees into the failure of Enron and was named in a class action by workers frustrated at the millions of dollars made by executives from the sale of shares .
Friends of Mr Baxter said he was depressed by the prospect of testifying about the role he and his colleagues played in the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history .
Mr Baxter had complained about the murky accounting methods employed by Enron before he resigned last May.
Meanwhile reports in the US suggest that Enron is close to appointing a chief executive to replace Kenneth Lay , who resigned last week .
The board of the bankrupt company met over the weekend to discuss the appointment and are understood to have drawn up a shortlist with an announcement expected in the next few days .
Speculation has alighted on bankruptcy reorganisation specialist Stephen Cooper who runs a New York consulting firm .
Mr Cheney has come under the microscope because of the perceived role Enron had in shaping the government 's energy policy .
He said handing over a list of business leaders he has met and the contents of conversations would damage relations with the business community .
"" It 's unprecedented in the sense that it would make it virtually impossible for me to have confidential conversations with anybody , "" he said .
"" You just can not accept that proposition without putting a chill over the ability of the president and vice president to receive unvarnished advice . """
2002-01-28,"Vice - president Dick Cheney 's refusal to release details of his private meetings with Enron officials to the congressional watchdog , the general accounting office ( GAO ) provides the focus of today 's coverage of the scandal .
In his appearance on TV news shows yesterday , Mr Cheney argued that releasing the information would set a precedent that would make it impossible for him to receive "" unvarnished advice "" and erode the powers of the presidency .
By digging in his heels , Mr Cheney has set the stage for the biggest legal confrontation between the White House and Congress since Watergate .
As Mr Cheney stood firm , the Los Angeles Times sees dangers for the Republicans .
"" Polls are beginning to show signs that the controversy surrounding the collapse of what had been the seventh - largest US corporation could take a political toll on the GOP .
A new poll by CBS and the New York Times found that 45 % of those surveyed believed that Enron had closer ties to the Republican party than to the Democrats , and more than half said the Bush administration was either hiding or something or lying about Enron . ""
Los Angeles Times Citing the same poll , the Wall Street Journal , which earlier made light of the scandal in an editorial , reports growing unease among Republicans . ""
Republic veterans in Washington worry that the White House showdown over the meetings between Mr Cheney and his staff with Enron officials could nurture those suspicions . ""
Wall Street Journal ( subscribers only )
The Washington Post says the standoff between the Bush administration and the GAO follows "" a nine - month effort by Congress to see whether campaign contributors disproportionately influenced White House energy proposals .
The matter has gained new prominence because of the collapse and numerous investigations of energy trader Enron , which has ties to the administration . ""
Washington Post
The line from USA Today is that the administration will eventually give in . ""
The debacle surrounding Enron , which had been Bush 's most generous campaign contributor , raises the president 's political risks in the standoff .
Some analysts predict the administration ultimately will be forced to give in .
White House chief of staff Andy Card may have hinted at compromise when he said on NBC 's Meet the Press , ' There are probably ways to address some of the concerns on information . '

USA Today"
2002-01-28,"The Liberal Democrats today called for an inquiry into Labour 's links with the bankrupt energy firm Enron and its accountants Arthur Andersen .
Matthew Taylor , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , this morning described the government 's business links as "" pretty dubious "" and claimed that Andersen had produced some "" very questionable reports "" backing government policy .
Mr Taylor told Guardian Unlimited Politics that Andersen had issued "" two key reports "" last year which supported aspects of Labour policy .
The first , Value for Money Drivers in the Private Finance Initiative - which was commissioned by the Treasury and published in January 2000 - concluded that "" on the basis of the public sector 's own figures , the PFI ... appears to offer excellent value for money . ""
The second , Not Just Peanuts , identified Britain , Spain and the US as the "" best performing entrepreneurial environments "" .
Its findings are in stark contrast to those of a KPMG report published at the same time , Mr Taylor said .
Andersen 's willingness to help the chancellor , Gordon Brown , plan his windfall tax while Labour were in opposition had been rewarded by extensive government business , Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
Andersen had previously been barred from undertaking government work after the accountants failed to stop a US car manufacturer from extracting millions of pounds over a Belfast car plant . ""
This free work appears to have paid off , because just after the general election they were brought back into government business and have been absolutely at the centre of what has been happening in government since , "" he said .
He added that Enron 's sponsorship of a Labour event had helped to smooth the way for their takeover of Wessex Water , while a ban on building gas - fired power stations was lifted after former Labour employees were taken on to lobby for it .
He added that Lord Wakeham , currently the chairman of the press complaints commission and a former non - executive director of Enron , needed to explain his role .
Lord Wakeham has declined to comment .
Labour insisted it had never received any donations from Enron . ""
It is a matter of public record , both from our accounts and previous newspaper reports , that Enron Europe has bought tickets for dinners and sponsored one event , "" a party spokesman said .
"" The last event they attended was in April 2000 . ""
Tony Blair 's spokesman added that Enron representatives had met ministers from the Department of Trade and Industry , including Peter Mandelson , Helen Liddell and Stephen Byers , but denied they had received special treatment .
"" We would refute absolutely that there has been any impropriety , "" he said .
The change in government policy on gas - fired power stations had been guided by market demands , he added , and Mr Blair had never had any official meetings with Enron representatives .
However , the Conservative vice chairman , Tim Collins , supported the Liberal Democrats ' call for an inquiry .
"" There are certainly some very interesting coincidences here , "" he said this afternoon .
"" It is exactly a cash - for - access problem , and it is on a scale which dwarves some of the problems encountered by past ministers in past administrations . """
2002-01-29,"The Enron saga is threatening to stain Labour .
At issue for the party 's reputation is the £ 36,000 in sponsorship it accepted from the US energy company , now America 's biggest bankrupt .
The cash , according to Enron 's former European boss , was for "" access "" .
The company wanted its £ 1.5bn acquisition of Wessex Water , Britain 's biggest water operator , to pass unhindered by a regulatory review .
It did so .
The Houston - based energy company lobbied for a moratorium on gas - fired power stations to be lifted .
It got its wish there too .
Influence was undoubtedly sought by Enron .
The question is whether it was bought .
Given the blatant nature of Enron 's charms , it is unlikely that Labour ministers were so easily seduced .
After all , the water deal was independently approved by both the industry regulator and the director general of fair trading .
In the case of the moratorium , ministers buckled under the threat of international court action from the Clinton commerce department , which lobbied to protect the financial interests of American - owned utility companies .
More worrying is Labour 's reliance on accountants Arthur Andersen , who failed to spot that Enron 's balance sheet was more fiction than fact .
Apparently dropped by Margaret Thatcher for failing to spot the holes in the accounts of the failed car - maker DeLorean , Andersens was brought in from the cold by Labour to draft the windfall tax .
With hindsight , this act of generosity may appear like a mistake .
Having hammered the Conservatives over sleaze before 1997 , Labour should not be surprised to be spattered when the mud starts flying .
But given the paucity of the allegations and that its potential investigating body is the Labour - dominated parliamentary public administration committee , none of the dirt is likely to stick .
The same can not be said of the Bush White House .
What Enron did at Westminster was utterly dwarfed by its actions in Washington .
The company paid out more than $ 6 m in campaign contributions over the last decade - and among those favoured were President George Bush and his vice - president Dick Cheney .
Mr Cheney also formulated the new administration 's energy policy - and met Enron six times in the process of doing so .
The congressional bloodhounds that sniff around scandals scent that Enron 's donations could have helped it to shape national energy policy .
The White House is determined not to be dragged into the affair - saying that Enron is a corporate not a political matter .
But the investigative arm of Congress is now threatening to sue Mr Cheney , after the vice - president refused to release details of the Enron meetings .
If this does not worry the administration , then the shift in the public mood should .
The latest polls show that the majority of Americans believe the Bush administration is hiding something about its dealings with Enron .
The debacle has tapped into a feeling that the political process is up for sale .
This exerts a powerful pull on US voters - witness Senator John McCain 's success , based upon campaign finance reform , when he stood against Mr Bush in the Republican primaries .
Congress should drop some of its Enron investigations in favour of enacting a campaign finance reform bill this coming session .
Mr Bush comes from a party which sees itself as the political agency of the large corporations , while Mr Blair uses the private sector to provide a bright , shiny gloss to his policies .
But the prime minister should proceed with caution .
Political donations have yet to defile Labour .
If they start to do so , the stain will be very hard to shift ."

Number 10 released a list detailing seven ministerial meetings with company representatives between 1998 and 2000 , and culminating in a CBE in the 2001 new year 's honours list for Ralph Hodge , the former Enron Europe chairman .
Mr Hodge has now ex pressed unease about the US firm 's aggressive lobbying stance , triggering claims that Enron paid "" cash for access "" because it made low - key donations totalling £ 36,000 to Labour - sponsored events .
The purpose was to explain "" the differences in the UK political scene "" to his US bosses , he told Channel 4 News last night .
"" It would be a better world if it was not custom and practice to do that , "" Mr Hodge said , stressing that he did not believe Enron had bought influence .
The firm also hired a Conservative ex - cabinet minister , Lord Wakeham , who sat as a non - executive director on the Enron board , and may have to testify on Capitol Hill .
Downing Street officials denied that Mr Blair had ever met any executives of Enron to discuss the government 's moratorium on gas - fired power stations , which was modified after extensive pressure from the energy sector .
Ministers and ex - ministers admit there was intense pressure to create a more active market , but from many firms .
There was also an environmental case for gas . ""
The change was won by argument , not by pressure from Enron , "" one backbench expert recalled last night .
But the former Treasury minister , David Davis , now Tory chairman , issued a statement based on a Guardian rev elation in August 1999 that the US embassy in London had reported that "" prime minister Blair has recently intervened to water down the moratorium proposals "" .
The Guardian document , obtained via the US Freedom of Information Act , prompted Mr Davis to back calls from Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs for "" further clarification "" to test Mr Hodge 's claim that giving money was the "" most efficient "" way to reach ministers .
"" The question remains whether Mr Blair was aware of the meetings between his ministers and Enron executives and whether he intervened to secure a change of policy _
The PM now needs to come clean about the whole affair and in particular the role he played , "" said Mr Davis .
As the deepening implications of Enron 's collapse and the complicity of its accountants , Arthur Andersen , spread within the US , MPs in all parties are determined to establish whether Britain has also been tainted by dubious corporate practice .
No 10 and the Department of Trade and Industry , where three secretaries of state , Margaret Beckett , Peter Mandelson and Stephen Byers , were involved in the policy change , are adamant that the moratorium on gas had always been temporary , to help the rival coal industry through a bad patch .
They also insist that ministers acted on the advice of officials , notably the director general of gas and electricity , who urged Mr Byers in April 2000 to ease the block on gas - fired stations .
It was finally done that November .
But according to the Guardian report , a former Enron executive , David Lewis , wrote in May 1998 : "" We have a very clear sign from government that at the moment an extended moratorium is the frontrunner as a means of protecting the coal industry . ""
The role of Andersen , who won back access to huge government contracts through Labour , after being blackballed by the Tories , is also being questioned .
Matthew Taylor , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , is seeking to know what government contracts the partnership has won since 1997 , and how many staff , some very senior , have been seconded to Whitehall .
The MP listed Andersen 's help to Labour in opposition , ranging from policy advice to management training and a crucial report supporting the controversial policy of public / private partnerships .
Among the contracts Andersen later won was a £ 70 - 130 m national insurance computer contract and extensive contracts advising ministers on privatisations and partnerships , including Railtrack , London Underground and schools and hospitals .

2002-01-29,"Today 's papers are still slightly unsure about the scope of Labour 's links with Enron .
Do they constitute a full - blown "" cash for access "" scandal of the kind which tainted the last few years of the Conservative government ?
Or is this the unexceptional tale of a company which - like so many others - donated money to the government in the hope of lobbying ministers ?
Yet even as a lobbying exercise , Donald MacIntyre writes in the Independent , "" it was hardly a stunning success . ""
The £ 36,000 donations were peanuts in comparison with Enron 's gifts to the Republicans and 210 Senate members .
What did the company get in return ?
They benefited from a decision which might well have been made anyway - the lifting of restrictions on gas - fired nuclear power stations .
Nonetheless , MacIntyre continues , Britain should n't be complacent .
Our moves to deregulate business might very well produce another Enron of our own .
The Financial Times is rather underwhelmed by the whole affair .
"" Enron lobbied ministers to drop restrictions , "" runs the matter - of - fact headline .
"" What is clear is that the group appears to have gained little advantage . ""
The Guardian makes rather more of the CBE awarded to Enron 's Europe chairman , Ralph Hodge , in the 2001 New Year 's honours list .
It also questions Downing Street 's insistence that Tony Blair had never met any Enron executives to discuss the restrictions on gas power stations , pointing out that a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in 1999 claimed Mr Blair had intervened personally to "" water down "" the moratorium .
While the Mirror says the Tories ' complaints have backfired after they admitted receiving £ 25,000 from Enron during their time in power , the Sun is bored by the affair .
But the Mail is not going to let the story go without a fight . ""
The questions Labour must answer , "" it splashes , before its reporter does it for them .
Labour 's connections with the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen , which audited Enron 's account , are subjected to some scrutiny - as is Geoffrey Robinson , the Labour MP who , the paper says , is "" no doubt grateful "" to Andersen for "" shielding him "" by refusing to hand over papers relating to a £ 200,000 payment from Robert Maxwell .
( Mr Robinson denies having received it ) .
The Telegraph is convinced that Enron 's attempt to woo Labour began and ended with the end of the stricter gas controls policy . ""
Last year , for the first time since 1997 , Labour received no money from Enron ...
Cynics might say Enron had got what it wanted from Labour . ""
But Peter Riddell of the Times sees "" nothing odd "" in the decision .
What is really seedy , he says , is the ability of companies to sponsor political events .
As for Lord Wakeham , who has sat on Enron 's board and audit committee , he should step down from his job as chairman of the press complaints commission until the extent of his knowledge about Enron 's more questionable business practices is uncovered ."
2002-01-29,"Downing Street today fought off Conservative efforts to implicate Tony Blair in the row over Enron 's collapse , describing reports that he had intervened to change government policy after pressure from the firm as "" overheated nonsense "" .
The Conservative party chairman , David Davies , claimed that US information - first highlighted in 1998 - showed Mr Blair intervened in the decision to end the moratorium on gas power stations .
"" It is part of a pattern , "" he told BBC Radio 4 's World at One programme .
"" We have had the Ecclestone affair , the Hindujas affair , the Robinson affair and now the Enron affair . ""
And there is a concern among the public at large that there may have been institutionalised influence peddling . ""
The opposition and some Labour MPs have demanded to know whether the government 's energy policy had been influenced by the £ 36,000 in donations which Labour received from the company .
When Labour came to office in 1997 the party was imposed a ban on the building of new gas - fired power stations but later reversed this .
Enron was a major player in the gas - power industry and campaigned against the ban .
However , the Scottish secretary , Helen Liddell , who was the energy minister at the time , said : "" These are politically motivated allegations that are without substance . ""
Ms Liddell added : "" Quite frankly I find it preposterous that anyone should suggest that the Conservative party can attack Labour in terms of the transparency of our accounting .
This morning a Downing Street spokesman said that the donation to Labour funds between 1998 and 2000 had no bearing on the decision to lift the moratorium on new gas - fired power .
However he conceded that the prime minister had "" taken an interest "" in the change of policy .
Downing Street was unable to say today whether the prime minister had met Enron officials at a social gathering but said there had been no formal meeting .
Mr Blair 's spokesman denied that Downing Street took the unusual step yesterday of releasing details of ministers ' contacts with Enron because it was "" rattled "" , insisting it was simply responding to requests from journalists for information .
However he refused to comment on a US embassy document claiming the prime minister had "" intervened "" personally to "" water down "" the original moratorium proposals .
The document was originally obtained by the Guardian under US Freedom of Information laws .
The prime minister 's spokesman said today that it had always been made clear in government 's green and white papers that the move was temporary .
Meanwhile former Enron Europe chairman Ralph Hodge , who first disclosed the donations to Labour , said he believed the company would have been granted meetings with ministers , even if it had not sponsored party events .
In a statement , he also said that the decision to lift the moratorium on gas - fired power stations had come too late to benefit the company .
"" Meetings were held with ministers and officials on a number of occasions before and after Enron sponsored events at party conferences and conventions .
I am certain that these meetings would have taken place irrespective of any sponsorships , "" he said .
"" The decision to impose a moratorium on the use of gas for new gas - fired power stations was always going to be only for a period of time , as its title clearly implies .
He said he had "" on balance "" advised against making donations to political parties in Britain , but if this was done it should be only "" modest amounts "" , in the form of sponsorship rather than cash donations , spread evenly among all the main parties - advice the company followed ."
2002-01-29,"Enron today named Stephen Cooper as its new chief executive , replacing Kenneth Lay , who resigned last week from the bankrupt US energy giant .
Mr Cooper will take over one of the toughest jobs in corporate America as the disgraced US company tries to restructure itself while facing myriad federal and congressional investigations .
Mr Cooper is managing principal of the New York - based reorganisation adviser Zolfo Cooper .
The company 's long list of clients has included Federated Stores , instant film maker Polaroid , Hawaiian retailer Liberty House and Pegasus Gold .
"" Our focus is on the future of Enron .
With more than 19,000 employees worldwide , Enron has real businesses with real value , "" Mr Cooper said .
"" We will work closely with the board of directors , management , and the creditors committee to develop a reorganisation plan to maximise value for the company 's stakeholders . ""
In other staff changes , Enron named members of the office of the chief executive , which will include Mr Cooper .
Jeff McMahon , formerly chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer .
Ray Bowen , formerly Enron treasurer , becomes executive vice president and chief financial officer .
Mr Lay , who transformed Enron from an obscure Texas gas pipeline company into America 's seventh largest corporation , was forced out last week .
He is scheduled to testify before Congress next week amid a barrage of civil suits accusing him of misleading shareholders , employees and the government about Enron 's financial health ."
2002-01-29,"The wife of the former head of Enron , Kenneth Lay , yesterday claimed that her family had lost a fortune over the collapse of the company and was now facing bankruptcy .
She also praised her husband as an "" honest , decent , moral human being "" who had done nothing wrong and blamed the media for the suicide last week of a former senior Enron executive .
In an emotional interview with NBC 's Today programme , Linda Lay , speaking from Houston , Texas , said that their family had had all their investments in the company and now faced personal ruin .
"" Other than the home we live in , everything else is for sale , "" she said .
"" We are fighting for liquidity .
We do n't want to go bankrupt . ""
Questioned about what had happened to a reported $ 300 m ( £ 215 m ) in compensation and stocks that Kenneth Lay had made from the company over the past four years , Mrs Lay said the couple had not diversified in their investments and had relied on Enron stock .
"" It 's gone , "" she said .
"" There 's nothing left .
Everything we had mostly was in the one stock , "" she said .
According to court records , Kenneth Lay received $ 101 m ( £ 71 m ) in proceeds from the sale of Enron stock between October 1998 and November 2001 .
Sceptical Former Enron employees who have lost all their savings are likely to be highly sceptical of Mrs Lay 's claim that they face ruin .
Mrs Lay 's intervention came amid growing criticism of her husband 's conduct and inquiries about the closeness of his connections with the White House and what influence he may have had on the administration 's energy policy .
"" Nobody even knows what the truth is yet , "" she said .
"" The only thing I know , 100 % for sure , is that my husband is an honest , decent , moral human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong .
That I know 100 % . ""
Mrs Lay said that she could understand why former Enron employees might be angry that her husband had been talking up the company and encouraging staff to buy stock at a time when it was already in serious financial trouble .
"" If I were back there listening to all the things that were being said I would absolutely have to say , ' What is wrong here ?
How can all of this be happening without someone doing something terribly wrong ' ? "" said Mrs Lay .
She broke down in tears as she spoke of her husband coming home shortly before the final Enron collapse and saying that he could no longer turn the company around . ""
He said he had tried everything he could think of and he could not stop it , "" she said , wiping tears from her eyes .
Her husband had been devastated by the realisation , she said .
"" We 've lost everything
but I do n't feel Ken has betrayed me .
I 'm sad , I 'm desperately sad but I do n't know where to place the anger .
I do n't know who to get mad at .
I just know my husband did not have an involvement . ""
Mrs Lay said that she wished "" selfishly "" that her husband had never come out of retirement last year to return to his old job as chief executive officer at Enron . ""
He 's not a liar
... he believed it would be OK . ""
Many of those ruined were their own friends and relatives , she said .
Speaking about John Clifford Baxter , who resigned as vice - chairman of Enron last year and committed suicide last week , Mrs Lay said : "" Cliff was a wonderful man .
It 's a perfect example of how the media can play such havoc and destruction in people 's lives .
This is the ultimate .
This is a loss of life . ""
She added : "" It makes my heart , it makes Ken 's heart ache ...
Had we known , we would have picked up the phone and called him .
We would have gone and been with him .
We would have done anything we could to have helped him , helped his family
but we had no idea
he was in that kind of pain . ""
Mrs Lay 's remarks came as the row intensified over vice - president Dick Cheney 's refusal to make available documentation of his meetings with Enron to the General Accounting Office , the agency investigating the collapse .
The GAO is now likely to use the courts in an attempt to obtain details of the discussions .
3Mr Cheney defended his decision over the weekend on the grounds that it was essential to keep such conversations confidential in order to get "" unvarnished "" advice from outside experts .
"" Enron did n't get any special deals , "" said Mr Cheney .
Although the Bush administration has sought to distance itself and the Republican party from the scandal , a New York Times / CBS poll at the weekend showed that 45 % of Americans believe that Enron executives had closer ties with the Republicans as opposed to 10 % who believed the Democrat links were closer and 10 % who saw both parties equally involved .
Yesterday White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said that the "" drip , drip , drip "" of allegation about the White House links to Enron kept coming up "" dry , dry , dry . ""
He reiterated Mr Cheney 's position that people would be reluctant to talk frankly to the White House if they thought that their conversations might later be made public ."
2002-01-29,"Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm that audited the books at Enron , the disgraced US energy company , today issued a mea culpa and appealed for fair treatment .
With its reputation in tatters , under investigation of possible misconduct and besieged by lawsuits , Andersen 's chief executive , Joseph Berardino , made a public appeal for sympathy .
Mr Berardino admitted to serious errors in judgment when Enron - related documents were destroyed , but insisted that it was not company policy .
"" What was done was not in keeping with the values and heritage of this firm , "" he said .
"" It was wrong .
There 's no other word for it .
But 85,000 people did not work on the Enron engagement .
85,000 people did not destroy documents .
And 85,000 people did not encourage anyone to destroy those documents .
"" The destruction of thousands of documents at Andersen 's Houston office has emerged as a key issue in federal and congressional investigations .
Andersen has fired David Duncan , the executive blamed by the company for shredding documents .
He , in turn , has said he was merely following company policy .
Mr Berardino indicated that more heads will roll as the fallout from the Enron collapse continues to wreak havoc with Andersen 's reputation .
"" We are going to hold people accountable .
And we will make it clear that this behaviour will not be tolerated , "" he said .
More broadly , Andersen has come under fire for being too close to Enron and of having looked the other way despite Enron 's questionable financial practises , particularly the use of secretive partnerships to conceal debt .
Mr Berardino restated Andersen 's position that it was not to blame for Enron 's financial meltdown . ""
Accounting issues did not cause Enron 's stock price to fall - its failed business model did , "" he said .
Even as Mr Berardino tried to gain some breathing room for Andersen , the Wall Street Journal reported that Delta , the US airline , may dump the company as its accountant .
The paper says that Delta has invited Andersen to participate in the competition for a 2002 audit contract amid concern that mounting problems at Andersen could affect its ability to deliver services .
Mr Berardino said the firm has lost business because of its association with Enron , but forecast that it would survive .
Enron fired Andersen as its auditor earlier this month and several other large companies are now reviewing their relationship with Andersen , including Federal Express , the courier service .
The role of Andersen is also coming under scrutiny in the UK , where it won access to huge government contracts under Labour after being blackballed by the Tories .
The Conservatives had taken legal action over the collapse of the De Lorean car firm , seeking £ 200 m in compensation ."
2002-01-29,"Why is party funding in the news ?
Because of the scandal surrounding the collapse of the giant American energy company Enron .
The business lavishly funded the election campaigns of many American politicians .
Now it has become clear that Enron paid money to both the Labour party and the Conservative party too .
Between 1998 and 2000 the Conservatives took £ 25,000 while the Labour party received a series of donations totalling £ 38,000 .
In return Enron executives were able to meet ministers , civil servants and MPs and press their case for the overturning of the government 's block on building new gas - fuelled power stations .
The block was subsequently removed - although the government stresses that this was for economic and environmental reasons , rather than because of pressure from Enron .
But were n't the donations from Enron illegal ?
No .
Parties have always been allowed to take money from outside sources - it 's how they pay their bills .
In fact without donations the democratic process would come to a halt .
But the Enron case does raise two issues : what are the rules surrounding donations and what do the individuals , companies and trade unions get in return for their money ?
So what are the rules ?
The rules governing donations to political parties in Britain are now among the toughest in the world .
Parties must declare all donations of above £ 200 and can accept them from individuals , trade unions or British - based companies ( or , with certain restrictions , the EU ) .
Every three months parties must send a list of all donations to the electoral commission ( which publishes them on its website at www.electoralcommission.org.uk )
Further rules govern party expenditure during election campaigns .
But Enron is not based in Britain .
How did it make its donation ?
Enron made its payments before the new rules came into effect in 2001 - which is why full details of the payments have only just come out .
Had they been made under the new regulations the electoral commission would have had to have been informed .
Are there ways around the rules ?
Only a few .
Global companies with UK subsiduaries - such as Enron - can still make donations provided they make them through their UK arm .
And since donations of under £ 200 do not have to be declared individuals can make several small donations and escape publicity - but only up to a total of £ 5,000 .
Parties can also receive income from commercial activities , such as selling exhibition space at party conferences , without declaring that .
However the rules do close many of the loopholes present in similar legislation in America .
For instance , outside organisations that support party political activity have to register donations .
How much money is involved ?
British politics is still relatively low cost , especially compared with the US .
At general elections , for example , each party is limited to spending £ 15 m and in 2001 all spent less than that .
Most donations to political parties are small and from individuals - at most a few thousand pounds .
This would make the Enron payments among the larger donations .
That said , the electoral commission register lists many donations of £ 10,000 and famously one of £ 5 m , given to the Tories during the general election by Sir Paul Getty .
And what do people get in return for their money ?
Nothing , most of the time , except to see the party they support do well .
That is as true for some large gifts as for the many small ones .
Sir Paul Getty , for instance , backed William Hague because he disliked New Labour , not because he hoped an incoming Conservative government would do him any favours .
Surely that 's not always the case ?
No .
Some donations are made with the open intention of getting something in return .
Enron , for instance , gave money to Labour in order to attach its name to specific Labour events , such as dinners .
These gave Enron officials access to ministers .
But there is nothing in the rules to prevent that and ministers meet businessmen all the time .
What would be wrong would be for ministers to favour companies that made donations when making policy decisions .
And so far there is no evidence of that ."
2002-01-29,"Stephen Cooper , who was named today as Enron 's chief executive , is a restructuring specialist or doctor for distressed companies .
Mr Cooper works as a managing principal at Zolfo Cooper , a 20-year - old consulting firm that specialises in getting companies out of trouble .
According to Zolfo Cooper 's website , Mr Cooper has significant experience in production , marketing and sales as well as finance . ""
He enjoys a national reputation as an effective problem solver , particularly in coalescing diverse interest groups , "" the company said .
Mr Cooper 's track record includes working on several well - known bankruptcy cases , including Federated Department Stores , Polaroid , the instant film company , and Sunbeam , the domestic appliance company .
Among its list of clients were companies that have since disappeared from the corporate landscape , including Laker Airways , the low - cost carrier set up by the flamboyant Freddie Laker , and Maxwell Newspapers .
Zolfo Cooper describes itself as "" problem - solvers with a proven track record for forging consensual solutions to complex business problems among parties who have widely disparate interests "" .
Mr Cooper will need all his problem - solving skills .
Enron was once America 's seventh largest company , but filed for bankruptcy on December 2 after a financial meltdown .
While Mr Cooper 's job as chief executive will be to manage its complicated day - to - day operations and guide the firm through bankruptcy , the company is still looking for a chairman .
The chairman will be Enron 's public face , the person who will act as the company 's ambassador to Washington , where Enron is being investigated by nine congressional committees , the justice department and the securities and exchange commission ."
2002-01-29,"Madeleine Bunting 's article on the discrediting of a "" vicious market ideology "" over the Enron affair ( Fall of the arrogant , January 28 ) carries a message for the government also .
Many of its strongest supporters are deeply concerned about its apparent expectations that the market will solve all .
Most of Bill Clinton 's solutions to global inequality in the aftermath of September 11 ( World without walls , January 26 ) are far removed from an unregulated market - global debt relief , micro - enterprise loans , fighting Aids , paying poor families to send their children to school .
He also argues for expanding market access via the World Trade Organisation , but that is n't going to help the poor unless some of its rules and practices are radically changed .
Bunting quotes Fortune magazine about how Enron made its money :
"" In the end it boils down to a question of faith "" .
Christian Socialists also believe the creation and distribution of wealth is a concern of faith .
But our faith has been much longer tested and is not related to the selfishness and greed of the unregulated market , but to the equal importance of every human being and the need to work constantly for the common good .
We trust the government will continue not to place too much of its faith in what so often becomes vicious market ideology .
Rev David Haslam Chair , Christian Socialist Movement davidhaslam@fish.co.uk ·
The idea of a "" self - regulating market "" and of its cousin , "" minimal government "" , exists only in the minds of economic theorists .
It is certain such concepts never entered the thoughts of the Enron management during their endless manipulations .
The reality is that "" big business "" can not behave as it does without action by government .
Regulation provides the environment in which business operates , no matter whether it benefits or despoils society .
If not , why is the WTO needed and why does business fund politicians favourable to them ?
Companies welcome regulation that allows them freedom to operate and squeal only when regulation restricts .

2002-01-30,"Lord Wakeham , the former Conservative energy secretary entrusted by Lady Thatcher to privatise the British electricity industry , gave the now collapsing US energy giant , Enron , its first £ 700 m contract to build the UK 's biggest private gas fired power station .
Four years later Lord Wakeham joined the board of Enron as non - executive director after resigning as leader of the House of Lords .
He is now expected to have to give evidence to Congressional investigators following Enron 's collapse .
Details of Lord Wakeham 's support for Enron and his subsequent appointment to their board will add to pressure on the peer .
Calls are emerging for him to step aside as chairman of the press complaints commission .
As the row over Enron 's financial sponsorship of both Labour and Tory parties rumbled through Westminster there was also growing concern about the government 's intimate ties with Enron 's auditors , Arthur Andersen , now said by angry unions to be involved in public / private partnership projects worth £ 10bn .
But Lord Wakeham remains the most exposed UK politician so far .
US questioning will put him in the spotlight over the firm 's affairs since he sat on Enron 's audit and compliance committee .
Its role was to see that proper procedures were in place , including legal advice and best audit practice .
The committee relied on expert advice - but members could be held to account for not spotting exactly what was going on when fellow directors sold millions of dollars of shares before it finally collapsed - ruining employees ' pensions along with their jobs .
He may be able to claim that as a non - executive director he did not know what was going on .
A City accountant said last night : "" John Wakeham was probably just a name on the letterhead , turning up every few months for lunch and reading the reports in the taxi . ""
In 1990 , Lord Wakeham helped Enron develop the new Teesside power station - which supplies 3 % of UK needs - by giving financial concessions to four then state - owned electricity boards which went into partnership with Enron to build the station months before they were floated on the stock market .
The station - supplied by a £ 1.3bn pipeline from Amoco 's North Sea gas field - provided the electricity for ICI 's Teesside complex , cutting its bills by 30 % and generated a huge surplus which benefited four newly privatised firms .
Enron was the first US firm to benefit from electricity privatisation .
The other two initial gas fired power station approvals went to British Nuclear Fuels and Powergen .
Lord Wakeham could also face questioning over whether he was asked to do any lobbying for Enron when it faced a moratorium from Labour on gas fired stations , preventing it from getting new business .
At the time of Lord Wakeham 's appointment Enron was delighted that he had agreed to join the company .
Kenneth Lay , the now embattled chairman and chief executive of Enron , said of Lord Wakeham 's appointment at the time : "" We are quite pleased to welcome to our board of directors an individual whose accomplishments are highly regarded worldwide .
[ John Wakeham 's ] unique background of business and government strengthens our board 's ability to assess global opportunities for Enron . ""
Andersen 's close links with Labour , pre - dating the 1997 election , helped end a 15-year exclusion from Whitehall contracts .
Last night Downing Street insisted the review which ended the ban had been initiated by John Major 's government .

2002-01-30,"The government assures us

2002-01-30,"The government tonight sought to bury the Enron saga by explaining in detail its decision to lift a Whitehall ban on contracts with the bankrupt energy firm 's auditors , Arthur Andersen .
The former attorney general , Lord Morris , insisted he was working solely on legal advice when he let Arthur Andersen tender again for government work following a long - running dispute with the firm over the De Lorean car scandal .
And the prime minister 's official spokesman confirmed it was Lord Griffiths , a former law lord and a crossbench peer , who mediated in the long - running legal tussle with the company and recommended settling the case with £ 21 m compensation for the government - a tenth of the sum originally claimed .
The Tories have insisted that Downing Street deliberately misled reporters when it said a review of the Andersen - De Lorean case recommended settlement before the 1997 general election , while they were still in power .
But No 10 has maintained that its version of events was correct and the Conservatives have yet to refute it in detail .
Lord Morris told BBC Radio 4 's The World at One programme of lifting the ban on Arthur Andersen : "" I did it entirely on legal advice .
"" There had been proposals to my predecessor .
They came rather late in the day in the life of the parliament , and the matter had not been decided . ""
But the advice from departmental lawyers was that the litigation , after the best part of 15 years , should be brought to an end . ""
Lord Morris insisted that he made his decision purely on legal grounds , and was not influenced in any way by the company 's links with New Labour .
It had assiduously courted links with the party when it was in opposition .
"" I received no representations , was totally unaware of any Labour representations in any shape or form , "" he stressed .
Lord Morris added : "" I have looked at the files and I am exceedingly happy with what I have seen . ""
Mr Blair 's spokesman insisted the national audit office had found that the private finance initiative ( PFI ) , including its use of consultants to farm out projects , represented better value for money than the public sector .
And he criticised the media for pursuing the Enron story , saying that as soon as one episode was explained , reporters moved on to another to fit their own agendas .
"" What you have here is thousands of words , very little story , "" said the spokesman .
"" We have been open , transparent , above board .
If the answers and the facts do n't suit the theories people want to put , I ca n't do anything about that , "" he said ."
2002-01-30,"The financial meltdown of Enron , the US energy firm , has fuelled market jitters as investors fret about other companies that may have funny numbers .
Wall Street yesterday suffered its steepest fall in three months as the Dow closed down 247.51 points , or 2.5 % , at 9,618.24 .
The Nasdaq , where many technology companies are listed , tumbled 50.92 , or 2.6 % , to 1,892.9 .
Markets fell despite some positive economic news during the day , with analysts noting that Enron is yet the latest excuse for nervous investors to dump shares .
This morning , the Enron effect , coupled with general economic worries , spread to Europe .
The FTSE 100 was down 73.1 points or 1.42 % at 5,058.3 , a six - week low , while other European markets also took a knock . ""
Despite upbeat confidence surveys and new home sales , equity market performance has disappointed , "" said Avinash Persaud , an analyst with State Street Bank , the US financial services group .
"" The market no longer brushes aside bad news and focuses on the good .
As more household names file for Chapter 11 ( bankruptcy protection ) and the Enron saga unfurls , questions are being raised on US accounting practices and interests more generally .
Forget the military - industrial complex , the accounting - corporate - finance complex will hurt your pocket .
"" The financial implosion of one company , even one as big as Enron , theoretically should not have that much impact on the huge US financial markets .
In its review of the Enron case , the White House last October concluded that a collapse of the company would pose little risk to the economy .
But , as any analyst will tell you , markets are as much about psychology as economic fundamentals .
And the Enron debacle has not exactly boosted investor confidence .
Some of the companies that took a hit yesterday did so because of accounting issues .
Williams , an energy trader , plunged 22 % after announcing a delay in releasing a financial report and writing off $ 2.1bn ( £ 1.4bn ) from its telecommunications unit .
PNC Financial Services was punished when it had to restate 2001 results and Tyco , a conglomerate , took a battering after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had paid $ 20 m to one of its outside directors and a charity he controls for advice on a merger .
Suddenly , accounting issues and matters of corporate governance have taken on a renewed sense of urgency .
If companies have a whiff of dodgy dealing about them , they will be treated like pariahs .
Enron will linger like a bad smell as congressional and federal inquiries plough on , so not much help to investor psychology there .
For the US Federal Reserve , which is holding a meeting on interest rates today , the Enron debacle can only complicate matters .
Chairman Alan Greenspan is not expected to lower rates this time round , after a series of rate decreases last year , but weak investor confidence can only be a matter of concern for the US central bank . ""
For now the bears will dance on the graves of hope , "" Mr Persaud said .
"" There will be a premium on surety . """
2002-01-30,"The energy minister , Brian Wilson , has defended the government 's decision to let auditors Arthur Andersen tender for government contracts amid allegations that the company used a close relationship with Labour to overturn a 15-year exclusion from Whitehall contracts .
Andersen was the auditor for Enron and the collapse of the US energy giant has put the spotlight on the firm 's links with the British government .
Andersen had been barred from official contracts amid a dispute with the government over its role in the collapse of De Lorean cars in 1985 .
This morning Mr Wilson said the decision to allow to contracts once more was "" not in the least suspicious "" . ""
In January 1997 , several months before the general election , our predecessors the Tories set up a review to assess the whole De Lorean case , which by then was 12 years old , "" he said .
"" In early April the result of that review was sent to ministers , but no decision was taken before the general election .
After the general election , the report was resubmitted .
Lord Griffiths , the former law lord , heard both sides of the argument and made a recommendation of a £ 21 m settlement .
He said : "" The advice to government was to accept that argument and government agreed .
"" What you see there is a legalistic process which began under the Conservatives and ended under Labour , "" he said .
"" Those facts are freely available and anyone who tries to spin a conspiracy theory around that is barking up the wrong tree .
In order to sustain that political conspiracy theory , you have to drag in the Treasury solicitor and Lord Griffiths . ""
Yesterday in an online interview with Guardian Unlimited Politics John Edmonds , general secretary of the GMB , raised concerns over Andersen 's role in the government 's private finance initiative ( PFI ) scheme to involve private sector firms in the delivery of public services .
While advising the government on whether to press ahead with PFI , Andersen was involved in work on at least 37 PFI projects , from which it had made "" scores of millions "" , he added today .
"" The government commissioned Andersen to do what they have told everybody was a genuinely independent study of whether PFI projects were good value for money for the British people , "" he said .
"" That was produced in 2000 and said that PFI projects were very good value . ""
"" We now find that at the time they were producing that report , Andersen was making a great deal of money out of PFI and has continued to do so .
There was no independence in the report at all .
It was making a report on something that it was profiting from enormously .
Government ministers keep quoting from it as if it was independent . ""
But Mr Wilson insisted that PFI was good value for money and that the government 's enthusiasm for it was not dependent on Andersen 's advice .
He said he did not know how much money Andersen had made from PFI projects , but added : "" Of the professional services supplied to government departments last year , in other words consultancy work , Arthur Andersen got 1 % of it - that is worth £ 7.9 m . """
2002-01-30,"Enron , the failed energy firm , was yesterday likened to a pyramid - selling scam and was said to be possibly hiding billions of dollars of debts that have yet to come to light .
Robert McCullough , a forensic accountant who will testify before Congress today , said an examination of just one of the many offshore entities used to mask Enron 's debts had found $ 2.7bn in unreported losses .
Professor McCullough , of Portland State University , told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that he had been surprised by the sheer magnitude of losses .
The discoveries will make the task for Enron 's new chief executive all the more difficult .
The company yesterday confirmed that it has hired Stephen Cooper , a corporate recovery expert , as interim chief executive and chief restructuring officer .
Mr Cooper has in the past helped to restructure struggling companies including Polaroid and Federated Department Stores , which owns Macy 's and Bloomingdales .
Mr McCullough said his initial findings had confirmed all the worst fears of the whistle - blowing Enron executive who had warned the company could "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
The venture studied by Mr McCullough was dubbed Whitewing , which housed investments in Eastern Euro pean and Brazilian utilities that had gone bad .
Whitewing used money from insurance companies and mutual funds to buy the bad assets and place them into an offshore company called Condor . ""
Some $ 4.7bn of investments - failing investments , as it turned out - were housed within Condor , taken off the books so that investors would never be able to see the full impact , "" Mr McCullough said .
"" Our close review indicated that there were probably unrealised losses of $ 2.7bn in this one set of investments alone "" He said there is probably far worse still to come out .
"" Our review of the single Whitewing group surprised us by the sheer magnitude of the guarantees and investments hid den behind it .
We 're hearing about 4,000 of these entities .
"" Enron 's spectacular collapse was triggered after it announced a $ 1.2bn reduction in asset value after taking some of the offshore entities on to its books - prompted by an outside investigation .
It recorded losses of more than $ 600 m and admitted it had overstated profits by a similar amount in the previous four years .
In further developments , the House energy and commerce committee piled further pressure on to Arthur Andersen , the accountants which audited Enron .
The committee has written to Andersen demanding new information including a list of names of the members of staff that took part in the shredding of key Enron - related documents .
Hearings into the collapse continued yesterday .
Lawrence Whalley , the company 's president and chief operating officer stood down yesterday and will take up a position with investment bank UBS Warburg , which has bought Enron 's energy trading arm ."
2002-01-30,""" Enron Sleaze Engulfs Labour "" : so blazed one and all front pages yesterday .
If a piffling £ 36,000 sponsorship from Enron can cause all this , how many more embarrassments before Labour sees sense ?
The Bernie Ecclestone £ 1 m did more early damage than any good opinion they could have purchased with a hundred times that sum .
It bruised Tony Blair so badly he should have scotched all possible future sleaze allegations then and there .
Well , maybe at last Labour will do it .
At yesterday 's national executive committee the question was raised .
Suddenly for the first time Labour 's new officials are sounding positively enthusiastic about state funding for political parties .
General secretary David Triesman is musing on it - and thinks the time has come .
Yesterday he told me : "" It is not beyond the bounds of possibility it could be done by the next election "" .
Sitting where he does , perhaps it is not so surprising .
With his government up to its neck in contracts with Andersen 's , the Enron - shamed accountants , Triesman says glumly : "" Nothing 's safe .
Our finance committee screens everyone and every company making donations and they do a good job -
but if you are in trouble over one of the top four accountancy firms in the world , what can you do ? ""
Labour hoped transparency would do the trick .
Setting up the electoral commission to record every donation over £ 5,000 ( Labour publicly records every donation over £ 1,000 ) , banning every foreign donation ( the Tories refused ever to divulge their 1997 foreign donors ) and making everything open and above board might have been enough .
But it was n't and the potential for endless scandals remains unfathomable .
Transparency is supposed to create trust , but in all kinds of fields , perversely , it often has the opposite effect .
( A more transparent NHS is often in trouble for adverse public reports from its own new scrutineers . )
Check out the electoral commission 's website and there , with admirable transparency , is every donation to parties .
Some large sums are given by people with peerages , knighthoods and CBEs .
Any connection between gifts and gongs may be purely coincidental but the question hovers for any casual browser who knows nothing about the donor , the date or reason for their honour .
As for companies , any of them might go the Enron way any day .
Most have an interest in decisions taken by one department or another .
The unsavoury truth is that any big corporate player can march straight into the DTI or Downing Street without paying penny - ante entry fees : power kicks down doors .
But these paltry pourboires from magnates degrade politics .
The greasy smell of money oozes through the corporate exhibition stands at the Labour conference each year .
The government of the day always packs in business while an opposition going nowhere gets very few - Labour then , the Tories now .
But what are they doing there ?
What do these Macsponsors want ?
Maybe it is just CEO junketing , nothing worse than a waste of share - holders ' money .
But how do they justify those expenses back in the boardroom ?
Presumably with boasts about access that would make embarrassing reading .
Thinktanks that depend on corporate sponsorship for much of their money are in the same danger : the Fabians were pilloried in Private Eye for holding a fringe meeting at the Labour conference ( at which I was a speaker ) sponsored by Wessex Water , owned by Enron .
Hardly their fault , but all the thinktanks close to Labour
know they get funds because of their proximity to power
and it makes them deeply uneasy .
Labour is n't there yet .
Tony Blair at yesterday 's national executive ended the brief discussion with his usual comment that he was not convinced there was a great deal of public support for the taxpayers footing the bill for political parties .
There probably is n't , but no party has put the case yet .
There are plenty of good reasons to oppose it .
Would it risk enshrining forever a moribund party political structure that has already lost public confidence ?
Only yesterday Labour announced a 10 % fall in membership , now only 280,000 weak .
Tiny unrepresentative parties are the sole gatekeepers and barriers to citizens ' access to the election .
MP selection by a handful of local self - selecting semi - worthies is hardly something to enshrine and fund from the exchequer .
How rare was that election of an independent doctor from Kidderminster .
All these would be valid objections if the present "" cash for access "" system was not now bankrupting political credibility .
Least - worst options are still the best .
Some more timorous Labour leaders are talking of state funding for some functions - but dare not ask the taxpayer to pay for political campaigns voters detest .
But half - way will have no effect .
Only an absolute ban on any donations , in cash or kind , will have the public impact to repair Westminster 's sleazy reputation .
Never mind that British politics is cleaner than it has ever been , and cleaner than most other countries : Kohl 's reputation has been wrecked , Chirac is in deep trouble , Enron will be only the first of George Bush 's $ 100 m in donations to explode over the White House and the likely Berlusconi fall - out is beyond imagining .
However clean Britain is , perception is all .
For as long as parties have to solicit cash , political trust will take knock after knock .
State funding could breathe new life into politics .
If parties were paid not just according to their proportion of the vote or the number of MPs elected , but also according to party membership , it would greatly increase their incentive to recruit .
While fat - cat money rolls in , why bother with the little people 's subscriptions ?
This would mean recruit or die : membership would have to be fun .
A sizeable slab of state party funding would have to be spent on education , research and engaging the citizenry locally in politics .
After the abysmal turnout at the election , the parties are all indulging in ( a little ) constitutional soul - searching .
But they are not very good at it , for obvious reasons .
Which of them would not rather win on a tiny turn - out than lose on a mighty resurgence of public enthusiasm ( but not for them ) ?
Calculations of party political advantage tend to outweigh the general good .
Voters are right to be cynical when lofty constitutional principle at Westminster usually masks low political cunning .
House of Commons turkeys rarely vote for seasonal festivities .
For many of them see how the party funding issue opens up far bigger questions about political parties .
Demands for proportional representation are likely to follow , already supported by a sizeable majority of voters .
Why should the present two and a half parties monopolise access to the Westminster club ?
Why ca n't people vote for smaller parties , at least as a first choice ?
The more people are invited to inspect the peculiarities of the party system , the more public appetite there might be for radical change .

2002-01-30,"How much money did Enron give to Labour and the Conservatives ?
Enron gave £ 38,000 to the Labour party in sponsorship , donations , as well as tickets for the party 's 1998 gala conference dinner .
The company also gave £ 25,000 to the Conservatives at the same time .
Why did Enron sponsor party events ?
Was it cash for access ?
Many firms sponsor receptions and debates , and rent space for exhibition stands at party conferences as well as buy tickets for dinners .
The sponsorship means free advertising and ensures a direct route to ministers .
The cash does "" buy "" access to ministers .
The main two parties rely on such money to pay for their campaigning .
Is what they did against the rules ?
No .
There is nothing wrong in any of this - as long as it is properly declared to the electoral commission .
How many ministers did Enron meet ?
Kenneth Lay , Enron 's chairman and chief executive , met John Battle , industry minister , on April 28 , 1998 .
Peter Mandelson , then industry secretary , and Mr Battle , met Enron and other energy companies on September 23 , 1998 .
Stephen Byers , industry secretary , met Enron representatives on May 28 , 1999 .
Helen Liddell , industry minister , met Enron representatives on February 9 , 2000 .
Mr Byers opened Enron 's UK headquarters on February 29 , 2000 .
Ms Liddell met Enron and other energy companies on April 13 , 2000 , and visited Enron 's headquarters on October 5 , 2000 .
Did Enron influence government policy ?
Enron might have influenced the government .
The first issue concerns Labour 's decision to lift a moratorium on building gas power stations .
But there is no direct evidence that this happened because of Enron 's lobbying .
There is evidence , from documents obtained by the Guardian under the US freedom of information act , that the US embassy and US commerce department coordinated a campaign with Enron and other US energy firms to get the moratorium lifted , and then claimed that Tony Blair had intervened to modify it .
One US commerce department document reads : "" US companies are encouraged to bring their concerns to the attention of the UK government . ""
The other issue is the decision not to refer Enron 's proposed acquisition of Wessex Water to the monopolies and mergers commission .
Again , there is no evidence that Enron 's lobbying and financial support influenced this decision .
Why does Peter Mandelson 's name keep cropping up ?
He took a different line to his predecessor , Margaret Beckett , by announcing the relaxation of the gas power station moratorium - though Mr Byers took the decision to lift it .
Mr Mandelson approved Enron 's takeover of Wessex Water .
Why is accountancy firm Arthur Andersen embroiled in this scandal ?
The company was Enron 's auditors and accountants .
The allegations are that thousands of Enron documents were destroyed by Enron executives , even after official inquiries began into the firm 's collapse .
Andersen is accused of complicity in the scandal , particularly over the way Enron seems to have covered its tracks through accounting procedures .
What are Labour 's links with Andersen ?
Labour brought Andersen in from the cold after the Tories stopped employing the firm after it was blamed for the De Lorean cars scandal .
Geoffrey Robinson , the former paymaster general , and close friend of Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson , employed the accountants to design Labour 's windfall tax and the part - privatisation of London Underground .
Andersen has since won many government contracts .
It supports Labour 's private finance initiative .
What is Lord Wakeham 's involvement ?
He is a non - executive director of Enron .
He was energy secretary from 1989 to 1992 and privatised the electricity industry .
He granted Enron 's first big gas power station in 1989 , and became a director of the firm in 1994 , two years after leaving office .
Tories say this could dwarf the sleaze scandals of the Major government .
True ?
No one has yet been caught accepting cash in brown envelopes or getting involved in perjury to cover tracks .
But the scandal could grow if any evidence emerges that ministers were directly influenced by Enron ."
2002-01-30,"The worldwide accountancy firm of Arthur Andersen wrote an upbeat assessment telling Labour ministers that huge sums of money could be saved through the use of public private partnerships - and thereby assured its own participation in capital projects said to be worth at least £ 10bn .
As Andersen 's global reputation reels in the wake of the Enron scandal in the US , Tory , Liberal Democrat and some Labour MPs - as well as angry trade unions - are challenging ministers to justify the scale of their links to the partnership since 1997 .
Labour had simply "" caved into them "" , the Tories protested .
Labour MPs who have long been campaigning for the accountancy and auditing profession - dominated by the big five , including Andersen - to be properly regulated , also complained .
"" Less than adequate and complacent auditing is the foot in the door which allows these firms to sell other services like tax advice .
But we were told that the [ Labour ] party was bound to make concessions to them , "" said Austin Mitchell , MP for Great Grimsby , who has written six pamphlets on what he calls "" the accountants laudromat "" .
Yesterday Downing Street said it would take weeks to calculate the total value of contracts awarded to Andersen since Tony Blair first won office .
But the GMB union , a vocal critic of the government 's partnerships with the private sector , estimated them to have been worth £ 20 m in the first three years alone .
Last night the union identified an Andersen role in 37 private finance initiatives covering schools , hospitals and roads .
It claimed projects from defence housing to the GCHQ listening post , and the £ 7bn London tube privatisation had an Andersen dimension .
But the main target of leftwing wrath has been the firm 's dominant role in writing a value for money report on the private finance intitative , commissioned by the Treasury , in January 2000 .
Based on analysis of 17 PFI projects it concluded : "" The average percentage estimated saving against the public sector comparator [ what it would cost if done in the traditional way ] for our sample of projects was 17 % .
"" To the fury of critics of the PFI ( also known as PPPs ) the 17 % figure has since been widely quoted by Treasury ministers - even though the scale of projected savings was disputed from the start .
The GMB leader , John Edmonds , complained last night that the government had justified its PFI policy by an allegedly independent report . ""
Yet now we have the revelation that Andersens have in fact made millions from the very policy they endorsed . ""
The suspicion being raised by opposition MPs is that Andersens did high quality work for Labour when it was still in opposition , notably on Gordon Brown 's £ 5bn windfall tax and other tax reforms , to regain insider status in Whitehall .
Because Margaret Thatcher 's government had blamed Andersen - acting as auditors - for allowing John de Lorean to siphon off £ 70 m of taxpayers money in his doomed Belfast car plant in 1982 , it banned the firm from Whitehall work and pursued it through US courts for 12 years .
Labour first lifted the ban in July 1997 , then in November abandoned the court case in return for a £ 21 m settlement , one tenth of what the British lawyers had sought .
It was achieved after lawyers for both sides accepted mediation .
That decision also produced a row last night as Downing Street claimed the legal review which led to both decisions had been initiated by the then - Tory attorney general , Sir Nicholas Lyell , in January 1997 .
The lawyers ' report was received on March 23 , examined in April when the election campaign was under way - then left for Labour to sort out .
The new attorney general , John Morris , obtained a QC 's advice which confirmed the in - house lawyers recommendations : to cut the government 's lossses after its protracted US law suit had failed .
Lawyers feared Andersen would reopen the case in Britain .
Last night No 10 did not seek to blame the Tories for the "" attrition "" in the courts , but said the process had taken time to resolve - straddling both governments .
But the Tory cabinet office spokesman , Tim Collins , said Conservative ex - ministers disputed that ."
2002-01-30,"In order to understand the implications of the Enron connection , all you really need is the psychology of a Mob prosecutor .
This is the point where a certain kind of corporate culture takes its tune from organised crime .
The main operating principle of the Mob is known as "" dirtying up "" .
The thing is to make certain that as many people are implicated as possible .
Not only does this remove the incentive or the temptation to squeal , but it also ensures that a number of otherwise respectable people will have an interest in preventing any disclosure .
A true corporate godfather will have spent time dirtying up journalists as well as lawyers , politicians and the forces of criminal justice .
The corruption must be so widespread that any whistleblower will be accused of spoiling things for everybody .
When a friend of mine wrote a "" connect the dots "" article on Enron for the Los Angeles Times last year , he drew attention to the almost symbiotic relationship between the company and the Texas wing of the Republican party .
Very impressive , I told him , but promise me you do n't think that Kenneth Lay is such a dunce as to pay off only one party ?
Sure enough , and within days of Senator Joseph Lieberman announcing that he would hold hearings into the company 's affairs , it was disclosed that he , too , had received Enron subventions .
And it soon turned out that the Clinton administration , in the person of the president himself as well as his treasury secretary Robert Rubin , had been eager to turn tricks for Enron almost without being asked .
Meanwhile , in Houston , there is hardly a lawyer on the government payroll who has n't had to recuse himself because of conflict of interest .
And in the same town , it is n't clear whether Cliff Baxter , a senior Enron figure who killed himself at the weekend , was motivated by conscience or simple guilt .
He had been warning people that things were going badly wrong , but he 'd also cashed about $ 30 m worth of Enron shares .
A perfect illustration of the Mob principle : anyone in a position to develop qualms can also be reminded that he is a profiteer from the conspiracy .
As for the accountancy profession , it provides a perfect illustration of the old conundrum about quis custodiet ( who shall guard the guardians ) .
Fully implicated in the racket , it discharged its duties of auditing and oversight by turning up the shredder to full blast .
Nor was this some bucket - shop firm , but the bluest of the blue - chip ; the whitest of the white shoe .
To see one of its representatives doggedly pleading the fifth amendment , for all the world like some Teamster 's Union heavyweight from the Hoffa days , was to realise how far the rot has spread .
Men found dead in their cars , secret accounts in offshore locations , hearings where bought Congressmen pretend to interro gate grim - faced witnesses ...
all this scandal currently lacks is a decent moll ; a Fawn Hall or a Paula Jones .
The two heroes are actually both heroines : the chief whistleblower and the journalist who broke the story .
The latter , Bethany MacLean of Fortune magazine , is the very model of the bright - eyed girl reporter .
And that brings one to another element : the almost complete failure of the press to do its job of investigation and disclosure .
MacLean happened to be an expert at figures and the reading of balance sheets : she saw some numbers that did n't add up and asked , just like the child viewing the unclad emperor : "" How does Enron make its money ? ""
Up until then , the whole of the business press had been in slack - jawed awe of the company 's mighty attainments .
And Enron used a lot of muscle to get that little story downplayed .
So the current media circus conceals the fact that the journalistic profession is playing catch - up , to compensate for a long period of inertia and incuriosity .
The law of omerta , meanwhile , has spread throughout the administration .
The vice - president declines to release , to his own general accounting office , the records of meetings where - it seems , prima facie - a bent corporation guided the signatures of government on the formulation of energy policy .
There was not even a conflict of interest , by the sound of it .
More like an identity of interest : an automatic assumption that what was good for one boardroom was good for America .
The president 's lame and misleading explanation of how he came to meet "" Kenny - boy "" , as he used to refer to chairman Kenneth Lay , is - when coupled with his defence of Dick Cheney 's mulishness - an additional insult to the very idea of the separation of powers .
The situation calls for a Galahad among lawyers and investigators , if one can still be found in a system so thoroughly compromised .
It also calls for satire and bitterness .
My current plan is to open a Washington restaurant called "" Enron "" .
On the prix fixe menu the starter would be fish wrapped in newspaper .
The main course would be a garnished horse 's head .

2002-01-30,"Lord Wakeham is facing pressure to step down as chairman of the press complaints commission because of his links to the Enron scandal .
Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Nick Harvey said he should stand aside until the Enron affair was resolved .
"" I am sure he can see the advantage of stepping down voluntarily while matters at Enron are clarified , "" Mr Harvey said today .
Lord Wakeham , who was described as the "" Minister for Banana Skins "" during his time in the Thatcher government for his ability to neutralise thorny political problems , is the subject of mounting pressure after revelations about his links with the collapsed US energy giant .
He was appointed in 2000 as a director of Enron subsidiary Azurix , and was welcomed by Enron 's chief executive , Kenneth Lay , who described him as "" an individual whose accomplishments are highly regarded worldwide "" .
Lord Wakeham has been chairman of the PCC since 1995 and is widely regarded as a success - heading off statutory regulation of the press and charting new rules governing the way the media cover the royals , children of celebrities and celebrities themselves .
It emerged today that the peer helped Enron - now mired in a huge accounting scandal - win its first £ 700 m contract to build a gas - fired power station as energy secretary under the Thatcher government .
In 1990 he was involved in the development of a new power station in Teesside that gave financial concessions to four former state - owned electricity boards , which were in partnership with Enron .
Lord Wakeham is expected to face questioning by US auditors over his role in the affair , as he sat on Enron 's audit and compliance committee , which was charged with maintaining correct accounting and auditing practice ."
2002-01-30,"Welcome to the Backbencher , the weekly insider 's guide to Westminster from Guardian Unlimited Politics .
FROM WESTMINSTER
Westminster correspondent David Hencke looks at the UK politicians under pressure in the wake of Enron 's collapse . ""
The row over Enron , Arthur Andersen and any influence they may have had in Britain is gathering pace in Westminster , although it seems to be going in two entirely separate directions .
Initially , the fall of Enron hit the Americans ; now it has spread to Britain .
The first question is over who influenced the prime minister and three successive trade and industry secretaries - Margaret Beckett , Peter Mandelson and Stephen Byers - to get rid of a moratorium which prevented Enron from getting any business in the UK .
The Labour government pledged to help the miners by keeping coal - fired power stations going and not building too many gas - fired ones .
Enron asked for a number of contracts for the latter , and was involved - along with the American government and embassy - in putting pressure on Tony Blair and his secretaries of state to change their minds .
What 's also provable is that Enron was involved in specific talks at the same time that it gave money to both the Labour and Tory parties for receptions and sponsorship .
Neither of these facts proves , however , that the ministers changed their minds because of the money .
The Conservatives , led by their chairman , David Davis , are desperate to prove that Mr Blair overruled the policy .
But while he may have come under pressure from the American government to do so , it 's a different thing to say that Enron itself succeeded in persuading him .
The other person under pressure at the moment is Lord Wakeham .
When he privatised the electricity industry in Britain , he gave Enron a GBP750 m contract to build the first gas - fired power station .
Four years later he was on Enron 's board on a salary worth about GBP80,000 a year .
He also sat on the Enron audit committee , which is supposed to preserve standards of accounting and watch other directors .
The Tories , incidentally , are keeping extremely quiet about this - they obviously prefer to attack Labour - but Lord Wakeham is also under pressure from some backbenchers to drop his GBP156,000-a - year job as chairman of the press complaints commission .
However , the government has no say in this , because the only people who can sack him are the editors of the national newspapers .
Fortunately for Andersen , it split its accountancy and consulting arms a year ago , and it was very wise to have done so .
The company is certainly in the firing line .
As Enron 's auditor , it oversaw what at best looks like accounting fiddles and might be worse once the investigation goes any further .
Andersen has a lot of contracts with the British government , partly thanks to Geoffrey Robinson , and they could be the main casualty of this affair .
As for the Labour party , it could get off the hook if there is no real proof of any influence , but if any evidence does turn up Labour is in great trouble .
All three ministers , and even the prime minister himself , could be called to account . ""
NEWS ROUND - UP
The energy minister , Brian Wilson , defends the government 's decision to allow Arthur Andersen to tend for contracts once more as "" not in the least suspicious "" .
The government 's proposal for only 20 % of the House of Lords to be elected is "" unlikely to change "" , Lord Irvine warned last night , despite widespread criticism Labour peer and government adviser Lord Haskins today said he would like to see his party announce it would no longer accept corporate donations .
As the people of Derry today marked the 30th anniversary of Bloody Sunday , the Northern Ireland secretary , John Reid , said the province must not be shackled by its past .
Brynle Williams , who led fuel protests in 2000 , is to stand as a Conservative candidate at the next Welsh assembly election .
QUESTION TIME Iain Duncan Smith tackles the government again on the health service .
THE FLOATING VOTER
Our man on the sofa investigates the ethics of the Enron affair .
What exactly did happen when Enron executives met with members of her majesty 's government ?
There has been no shortage of rumours this week , with Newsnight suggesting there might have been some currying of favour , newspapers implying a surreptitious awarding of contracts , and This Morning reporting that autumn fashion tips ( beige , not ochre ) were exchanged behind closed doors .
Now it is obvious that there is something highly dubious about any government minister who purports to be involved in energy policy ( Peter , that means you ) meeting with companies involved in the energy sector and talking about energy .
It 's almost like a journalist checking their sources before writing an article , which , as we 're all aware , is a quaint , but increasingly out - of - date practice .
It is of the utmost importance ( apologies for the fruity language , by the way - I could n't sleep last night and caught Andrew Neil on Despatch Box ) that this sort of behaviour does n't happen in future .
And that any meetings between industry and government should be conducted while wearing big hats in a shady alley in order to keep their garish dealings out of the full view of the public .
What 's more , instead of tarnishing the party 's image by making donations , companies should instead be forced to pay individuals , and show their disdain for the process by putting all money into unmarked brown envelopes .
These measures may seem draconian .
But when the cost is democracy , no price is too great .
OLD HAUNTS
The golden jubilee may bring joy to the nation 's hearts , but the Backbencher understands that the planned celebrations present one former prime minister with a tricky problem .
John Major left No 10 in the early hours of May 2 1997 and vowed never to return .
He believes it is important that the building is left clear for his successors , and so far he has lived up to his promise .
But Mr Major 's name heads the guest list for a Downing Street golden jubilee dinner on April 29 - along with the Queen , the prime minister , Lady Thatcher and Sir Edward Heath .
How can he refuse to attend ?
The Backbencher will be watching carefully .
THE STATUE SAGA , PART CXVIII
The Backbencher is reluctant to add to the long - running debate about the siting of Baroness Thatcher 's statue , but she did note that Romford MP Andrew Rosindell has weighed into the debate with an early day motion on the subject .
Andrew wants the statue to be installed in the member 's lobby on the anniversary of the liberation of the Falklands .
But the Backbencher has a better idea .
Why not present it as a gift to the grateful people of the Islands ?
Troops still on the islands 20 years after the battle might benefit from a reminder of why they are there .
Speaking of EDMs , the winner of this week 's early day motion of the week award is Tony Banks , who calls on the Afghan government to "" honour the memory of the poor , mutilated creature "" - Marjan the lion , late of Kabul zoo - "" by banning cock - fighting and dog - fighting "" .
Rumours that Mr Banks wants to replace one of the lions in Trafalgar Square with a marble Marjan are entirely unfounded .

DIRTY SECRETS Lucky Peter Ainsworth ( Conservative , East Surrey ) made page two of the Express today , next to "" The Pop Idols as you 've never seen them before "" and a mugshot of David Blunkett .
This had nothing to do with his duties as environment spokesman , and everything to do with a shocking outburst by Mr Ainsworth : "" I read the Express for its lively and varied coverage of the news and for opinions I do n't necessarily share . ""

THIS WEEK 'S COMPETITION Congratulations to Rene Kinzett , the winner of last week 's competition , who explained that a miscount and the Speaker 's subsequent obligation to vote with the government marred John Smith 's 1993 triumph in the Commons , when he almost brought down the Conservative government .
Thanks also to the readers who sent in pictures of themselves - and friends - with fibreglass cows and fish in the US .
Clearly , life - sized ruminants painted in bright colours are indeed a tourist attraction , and the Backbencher 's cynicism was quite unfounded .
Thanks , also , to the reader who has spotted two of the beasts already in London : a blue - and - white spotted bull on the north - west corner of Red Lion Square in Holborn , and another ( presumably suffering from rigor mortis ) "" somewhere near Smithfield "" .
This week 's prize is a copy of Jeremy Thorpe 's memoirs
In My Own Time ( courtesy of Politico 's Bookshop ) .
To win it , remind the Backbencher of a name the former Liberal leader seems to have left out of his book - that of a certain Great Dane , shot on Bodmin Moor in 1975 .
Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk .
WHERE THERE IS DISCORD
"" I wanted to write one more book , "" explains the author of a bulky new volume out in April .
"" If we wish to make our achievements secure for our children and grandchildren .... "" Can you guess who it is yet ? "" ... the west must stay vigilant and strong .
In this book it will be my purpose to show how that can - and must - be done "" .
Devotees can already admire the cover and pre - order a copy here .
In the meantime , the Backbencher invites suggestions for the opening sentence of Statecraft : Strategies for a Changing World .
The best effort will win a dollar bill , which is probably quite a lot less than the Baroness earned from her lecture tours last year .
Unfortunately , the register of Lords ' interests seems to have overlooked her entirely , but we assume this is merely an oversight .
One other thing - the Backbencher is naturally flattered that the relaunched Thatcherweb.com chose to quote her on its front page , but she fears the words "" startling website ... extremely comprehensive "" may have been taken out of context .
TIME FOR A WHIP - ROUND A date for your diary .
Jonathan Aitken , who is now studying theology at Wycliffe Hall , will be talking about prison , power and God in Oxford tomorrow .
The Theology Society hopes the talk will attract an audience "" interested in theology and politics "" .
Do go along and tell the Backbencher how it went , especially if Jonathan endorses Oliver Letwin 's doubts about the efficacy of prison sentences .
It 's at 8.30pm , Keble College , and we hope Jonathan will be passing round the collection plate afterwards .

Lord Powell of Bayswater has advised Margaret Thatcher , John Major and Tony Blair on foreign affairs .
He talked to Julian Glover about the impact of September 11 on foreign policy and the changing shape of government under New Labour .
Read the interview here .
We asked the Guardian and Observer 's renowned team of columnists and political specialists to share the contents of their bookshelves .
Here 's what they told us ."
2002-01-30,"The Enron scandal has prompted accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers to accelerate plans for a "" global and rapid "" flotation of its consultancy division , which could be valued at more than £ 5bn .
According to an "" internal communication "" which was obtained by a City newswire service yesterday , Britain 's biggest accountancy firm is keen to divide its auditing and consulting arms imminently .
PricewaterhouseCoopers was not involved in the collapse of Enron .
However , the affair raised renewed concern in the financial world about big accountancy firms carrying out lucrative consulting work for companies at the same time as auditing them .
The decision is reported to have been announced by PwC 's chief executive Sam DiPiazza at a meeting of senior partners on Saturday , although AFX News said it was yet to be endorsed by the firm 's main board .
A PwC spokeswoman last night confirmed that PwC had been exploring plans for a separation of its consultancy business .
But she said suggestions of an imminent flotation were "" rumour and speculation "" .
PwC audits more than 40 % of the companies in the FTSE 100 index .
The company 's consultancy arm had worldwide revenue of $ 6.7bn ( £ 4.7bn ) last year ."
2002-01-30,"In editing Irwin Stelzer 's Enron article , page 16 ( Comment ) , yesterday , we deleted a sentence in which Dr Stelzer made perfectly clear the fact that he served on an Enron advisory board .
Dr Stelzer has pointed out that he is always scrupulous in naming clients who might have an interest in the subjects of his writings and speeches .
We are sorry that we deleted his usual declaration of interest in this case .
We should no longer in a current context (
Spreading the pain , page 17 , January 23 ) be referring to the Royal Ulster Constabulary .
The name was changed to the Police Service of Northern Ireland in November last year .
Malin Head ( Worst storm in a decade ... , page 9 , yesterday ) is in Co Donegal in the Republic of Ireland , not Northern Ireland .
A table accompanying the report headed Labour inquest on membership loss , page 10 , yesterday , gave incorrect figures for RSPB membership , making it appear that there had been a fall in membership between 2000 and 2001 .
This was not the case , as the correct figures show : 1996 : 925,000 ; 2000 : 1.004 m ; 2001 : 1.011 m ; 2002 : 1.019 m .
The photograph captioned Doon Mackichan , in our two - minute Guardian , page 2 , January 28 , in fact showed Fiona Allen .
Both appeared in their correct identities , with Sally Phillips , the third star of Smack the Pony , in the picture on pages 6 and 7 , G2 .
A caption on page 9 , G2 , January 25 , identified Alanis Morissette among those at a Versace show in Paris .
Ms Morissette was , in fact , in Manchester at the time the picture was taken ( promoting her new album Under Rug Swept ) .
The person in our picture was Verity Hawkes .
The film still captioned Frank Thring as Herod in the 1961 film King of Kings , page 5 , January 26 , in fact showed him in the role of Herod Antipas , and not Herod the Great to whom the accompanying report referred .
Herod the Great was played by Grégoire Aslan .

2002-01-30,"Lord Haskins , a Labour peer and chairman of Northern Foods , today said he would like to see his party announce it would no longer accept corporate donations - including donations from trade unions .
His remarks follow the controversial relevations earlier this week that both Labour and Conservatives had received money from bankrupt US energy firm Enron .
Although has personally giving substantial sums to Labour he has refused to allow his company to make political donations .
Asked if the party should refuse corporate donations , he told the BBC : "" Left to me , I would prefer that , I have to say , but then it raises the question of trade union donations . ""
"" What 's the difference between a corporate trade union donor and a corporate business donor ?
In an ideal world , I would prefer that neither applied . ""
Labour backbencher David Taylor said state funding of political parties would reduce the problems caused by corporate donations .
"" Funding by the taxpayer to a limited extent may be ought to be piloted for a period , "" he argued .
"" Some change , some new framework , within which the taxpayer can support a proportion of the costs of all parties , including minority parties , would be good . """

2002-01-31,"Credit Suisse Group today warned of a sharp fall in profits for 2001 as the Swiss financial giant was hit by restructuring costs and losses related to Enron and Argentina .
Profits last year came to $ 940 m ( £ 665,394 ) , down from profits of $ 3.5bn ( £ 2.5bn ) in 2000 .
Credit Suisse was hit by heavy losses at its investment banking arm , Credit Suisse First Boston .
CSFB expects to report a net loss of approximately $ 961 m for the full year , with a loss of $ 1bn in the fourth quarter alone .
CSFB has taken a charge of $ 745 m for restructuring and cost - reduction initiatives , as well as about $ 100 m for a settlement reached with the US securities and exchange commission following an investigation into how the company handled sales of new share offerings .
CSFB also had pre - tax losses of $ 213 m from the situation in Argentina and $ 126 m stemming from the meltdown of Enron , the US energy company .
A Credit Suisse official said the figures had been released earlier than expected to warn investors who were not expecting the higher costs and provisions .
Full figures are to be released on March 12 . ""
Since the market was not aware of the additional costs and provisions , we wanted to provide this information as soon possible , "" the official said ."

The Bush administration said it would fight the legal case .
Congressmen have warned the White House that it risks the appearance of wrongdoing , even if there is none , if it keeps the details secret .
The GAO has given Mr Cheney notice that it is seeking papers detailing the contacts with Enron and will go to a full - scale hearing if necessary .
Mr Cheney has acknowledged meetings with executives a number of times to discuss the government 's energy policy .

Mr Cheney has argued that giving up details of the conversations would irreparably damage ties with business .
"" It would make it virtually impossible for me to have confidential conversations with anybody , "" he said at the weekend .
"" You just can not accept that proposition without putting a chill over the ability of the president and vice - president to receive unvarnished advice "" .

2002-01-31,"Pressure was mounting yesterday on Lord Wakeham to resign as chairman of the press complaints commission as British and US trade unions insisted that he must answer tough questions over his role in Enron 's multi - billion dollar collapse .
At his London home last night , Lord Wakeham , who has said he will give evidence to congressional investigators , would only offer a terse "" I am not saying anything "" .
But the American equivalent of the TUC , the AFL - CIO , which has seen thousands of its members lose their jobs and pensions in the Enron scandal , has written to all companies of which the Tory peer is a director saying it believes he is not a fit person to serve on their boards .
Damon Silvers , head of the AFL - CIO 's legal affairs department , predicited that Lord Wakeham was likely to face civil actions in the US from disgruntled investors .
"" I think it 's a virtual certainty .
He has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits already brought by shareholders , "" he told Radio 4 's World at One .
He also said that Lord Wakeham - a professional accountant and former energy secretary - should not be renominated to Enron 's board . ""
Unless Lord Wakeham can show something which he has n't shown thus far , that he took meaningful steps to protect Enron and its investors as the company collapsed
, he is really not fit to be a steward of investors ' money as a member of the board , "" he said .
Labour ministers came under pressure from British unions yesterday to explain their close collaboration with Enron 's accountants , Arthur Andersen , in promoting the controversial public private partnerships from which Andersen stood to benefit financially .
Tony Blair was challenged at Commons question time over a pro - PPP report written for ministers by Andersen which predicted 17 % savings from such schemes .
Mr Blair argued that rival accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers had also backed PPP .
The GMB general union retaliated that PwC 's analysis was also compromised by financial interests in PPP .
Critics of the "" big five "" global accountancy firms say they are beyond effective regulation .
The Lib Dems also called for Lord Wakeham to stand aside from the press complaints commission and accused ministers of "" ducking and diving "" over Andersen 's role in government policy making ."

The general accounting office , the investigative arm of Congress , took the unprecedented step after Mr Cheney refused to surrender details of meetings he held with Enron over the past 12 months .
The Bush administration vowed to fight the legal case and said earlier this week the accounting office was overstepping its bounds .
Members of Congress have warned the White House that it risks the appearance of wrongdoing , even if there is none , if it keeps the contents of the meetings secret .
The accounting office has given Mr Cheney notice that it is seeking papers detailing contacts with Enron and will go to a full - scale hearing if necessary .
Mr Cheney has acknowledged meeting executives a number of times to discuss the formation of the government 's energy policy .
The accounting office wants a list of individuals who met with the energy taskforce , as well as the subject and location of the meetings and how much they cost .
Mr Cheney has argued that giving up details of the conversations would irreparably damage the administration 's relationship with the business community .
"" It would make it virtually impossible for me to have confidential conversations with anybody , "" he said at the weekend .
"" You just can not accept that proposition without putting a chill over the ability of the president and vice - president to receive unvarnished advice . ""
President Bush has backed Mr Cheney 's decision to keep the details private .
"" It 's not only important for us , for this administration , it 's an important principle for future administrations , "" he said .
Enron spent millions of dollars supporting a vast network of politicians and was Mr Bush 's chief backer in last year 's election campaign .
Other members of the admin istration who received money from Enron included the attorney general , John Ashcroft , who excused himself from the investigation into the events that led to the company 's fall .
There are 12 congressional committees looking into the scandal , as well as the FBI and the financial regulator , the securities and exchange commission ."
2002-01-31,"Lord Wakeham today stepped aside as chairman of the press complaints commission in order to answer questions about his involvement with the collapsed energy giant Enron .
The peer announced the temporary move "" as a matter of honour "" while his links to Enron were being probed by investigators in the US .
Lord Wakeham said he wanted to protect the PCC from damaging speculation during the inquiry into the firm 's multibillion dollar bankruptcy .
A former energy minister under Lady Thatcher who later joined Enron as a non - executive director
, he has faced demands this week to explain his role .
He said in a statement : "" As chairman of the press complaints commission for the past seven years , I am only too aware of the damage that can be done to individuals and institutions that are thrust into the public spotlight . ""
Since the collapse of Enron , I have been unable to make any statement or undertake any interviews on the subject for legal reasons .
I am conscious that some see this position as incompatible with the chairmanship of the commission .
"" I am very proud of everything we have achieved at the PCC and do not wish it to be damaged by continuing short - term speculation .
"" I therefore see it as a matter of honour to stand aside temporarily from the chairmanship of the commission until the report of the independent investigating committee of Enron is published and evaluated .
"" I am co - operating actively with these inquiries .
I will not be making any further statement . ""
Lord Wakeham 's decision follows calls yesterday from the Liberal Democrats for him to step aside from the PCC , which he has headed since 1995 .
Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Nick Harvey yesterday called for the PCC chief to stand aside until the Enron affair was resolved ."
2002-01-31,"Newspaper editors and politicians have welcomed Lord Wakeham 's decision to stand aside as the chairman of the press complaints commission pending an investigation into his involvement with Enron .
Many believe the probe into the collapse of the US energy giant will take months or even years , meaning Lord Wakeham is unlikely to return to the post .
"" I do n't think he had much choice but to step down but we have to remember he has not been accused of any wrongdoing , "" said the Mirror editor , Piers Morgan .
"" He 's done a brilliant job at the PCC and I for one will miss him . ""
Morgan added : "" I hope to see him back at the PCC but Enron is a very messy business and he 's a realist .
If he 's detached from the industry for too long that may not be a possibility . ""
The Sun editor , David Yelland , also welcomed the decision , saying Lord Wakeham had "" acted in exactly the way those who know him would expect .
With honour . ""
The Liberal Democrat culture spokesman , Nick Harvey , said the Conservative peer had done the right thing .
"" Things can erupt very quickly in the press and he could be called upon to take some decisions it would n't be appropriate for him to take , on Enron , for example . ""
He ca n't really be taking decisions of that nature , "" he said .
Although most in the industry believe Lord Wakeham had no choice but to stand aside , there are concerns about who could succeed him .
Many politicians believe the PCC treated the press too leniently under Lord Wakeham and any successor will be pressed to introduce a harsher regime ."
2002-01-31,"· "" Why is Enron a problem for conservatives ? "" wonders respected economist Paul Krugman .
The answer is : because it makes them look stupid . ""
After all that effort to convince people that the private sector can police itself , the most admired company in America turns out to have been a giant Ponzi scheme - and the most respected accounting firm turns out to have been an accomplice . ""
The latest defence by the right is that Enron - despite its voodoo accounting - heroically opened up regulated energy markets and drove down prices for ordinary consumers .
But even this claim looks flimsy .
The Houston Chronicle reveals that Enron may have inflated electricity prices in order to boost earnings : within days of Enron 's bankruptcy , long - term power prices fell by 30 % .
And when UBS Warburg won its bid for Enron 's energy trading business - the unit that led the heroic fight for lower prices - it did n't pay a cent up - front a miserable price tag for a supposedly robust operation ?

2002-02-01,"Arthur Andersen One of the "" big give "" accountancy firms , the company audited Enron .
Andersen has come under fire for being too close to Enron and of having looked the other way despite Enron 's questionable financial practises , particularly the use of secretive partnerships to conceal debt .
In February 2001 , Andersen discussed whether to retain Enron as a client amid concern over Enron 's use of those partnerships .
Andersen decided to stick with Enron because of the prospect of lucrative fees .
Andersen has also attracted controversy in the UK , where the Tories have accused Labour of giving business to the firm in exchange for free advice and political donations .
Labour brought Andersen in from the cold after the Tories stopped employing the firm when it was blamed for the De Lorean cars scandal .
Geoffrey Robinson , the former paymaster general , and close friend of Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson , employed the accountants to design Labour 's windfall tax and the part - privatisation of London Underground .
Andersen has since won many government contracts .
It supports Labour 's private finance initiative .
Key players David Duncan
The Andersen partner fired by the company for destroying documents related to Enron even as financial regulators investigated the company .
In congressional testimony , the accounting group said Mr Duncan had "" organised and expedited efforts to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron - related documents without consultation with others in the firm "" .
During the same hearing , Mr Duncan declined to answer questions , invoking the fifth amendment right to not incriminate himself .
Mr Duncan had previously told investigators that he was acting on an email from Nancy Temple , a legal counsel at Andersen , reminding staff of the regular policy of retaining and destroying documents .
Nancy Temple A lawyer at Andersen headquarters in Chicago , she emailed a copy of the firm 's document destruction policy on October 12 to the Houston office where Mr Duncan and other accountants worked on the Enron account .
Under congressional questioning she said : "" I never counselled any destruction or shredding of documents . ""
Michael Odom Head of risk management for the Houston office
, he said Ms Temple 's email reminding employees of Andersen 's document - disposal policy was unprecedented .
Joseph Berardino Andersen 's chief executive .
In an appeal for public sympathy
Mr Berardino declared : "" What was done was not in keeping with the values and heritage of this firm .
It was wrong .
There 's no other word for it .
But 85,000 people did not work on the Enron engagement .
85,000 people did not destroy documents .
And 85,000 people did not encourage anyone to destroy those documents . """
2002-02-01,"I guess I 'm not a nice guy .
But when I heard that Enron 's former vice - chairman Cliff Baxter had shunted his mortal coil , I shed no tears .
One tabloid even called Baxter a "" hero "" who courageously raised the alarm about his company 's fantasy financials .
Maybe I 'm missing something here , but this is the Baxter who last year quietly crawled out of Enron like a cockroach from a rotting log - then dumped his stock on unsuspecting buyers , thereby pocketing a reported $ 35 m ( £ 25 m ) .
You can just imagine Baxter chuckling to himself in January last year as Enron 's office staff gathered their pennies for his retirement gift while he 's thinking , "" So long , suckers ! "" - knowing they are about to lose their jobs and life savings .
There have been a lot of misplaced tears in the Affair Enron .
The employees were shafted , no doubt about it .
But the shareholders ?
I did n't hear any of them moan when Enron stock shot up through the roof when the company , joined by a half dozen other power pirates , manipulated , monopolised and muscled the California electricity market a year ago .
All together , Enron and half a dozen others skinned purchasers for more than $ 12bn in excess charges .
That 's the calculation of Calfornia 's utility watchdog as presented to federal regulators in a damning petition for refunds .
Here 's an example of how Enron 's po ' widdle stockholders , hero Baxter and chairman Ken Lay made their loot .
Soon after California dumbly deregulated its power markets , Enron sold 500 megawatts of power to the state for delivery over a 15-megawatt line .
Very cute
, that : the company knew darn well the juice could n't make it over the line , causing panic in the state - customers would then pay 10 times the normal cost to keep the lights on and traders could cash in .
The federal regulator caught that one .
Within weeks of taking office , George Bush demoted the troublesome official .
Lay boasted to one candidate expected to replace the sacked regulator that President Bush had given Enron veto over the government appointment .
Nor did Enron 's stockholders object to their profitable business of trading politicians like bags of sugar .
From Texas to Argentina to Britain , Enron used legal but sick - making use of political donations , consultancies and lobbying to twist contracts , rules and regulations to their liking .
You want to cry for a power industry exec who came to an early , violent , end ?
Then let me suggest to you Jake Horton , late senior vice - president of Gulf power , a subsidiary of Southern Company .
( Southern is one of Enron 's cohort in that fixed casino called the US electricity market . )
Horton apparently knew about some of his company 's less - than - kosher accounting practices ; and he had no doubt about its illegal campaign contributions to Florida politicans - he 'd made the payments himself .
But unlike Baxter , who took the money and ran , in April 1989 , Horton decided to blow the whistle , confront his bosses and go to state officials .
He demanded and received use of the company 's jet to go and confront Southern 's board of directors .
Ten minutes after take - off , the jet exploded .
While the investigation into the plane crash was inconclusive , the company 's CEO believed his death was suicide .
He told the BBC : "" I guess poor Jake saw no other way out . ""
Ultimately , Southern pleaded guilty to the charges related to the illegal payments .
Jake and Baxter are the beginning and end of the story of deregulation .
I was part of a team investigating Southern 's finances after Jake 's plane went down , just after a grand jury voted to charge his company with criminal racketeering for manipulating its accounts .
Millions of dollars were charged to customers of Southern 's subsidiary , Georgia Power , for spare parts that were not used .
The internal revenue service recommended indictment , but George Bush Sr 's justice department put the kibosh on the prosecution ( their legal prerogative ) - in great part because the fancy financials had been blessed by the company 's auditor : Arthur Andersen .
The company denied any wrongdoing .
But while Southern Company did n't face criminal charges , regulators ordered it to pay back millions to its customers .
And that 's the big connection to Enron .
Because it was in those years of investigation that Southern Company led the fight to "" deregulate "" the power industry .
Rather than conform to the rules , they lobbied to get rid of the rules .
Southern and its buddies in the power industry were successful beyond imagination .
Industry lobbyists and lawyers eviscerated America 's Public Utilities Holding Company 's Act , and made mincemeat of the rules which once barred power companies from making donations to political campaigns .
Crucially , in the newly deregulated power markets , the companies were relieved of the requirement to follow the strict government - designed Uniform System of Accounts .
Enron , founded in 1986 , was the Rosemary 's Baby of this satanic coupling of free - market ideological hoodoo and electricity industry greed .
Enron played it faster and looser than the others , but it is wrong and dangerous to say Enron was one bad apple .
It 's the whole wormy tree of public services deregulation mania which is rotten , root and branch . ·

2002-02-01,"US federal energy regulators began an investigation yesterday into allegations that Enron unfairly boosted wholesale power prices at the expense of residents during an electricity crisis in California .
The crisis led to blackouts and forced the state to spend billions of dollars to buy power when utilities could no longer afford to do so .
Enron has denied any wrongdoing .
Pat Wood , chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , who announced the investigation , was appointed chairman last summer by George Bush with the support of Enron .
Enron was among a dozen power generators active in California 's wholesale electricity market .
Prices for power sold on the state 's spot market rose tenfold in the autumn of 2000 and continued at high levels through spring of 2001 .
The state of California is demanding $ 9bn ( £ 6.36bn ) in refunds for alleged overcharges by Enron and several other generators during the crisis .
Also yesterday , senator Byron Dorgan said Enron had not cooperated with an inquiry by the Senate commerce committee .
Mr Dorgan , chairman of the Senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs , said Jeffrey Skilling , former Enron chief executive , had declined to appear on February 4 , but had agreed to testify later .
The former Enron chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , "" has not responded to any of the committee 's communications "" .

2002-02-01,"Irwin Stelzer defends Enron ( Why Enron deserves our gratitude , January 29 ) on the basis that it benefited consumers by creating a competitive energy market .
This is only one side of the story .
Competition is not the main goal of companies , profits are .
If Enron could get away with profits without competition it surely would , as it did in India .
There , the state government of Maharashtra was forced to pay exorbitant rates for Enron energy it did not need , even when it could buy it more cheaply elsewhere .
The murky contract , negotiated in secret , involved counter guarantees by the government of India in case the state defaulted , which it eventually did when it went broke .
In other words , its investment was completely risk - free and competition - free , redefining the meaning of "" free market "" .
The company 's competitive tactics ranged from spending lots of money to "" educate officials "" , to bullying govern - ments which could not pay .
Enron could force its way in India far more easily than it could in the west .
But the governing principles are the same : buying political influence to create an environment to suit its goals .

Irwin Stelzer makes it plain that , for him , deregulation is worth any price and implies that the great gain is a disposable and impotent workforce .
Investors can spread their portfolios , executives are protected by remuneration committees , the consumer takes no risks , but the employees emerge without salary or investment .

Tim Searle Dronfield , Derbys long-acre@freeuk.com · The influence of Enron 's money in changing Labour energy policy is greatly exaggerated ( Blair mired in Enron row , January 29 ) .
I crossed swords with Enron on many occasions due to my support for the government 's moratorium on gas - fired power stations .
While Enron may have been ruthless in its support for free energy markets , it did not buy a lifting of the moratorium from Labour .
The policy was very unpopular , and many were calling for its reversal including the energy regulator , the CBI , consumer groups and energy companies .
The only supporters were some Labour ministers ( particularly within the then DETR ) and the coal lobby .

2002-02-01,"The earnings crisis facing the global banking industry was thrown into stark relief yesterday when two of its biggest players revealed that they had slumped into the red .
Credit Suisse First Boston said it would record a $ 1bn ( £ 708 m ) loss during the fourth quarter , reflecting the cost of extensive job cuts , exposure to the failed energy firm Enron and the Argentinian financial crisis .
The bank rushed out a forecast to alert investors to the scale of its losses , which will be higher than previous estimates .
The full results are not scheduled for release until March .
The bad news from CSFB was echoed by Deutsche Bank which yesterday revealed that it had clocked up its first ever quarterly loss in the final three months of the year .
Hit by higher bad debt provisions , restructuring costs and investment write - downs , Deutsche said it made a pretax loss of € 800 m ( £ 487 m ) , against a profit of € 586 m in the previous three months .
CSFB has been struggling to restore its fortunes amid poor conditions on Wall Street , which has suffered from the decline in corporate activity .
CSFB has cut more than 2,400 jobs and renegotiated the pay and bonuses of many of the remaining executives in an effort to tackle its bloated cost base .
John Mack , who was appointed chief executive of CSFB six months ago with the brief of turning the business around , said he had made "" important progress "" during 2001 but admitted there was still much to do .
Mr Mack , a former president of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter , has said the job of getting the bank back in shape will take up to 18 months .
About $ 213 m of losses related to bad debts in Argentina , while $ 126 m was written off against Enron , the failed energy trader .
CSFB took a one - off charge of $ 745 m related to the restructuring of the company , a figure $ 95 m higher than it had earlier indicated .
It also made a provision of $ 100 m for a settlement reached with US financial regulators , which have been investigating certain of CSFB 's share alloca tion practices in flotations during the internet - driven boom .
At group level , Credit Suisse said it expected to report a loss of SFr800 m ( £ 330 m ) for the fourth quarter .
For the full year CSFB is forecast to lose $ 961 m .
Deutsche , which this week announced measures to streamline the board , said yesterday that its core corporate and investment banking business had seen profits fall 50 % to € 300 m .
Bad debt provisions rose € 500 m as the bank absorbed the impact of increased bankruptcies in Germany 's small business sector and fallout from Argentina 's economic crisis and the Enron collapse .
Analysts , however , praised Deutsche 's efforts to control costs which include cutting more than 9,000 jobs ."
2002-02-01,"Lord Wakeham flew to New York last night to begin a prolonged fight to save his name and reputation following the collapse of US energy giant Enron , leaving £ 55bn of debts .
The former Tory cabinet minister , who yesterday stood down from his £ 156,000 post as chairman of the independent press complaints commission , is meeting US lawyers today to discuss his defence against claims from workers who lost their jobs and savings in the world 's biggest bankruptcy .
The Tory peer is likely to be centre stage in the legal battle with redundant employees as he is one of six non - executive directors who sat on the audit and compliance committee of the Texas - based company and were charged with keeping an eye on the firm 's activities .
He has been a director since 1994 , four years after he gave Enron the contract for Europe 's largest gas - fired power station in Teesside when he was energy secretary .
Lord Wakeham will have to prepare for congressional hearings into the Enron affair .
At this stage he is not certain how many committees he will have to give evidence to , nor how long the inquiries and legal battles will take .
American trade unions have singled out Lord Wakeham for criticism and have written to every company on which he holds a board position asking them to deny his re - election .
Damon Silvers , a lawyer for the main US trade body , the American Federation of Labour - Congress of Industrial Organisations said : "" By no means is everything known about what happened at Enron but what we do know is that the board was approving these off - balance sheet transactions and that is such an indictment .
Lord Wakeham because of his position on the audit committee and corporate governance committee had particular responsibility . ""
He added : "" In light of the $ 72,000 consultancy fee he was earning from Enron , Lord Wakeham should n't have even been on the audit committee because he was supposed to be independent . ""
Sources yesterday indicated it was unlikely that Lord Wakeham would be able to resume his job at the PCC for many months .
The former minister decided late on Wednesday that he should announce his resignation when it became clear from the first editions of Thursday 's papers that the press were still taking a keen interest in his role at Enron .
He decided to take advice he has given privately many times to senior Tories and Labour ministers who are suddenly in the media spotlight - not to stay "" dangling in the wind "" .
The veteran fixer issued a statement saying : "" As chairman of the press complaints commission for the past seven years , I am only too aware of the damage that can be done to individuals and institutions that are thrust into the public spotlight . ""
Since the collapse of Enron , I have been unable to make any statement or undertake any interviews on the subject for legal reasons .
I am conscious that some see this position as incompatible with the chairmanship of the commission .
"" I am very proud of everything we have achieved at the PCC and do not wish it to be damaged by continuing short - term speculation .
"" I therefore see it as a matter of honour to stand aside temporarily from the chairmanship of the commission until the report of the independent investigating committee of Enron is published and evaluated .
I am cooperating actively with these inquiries . ""
His decision was welcomed by friends and critics .
Opposition parties contrasted his attitude to the government 's reaction over the affair and allegations about "" cash for access "" after Enron gave £ 38,000 to the Labour party .
The Liberal Democrat media spokesman , Nick Harvey , said Lord Wakeham should be credited for acting swiftly .
"" Such a sensitive role makes it crucial that all the questions about his dealings with Enron are cleared up .
"" The government should take a lead from Lord Wakeham and act swiftly to answer the many questions still remaining about its relationship with Enron and Andersen . ""
The Conservative party , which has been embarrassed by the disclosures , said : "" Lord Wakeham has made the correct decision in temporarily stepping aside while he cooperates with inquiries concerning Enron in the United States . ""
This contrasts markedly with the government 's failure to hold an inquiry into their links with the company and its auditors , in particular the involvement of Patricia Hewitt and Helen Liddell . ""
Professor Robert Pinker will replace Lord Wakeham at the PCC .
Mr Pinker is one of the founding members and has served for seven years as the PCC 's privacy commissioner ."
2002-02-01,"President George Bush will propose measures today to safeguard employee pensions in the wake of the Enron debacle , when workers lost their retirement funds .
In one proposal designed to level the playing field between top management and employees , Mr Bush wants to bar executives from selling shares during so - called "" blackout "" periods , such as the one that kept Enron 's workers locked in to their Enron holdings while the company 's stock plummeted .
Thousands of Enron workers lost their jobs and pension savings when the company imploded last year amid allegations that it misled investors about its financial health while top executives reaped huge profits by selling their shares .
Mr Bush was scheduled to announce the proposed pension reforms at a retreat with fellow Republicans as the White House seeks to protect itself from the Enron debacle .
Public opinion polls show that a growing number of Americans believe that the administration has something to hide because of its unwillingness to release information on meetings held by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and top Enron officials as the White House was formulating its energy policy .
Enron was the biggest contributor to Mr Bush 's election campaign .
Democrats have raised questions about Mr Bush 's close ties to Enron executives and have asked if the firm used its influence to shape a favourable administration energy policy .
Administration officials concede Enron had access but deny that the company influenced policy .
The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Wednesday that Kenneth Lay , then the Enron chairman , handed Mr Cheney a memo last year that included suggestions resembling elements of the Bush administration energy policy .
Today 's proposals constitute an attempt by the White House to show that it has taken on board public outrage at the apparent double standard that allowed Enron top executives to profit , while employees were financially ruined .
Damage limitation is particularly important in the runup to the November 5 midterm elections , when the Democrats will seek to make big gains in the House and Senate ."
2002-02-01,"A senior figure from Andersen , the company under fire for its role in the Enron crash , said yesterday that the firm bore no responsibility for the scandal .
John Ormerod , managing partner of Andersen UK , rebuffed criticism that its US arm had missed signs that Enron was about to collapse .
He said : "" The people who run the business are the directors and managers .
Auditors comment on financial information , a little like journalists comment on that information .
That does not make you responsible . ""
He said that other companies , such as ratings agencies and banks , had access to more up - to - date information about Enron than Andersen .
In a BBC interview , he said that Andersen 's relationship with Enron had been "" objective "" and that auditors should not be relied upon to find every mistake of management or anyone else .
Mr Ormerod also denied any impropriety over its ties with Labour , which lifted an unofficial ban on awarding government contracts to the firm following its 1997 general election victory .
Andersen courted Labour politicians while they were in opposition and performed work for the party for free .
Mr Ormerod said that subsequent contracts were won fairly and on merit .
He added that Andersen had carried out only a "" modest "" amount of work for Labour , which was paid for ."
2002-02-01,"Lord Wakeham and his fellow Enron directors faced increasingly angry questions last night about their decision to waive ethical guidelines on several multimillion pound deals before the American energy company 's collapse .
According to boardroom minutes leaked to the Washington Post , directors received detailed briefings about the purpose and structure of controversial "" partnerships "" used to shield the company 's debt .
In establishing these partnerships , directors twice chose in 1999 to set aside "" conflict of interest "" rules .
They gave the go - ahead for Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , to oversee the partnerships , despite the fact that he could benefit from them financially .
He is reported to have made a personal profit of $ 30 m from the partnerships .
The minutes confirm , for the first time , that the entire board , including Lord Wakeham , gave its blessing to Enron 's controversial accounting policies .
As a non - executive director , Lord Wakeham 's role was to ask "" dumb questions "" and to contribute an objective opinion .
In theory , he was expected to attend monthly board meetings and to make himself available whenever chief executive Kenneth Lay wanted to consult him .
A qualified accountant , Lord Wakeham was also a member of the audit committee , which met four times last year .
Its role was to scrutinise the accounts and to liaise with partners from the accountancy firm Andersen .
Ann Yerger head of research at the Council of Institutional Investors which represents funds managing some $ 1.5 trillion , said that the independent directors on the audit committee had a crucial role in monitoring the work of the auditors and the relationship with management .
She said : "" We do n't expect them to sit just occupying a chair .
We do n't expect them to micro - manage .
They have an important oversight role .
"" They have been sure the internal audit function and the external audit function are done in an appropriate manner , making certain that quality processes and systems are in place . ""
Audit committee meetings usually bring together non - executives , senior figures from a company 's finance department and auditors , who each go through the latest accounts , offering their interpretation item by item .
According to Sir Dominic Cadbury , who has served on the boards of EMI , Guinness and Cadbury Schweppes , questioning is usually intense : "" I 've never been on an audit committee where the directors kept quiet .
There are always questions to be asked about any set of accounts . ""
At some stage during the meeting , finance staff are asked to leave , allowing auditors to express any concerns privately to independent directors .
Best practice in the US says that non - executive directors should be chosen by a special board committee with help from outside head - hunters , though critics claim that the process is run by the chief executive .
Ken Berteich who is responsible for corporate governance at TIAA - CREF , which manages pension funds for US colleges , universities and research institutions , argues it is vital that non - executive directors are completely independent .
He said he did not know the way in which board selection worked at Enron but added : "" They looked like a pretty cosy group of people . ""
Mr Berteich said the key question which Enron directors needed to answer was why did they allow "" this exemption to their own ethics policy , permitting an officer to be on the other side of huge transactions with the company "" ?
Other questions facing Lord Wakeham and his fellow directors include : · Did Andersen raise any concerns about Enron 's "" aggressive accounting "" practices ? · What discussion took place about Andersen 's reappointment ? · How did Enron secure an exemption from US law in 1997 , allowing it to spread its web of "" partnerships "" offshore ? · How did the board respond to accounting concerns raised in a letter last year by "" whistleblower "" Sherren Watkins ?"
2002-02-01,"The editor of the Daily Telegraph , Charles Moore , has called for a complete overhaul of the press complaints commission 's procedures , which he today branded "" a bit of a stitch - up "" .
He also raised concerns for the continuing role of Lord Wakeham after it emerged the peer would continue to receive his £ 156,000 annual salary even though he has stepped aside as PCC chairman .
Moore , a harsh critic of the PCC , wants clarification of Lord Wakeham 's role at the watchdog given that he could remain on the payroll even if the investigation into his role in the Enron scandal takes years , it emerged today .
The peer 's decision to step aside as PCC chairman followed mounting pressure for him to quit .
He is being asked to give evidence to the congressional inquiry into the collapse of the energy giant , Enron , of which he is a director .
Graham Thompson , the secretary and treasurer of the press standards board of finance , which has administrative and financial responsibility for the PCC , confirmed Lord Wakeham was still receiving his £ 156,000 salary .
"" There 's been no decision taken so far to stop paying [ Lord Wakeham ] , "" said Mr Thompson .
"" The logistics of a thing like this take time . ""
Moore pointed out today that Lord Wakeham 's temporary resignation could hold back the PCC . ""
The PCC ca n't be held in limbo for the period of the Enron investigation , which could drag on for some time , "" he said .
Moore said the credibility of the PCC had already been undermined by recent incidents , which had shown it to be too close to the royal family .
"" I think after the death of Princess Diana there was a real concern for the protection of Prince William 's and Prince Harry 's welfare , "" he said .
"" But after a while this became a way of doing special deals with the royal family , "" he added .
Moore described the PCC 's star - studded tenth birthday party last year as an exercise in "" campaigning for the rehabilitation of Camilla Parker Bowles and the acceptance of her relationship with the Prince of Wales "" .
He added : "" The most recent situation with Prince Harry undermined the PCC . ""
The commission brokered a deal between the News of the World and St James 's Palace over revelations that the prince had smoked cannabis and indulged in late - night drinking sessions .
Both the PCC director , Guy Black , and his partner , Mark Bolland , the deputy private secretary to Prince Charles , were instrumental in the handling of the story .
"" I have n't got a blueprint for what should be done but , at the moment , the PCC has the appearance of being a bit of a stitch - up , "" Moore said , adding it was perceived to be "" deferential "" to newspapers and powerful people .
The Telegraph editor was angered by the PCC 's recent decision to uphold a complaint from Tony and Cherie Blair .
The prime minister and his wife claimed stories in the Telegraph and the Daily Mail about their son Euan 's university plans breached clause six of the PCC 's code of practice .
Moore said he favoured an "" overhaul of procedure "" rather than a root - and - branch reform of the PCC , adding its complaints procedure must be seen to be more transparent ."
2002-02-01,"Resignation is a rare occurrence in public life these days , so Lord Wakeham should be congratulated for speedily and gracefully stepping down from the press complaints commission while his role in the Enron scandal is investigated .
It is likely that his involvement at Enron - he was a non - executive director as well as sitting on the audit committee - will be picked over in the press and by investigatory authorities for some considerable time to come .
Though Lord Wakeham said yesterday that he was stepping down only temporarily , it would be extremely damaging for the PCC to be left leaderless for months , or even years , while he cooperates with inquiries .
Robert Pinker , who was yesterday named as acting chairman , will be a safe stopgap .
But serious consideration should now be given to finding a permanent replacement to take the PCC forward .
Lord Wakeham brought all the qualities of a former chief whip to the PCC job .
He was a polished fixer , a reader of consensus , a smoother - over , the dealer of a nudge here , a shove there .
Though not a journalist , he had a well - developed sense of the importance of a free press and brought a much - needed period of stability to the PCC .
The next director must appreciate that he / she is a regulator - and must not confuse that role with acting as a spokesperson for the press .
While conciliation and mediation are important functions of the PCC , there is also a need for clear and consistent judgments based on precedents .
The PCC ought to be more willing to initiate inquiries when there is prima facie evidence that its code has been flouted .
And it would be anathema to its integrity if the PCC was ever suspected of being too cosily allied with people or organisations - whether they be particularly powerful newspaper groups or ( for instance ) the monarchy .
Lord Wakeham leaves the PCC in reasonable shape , but it is time now to move the organisation on to a different footing ."
2002-02-01,"Enron The "" funding of democracy "" should be reviewed in light of allegations linking the government with the collapsed US energy company Enron , the Liberal Democrat parliamentary affairs spokesman , Paul Tyle , demanded .
He said ministers should tackle the public impression that it was possible to "" buy access and influence "" to parliament .
The Commons leader , Robin Cook , said : "" I regard with some mystification why it is thought in any way unusual for a minister for energy to meet what at the time was then a major energy company , particularly since the outcome of those discussions was a green paper which actually curtailed - did not expand - the opportunity for Enron within the British market . ""
Transport Commons watchdogs must be given the right to question special advisers on government policy said Labour 's Gwyneth Dunwoody , chairman of the transport select committee which was snubbed by Lord Birt .
She said there was an "" increasing problem "" hampering their ability to scrutinise the Government .
Mr Cook said if Lord Birt was forced to give evidence the government could find it hard to attract similar unpaid advisers .
Post Office Post Office regulator Graham Corbett came under fire from Labour backbenchers over comments on increased competition within the postal service .
Left - winger Dennis Skinner said : "" I think this fellow Corbett or whatever his name is has gone too far already .
He 's going to become an embarrassment to this government just like [ Chris ] Woodhead before .
Let 's get him out before he causes more damage . ""
Mr Cook acknowledged that the more cherry picking there was of large commercial contracts , the more challenging it would become for the Post Office to maintain its universal service .
He said : "" Obviously that is a matter that must weigh with us when we come to consider any outcome of the consultation process . ""
Elderly Tories called on the government to fully reimburse councils for the cost of concessionary fares for the elderly .
Geoffrey Clifton - Brown , for Conservatives , said some councils failed to get any money reimbursed for the cost of providing the mandatory schemes .
In debate on the travel concessions ( eligibility ) bill , Mr Clifton - Brown said the full cost was estimated to be £ 54 m a year .
Junior transport minister Sally Keeble said attempts to change the way the costs were reimbursed would prevent new measures being in place for the next financial year as planned .
It could also undermine the established systems for distributing money to councils .
Zimbabwe
The government has done "" too little too late "" to protest about the "" terrible situation "" in Zimbabwe , Tory Julian Lewis said .
Mr Cook said : "" The present situation in Zimbabwe is alarming and deplorable and the attacks on the opposition are outrageous . ""
The government had worked hard through the EU and the Commonwealth to ensure external observers were at coming elections in a bid to "" curb the worst of the intimidation "" .
Gibraltar The government disclosed plans to issue a joint declaration with Spain on the future of Gibraltar .
The Europe minister , Peter Hain , announced the two countries were planning to issue a "" declaration of principles "" once agreement had been reached in the discussions over the rock .
The news was attacked by Richard Spring , for Tories , as proof of a "" done deal "" with shared sovereignty of the territory .
Military Ministers were urged to ensure Germany "" honours its obligations "" to buying its full share of a fleet of new Airbus military transport aircraft .
Tory Michael Jack expressed concerns after German defence minister Rudolf Scharping said this week that Berlin can not make a watertight legal commitment to provide the £ 5.1bn for 73 German aircraft .
Mr Cook said : "" They are a sovereign government and they will reach their own decisions , but we are of course making very strong representations to that government .
We 'll continue to do so and we 'll consider any statement they may make . ""
Agricultural shows Animals look set to be allowed to return to agricultural shows after the government said it was to make a decision about lifting a movement ban "" in the next few days "" .
The rural affairs minister Alun Michael , responding to appeals from Tory Hugo Swire to allow animals at the Devon county show , said : "" We hope within a few days to be able to respond ... in respect to the agricultural shows about which you asked . ""
Farming Farmers should make greater use of the internet and video links to sell their animals , Labour 's Paul Flynn told MPs .
He said that , although cattle markets were now re - opening , sales methods adopted during the food - and - mouth outbreak should not be abandoned .
r Cook said : "" If one of the consequences has been to provoke more local slaughter and local sales then personally I would regard that as welcome and would be a helpful step to making sure that we would be able to contain any future outbreak . ""
Hospital scandal Mr Cook praised staff at the hospital where the body of a premature baby was accidentally thrown into a laundry bin and put through a boil wash .
Mr Cook said the incident was an "" appalling experience "" for the family of tiny James Fernandez , but praised staff from Queen Mary 's Hospital in Sidcup for their quick response to the mishap .
Fridges Environment minister Michael Meacher denied government "" incompetence "" was to blame for the mountain of fridges being put into store .
He said : "" We were badly let down by the European commission .
"" Thousands of fridges are being put into store while recycling plants are built to cope with removal of environment - damaging insulation foam .
Mr Meacher said officials made repeated requests from 1999 to find out if new disposal rules applied to the foam .
He said : "" We did not get a formal reply until June 2001 . ""
NHS The government 's latest health care shake - up was criticised as a "" recipe for disaster "" .
Lord Clement - Jones , for Liberal Democrats , said such was the "" hostility "" to the NHS reform and health care professions bill that his party was urging ministers to delay and bring in a well thought out alternative .
Junior health minister Lord Hunt said for patient choice to thrive it needed an environment in which there was greater diversity of services , with freedom to innovate and respond to patient needs .
The bill was given an unopposed second reading .
Call for inquiry Former Tory leader William Hague demanded a public inquiry into the "" uniquely chilling "" case of disgraced gynaecologist Richard Neale .
A "" low key "" investigation into how Neale was allowed to practice in the UK for nearly 15 years after being struck off in Canada was inadequate .
Opening his first adjournment debate since rejoining the backbenches , he said it was a "" tragic , deeply disturbing and utterly scandalous tale "" .
Junior health minister Yvette Cooper acknowledged that the Neale case was "" harrowing and distressing "" .
She said : "" The government is determined to ensure that procedures are in place to minimise the risk to patients to the extent that that is possible . ""
The issue of whether a public inquiry should be held was now the subject of a judicial review .
Red tape Farmers struggling to recover from one of the industry 's most disastrous years are to be hit with more unnecessary red tape , the Tories claimed .
The shadow environment secretary , Peter Ainsworth , called on the government to relax environmental protection rules due to come into force this week .
Junior rural affairs minister Elliot Morley said the department wanted to be as "" flexible and as realistic "" as possible in implementing the rules .
They would be reviewed after 18 months .
TB tests for cattle Mr Morley announced movement restrictions on certain beef herds with overdue tuberculosis tests .
Around 1,250 herds mainly in the south and west of England are expected to be affected .
The government is also introducing additional checks on herds that have been reformed after foot - and - mouth disease .
Station closure The government is to question the possible closure of Ashford International station on the weekend of the France v England rugby match in Paris .
Transport minister John Spellar said the timing of the proposed shutdown was "" particularly unfortunate "" and promised to talk to the rail firm concerned .
Hedges The government is to issue a new guidance leaflet on neighbours ' rights to object to high hedges .
But local government spokesman Lord Filkin could give no indication when legislation would be introduced to allow councils to intervene in disputes over trees and hedges .
Golden jubilee Employers were urged to do their "" patriotic "" duty in allowing staff paid leave to celebrate the Queen 's golden jubilee .
Mr Cook said he hoped staff would be allowed to enjoy the extra bank holiday on June 4 .
MoD thefts Dental gold , night vision goggles , mobile phone top - up cards and military ration packs are among the more bizarre items stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 1997 .
Losses include three Land Rovers , a Vauxhall Astra and a motorbike .
Total value of items on a list disclosed by armed forces minister Adam Ingram was more than £ 300,000 .
Summer tours Summer tours of parliament have been a great success and should be made a permanent attraction , the Commons decided today .
But MPs warned that British taxpayers have been subsidising overseas visitors to the Palace of Westminster and that admission prices should be increased .
MPs backed a report by the Commons administration select committee after hearing that more than 86,000 tourists had visited the palace during the trial opening last year .
Foot and mouth About 6.5 m farm animals were slaughtered during the foot - and - mouth outbreak , junior environment minister Lord Whitty reported .
Tactic review The lord chancellor , Lord Irving , has ordered a review of the use of "" intimidatory tactics "" in defamation cases , such as gagging writs and gagging letters .

2002-02-02,"The Enron collapse in the US has been on such a scale that it has made waves elsewhere in the world , and certainly in London .
The big question is - could it happen here ?
The only honest answer is yes .
But we have rather different arrangements for the oversight of the accounting profession and for financial regulation .
As far as accounting is concerned , our standard setters argue the UK approach emphasises substance over form and seeks to address the underlying economic reality in consolidated accounts , rather than staying close to the particular corporate and legal structure adopted .
I would note that that approach has not prevented corporate failures in which accounting treatment has been an issue , but the general principle must be right .
The UK profession also argues that the arrangements for the oversight of auditors and audit quality are somewhat more robust than those in the US .
In our case there is , now , after a lengthy gestation , an Accountancy Foundation overseeing the Auditing Practices Board , which , in turn , aims to monitor the quality of audit work .
While accountancy remains a self - regulating profession , audit is - formally at least - covered by some statutory controls .
Companies Acts regulate the qualifications of auditors and set out their duties and rights .
But in spite of the strong injection of public interest representatives , the oversight arrangements remain substantially a self - regulatory system .
There is nothing so different about our system that it can stop an audit firm becoming too close to its client and colluding in accounting practices which mislead investors , deliberately or inadvertently .
There is nothing to stop an audit firm working indefinitely for the same client .
There is nothing to stop a firm undertaking consulting business for the audit client on a very substantial scale .
So investors and politicians are reasonably asking whether we should make changes to outlaw such practices .
Indeed , these were questions the FSA already intended to raise , in relation to listed firms , in this year 's review of the listing rules .
There are , in principle , three possible steps one might take to deal with potential conflicts of interest for auditors .
First , we could require rotation of auditors at a defined interval , perhaps every five years .
The present requirement is that the lead partner on an audit must rotate at least every seven years , but there is no requirement for firm rotation .
Would that be a justifiable intrusion into the commercial freedom for companies to choose their own auditors ?
Or would it help to prevent excessively close relationships , and emphasise the regulatory , public interest role of the audit function ?
At the audit commission , which appoints auditors to many public bodies in the UK , audit rotation is planned as part of the process .
When I ran the commission I found it a helpful discipline , and one which had the useful effect of making auditors more ready to challenge clients .
A second possibility , which would have a less intrusive effect , would be to require regular re - tendering of audit work , but not to rule out the possibility that the current auditor would be reappointed .
The aim would be to break the normal assumption that auditors are re - appointed year by year , and would require audit committees to ask themselves direct questions about audit performance .
It would also give other firms the opportunity to set out the case for a fresh pair of eyes .
A third option might be to impose limits on the amount of non - audit work an auditor can do for an audit client .
Once again , that is a feature of the audit commission 's regime .
But there are potential drawbacks .
Firms might reasonably argue that some audit work can most effectively be carried out by a company with a good knowledge of the clients ' systems .
And policing such a restriction could also be rather difficult in practice .
We shall be consulting formally on these possibilities later in the year , but I can see advantages in opening up the question for debate now , since the Enron collapse has raised these questions here .
But in each case the role of the audit committee would remain crucial .
Unless such committees work effectively , any change to the arrangements for appointing auditors will have little impact .
And we have to recognise that there may be consequences for audit fees .
It is arguable that they do not now fully reflect the risks auditors take - and the contribution they should make to market integrity .
The second area where there are differences in the UK is financial regulation .
One should not overstate these differences .
It is certainly possible in the UK for a non - financial company to undertake extensive activities in financial markets , as Enron has done .
And financial regulators here , as in the US , do not seek to regulate the non - financial parent on a consolidated basis .
But we do maintain closer regulatory oversight of the financial subsidiaries of unregulated groups .
There are also two features of our new legislation which help .
First , we have introduced some specific powers over the auditors of financial firms , over their terms of appointment , for instance .
There are new whistleblowing requirements .
Auditors of a regulated firm must report directly to us any contravention relevant to the exercise of our powers .
If they do not do so , we can disqualify them .
The second advantage is that our unified regulatory system allows us to look at all of the financial activities of a diversified group together .
It is clear that almost all financial crises these days cross traditional sectoral boundaries .
No regulatory system is foolproof , and internationally we need to work more on implementing appropriate disclosure rules , especially of complex derivatives , to promote effective market discipline .
That is likely to be the most effective way of preventing more Enron - type collapses .
Sir Howard Davies is chairman of the Financial Services Authority"
2002-02-02,"The former head of Enron , Kenneth Lay , gave the White House a list of his personal recommendations for key federal energy posts and two of the people on his list were appointed , it emerged yesterday , providing the strongest evidence so far of the political influence wielded by President Bush 's biggest financial backer .
The revelation is likely to increase pressure on the Bush administration to open the books on its contacts with Mr Lay and his associates .
The Enron scandal is now threatening to reach to the heart of the White House .
Mr Lay put forward his list of suggested members of the federal energy regulatory commission last spring .
Two of the people he suggested , Pat Wood , a Texas Republican who now chairs the commission , and Nora Brownell , were appointed by the president .
Mr Lay himself disclosed details of the list in an interview recorded last May but only broadcast yesterday .
"" I brought a list , we certainly presented a list , "" Mr Lay told the PBS channel . ""
As I recall , I signed a letter which , in fact , had some recommendations as to people we thought would be good commissioners . ""
The list of around eight names was given to Mr Bush 's director of personnel , Clay Johnson .
The White House moved swiftly to distance itself from the claim , which ties the administration more closely with the former Enron chief .
"" It was one of many , many recommendations , "" said a White House spokeswoman , Anne Womack .
She added that other members of the energy industry , members of Congress and government officials had all submitted suggestions .
Mr Lay will give evidence next week to congressional panels investigating the affair .
In May , the ex - chairman of the commission , Curtis Hebert , said he had received a call from Mr Lay offering Enron 's backing to help him keep his job if he adapted his views on deregulation .
Mr Hebert said he had turned down the offer .
Mr Lay confirmed the call had taken place , but said it was Mr Hebert who had asked for Enron 's backing to keep his job .
Mr Hebert also said that a few weeks after his appointment Mr Lay had told him on the telephone that "" he and Enron would like to support me as chairman , but we would have to agree on principles "" .
While Vice - President Dick Cheney has said that he met Enron officials to discuss energy policy , he is declining to give details of conversations during six meetings to the general accounting office , which has indicated it will go to court to force the White House to identify which energy industry figures met Mr Cheney .
The congressional panels conducting the inquiries have run into problems in extracting information from Enron itself in the wake of the bankruptcy , which has put thousands out of work and wiped out retirement funds .
The chairman of the Senate commerce subcommittee , Byron Dorgan , said the corporation had not cooperated with requests for documents .
"" We again renew our request , "" he said .
Many key documents have already been shredded .
Enron was the largest contributor to Mr Bush 's election campaign , donating £ 1.2 m .
Mr Lay , a close friend of the president , has been a contributor to both parties but is tied mainly to Republicans and the Bushes .
Claims from Mr Lay 's wife , Linda , that they were facing ruin because all their stock had been in Enron were greeted with scepticism : the family is down to its last £ 21 m ."
2002-02-02,"There are few people who want to wade into the spreading mess of Enron .
The muck is starting to stick to political elites on both sides of the Atlantic and appears to be coating the financial community .
But one person happy to get his hands dirty is Sir Howard Davies , the chairman of the City 's watchdog , the financial services authority .
He wants to mount a clean - up operation and to start with accountants .
Arthur Andersen audited Enron , but managed to miss that the US energy company was not making , but leaking , money .
Eager to keep the clients happy and the fees paid , Andersen 's partners appeared to have been too tight with Enron 's board to challenge dodgy figures .
This cosy relationship has become a feature of business life .
Corporations rarely change auditors , arguing that accountants need time to get to know a business .
Accountants ' independence may also be compromised as they are paid not only for auditing company books but also for consulting services .
Enron paid Andersen $ 27 m for consulting and $ 25 m for auditing in 2000 .
Sir Howard wants to see whether such actions can be regulated .
American accountants , anticipating regulation , are scrambling to drop practices before they are forced to .
In opposition , Labour promised "" independent regulation "" .
Once in power , ministers opted to keep a modified form of self - regulation in place .
Given the errors of Enron , this should be dispensed with and Sir Howard should press ahead with reform .
The watchdog may also ponder why no bankers , share analysts or credit - rating experts spotted Enron was broke .
Maybe Enron dazzled analysts by re - inventing itself and appearing to conjure new revenue streams .
Others might try the same trick .
City institutions must be vigilant and regulators need to ensure that companies are transparent .
Failure to act on regulation might mean Sir Howard soils his reputation while cleaning up Enron 's mess ."
2002-02-02,"The top City watchdog is considering an overhaul of auditing procedures to force accountants to put shareholders ' interests first in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the Enron scandal .
Sir Howard Davies , chairman of the financial services authority , is to examine proposals that could force British companies to change their auditors every five years and limit the amount of consultancy work auditors carry out for their corporate clients .
Writing in today 's Guardian , Sir Howard says there is nothing to stop an Enron - style debacle happening in Britain ."

2002-02-03,"The row over Downing Street 's links with energy giant Enron took a new twist last night when a former vice - president of the company revealed details of secret meetings it had with key Government figures .
David Lewis , head of the firm in the UK throughout the Nineties , provided The Observer with dates of a number of meetings not disclosed last week by Number 10 .
Opposition MPs accused the Government of a ' cover - up ' to mislead the public .
The disclosure came a week after Tony Blair came under pressure when MPs alleged that Enron had been able to swing his Government 's energy policy its way after giving donations .
Enron , which wanted Labour to lift its ban on gas - fired power stations , admitted giving the party a series of gifts totalling £ 36,000 , starting in 1997 , to get access to Ministers .
Blair intervened personally to water down the ban in 1998 , and it was ended completely in November 2000 .
Lewis told The Observer the company was ' surprised ' when Labour lifted the ban because it had believed Ministers would only act after last year 's general election .
Enron executives met the then Treasury Minister , Geoffrey Robinson , on 8 May 1998 to lobby against its being imposed , he said .
The Enron executives also gave The Observer details of a crucial meeting held in Downing Street on 28 April 1998 with Geoff Norris , Blair 's senior energy adviser from the Downing Street Policy Unit .
Norris was described as being ' understanding ' about Enron 's position .
Disclosure of this meeting has fuelled speculation that this was a pivotal moment which led to Blair 's decision to intervene and ' water down ' the moratorium on the gas - fired power stations .
Lewis also gave details of a 1999 meeting with then Welsh Office minister Peter Hain .
The company was lobbying to build a gas - fired power station in Ebbw Vale .
So far this has not been built .
A further suggestion that Enron officials met Keith Vaz , the former Minister for Europe , to discuss energy deregulation in Europe , was denied by Vaz .
He said he could not recall meeting anybody from Enron .
The Foreign Office was unable to verify this independently , as it ' could not get access to official diaries ' .
Downing Street has denied it deliberately withheld details of meetings between Ministers and Enron .
A spokeswoman said : ' We were only asked to give details of meeting with DTI Ministers .
Enron is a big company with major investments in the UK .
There is nothing improper with such a company meeting Ministers or officials . '
The Treasury is coming under increasing pressure to explain why it let off Andersen Consulting , a sister company of Enron auditor Arthur Andersen , millions of pounds in fines after its disastrous scheme to introduce a new Inland Revenue computer system for National Insurance contributions .
The fiasco deprived 250,000 pensioners of hundreds of pounds each , and cost the taxpayer up to £ 150 m .
While the Government was entitled to fine Andersen £ 40 m , Treasury Ministers intervened to ensure it paid only £ 3.9 m .
The Government said then that a steep fine would ruin its relationship with Andersen and harm other Private Finance Initiative projects .
The Treasury last night said the decision on fining Andersen was taken on independent legal advice .
Matthew Taylor , Liberal Democrat economics spokesman , said : ' The links between Enron , Andersen and the Government are a spider 's web which gets more tangled the deeper you delve . '
Why did Labour conceal these meetings if they had nothing to hide .
It 's time they published a full list of their meetings with the company . ' ·
Lord Wakeham , former Tory Energy Secretary , is to be sued over his role as an Enron director by New York firefighters and police whose pension funds were invested in the collapsed company ."
2002-02-03,"As management crashes go , Enron rates a faultless 10 .
It has everything , but in reverse .
Instead of creating value , jobs , pensions and lives , it has destroyed them .
As well as ruining the reputation of business - school professors , it could well pull down its auditor , the giant Arthur Andersen .
Governments could even be dragged under too .
Enron provides a fitting epitaph to the bubble decade of the 1990s .
It is also a quintessential fable for our time , pointing up with black - and - white clarity the Faustian battle now being waged for the corporate heart and soul .
As Enron shows , it 's a battle that the devil can still win - and even now is busy turning into a damage - limitation exercise , with soothing suggestions about tighter auditing and better non - executive directors .
This is like saying you can stop people joining al - Qaeda with better passport controls .
The truth is that Enron was way past technical control , being the living embodiment of the fundamentalist management beliefs that took hold in the 1990s , with results that are now nightmarishly plain .
Let 's have a look at Enron 's anti - management doctrine point by point : · Politics must bend to the market .
Aided by the internet , a near - religious belief grew up in the 1990s that technology and capital could bypass earthbound governments and nation states , turning the globe into one giant marketplace .
To speed the conversion , at least for energy , Enron backed its fanatical zeal for deregulation with a reported $ 5.9 billion in political contributions since 1990 - and not just in the US , as we know .
Significantly , political commentators ( such as our own Nick Cohen and Greg Palast ) were sounding the alarm on these excesses while the business gurus were still fêting its apparently dazzling metamorphosis from boring energy company to weightless giant of the new economy . ·
The only measure of success is Total Shareholder Return ( TSR ) .
More than any dotcom , Enron was the ultimate bubble company .
It has been well put that instead of its soaraway share price being the result of solid commercial success , success was a smoke - and - mirrors affair based on the soaraway share price .
So long as the share price kept climbing , no one looked too closely at what ' success ' represented .
Now , there is some doubt whether the shrivelling company will be left with any net worth at all .
· What you manage is the numbers .
This is the logical consequence of using TSR as the measure of success - and Enron did it with ruthless enthusiasm .
To participate in the capital markets ' feeding frenzy , it largely abandoned the old - fashioned idea of profit ( and share performance ) as a byproduct of delivering superior value to customers , in favour of instant profit from numbers - that is , from trading , in energy , in broadband internet capacity , in anything .
As the story shows , if you 're determined ( or aggressive ) enough , managing by numbers is supremely easy .
Even Enron 's size ( it was at one point ' the seventh - largest corporation in the US ' ) was a numerical illusion , built on an accounting convention that allowed it to book the full amount of energy trades as sales , not just its own margin .
Just as fictional were its earnings , a combination of financial manipulation ( ' innovative transaction structures ' , as the prospectus for one of its off - balance - sheet partnerships boasted ) and booking future earnings as current profit - practices which , though not in themselves illegal , drove coach , horses and an entire baggage train through accountancy and audit claims to objectivity .
· Interests of shareholders , employees and managers can be aligned with stock options .
This was another of Enron 's most fervently practised beliefs .
As the unwinding saga proves , there 's nothing so dangerously un aligned as senior executives armed with their insiders ' knowledge of a company 's real position and a stack of options about to mature .
While long - serving Enron employees lost not only livelihoods but future pensions in the débcle , chairman Kenneth Lay 's Enron share - dealing profits totalled $ 145 million , on top of an already handsome salary and bonus .
As fund manager Alastair Ross Goobey remarked ruefully in a recent interview : ' I 've learnt never to underestimate human greed .
People when they 're rich beyond the dreams of avarice , still are greedy . '
· Good corporate citizenship is a voluntary add - on .
Enron was a lavish corporate donor , with a policy of giving 1 per cent of earnings to charitable and civic causes ranging from opera and ballet to medical and community centres .
Lay was also generous in support of local good causes .
At first sight this seems surprising , but not as a kind of retrospective profit - laundering .
The use of ' corporate social responsibility ' as a fig - leaf - quite separate from its business purpose - is of a piece with its overall strategy .
At the Houston company , these unholy principles locked together to create a monster , a monster that bears the same relation to capitalism as the Taliban do to mainstream Islam .
The initial reaction has been to blame external agencies such as auditors and credit - rating analysts , or internal risk analysis , or even the computer algorithms used by Enron 's traders .
In the US , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has solemnly unveiled plans to set up an independent governing body to review the big accountancy firms that regularly audit public corporations - in effect auditing the auditors .
This is understandable .
But the danger in this approach is clear .
Accounts are opinion , not fact ( a confusion exploited by Enron ) .
As such , what makes them work is not more figures - their bulkiness is already as much an obstacle as an aid to understanding - but a willingness to abide by the spirit of the exercise .
Likewise , executive management will always have an information advantage over non - execs and auditors , whatever the corporate - governance safeguards .
Formulas and formal compliance may catch some mistakes and fiddles
but they are not up to dealing with an Enron .
They may even make matters worse .
As Peter Martin pointed out in the Financial Times , business is about judgment and risk .
Imagining that those judgments can be reduced to , and uncertainty eliminated by , quantitive analysis ' may expose us to still greater dangers , by placing too much faith in analysis that will always be vulnerable to wishful thinking or outright manipulation ' .
This is to attack the wrong problem .
What 's wrong with Enron is its entire conception of what a company is .
Let 's be brutal .
The only good thing about Enron is that it is such a clear illustration of the dark side of management : as instrument of enslavement and destruction , rather than the empowering ' liberal art ' described by Peter Drucker .
Enron does n't deserve to survive , but even more importantly nor do the principles it was based on .
The answer is clear : just say no . simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2002-02-03,"When Tony met Enron I was there to witness love at first sight .
New Labour was warned about Enron and its number crunchers , Arthur Andersen , after the office of Jack Cunningham , then Tony Blair 's Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary , rang me in New York at 5 am on 21 September 1995 .
Someone in London did n't know the time difference though , from the urgency of the call , they did n't care .
An American power company had launched a bid for Sweb , the former South West Electricity Board , and Cunningham had read that I had investigated the would - be buyer 's funny accounting .
Cunningham wanted me in London pronto .
The US seizure of the British electricity industry was the embarrassing endgame of the Tory privatisation of Britain 's power industry , and Labour hoped to exploit by promising to block the US marauders and regulate the market .
I was enlisted .
On 18 October , I took Cunningham a photocopied summary of secret accounts set up by the US power firm with the approval of their auditors , Arthur Andersen .
I was illustrating a point : '
This is n't accounting , it 's a magic show .
Britain has no system of control over power plant accounting .
You 'll get skinned alive . '
Which companies should the UK beware of ?
I mentioned six , including Enron .
During our chat , Cunningham learnt he 'd lost his front - bench post
so I explained again to his successor , Margaret Beckett .
Over the next two years , I went over the details of utility accounting with Beckett and her team .
They pledged to regulate the US power buccaneers .
Once in office , the pledge vanished .
After lobbying by Enron and others Blair intervened to dilute a ban on new gas - fired power stations , helping Enron expand its UK operations .
Some thought its executives would offend him with their Texas swaggering .
In fact , he seems infatuated with hormonal US commercialism .
Enron won at every turn ."
2002-02-03,"Those who like to think that there is still some natural justice will be heartened that the first British casualty of the Enron affair is John Wakeham .
His talent for deal - making was the grease which lubricated a political career of promiscuous loyalties and an extremely lucrative business life which accumulated so many directorships that even he must struggle to remember them all .
Then along came a scandal so engulfing that even he could not dodge the fallout .
An operator whose skill lay in secretly blurring away conflicts of interest has finally been snagged by his own all - too - public conflicts of interest .
I 'll say this for John Wakeham .
He never pretended to be anything but what he was .
Whereas most politicians hope to be thought of as charismatic or visionary or principled , he gladly accepted , even relished , his reputation as the Lord of the Fix .
Seamlessly did he transfer his services from one Prime Minister to the next .
When Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp , he fixed her majorities as Chief Whip .
A favoured Wakeham device for dealing with difficult backbenchers was to interview them while painfully exercising his legs , horribly injured by the IRA 's Brighton bomb .
This wily trick melted away many a potential rebel .
When Thatcher had passed her sell - by date , he fixed up her bloodless removal by the Cabinet and silkily reoriented himself behind John Major .
When Tony Blair was in need of a Tory to rubber - stamp his own wish for an unelected Lords , he naturally reached for John Wakeham as the chair of the Royal Commission .
Reliable as ever , Super Fix delivered the conclusion that the Prime Minister wanted .
When newspaper editors were desperate for a figure to save the press from statutory regulation , the call went out for Wakeham .
Here I should declare an interest - or , rather , a lack of an interest .
I have never been the subject of a hostile judgment from the Press Complaints Commission .
There is no personal grudge lurking in the background when I wonder at the extraordinary generosity of the response to his ( sort of ) resignation as chairman of the body which regulates my profession .
The editors of the Sun and the Mirror - a pair usually to be found gouging out each other 's eyes - are in rare agreement that his lordship is an outstandingly fine fellow .
The Mirror calls him ' Lord of honour ' . '
He is a genuinely decent man .
A force for good , ' says the Sun , eulogies that may not be applauded by the thousands of Enron workers and small shareholders who were fleeced while this ' Lord of honour ' was sitting on the audit committee of the imploded energy conglomerate .
For a man to be garlanded with so much praise by the newspapers that he was supposed to be regulating must give some of their readers pause for thought .
What would we think of a departing rail regulator who was heaped with plaudits by train companies ?
Would we be suspicious if a resigning health ombudsman was the toast of hospital managers ?
I think we would .
I find myself agreeing with Charles Moore , editor of the Daily Telegraph , that there was something incestuously collusive about Lord W 's deal - making between powerful press empires and the royals , whether of the Windsor or the Blair variety of First Family .
Nor can I detect the honour in a man who steps aside from a compromised position and yet apparently intends to continue drawing the £ 156,000 a year salary for the job he will no longer be doing .
He fixes for no one more remunera tively than himself .
As Energy Secretary , he privatised the electricity industry , the first American beneficiary of which was Enron to whom he gave personal approval to build Europe 's largest gas - fired power station .
When Enron sought a British lord to adorn its board , whom should it appoint ?
Why , my Lord Wakeham , at £ 80,000 a year plus consultancy fees .
It seems to me that the smooth - operator qualities that are so admired by the chief executives of scandalous corporations , royal spin - doctors , newspaper editors and other politicians are precisely what is wrong with the Wakeham style of politicking in the eyes of most voters .
Why was the turn - out at the last election the lowest since universal suffrage ?
Why has membership of the Labour Party - as its refreshingly candid general secretary confessed to me on Radio 4 's
Westminster Hour - plunged to 280,000 ?
Why is the average age of members of the Tory party in the high sixties ?
Whether it 's not joining a party or not even being prepared to vote for a party once every five years , a large part of the reason is surely the pervasive feeling that it makes not a damn bit of difference to how we are governed .
This may be wrong - or at least exag gerated .
But it is there ; the widespread impression that public politics is synthetic , the real deal is being done by a Wakeham character sliding in the shadows .
We can complacently congratulate ourselves that it is so much worse in the United States .
Enron was the fix of all fixes .
The company 's executives tried - and for a long time succeeded - in buying the complicity , witting or unwitting , of those who should have been invigilating its activities , whether it be politicians or auditors .
Even as George W Bush enjoys stratospheric poll ratings , two - thirds of Americans think the White House is lying about its entanglement .
In the case of our government and Enron , unless there is further evidence to the contrary , we must enter the Scottish verdict of not proven .
It is not proven that the £ 36,000 spent by the company to suck up to the Labour Party impacted in any meaningful way on energy policy .
It is not proven that Andersen got easier terms or better contracts from the Government because of the gratis work it did for Labour when the party was in opposition .
The trouble for the Government is conclusively proving the negative to an electorate schooled to put the most cynical interpretation on the behaviour of its politicians .
As soon as party donations are inserted into the equation - even when it is such a relatively piffling amount - the relationship between gov ernment and companies is tainted .
A former Enron executive freely confesses that it bought its way into Labour circles to gain access to Ministers .
He does n't tell us anything we did n't know , but it is still useful to have it so baldly confirmed .
The BBC is currently torturing itself about why so many viewers find politics a switch - off .
I do n't believe the answer is that people think politics is boring .
It is that they harbour the not unfounded suspicion that the interesting bits of politics are kept cloaked .
Since Labour came into government , attendance by its members at party conferences has not grown .
It has shrunk .
Why bother going through the conference motions when you suspect that the important power - plays are being transacted at private dinners for the big donors ?
Why trust what you read about the royals when you have a hunch that behind the headline is a secret bargain between Buck Palace and the newspaper ?
Why tune in to our political correspondent with the latest from the parliamentary circus when the serious action is taking place off - stage ?
Why vote if the way so much of our politics is conducted tells you that decisions are not made in Parliament , not even in Cabinet , but by hidden wire - pullers in backrooms to which you will never be admitted ?
Fixing that is beyond the Lord of the Fixes .
Because his type put us in this fix ."
2002-02-03,"Sir Christopher Meyer , the British ambassador to Washington , emerged last night as a frontrunner to replace Lord Wakeham as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission .
Wakeham stepped aside last week after becoming embroiled in the scandal engulfing the American energy giant Enron , of which he is a director .
Publicly , the Press Board of Finance ( Presbof ) which runs the PCC , insists there is no vacancy .
Wakeham , still receiving his £ 156,000-a - year salary , has pointedly not resigned .
However , a reliable source said yesterday : ' The succession is being contemplated with some urgency .
Sir Christopher 's name is most definitely in the forefront of people 's considerations . '
Prior to his Washington posting , Meyer was press secretary to the then Prime Minister , John Major , and head of news at the Foreign Office from 1984 to 1988 .
His four - year Washington stint has been extended , and he is now expected to return to London in the autumn .
A spokesman for Meyer said : ' The ambassador has no comment to make on this matter today . '
Wakeham too is in America , where he is expected to be extensively involved in inquiries into the Enron collapse for at least two years .
He has been summoned to appear before a congressional investigation .
As well as his PCC membership , he is a director of 17 companies .
Pressbof meets on Tuesday .
The chairman 's position will be discussed , but ' you can not expect an instant appointment , ' the source said ."
2002-02-03,"Squeaky - clean Bush burns BA hopes Is British Airways the latest victim of what the markets are calling ' Enronitis ' ?
No , there is no suggestion that Lord Marshall or Rod Eddington , his friend on the BA board , were setting up bogus offshore partnerships to hide mountains of debt , nor that it hired Arthur Andersen to cook the books .
But there is a sinister theory doing the rounds at Waterside that blames BA 's latest disaster on events at the Texas company .
Last week , BA finally shelved the idea of a merger with American Airlines after the US transport authorities imposed swingeing conditions on the deal .
This seemed to come as a surprise to all at BA , as the received wisdom was that , after 11 September , Bush and Blair were so close that the President would do anything he could to help out Britain 's PM - including twisting a few arms to let the BA - AA link - up through .
The fall of Enron changed all that .
Bush suddenly had to appear beyond reproach in his corporate dealings , and could not be seen to be showing favour anywhere - least of all to a company from in his home state of Texas , like Dallas - based AA .
Sterling work Contrary to what the conspiracy theorists say , it is usually business that ultimately comes off worst when its interests conflict with those of politics .
We had another example last week , in the surprise decision to refer the proposed P&amp;O - Royal Caribbean merger to the Competition Commission .
By any normal yardstick , it is hard to see why the regulators , under a Labour government , are wasting their time on the cruise line business .
As Lady Porter can testify , if you start quibbling about the price of your cruise , you probably should n't be on the ship in the first place .
What business is it of Patricia Hewitt if one bunch of rich people - the cruise line owners - want to rip - off another lot - the cruise travellers ?
Next she 'll be getting the town hall 's weights and measures man to launch a probe into caviar mispricing .
But Tessa Jowell decided it was worth it .
Could this have anything to do with P&amp;O 's long history of guerrilla warfare against the regulators on fares and services ?
Or with the neo - Thatcherite orthodoxy of P&amp;O 's chairman , Lord Sterling , who is also a vociferous opponent of the euro ?
You bet it could .
Carlton putsch
Here 's some juicy gossip : apparently , it was Carlton , not Bertelsmann , that was making all the running when the two media groups were flirting with the idea of a merger last year .
Everyone assumed that Thomas Middelhoff , Bertelsmann 's chairman , was the main proponent of a marriage .
That made sense , as Middelhof has done little to hide his determination to extend his company 's reach beyond Germany .
But Middelhof may not be as desperate to get into bed with Carlton , headed by Michael Green , as we thought .
Why does Green want to be swallowed up by a foreign predator ?
The obvious answer is that this would avoid the unpalatable alternative of being taken over by Charles Allen 's Granada , when media ownership rules are relaxed .
There is little love lost between Carlton and Granada , both of which are struggling to make commercial sense out of loss - making ITV Digital .
But Allen 's company is bigger and stronger than Carlton - so it 's goodbye to Green if Granada pounces .
On the other hand , a merger with Bertelsmann might allow Carlton to operate relatively independently - although under the watchful eye of Didier Bellens , boss of RTL , the European broadcaster that controls Channel 5 and is owned by Bertelsmann .
Later , backed by German money , Green could turn the tables on Allen by bidding for Granada - so realising his long - cherished dream of dominating the ITV network .
Watch out , Charles .
Leighton buzzard Has former Asda boss Allan Leighton got the post office disease of putting his head in the sand , rather than thinking of ways of modernising one of the country 's most inefficient industries ?
In his new role as chairman of Consignia , the company that runs the Royal Mail and the postal network , he was suitably indignant last week about the regulator 's plans to expose the Post Office to the full rigours of competition by 2006 .
The time - frame , he argues , is too short .
But Leighton is a smart operator and certainly no Luddite .
He knows that Consignia needs to put its house in order , but the task is enormous , so who can blame him for complaining about the timetable .
Leighton must realise that anything relating to glasnost at the Post Office is a political hot potato .
So he must curb his propensity for being outspoken , especially now , as the spectre of an all - out strike by unions over pay looms ever larger .
But later , anything could happen .
A profitable , streamlined Consignia might finally be privatised .
That would mean a bucketload of share options for senior managers .
True , Leighton is only an interim chairman : he has agreed to step in to allow the company time to find a replacement for Neville Bain , who resigned last year .
But Ministers think he is a great catch and would love him to stay on .
If he does , he could collect some serious money after a float .
A perfect encore , you may think , to the killing he made when he sold Asda to Wal - Mart three years ago .
In Green Arcadia ?
Stuart Rose of Arcadia has done the right thing telling the Icelandic upstarts to Baugur off with their ill - conceived and badly executed bid approach .
It was wasting his time , damaging staff morale and ruining the reputation of a retail success story .
But now for the harder part .
Baugur is still sitting on 20 per cent of Arcadia , which will inevitably be seen as an overhang and depress the share price , while the City has given a nod and a wink that it would have accepted a bid around the 300p level .
Arcadia is vulnerable .
And what better man to put it out of its misery than Philip Green , the people 's champion who saved Bhs and is reputedly sitting on a £ 1 billion profit .
That would easily be enough to conquer Arcadia ."
2002-02-03,"There 's a drama .
How could there not be as Lord Wakeham , supreme guardian of British newspaper probity , begins to sweat through months of Enron investigation in the US ?
But is there a crisis for the Press Complaints Commission he leaves behind , probably for ever ?
That , on some anxious industry reckonings , could easily be .
Wakeham , through seven years of toiling and dealing , had almost become the PCC , its outward and visible face , its internal orchestrator .
Who else , now , can provide open lines to Buckingham Palace and Downing Street , some measure of public recognition and the clout to keep a fractious press in order ?
Charles Moore and his Daily Telegraph chunter ominously about their recent Euan Blair wigging .
Other editors do n't like the way the royals can increasingly claim special treatment , right down to the curiously genteel gavotte over Prince Harry 's pot smoking and the News of the World .
Backbenchers , a perennial source of trouble , may not be too impressed by the tabloid cash offered last week to schoolboys who told a court how their biology teacher seduced them .
The reputation of the press is , as usual , no better than the last public row questioning its behaviour .
The threat of privacy legislation - the precise threat that brought the PCC into being 11 years ago - has n't evaporated either .
Life without Wakeham will have its problems , as shrewd readers between the lines of Friday morning 's newspapers may have deduced .
Seldom has the departure of an amiable fixer been pavilioned in such fulsome praise - or buried so modestly on inside pages in the Mail and Times .
Pillars of self - regulation , such as Les Hinton of News International and Paul Dacre of the Mail , do n't want the temple collapsing on them .
The theory , hastily bolted into place , is that Wakeham will be back quite soon , cleared of any blot on his escutcheon .
Meanwhile , Professor Robert Pinker , an LSE sociologist and 11-year PCC veteran , is the safest pair of shop - minding hands available .
The reality is less assured .
Wakeham 's second term runs out anyway in June 2003 .
Everyone expects the American inquiries to grind on and on .
Pinker turns 70 in three months ' time and ca n't be a candidate for the long haul .
The search for a new , permanent chairman is already on .
The pay is £ 150,000 a year for a pretty part - time job , which also allowed Lord Wakeham to load up to 17 non - executive directorships .
It should be easy to fill .
But it is n't .
There is no model , nor any very clear job description , for what the role involves .
Lord McGregor of Durris , the first PCC boss , was another London University sociologist ( and former chairman of a Labour - initiated Royal Commission on the Press ) .
He was , by common consent , a shrewd operator and builder of organisations , but no good at all at TV soundbites in the débcles over Diana , Princess of Wales .
It was the public image bits that pulled him down and out of the job .
Wakeham , by contrast , has rarely put a foot wrong in public or private - at least after a doomed personal campaign to make Bernard Ingham , Margaret Thatcher 's former press secretary , a member of his team .
But is another old politician what the PCC needs next time round ?
And even if it , is there another one like Wakeham ?
Names with some media experience - and some bitter experience of the press - are easy enough to come up with .
Mo Mowlam if you want a retired Labour politician ; David Mellor or Paddy Ashdown if it 's another party 's turn .
None of them , though , is in the persona grata fixing business .
Lord Derry Irvine may be eventually - he used to sit on the independent panel that chooses PCC commissioners - but probably not this year or next .
In any case , Irvine is and always will be a lawyer - and lawyers , by tradition , are anathema to the PCC .
The old Press Council , McGregor believed , was silted into immobility by too many lawyers playing out too many quasi - legal rituals .
Retired judges and barristers have not been welcome in Salisbury Square , and it would be a complete U - turn to see them welcomed now .
So , if the political cupboard looks bare , and wigs are out of fashion , where can the PCC turn ?
Three renowned and experienced regulators may be there for the asking .
General Sir David Ramsbotham was Her Majesty 's Inspector of Prisons until a battered Home Office declined to renew his contract .
He 's a brave , outspoken soldier - and he used to be aide - de - camp general to the Queen , which would appear to cope with the Palace relations problem .
Elizabeth France , in one of those neat Whitehall balancing acts , is both Commissioner for Data Protection and Commissioner for ( freedom - infused ) Information ; and she 's a shrewd , impressive performer well known around press tables .
But she 's grown tired of waiting for the Government to implement its Freedom of Information Act and has testily signalled her exit .
Where better to defend such information more broadly than from the PCC ?
And then , of course , there 's the most embattled regulator of them all , Elizabeth Filkin , out of her Commons standards job in 10 days ' time .
A good administrator , a proven battler after truth , she has a public profile calculated to send troublesome MPs running for cover .
How could they attack a press that had hired the regulator they cravenly deemed too hot to handle their own affairs ?
Such possibilities , once posed , swiftly turn into questions for the press itself .
They pay to keep the PCC going ; they value a relationship with its chairman .
Would a France or a Filkin be too abrasive ( which is another way of saying too punctiliously professional ) ?
Politicians have their traditional virtues .
When do Chris Patten or Neil Kinnock come back from Europe ?
Perhaps , for multi - media hands , Lord David Puttnam has the profile , subtlety and nous to become the lateral thinkers ' favourite contender .
But it is n't easy , because it asks the PCC to define itself anew in a world where the great and the good tend to go missing , helping the authorities with their inquiries .
No wonder the tears shed for Wakeham flowed so copiously .
Great story - bitter end ."
2002-02-04,"Sir Howard Davies ( Could Enron happen here ?
Yes , it could , February 2 ) makes some suggestions as to how to prevent audit services being influenced by the weight of consulting services from the same firm , an important element of the Enron mess .
He concludes with an appeal for disclosure , but ignores the simplest and most effective option : auditors should disclose , in their audit report , all contracts they have with the firm they are auditing .
This would make the objectivity of an audit report far more obvious .
It is even possible , with a more informed market , that shareholders will insist on auditors who stick to their knitting .
Adrian Henriques Social auditor , London adrian@henriques.co.uk
Could Enron happen here ?
Yes , it could , Letter , February 2 )
At a meeting of Labour 's national executive in January 1999 , I raised strong objections to the acceptance of financial support from Enron , given its record of human rights abuses and the potential conflicts of interest it posed .
In June 1999 , in a formal submission to the party 's review on financial relations , I noted again the objections to taking money from Enron and other companies where similar concerns arose .
There was no response of any kind to my objections to Enron .
One of the reason I left the executive and subsequently the Labour party was this manifest indifference to the most elementary ethical concerns .
The issue goes far beyond Enron .
With New Labour now firmly in the global camp of the rich and powerful , big business is able to dominate political decision - making , and those without large sums of money are left voiceless - unless we build an alternative .

2002-02-04,"Senior Enron employees made millions of dollars from secret partnerships that violated basic rules of accounting and ethics , according to an internal report which seeks to shift blame for the firm 's implosion away from its chief executive and directors .
The 218-page report , released on Saturday night , shows that the company hid losses of $ 1bn ( £ 700 m ) in the year to September 2001 - not the $ 586 m over five years that had previously been announced .
It portrays Andrew Fastow , Enron 's chief financial officer until last October , as the central villain , accusing him of making personal gains of at least $ 30 m from the off - the - book partnerships .
Chief executive Kenneth Lay , the report finds , did not have full knowledge of the partnerships and was merely "" inattentive "" , although he must take "" ultimate responsibility "" for the energy trader 's collapse .
Andersen , the auditors implicated in the scandal , immediately condemned the report as "" extremely self - serving "" and rejected its claim that Enron 's internal investigators had been refused access to relevant Andersen documents . ""
The authors of this report , whose independence has already been questioned , were hand - picked by Enron 's board , "" said Charlie Leonard , a spokesman for the auditors .
"" Their conclusions appear to be extremely self - serving .
The report falsely states that Andersen did not cooperate with the authors .
On the contrary , the authors rebuffed several attempts by Andersen to provide input to the report . ""
The internal investigation team was led by William Powers , an Enron director and dean of the University of Texas law school .
His findings were filed with the federal bankruptcy court in New York on Saturday .
The report accuses Andersen of benefiting from two suspect partnerships , known as LJM and Chewco . ""
Enron 's records show that Andersen billed Enron $ 5.7 m for advice in connection with the LJM and Chewco transactions alone , above and beyond its regular audit fees , "" Powers ' team found .
They also said Enron 's principal lawyers , Vinson and Elkins , "" should have brought a stronger , more objective and more critical voice to the disclosure process "" .
In one of the unmonitored transactions , they found , Mr Fastow made $ 4.5 m in two months from a partnership investment of $ 25,000 .
Mr Powers would not comment on his findings before testifying to Congress this week , except to say that his intent was "" to shed light on certain related party transactions ...
I believe the report does that "" .
While accusing Mr Fastow and others of accumulating "" tens of millions of dollars they should never have received "" , the report does find the directors and chief executive indirectly responsible . ""
The board can not be faulted for failing to act on information that was withheld , but it can be faulted for the limited scrutiny it gave to the transactions between Enron and the LJM partnerships .
""
As "" the captain of the ship "" , Mr Lay should have ensured that oversight procedures were more rigorous , while president and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling bears "" substantial responsibility "" for similar failings .
Enron said it would be setting up a restructuring committee . ""
The report has made the board aware of numerous past events for the first time .
These events are deeply regretted by the board .
""
The company 's lawyer , Robert Bennett , said the report demonstrated that Enron "" did an honourable job in investigating its own problems and publicly releasing a report about them "" .
Lord Wakeham , who sat on Enron 's board and was a member of its audit and compliance committee , is not named in the report .
But his committee is damned for its alleged incompetence .
With more aggression and vigilance , abuses might have been prevented , the report says .
"" The board assigned the audit and compliance committee an expanded duty to review the [ suspect ] transactions , but the committee carried out the reviews only in a cursory way . """
2002-02-04,"A group of Harvard students and alumni have called for an investigation into possible links between an Enron director on the university 's governing corporation and the timely selling of stock which netted an estimated $ 50 m as the company 's shares declined .
HarvardWatch , which campaigns for more open governance of the university , admits it has no evidence of insider trading but is urging the suspension of Herbert "" Pug "" Winokur from the seven - member corporation pending the outcome of a "" credible investigation into alleged financial improprieties regarding the management of the university 's endowment "" .
The university said Mr Winokur , who chairs Enron 's finance committee , was a "" valued member "" of the Harvard Corporation .
A Harvard alumnus , he has , since 1995 , been on the board of the Harvard Management Company which oversees the university 's $ 18bn endowment .
Joe Wrinn , a university spokesman , said HMC did not participate in investment decisions by Highfields Capital Management , a hedge fund which manages about $ 2bn of the endowment , and which bought "" put options "" on Enron shares , enabling it to profit when the shares fell .
Highfields declined to comment on the assertions .
But W Neil Eggleston , a lawyer who is representing Enron 's outside directors , told the New York Times : "" Mr Winokur has a long history of personal and financial commitment to Harvard , and he has no plans to walk away from the institution .
Winokur had no involvement with Highfields Capital and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to short sell Enron stock is just plain wrong . ""
HarvardWatch admits it has no evidence of wrongdoing , but calls for greater openness and accountability about the role of Enron and other corporations in Harvard .
More generally , the group argues that Enron shaped Harvard 's research agenda , contributing millions of dollars to research centres that advocated the deregulation of the energy industry .
In Trading Truth : a report on Harvard 's Enron entanglements , students say Harvard Business School produced "" glowing studies "" of Enron just before the company imploded .
Backing the students ' call , consumer champion Ralph Nader said their report revealed the "" latest chapter in the long - running story of the hijacking of Harvard University 's name and reputation by corporate interests "" .
He said : "" Companies like Enron have learned that small investments in endowing chairs , sponsoring research programmes or hiring moonlighting professors can return big payoffs in generating books , reports , articles , testimony and other materials to push for and rationalise public policy positions that damage the public interest but benefit corporate bottom lines . ""
Mr Nader urged the university 's new president , Lawrence Summers , to go beyond "" modest tinkering "" with conflict of interest rules and undertake a top - to - bottom review of its multiple interconnections with large corporations , including through research sponsorships and consulting arrangements with professors .
"" It is time to establish boundaries that establish precise limits on the university 's corporate entanglements .
There is need for a clear and comprehensive policy on the limits of commercialism on Harvard University and for pro - active efforts at the university to spur research guided by public - spirited , rather than mercantile , values , "" he said ."
2002-02-04,"A US Senate committee today cancelled a hearing on Enron after the energy company 's former chairman , Kenneth Lay , decided at the last minute not to appear .
Mr Lay would have been the star witness on Capitol Hill in a week full of congressional hearings into the collapse of America 's seventh largest company amid allegations of accounting shenanigans .
Mr Lay , a friend and big financial backer of the US president , George Bush , dropped out after several senators and House members suggested that he and other company executives engaged in criminal acts .
Earl Silbert , an attorney for Mr Lay , said his client "" can not be expected to participate in a proceeding in which conclusions have been reached before Mr Lay has been given an opportunity to be heard .
These inflammatory statements show that ... the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial . ""
Senators fumed at Mr Lay 's last minute decision .
Senator Peter Fitzgerald , a Republican from Illinois , said : "" Mr Lay is taking a dive ...
Mr Lay is the captain of the ship and he needs to explain why his ship has sunk . ""
With a criminal inquiry into the biggest bankruptcy in US history at the justice department and new information about irregular accounting practices , an increasing number of witnesses are refusing to testify before congressional committees .
Andrew Fastow , Enron 's much - criticised former chief financial officer , and Michael Kopper , another former Enron executive , are to appear on Thursday , but are expected to stay silent by invoking their constitutional right not to incriminate themselves .
David Duncan , a senior partner at Andersen , Enron 's financial auditor , last week used the same tactic .
Congressional officials today said they would discuss whether to subpoena Mr Lay , but they were not interested in offering him limited immunity against prosecution in exchange for his testimony .
Mr Lay 's non - appearance was a blow to many former Enron employees , who had organised "" Watch Kenny "" gatherings to hear what their former boss has to say about the company 's meltdown .
"" Why did he lie to us and tell us everything was just great when it was not ? "" asked Sue Nix , a former Enron employee .
"" People can accept the truth .
The constant lies are what is hard . ""
Mr Lay 's decision came a day after the released of an Enron - authorised review that portrayed Mr Fastow as the central villain while describing Mr Lay as merely "" inattentive "" , although he must take "" ultimate responsibility "" .
The internal report said that Andersen was aware of the secretive partnerships Enron used to manipulate profits and conceal debt .
But Andersen , fired by Enron last month , criticised the report an "" extremely self - serving "" attempt by Enron to shift the blame ."
2002-02-04,"No sensible person can honestly believe that New Labour made a corrupt bargain with either Enron or Arthur Andersen .
Since my relationship with the party is that of a forsaken lover , cynics might argue that I would be the last to know .

2002-02-04,"The row over the web of influence built up by the collapsed energy giant Enron deepened yesterday as it emerged that Downing Street failed to disclose a number of meetings the company held with ministers and key advisers to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown .
As No 10 continued to reject suggestions that Enron 's cash donations to Labour had bought it access to government , details also came to light of donations totalling almost £ 1 m made by the corporation to the Prince of Wales 's charity , the Prince 's Trust .
The former Enron chief executive , Kenneth Lay , entertained the prince with a lunch in Houston , and executives met him at a private dinner at Highgrove , the prince 's country home in Gloucestershire .
The revelation of Enron 's royal links , together with the disclosure by the firm 's own executives of five hitherto unreported meetings with government decision makers , will raise fresh questions over how far the company 's contacts extended as it sought to further its interests in Britain .
The company , which wanted the government to lift its moratorium on gas - fired power stations , has admitted giving £ 38,000 , through event sponsorship , to Labour from 1997 .
It also donated around £ 25,000 in sponsorship to the Conservatives .
Tony Blair intervened in 1998 to water down the bias towards coal , and the gas ban ended in 2000 .
Downing Street did not deny revelations of the further meet ings , which were not included in a detailed timetable of Enron 's formal contacts with ministers issued last week .
Enron says its European chief executive Mark Frevert met Geoff Norris , Mr Blair 's senior energy adviser in the Downing Street policy unit , in No 10 in April 1998 to discuss the future of British energy policy .
In a separate meeting on the same subject , Enron International 's chief operating officer Jeffrey Skilling met Ed Balls , the chancellor 's chief economic adviser , at the Treasury .
Enron executives also met the then paymaster general , Geoffrey Robinson , in May 1998 and Welsh minister Peter Hain .
Keith Vaz , former minister for Europe , yesterday said he had no recollection of a claimed meeting with company representatives to discuss European energy policy .
A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday : "" There is nothing extraordinary or improper in government officials or ministers regularly meeting representatives of industry , including those who are responsible for many jobs in this country .
That was the case with Enron . ""
The Prince 's Trust said it received corporate donations of at least £ 800,000 from Enron over an eight - year period , ending in 1999 .
A trust spokeswoman said : "" This sort of donation would be quite normal .
We are dealing with corporations all the time . """
2002-02-04,"Press reaction to Lord Wakeham 's decision to stand down from the press complaints commission chairmanship was almost unanimous .
Most papers thought the arch fixer had behaved like a true gent by moving aside temporarily to deal with questions about his part in the collapse of US energy corporation , Enron .
The daily tabloids were particularly effusive in their praise . ""
He is a genuinely decent man , "" noted the Sun .
The Mirror said it would welcome back the "" lord of honour "" .
The Daily Mail remarked on his "" considerable achievements "" .
The broadsheets were split .
The Guardian congratulated him for "" speedily and gracefully stepping down "" , while the Times 's commentator , Brian MacArthur , recalled his success in navigating various difficulties "" with skill and aplomb "" .
But the Independent 's heavily angled news report was more critical , accentuating the concerns of Wakeham 's detractors , pointing to supposed inconsistencies in decision - making and noting accusations that he has been "" too wary of causing offence to some institutions - notably Buckingham Palace and Number 10 "" .
That was mild compared to the Daily Telegraph 's full - page assault on the credibility of both Wakeham and the PCC , especially its director Guy Black .
In a prolonged polemic , masquerading as a background news feature , the paper made a series of allegations which came close to calling Black a liar .
One tabloid editor , astonished by both its tone and content , told me that if such a scurrilous piece about a public figure had appeared in , say , the Daily Mail , one of the first papers to clamber on to the moral high ground and complain would have been the Telegraph .
The central accusation involved Black and his predecessor as PCC director , Mark Bolland , who is now deputy private secretary to the Prince of Wales .
The two men also happen to live together .
According to the Telegraph , Black and Bolland conspired with the editor of the News of the World , Rebekah Wade , over the publication of two royal stories .
It also suggested that a PCC leak provided material to the Mail on Sunday .
Its editor , Peter Wright , has strenuously denied the claim .
The article prompted Wright , Wade and Black to fire off strong letters of protest to the Telegraph 's editor Charles Moore on Friday .
A further letter of complaint was sent by Prince Charles 's private secretary , Stephen Lamport .
Wade wrote of the Telegraph 's "" continuing nonsense "" and concluded : "" Approval for our report was neither sought from the PCC before publication , nor given .
Indeed , I was not aware that it was the PCC 's role to "" approve "" stories .
If it were I doubt you would have got away with printing such rubbish . ""
An unbowed Moore called for a complete overhaul of the PCC 's procedures .
"" I have n't got a blueprint for what should be done , "" he said .
"" But , at the moment , the PCC has the appearance of being a bit of a stitch - up . ""
Many PCC members believe the Telegraph 's hostility is fuelled by Moore 's anger at the commission upholding a complaint by the prime minister and his wife that the paper intruded into the privacy of their eldest son , Euan .
In publishing the PCC 's adjudication , the Telegraph also ran a lengthy piece of self - justification which , albeit obliquely , questioned the merits of the ruling .
That specific case aside , Moore has long viewed self - regulation with scepticism .
It may be the only topic on which he and Independent editor Simon Kelner agree .
Both men have been concerned at what they deem to be close relationships between the PCC and tabloid editors , concentrating their fire on Black .
A number of editors are alarmed at this turn of events .
One told me : "" Black may have made a mistake by going on holiday with Wade , but that does n't detract from his immense value to the continuance of self - regulation . ""
He has a first - rate brain and works tirelessly behind the scenes , meeting politicians and judges , to explain why the PCC is so important .
He is the best defender of press freedom we have .
"" I also believe Black to be utterly straight .
In my dealings with him I have never known him to act unethically .
But he does face a problem because he has emerged - courtesy of the press for which he acts - as a public figure and needs to be careful to safeguard his reputation .
That task will possibly be more difficult in the coming months because Black has a higher public profile than Wakeham 's temporary replacement , Professor Robert Pinker .
A likeable and energetic man with a fine record as an academic , Pinker will need time to acclimatise to the spotlight .
Wakeham 's post certainly wo n't be filled on a permanent basis .
His PCC contract runs until June 2003 and it would be wrong , morally and legally , to replace him while he fights to clear his name over his role as an Enron non - executive director .
Then again , the episode is certain to be top of the agenda when the PCC 's funding and governing body , the press standards board of finance ( Pressbof ) , holds its regular meeting tomorrow .
Though it 's extremely unlikely that the board , chaired by Sir Harry Roche , will start the process of scouting for Wakeham 's successor , they know that replacing him will be difficult and will require a lot of thought .
The 11 newspaper executives , led by Roche , who make up the board will alone take the decision .
The criteria are tough .
Candidates must have no connection with magazine and newspaper publishing , though that should n't necessarily rule out people who have been out of the industry for a long time .
Naturally , the person must be sympathetic to the concept of self - regulation .
Just as importantly , he or she will need to be experienced at coping with the media , at both private and public levels .
Our suggestions are not meant to be taken too seriously , though Kaufman and Dubs may well be given some consideration .
There are five areas in which Pressbof will probably trawl .
The first is among retired politicians , though the difficulty is that - unlike Wakeham - few of them genuinely believe in self - regulation .
Most MPs would like to see the press subject to a privacy law , but it is also recognised that no government would ever allow such a law to be passed .
Secondly , the board may consider retired judges and lawyers .
Again , there are difficulties : judges are usually 75 when they retire ; most value the law above self - regulation ; and previous experiences , when judges were chosen as press council chairmen , suggest they prefer to create precedents with their adjudications .
Thirdly , there are academics , such as the first PCC chairman , Lord McGregor , and Pinker .
The problem is whether people from such a background have the necessary flexibility of thought and the ability to deal with conflict resolution .
They may also find it difficult to cope with media attention .
Fourthly , and more hopefully , the board should consider former civil servants , who usually retire in their late 50s or early 60s .
They would have the clarity of intellect , would n't have the instinct to legalise and would have experience of seeking a consensus .
They would also have access to an informal network of the great and the good along with political connections .
The same could be said of the fifth group , retired diplomats who would have the additional advantage of having played a semi - public role .
Underlying such choices is the recognition that the PCC acts as a conciliatory buffer between newspaper and complainant rather than a quasi - courtroom .
I suspect this is anathema to the Telegraph 's Moore and to bodies such as Presswise which acts for people upset by newspaper activities .
But that 's what the PCC was always meant to be in order to avoid the reg ular clashes which besmirched the pre-1990 press council .
One other item Roche might like to raise with the Pressbof membership tomorrow is how to head off the potentially damaging effect of the Telegraph 's animosity towards the PCC .
Unfortunately , one of the board 's 10 members who wo n't be attending is the Telegraph 's managing director Jeremy Deedes because he is away in South Africa .
In his absence , perhaps the board would like to consider the fact that , for all its bleating about intrusion by tabloids , the Telegraph published every detail of the News of the World 's story about the Countess of Wessex using her royal connections for her commercial advantage .
It also gave a full account of another NoW scoop , about Prince Harry 's drinking and drug - taking , despite taking the PCC to task for having allowed the story to be published in the first place .
Three editors spoke to me in the harshest terms on Friday about the "" stinking hypocrisy "" of the Telegraph in those instances .
One of them added : "" It 's time that dogs stopped biting dogs , that we stopped crapping on each other .
No one can doubt that the editors ' code has led to a better press .
I now have to think about the code before I publish every story .
Self - regulation works . ""
Doubtless , the tabloids ' applause for Wakeham will only serve to confirm Moore 's view that he was too close to their editors .
But he should be urged to reconsider by comparing the current situation with the truly lawless phase of the late 1980s and the backsliding period of the early 1990s .
The press is imperfect and self - regulation is imperfect .
There is room for improvement and I have no intention of releasing the pressure to ensure that every imperfection is highlighted .
But one also needs a sense of proportion .
Charles , I 'm afraid that you 've lost yours at the moment .
Who 's in the frame ?
Gerald Kaufman Veteran Labour MP .
Media - savvy , sharp , intelligent and no pussycat .
But he would have to resign his seat .
Some editors might find him too acerbic - famously clashed as commons media committee chairman with Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie .
Odds :
25 - 1 Lord ( Alf ) Dubs Ex - Labour MP .
Chairman of Broadcasting Standards Commission ( due to disappear when Ofcom arrives ) .
Straightforward , pleasant and experienced at regulating .
But does he have a high enough public profile for the job ?
Odds : 30 - 1 David Mellor Ex - Tory minister , famous for saying that the press is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon .
Now a Sunday People columnist .
But many editors do not respect him .
Others may feel the exposure of his adultery by the tabloids means he has an axe to grind .
Odds : 50 - 1 Donald Trelford Former Observer editor and ex - professor of journalism .
No industry links as an executive for years .
Knows the score .
Showed great diplomatic skills in running a paper under the intrusive Tiny Rowland .
But editors never trust other editors , even those from the past .
Odds :
75 - 1 Christine Hamilton Wife of disgraced Tory MP Neil .
Opinionated , outspoken , obstreperous with a high public profile .
On the upside , would be able to handle press attention and hot on privacy and chequebook journalism issues .
Odds : not in this lifetime"
2002-02-05,"The Senate commerce committee today summoned Kenneth Lay to appear before Congress , but Enron 's former chairman appears to have gone to ground .
The Senate panel issued a subpoena after Mr Lay abruptly cancelled a congressional appearance scheduled yesterday .
But Mr Lay 's attorney , Earl Silbert , said he could not accept a subpoena in his client 's name , partly because he did not know Lay 's whereabouts .
"" My feeling is we have no choice , "" said senator Byron Dorgan , chairman of the commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs and a Democrat from North Dakota .
"" Based on what we have learned in the interim ... we know that we really need to compel the testimony of Mr. Lay . ""
Even if he did appear , congressional officials are unlikely to get much out of Mr Lay as he would almost certainly cite his fifth amendment right to remain silent so as not to incriminate himself .
At least 11 committees and subcommittees , the justice department and the securities and exchange commission are investigating the collapse of what was once America 's seventh largest company .
The biggest bankruptcy in US history has left thousands of workers unemployed and their retirement funds shrunken because most of their investments were in now nearly worthless Enron stock .
Mr Lay is sought for questioning to determine how much he knew about Enron 's creative accounting techniques to hide huge debt and losses .
"" It 's not possible to figure out what caused this huge Enron ship to capsize if you ca n't hear from the captain , "" said Senator Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat .
Mr Lay , who lives in Houston but also has homes elsewhere , including Galveston , Texas , and Aspen , Colorado , resigned yesterday from Enron 's board after stepping down as Enron chairman on January 23 .
Enron and Mr Lay have been among President George Bush 's largest campaign contributors .
An attorney for Lay has said the former executive declined to appear before the senate panel because of the prosecutorial tone of lawmakers investigating the bankrupt energy giant .
An Enron internal investigation released at the weekend found that there was a "" systematic and pervasive "" attempt by senior Enron mangers to "" misrepresent the company 's financial condition "" through the use of partnerships .
Those partnerships had no economic value to Enron except to hide debt and artificially inflate profits on Enron 's balance sheet , the report said .
It said Mr Lay approved the arrangements under which Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , created the partnerships and that the Enron chairman "" bears significant responsibility "" for not preventing the abuses
that this "" inherent conflict of interest "" created .
The internal report also criticised Enron 's board of directors for the partnerships - especially one led by Mr Fastow - and for not pursuing more aggressively questions about their operation ."
2002-02-05,"As Enron 's former chief executive , Kenneth Lay , failed to show up for a congressional hearing yesterday , attention began to focus on his personal finances , amid claims that he may not be as hard up as his family has claimed .
Like his former employees , Mr Lay finds himself with worthless Enron shares on his hands ; 3 m in his case .
But unlike his workers , he was able to sell off much of his company stock over the past three years for an estimated $ 100 m ( £ 70 m ) , whileencouraging Enron staff to keep buying the doomed shares .
He also holds $ 10 m in stock in other companies in which he served as a director or board member - such as Eli Lilly , the pharmaceutical company and the computer maker Compaq .
The Lays have put three houses and some land on the market for a total of $ 15 m in the ski resort of Aspen , including a 1,400 sq metre ( 4,500 sq ft ) log cabin .
They may also sell a house in Texas .
That would hardly put them on the street , however .
The family still owns more than a dozen properties in Texas .
At the end of December , the Lays owned homes and land worth an estimated total of $ 31.8 m , according to financial reports .
Their main home , a penthouse in a Houston skyscraper , is worth at least $ 8 m .
Mr Lay , the child of a Baptist preacher who grew up poor in Missouri , also went out of his way to spread his wealth with his relatives .
Enron staff who called the company travel office to book air tickets found themselves being transferred automatically to Travel Agency in the Park , a private company co - owned by Ken Lay 's younger sister , Sharon .
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission , the company ( renamed Alliance Worldwide in December ) got half its business ( some $ 6.8 m ) from big brother 's company .
Time magazine quoted former Enron employees as saying they were strongly discouraged from making bookings elsewhere , despite the $ 30-per - ticket fee charged by TAP .
Another major beneficiary of Enron nepotism was Ken Lay 's 33-year - old son , Mark .
In 1997 , Enron bought a paper manufacturer which Mark Lay happened to co - own .
As part of the deal , the younger Lay was given a three - year $ 850,000 management contract .
According to the New York Times , Mark Lay also owned or worked for three other companies that did business with Enron .
Despite these extensive business dealings , the magnate 's son still has time to attend a Baptist seminary in Houston , from where he has refused , so far , to comment .
In Houston his family has mounted a public relations campaign with the ambitious goal of convincing America that they too are victims of the deepening scandal .
Mr Lay 's wife , Linda , and his legal team have told journalists that the former colossus of the Texas energy market had the wool pulled over his eyes by scheming underlings .
Linda Lay , once the most sought - after society hostess in Houston , stretched national credulity further by weeping on television and complaining , "" We 've lost everything "" .
"" There 's nothing left .
Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock , "" she said .
Reactions in Texas and Washington have mainly echoed the disgruntled Enron worker who flatly asked Mr Lay at a company meeting last year : "" I would like to know if you are on crack .
If so , that would explain a lot . ""
· The TUC and its American counterpart , the AFL - CIO , have called for an investigation by the Institute of Chartered Accountants into the position of Lord Wakeham , who is a former director of Enron .
Lord Wakeham , who worked as a chartered accountant before entering politics , stood aside as the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission last week and flew to America for talks with lawyers ."
2002-02-05,"The Enron scandal exploded into open political warfare yesterday , as Congress declared its intention to subpoena the bankrupt energy trader 's former chief executive , Kenneth Lay , and the Democrats accused the Bush administration of running a "" cash - and - carry "" government on behalf of the disgraced company .
Mr Lay failed to turn up to the first day of congressional hearings into Enron 's collapse , amid signs that what was initially interpreted as a corporate disaster could also emerge as a huge criminal fraud .
After congressmen appeared on television at the weekend accusing Enron executives of "" corporate corruption "" , and suggesting someone may end up going to jail for insider trading , Mr Lay withdrew his offer to testify . ""
These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial , "" his lawyer , Earl Silbert , wrote to the Senate commerce committee and the House financial services committee .
Democrats and Republicans lined up to support the issue of subpoenas to force Mr Lay to come before their committees .
Last night Mr Lay said he was stepping down from Enron 's board .
Mr Lay had already resigned as chief executive officer , but had retained his seat on the board , giving rise to criticism that he was trying to control the investigation into Enron 's affairs .
Senator Ernest Hollings , the Democratic chairman of the Senate commerce committee , told a press conference that a vote would be held today on issuing a subpoena that would force Mr Lay to appear a week later , on February 12 .
His Republican counterparts on the committee said they would support the subpoena , but were horrified when Mr Hollings transformed the press conference into the most vituperative attack to date on President George Bush 's role in the Enron scandal .
He accused Mr Bush and his administration of being in Enron 's pocket , and creating a "" culture of government corruption "" .
"" I 've never seen a better example of cash- and - carry government than this Bush administration and Enron , "" he said .
"" Specifically , everyone knows how the Bushes got the cash , "" he added , referring to Enron as "" the largest contributor to the Republican committee running the convention and the inaugural committee and everything else like that "" .
He recited a list of cabinet members and other administration officials who he claimed had formerly been on the Enron payroll , as employees , advisers or lawyers .
The list included the attorney general , John Ashcroft , whom the senator described as "" Enron 's man "" ; the president 's economic adviser , Lawrence Lindsey ; the army secretary , Thomas White ; and the energy secretary , Spencer Abraham .
He accused them all of pursuing policies that were favourable to Enron .
The justice department issued a statement rejecting the Democrats ' demands for the appointment of a special counsel to look into the Enron scandal .
It insisted there was no conflict of interests involved in the inquiry it was conducting .
Mr Ashcroft had earlier excused himself from the investigation as he received financial backing from Enron for his senatorial campaign in the 2000 elections .
Mr Hollings 's attack drew rebukes from congressional Republicans .
The party 's leader in the Senate , Trent Lott , said the Democrats were "" exploiting the financial tragedy of thousands of Enron employees and those who had Enron stock for their own political purposes "" .
Andrew Fastow , the former chief financial officer , and Michael Kopper , another former Enron executive , are expected to appear before a house committee on Thursday but are likely to invoke their fifth amendment right not to testify to avoid self - incrimination .
Even if Mr Lay is forced to appear , he may invoke the same right .
An internal report commissioned by the Enron board and published on Saturday found executives had creamed millions from the firm through shell companies , breaking ethical and accounting rules .
The report , conducted by a Texas law professor , William Powers , also found that Enron executives had sold off millions in company shares while employees were forced to hold on to Enron stock in their pension funds .
Responding to the report , the Republican head of the house energy committee , Billy Tauzin , said "" somebody ought to go to the pokey for this "" ."
2002-02-05,"Irish drugs company Elan was engulfed by a wave of panic about alleged Enron - style accounting yesterday as its market value collapsed by € 4.5bn ( £ 2.75bn ) following a profit warning and fresh revelations about its debt .
Elan , which began the day as the largest company on the Dublin stock exchange , disclosed that if two "" qualified special purpose entities "" were included in its accounts , its indebtedness would rise from $ 1.98bn to $ 2.98bn .
It revealed the size of the accounting vehicles in a footnote to its year - end results .
The results contained a warning that problems with an Alzheimer 's disease drug , slowing product sales and extra costs would hit profits in 2002 .
Only a week ago , Elan responded to a 30 % drop in its share price by saying it "" knew of no reason "" for the decline .
The shares , which account for almost a quarter of Ireland 's ISEQ index , yesterday plummeted by € 14.5 to € 29.5 .
Chairman Donal Gleaney angrily rejected any comparison with Enron , the US energy trader which went bust last month due to large debts in off - balance sheet vehicles .
"" The only thing we have in common with Enron is that you spell both companies with an ' E ' , "" said Mr Gleaney .
"" We have real sales and a real pipeline of products . ""
But Elan 's explanation for its profits warning failed to satisfy analysts .
The company 's reasons included extra spending on late - stage clinical trials , expansion of its salesforce and the costs of establishing a European infrastructure - which one industry expert said were "" not unforeseeable "" .
A Dublin - based drugs analyst said he was "" somewhat surprised "" by the extent of Elan 's debt pile : "" There 's only a 5 % to 10 % difference between their total indebtedness and their shareholders ' equity - it 's clearly an issue . ""
Elan 's accounts have been audited by accountancy firm KPMG since the late 1970s .
Vice - chairman Tom Lynch joined from KPMG - where he is understood to have worked on Elan 's accounts .
One of Ireland 's biggest business success stories of the 1990s , Elan grew through a rapid series of acquisitions financed by sales of nicotine patches and circulatory drugs .
The board includes the Bank of Ireland 's governor Laurence Crowley , Merrill Lynch 's chairman emeritus Daniel Tully and former US attorney general Richard Thornburgh .
Elan reported year - end profits of $ 347 m , but admitted that fell to $ 211 m if including its special "" entities "" .
It has a string of joint ventures and third - party deals to develop drugs with biotech companies .
David Maris , an analyst at CSFB in New York , said : "" Playing hide and seek with earnings is no longer tolerated , and we would expect the stock to reflect that . ""
He added : "" This is an unmitigated disaster - we think when investors get through the details you 'll find out shenanigans have accounted for the majority of Elan 's earnings . ""
Elan pointed out that its debts were long term , with just $ 300 m for repayment this year .
It has a warchest of $ 2bn in cash and equities .
But a Dublin - based analyst , who would not be named , said : "" Their products are not selling as well , their development pipeline is not doing as well as expected
and they 're taking hits on all sides .
Their credibility is absolutely destroyed .

2002-02-05,"Just as the government struggles to shake off one scandal , it is entangling itself in several more .
Almost every day for the past fortnight , Labour has been embarrassed by new revelations about the favours it has exchanged with the disgraced companies Enron and Andersen .
And almost every day for the past fortnight , the government has been stocking up future trouble by granting companies even more extravagant concessions .
On Sunday , Tony Blair spoke of his determination to continue bringing corporations into government by means of the private finance initiative , which has already become the occasion for most of the trouble about Andersen 's role .
One of the Sunday newspapers claims that the government will announce its decision to part - privatise the London underground on Thursday .
Stephen Byers , the transport secretary , appears to be preparing his case : on Saturday he sought to dismiss comparisons between the privatisation of the railways and "" public private partnerships "" .
Other government spokespeople were forced , last week , to pour scorn on similar comparisons between the break - up of the railways and the rushed privatisation of the Post Office .
On Thursday , Greenpeace released a leaked summary of the government 's energy review , which shows that Labour , despite manifesto promises to the contrary , will not now rule out the construction of new nuclear power stations .
On the same day , the government announced 44 new trials of genetically engineered crops , which will be planted so close to fields of conventional crops that the further contamination of the food chain is guaranteed .
Today , parliament will debate the varied and fascinating career of John Birt , the government 's transport adviser , who turns out to be working for one of Britain 's major transport operators , Richard Branson .
The government seems to be looking for trouble .
So what on earth is going on ?
Given that the government 's love affair with big business provides the substance of all the major scandals it has suffered since taking office , why does it keep hopping into bed with corporate power ?
The commonest explanation is encapsulated in a phrase which has been used liberally over the past fortnight : cash for access .
The Labour party 's admission at the weekend that it now has an overdraft of £ 6 - 10 m reinforces the impression that Tony Blair will do anything for money .
Last week Polly Toynbee argued on these pages that "" only an absolute ban on any donations , in cash or kind , will have the public impact to repair Westminster 's sleazy reputation "" .
Her proposal makes sense , but I fear that the problem runs much deeper than that .
Corporations in Britain could get what they wanted from the government even if they never gave the Labour party a penny .
Labour is the rope being yanked in a woefully uneven tug of war .
On one end are some of the trades unions , such as Unison and the GMB , led by the people whom Blair attacked on Sunday as "" small ' c ' conservatives who believe the old ways will do "" .
Alongside them are a handful of pressure groups , such as Corporate Watch , the World Development Movement , Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace , and some tens of thousands of enthusiastic but disorganised protesters .
On the other end is just about every institution and individual wielding real power in the United Kingdom .
The anchorman at the end of the rope is the corporate sector and its well - resourced and effective lobby groups .
His constant traction results from his adherence to the oldest rule of the game : however much rope you are given
, you must always demand more .
Blair 's government , in response to pressure from the CBI , has granted British companies the lowest corporation tax in the rich world , a planning system which prevents citizens from challenging corporate developers and the most lax environmental standards in Europe , yet still the lobby group bellows that the government is creating a hostile climate for business .
Clinging to the anchorman 's thigh , so tightly that it is sometimes hard to tell where the corporations end and the party begins , is the parliamentary opposition .
Along the line , less consistent in its force , is the civil service and the quangocracy .
There are at least 40 senior civil servants and taskforce chairs who are charged with regulating companies which once employed them to fight the very measures they are now supposed to enforce .
The result is a creeping deregulation of business , despite consistent public demands for the better protection of workers , consumers and the environment .
Beside them are some of the most powerful European commissioners , as well as the heads of foreign governments , constrained , like our own , to demand concessions for their companies from other nations .
The gorilla at the head of the line is the media .
Most of it belongs , of course , to major corporations , some of which also have substantial interests in other sectors .
They rely for much of their income on corporate advertisers .
The proprietors ' political project is to create a better world for corporations and multimillionaires .
Their attitudes appear to have reached parts of the non - commercial sector .
Last year , Private Eye published a leaked memo sent to the BBC 's director general Greg Dyke by the business editor Jeff Randall .
He attacked a reporter for questioning a corporate executive about high prices during an interview for the Today programme 's business report .
"" Nobody in their right mind would put up with that .
It was crude consumerism of the worst kind _
If that slot is on Radio 4 simply to champion the downtrodden shopper , then why not drop the business tag and rename it the Ralph Nader memorial lecture ?
No serious business people will be interested in listening to , much less participating in , that kind of crap . ""
Since then , "" that slot "" has been used to give business executives the unchallenged access otherwise reserved only for God on Thought for the Day .
Such is the institutional power of the corporations that the only people now in a position to hold them to account are other companies .
When Amnesty International revealed that Indian police paid by Enron were beating and sexually abusing people living where it wanted to build a power plant , the news was received with horror by campaign ers but ignored by almost everyone else .
But when institutional shareholders lose their investments , the scandal dominates the headlines all over the world .
Governments stay in power by taking the path of least resistance .
If Labour sought to fight the stronger force , it would be ripped apart , and the spectators would find another rope for the contestants to pull .
Banning political donations merely changes the field on which the contest takes place : it does nothing to affect the disposition of forces .
The only way to fight corporate power is the only way democracy has ever been defended : by persuading as many of the spectators as we can to grab the other end of the rope .

2002-02-06,"Enronitis - also known as fear of accountancy shenanigans - is proving highly contagious .
Among the early cases identified so far are the now bankrupt Global Crossing , industrial conglomerate Tyco and Irish healthcare group Elan .
But the problem in treating it is being sure of all the symptoms .
Jittery investment analysts are now working overtime on their spreadsheets and calculators trying to identify the next cases .
What these companies have been up to is not rocket science .
Many have been doing it for years , and practices such as treating disposals as revenue and setting up off - balance sheet vehicles to remove the nasties from the bit of the books that receive closest scrutiny were , in the past , deemed entirely legitimate .
Indeed , they break no rules and have helped power companies ' growth .
They have even been regarded as being enlightened and clever .
For years , many software companies have been steaming ahead with stated profits while the workforce have been left wondering who was doing all the work .
Anyone who questioned accounting practices was seen either as being mad , maverick or medieval - probably all three .
Analyst Terry Smith springs to mind : when Mr Smith challenged accounting norms in the 1990s he was swiftly despatched from one of the biggest broking firms , which was embarrassing its big - name clients , to start over with a niche player .
The Enron episode has caused a major rethink .
Mr Smith now looks like an accountancy futurologist .
What was once acceptable is no longer regarded as straight .
It is now up to Sir Howard Davies at the financial services authority and
Sir David Tweedie of the international accounting standards board to find a cure .
Taking the biscuit On the subject of Enronitis , there are always people looking to benefit from the misery of others but Wall Street Reporter , an online and print financial media operation based in New York , has taken the practice to a new level .
Last week the firm circulated an e - mail to , it claims , 25,000 "" leading analysts , fund managers , investment bankers and venture capitalists nationwide "" asking for their snap judgment on what should be done to accountants at Andersen and executives at Enron .
The e - mail , which also found its way into the inboxes of financial journalists , also asked for off - the - cuff predictions as to who might be the next Enron .
Having received just 266 replies , the firm yesterday offered three advance copies of the report , with a list of those named as next in line , for the staggering price of $ 32,500 , or the equivalent of $ 122 per reply .
From Friday , everyone else will be able to pick it up for $ 250 .
Behind the survey is Wall Street Reporter 's publisher , Jack Marks .
Last night Alan Wolski , who describes himself as "" chief financial officer , chief operating officer , secretary , treasurer and supposed partner "" of Mr Marks defended the report .
But he admitted it will take at least a week before all the results are in , so anybody paying $ 32,500 will also be buying incomplete information .
Wilful ignorance Accountant turned would - be movie mogul Gary Smith has a lot on his hands at the moment .
His day job is as chief executive of Winchester Entertain ment , an ambitious film distributor and childrens ' TV company , and in his spare time he is doing up his house .
It is evidently quite a project .
In the movie business Winchester recently distributed Last Orders , starring Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins .
Last November it signed up David Baddiel in a bid to find new hit comedies like The Full Monty .
The company , with its interests in children 's TV programming , has just appointed one of the grand - daddies of British TV - Leslie Hill , chairman of ITV Network and a non - exec at Carlton - as its chairman .
Yesterday Winchester issued a profits warning on the basis that two films it thought would be delivered by the end of March were running late , and its new children 's TV programme was failing to generate the audiences expected in its launch territories .
Hence the company has written down its children 's TV programming assets by a one - off £ 2 m .
Profits for the year will therefore be "" substantially below "" expectations .
Indeed , they may well be losses - and the shares dived by a whopping 87p to 51.5p .
But it is not all bad news for Mr Smith .
Less than two weeks ago , with supremely fortuitous timing , the chief executive sold 400,000 shares at 148p .
He needed the money , he explained yesterday , for house renovations on his 1860 property .
He has evidently had to call in the structural engineers and , as we all know , they charge like wounded bulls .
Actually , if Mr Smith 's engineers require him to get his hands on £ 600,000 , he should find a new firm .
Mr Smith insists he knew nothing about the problems at the company until last Thursday , which suggests he does n't have his finger very firmly on the pulse .
"" I am the first to admit it looks bad , "" he said last night .
But he called on shareholders to give him "" the benefit of the doubt "" .
Indeed it does .
And frankly , it is unlikely they will ."
2002-02-06,"Enron with the wind Enron 's name is mud - and never more so than in squelchy Welsh countryside politics .
The doomed energy company 's offshoot , Enron Wind , has been planning a large windfarm at Cefn Croes in mid - Wales , but despite strong local approval of the 39 1.5mw turbines , the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales , the Council for National Parks , the Wildlife Trusts Wales , the Ramblers ' Association and the Snowdonia Society object and are urging energy minister Brian Wilson to hold a public inquiry .
FoE Cymru , and others in favour of Welsh renewables , despair .
They see what they call "" self - appointed publicly funded protectionist groups "" trying to go over the heads of local democracy and shafting renewables .
Meanwhile , Enron Wind is unhappy its name is so associated with global scandal .

Red or dead
It has been a miserable few weeks for fish and cetaceans .
The Natural History Museum and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) are alarmed that hundreds of dolphins are being washed up on the British coastline .
The storms may have driven the dead bodies ashore , says the WDCS , but they have revealed the scale of the day - to - day accidental dolphin catch in some fisheries , and also the way that trawlermen have been trying to cover up their catch .
Many of the dolphins have been mutilated , apparently to try to make their bodies sink .
Meanwhile , WWF International reports that tens of thousands of manta ray , shark and tuna , along with turtles , washed on to the Kenyan coast following one of the worst ever "" red tides "" - an explosion of microscopic toxic algae that colour ocean waters reddish brown .
Clinging mother Teddy Goldsmith , founder of the Ecologist magazine , author , funder of eco causes , and a man who has inspired and enraged British greens , last week gave a rare talk to the young pups at the London School of Economics .
After explaining why the whole discipline of economics as the LSE knows it is largely irrelevant , he was asked whether he had ever lived a "" pure "" life himself .
Ah , yes , said Teddy .
He and his wife lived in Cornwall for five years in self - sufficient bliss , surrounded by 55 varieties of apple trees .
So what happened ?
"" My mother - in - law came over from New Zealand , took one look and demanded that I buy her daughter a car , a fridge and tinned peaches .
She gave me a shopping list and that was that . ""

2002-02-06,"The Co - operative Insurance Society , one of Britain 's biggest institutional investors , is planning to vote against the reappointment of Arthur Andersen at tour operator Airtours ' annual shareholders ' meeting tomorrow .
The holiday company 's annual general meeting will be the first demonstration of how the Enron scandal is likely to reverberate on the cosy relationship British companies have traditionally enjoyed with their auditors .
Andersen is at the centre of the US scandal and in recent days has started a charm offensive in an attempt to shore up its battered reputation , allay investors ' fears and halt what could be a disastrous loss of business .
Last night , however , CIS fund managers said they would attend the agm in Manchester to question Airtours ' directors publicly about the independence of Andersen .
Head of corporate governance Ian Black said he was concerned about Andersen 's dual role as auditor and consultant to the holiday business : "" We want a proper answer from the company about their auditor 's independence . ""
CIS , which has made socially responsible investing a priority , is understood to be among a number of fund managers which have become concerned about such dual roles since the collapse of Enron , where Andersen made far more from consultancy work than from its auditing duties .
Last year the accountants earned £ 1.2 m from Airtours in audit fees and more than £ 7 m for consultancy work .
The tour operator 's finance director , David Jardine , is also a former Andersen partner .
Another large shareholder said : "" There are issues that need to be addressed .
There is a potential for significant moral hazard . ""
An Airtours spokeswoman hinted it was considering dropping Andersen for consultancy work if shareholders objected .
The company was intent on reappointing the firm as auditors , she said , but had not made a decision on other work .
"" They have had a good relationship with Andersen - and Houston is a long way from Manchester .
But in the current climate , 48 hours is a long time . ""
Mr Black said it was time that fund managers used their voting rights to take more responsibility for policing companies they invest in .
Failing to do so , he said , "" has made them complicit in some of the failings that have beset the corporate world "" , including Marconi and Enron .
His comments echoed those of Financial Services Authority chairman Sir Howard Davies , who told the Economic Forum in New York over the weekend that he was considering introducing compulsory rotation of auditing firms every five years .
He is also to look at proposals to ban auditors from undertaking other work which could prejudice their regulatory and investor protection responsibilities .
Another Airtours investor said new practices must be introduced for all auditors .
He favoured mandatory rotation of lead partners on audits every four years .
The present requirement is for a change of partner every seven years ."
2002-02-08,"American corporate culture of the past decade went on trial yesterday as US congressmen took turns to berate some of the key protagonists in the Enron scandal , but were met mainly with silence .
One after another of the disgraced businessmen invoked the constitution 's fifth amendment , allowing them to avoid testimony which might incriminate them later .
Each witness raised his hand to the accompaniment of whirring cameras .
Each witness swore to tell the truth and then promptly and "" regretfully "" refused to say a word .
The loudest silence yesterday belonged to Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer ( CFO ) , who was named by an internal company report at the weekend as the principal magician behind the elaborate tricks used to drain money from the Texas energy company .
In the heady days of the late 1990s , CFO magazine hailed him for his pioneering work on "" unique financing techniques "" .
This phrase now sounds like the most threadbare of euphemisms for financial scams .
He and his colleagues set up a series of shell companies to enter into partnerships with Enron .
Enron pumped money into them and into the pockets of their managers , who then used "" unique financing techniques "" to hide the losses .
Mr Fastow , who is believed to have made at least $ 30 m from his creativity , also took the fifth "" on the advice of my counsel "" .
He is now being blamed by former colleagues and bosses as almost solely responsible for Enron 's sins .
Another former chief executive , Kenneth Lay , is expected to appear next week and also to "" take the fifth "" .
The most important exception to the rule of silence yesterday was Jeffrey Skilling , a former Enron chief executive who resigned last August to "" spend more time with my family "" .
He told the committee that he was shocked that anything illegal was done under his watch .
"" I am devastated and apologetic , "" he said .
"" I believed at the time that adequate controls were in place and that the controls were complied with . ""
Mr Skilling is reported to have received $ 10.3 m in salary and bonuses from 1999 to 2000 .
But Enron 's new chief operating officer , Jeffrey McMa hon , said earlier yesterday that he was transferred to a new job shortly after he complained to Mr Skilling about the obscure partnerships in a 30-minute meeting in March 2000 .
Mr McMahon was Enron 's treasurer at the time .
The silence of Mr Fastow and other Enron witnesses only served to infuriate members of the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations .
John Dingell , the committee 's senior Democrat , expressed its frustration .
"" We had hoped to hear why this all happened .
We had hoped to hear what these people thought about the loss of the jobs of thousands of employees and the savings of even more employees , shareholders , pension funds and other investors , "" he said .
Billy Tauzin , a Republican from Louisiana , who has already predicted that someone from Enron will end up "" in pokey "" for the debacle , added : "" Despite all the complicated dealings and cross - dealing and self - dealing , we are learning , I believe , that what we have before us is a simple story of old - fashioned theft and the inexplicable acts , or lack thereof , that allowed the crooks to get away and to destroy a company . ""
His condemnation drew muttered agreement from the back of the room , where a delegation of Enron ex - employees had been shoehorned in to hear their elected representatives rail in their name .
Louis Allen , 42 , had travelled from Houston to hear his former bosses refuse to talk .
He had worked for Enron for nine years , supervising parking and company cars .
He had amassed a pension fund worth $ 70,000 , with which he hoped to pay for his daughter 's education .
Under Enron house rules , that fund was packed with company stock .
Mr Allen said it was now worth $ 4.62 .
He was given a severance package of $ 4,500 , from which Enron deducted medical insurance and parking expenses , leaving him $ 3,100 .
He had just heard that Enron executives , even in their disgrace , were still demanding severance packages worth tens of millions of dollars .
"" I feel mad , angry , "" he said .
"" They betrayed us .
We had trust in the company .
People are losing homes .
People are losing cars .
Justice has to be done .
Somebody must do time for this . """
2002-02-08,"George Lucas is the latest grandee to be tainted by the Enron scandal , if unwittingly .
It transpires that some of the bankrupt company 's employees were big Star Wars fans .
Big enough fans , in fact , to name some of their financial vehicles after Star Wars characters and themes .
The JEDI LP ( The Joint Energy Development Investment LP ) was first , in 1993 .
The possible coincidence "" just started a series of Star Wars names , "" according to Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne .
These included Chewco Investments LP , Kenobe Inc and Obi-1 Holdings LLC .
Chewco , in particular , is implicated in manoeuvres to obscure the debts of the parent company .
Lucasfilm was keen to point out that it was unaware of the usage of the names and that "" any use by Enron of such trademarks was without our permission "" .
The Star Wars franchise , it would seem , is a victim of its own success .
Lucasfilm has also recently been locked in a legal wrangle with the makers of a porn film called Wank Solo , objecting to a perceived infringement of its copyright ."
2002-02-08,"Royal Dutch - Shell last night defended its decision to use its own auditors for consulting work as it revealed a 71 % slump in fourth - quarter profits at the oil group .
Accountants KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers were paid up to $ 20 m ( £ 14 m ) to audit Shell 's accounts while sharing a further $ 40 m in consultancy fees .
The world 's second largest oil group also admitted using special purpose financial vehicles but said there was no question of it being vulnerable to an Enron - type crash as they appeared on its balance sheet .
Shell 's fourth - quarter income fell to $ 900 m while full - year profits fell from $ 12.7bn to $ 10.8bn , due to the oil price slide .
Seeking to diffuse investor concerns regarding the use of auditors as consultants , Shell chairman Phil Watts said : "" Shell is a very different company from Enron .
There was a time when we were criticised for not going with the times and not being more like Enron .
I am glad we were more conservative and careful . ""
But Shell had , like others in its sector including Enron , begun operating in energy trading .
The group defended its willingess to use its auditors for consultancy work , a combination that has been criticised by the FSA in the light of Andersen 's dual role at Enron .
"" We are confident that the situation we have at the moment is properly managed with due sensitivity , "" said Mr Watts , pointing out it was unusually conservative to have two auditors in the first place .
The two accountancy firms have to bid against outside competition for all consultancy work , although they are successful in 50 % of the cases they bid for , Shell said .
Finance director Judy Boynton said KPMG and PWC rotated the partners used on the Shell accounts every seven years .
Their consultancy activity revolved around building new accounting systems or carrying out due diligence on acquisition or divestments .
They report to an audit committee chaired by former HSBC banking boss Sir William Purves .
The special purpose vehicles were explained by Ms Boynton as being normal in the kind of area associated with its Shell Capital arm .
"" The debt level in the vehicles is not material to the group , "" she said , adding that details of this were always contained in annual reports .
Adjusted net profits for the quarter fell from $ 3.5bn to $ 1.9bn , and the share price yesterday dropped 3p to 481p ."
2002-02-08,"Regulators in Britain and the US are introducing measures designed to prevent another Enron - style collapse and repair the battered reputations of finance professionals .
Wall Street sought to restore its credibility with rules designed to guarantee the independence of research analysts in investment banks .
The International Accounting Standards Board , which is based in London , said it would step up its overhaul of profits reporting procedures , aiming to stamp out some of the more creative methods used recently .
The new US regulations will bolster the "" Chinese walls "" which are supposed to operate inside banks .
A number of research analysts continued to issue "" buy "" notes on Enron and Global Crossing , which has also collapsed , until shortly before they went under .
Critics believe some were compromised because of fees being earned from those companies by the investment banking arms of their firms .
The new rules agreed by the securities and exchange commission will remove incentives which can encourage analysts to recommend ailing companies .
Payments to analysts whose research work helps bring in lucrative banking custom will now be banned .
Analysts will also be prohibited from working under the supervision of investment bankers and they will have to disclose personal shareholdings on their notes .
The International Accounting Standards Board was preparing consultation documents on new corporate accounting rulesbefore the Enron collapse .
But yesterday , as more companies ' accounts were coming under intense scrutiny , IASB chairman Sir David Tweedie said : "" We have now got to clean up quickly "" .
There were also calls for shareholders to vote against the reappointment of company auditors which undertake lucrative non - audit consultancy work .
Stuart Bell of campaign group Pensions and Investment Research Consultants said : "" Commercial interest can make it less likely that they approach the audit in the robust manner they should . ""
The average FTSE 100 com pany pays its auditors nearly three times as much for consultancy work as for auditing .
Last year BSkyB paid £ 600,000 for its audit but handed over 23 times that amount for consultancy work .
Five companies , including United Business Media and housebuilder Wilson Connolly , handed over more than 20 times their audit fee for other services ."
2002-02-08,"Airtours chairman David Crossland yesterday angrily denied that Andersen - the accountancy firm at the heart of the Enron scandal - appeared to be running the holiday company .
That suggestion from a shareholder at Airtours ' annual meeting in Manchester was dismissed by Mr Crossland as malicious and he spoke of a media witchhunt against Andersen .
"" It is absolutely disgusting , "" he told the meeting of about 250 shareholders .
"" I for one will not stand by and see such appalling statements being made on no evidence at all .
We receive good service from them

Several shareholders questioned the reappointment of the company 's auditor but the motion to retain Andersen was passed .
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants , which advises 60 pension funds , urged its clients to oppose the reappointment on two grounds .
It cited the large amount of non - audit work carried out by the firm - last year Airtours paid £ 7.2 m for such services , compared with £ 1.2 m for audit work .
Pirc also pointed out that the company 's finance director , David Jardine , was a partner at Andersen until March 2000 .
Eric Sanderson , non - executive deputy chairman of Airtours , explained that the vast majority of the £ 7 m non - audit fees was for setting up the Mytravel website and was in "" no way "" related to accounts . ""
The board is satisfied that they have been in no way compromised .

2002-02-08,"Sage , the specialist in accounting systems , one of Britain 's leading software companies , has been using a controversial accounting mechanism to boost its apparent profitability .
The company faces huge write - offs if it now bows to City pressure and returns to standard industry practice in the way it treats the numerous acquisitions which have fueled its rapid growth .
Investors have become increasingly concerned about accounting policies employed by technology companies after the collapse of Houston - based energy trading firm Enron .
Sage stands alone among Europe 's software industry in the way it treats a crucial accounting element known as goodwill - the difference between the price paid for a business and the value of its tangible assets , such as stock , equipment and property .
European software firms such as Misys and SAP write down goodwill on the purchase of a business over five to 20 years - a practice known as amortisation .
Sage , however , does not make any provision for its goodwill , claiming the businesses it has bought have an "" indefinite economic life "" .
Instead it carries out an annual impairment review , examining the performance of each business to see if the value has fallen .
After a flurry of deals made in the last four years , Sage has £ 836 m of goodwill sitting on its balance sheet .
Even a small deterioration in trading at one of its recently acquired businesses could wipe out profits , which analysts expect to be about £ 140 m this year .
If the company had treated its accounts in the standard way last year 's pretax profit would have been at best £ 80 m as opposed to the £ 120 m declared .
"" Its accounting practices are among the most unusual that we look at , "" said one analyst .
"" Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about this sort of thing . ""
Sage 's finance director , Paul Harrison , last night admitted the company 's accounting practices are "" unusual "" and he has been forced to explain them to shareholders .
He defended the decision not to amortise goodwill .
"" We think we have got a pretty good track record that says we actually enhance the value of these assets over time , "" he said .
"" Our view is that if we continue to do our job well we do not think these assets have a finite life .
So we undertake the fairly onerous obligation to perform an annual impairment review . ""
That review is checked by Sage 's auditors , PriceWaterhouseCoopers .
Before joining Sage five years ago Mr Harrison worked for PwC where he was involved in working for Sage .
He admitted that carrying out an annual impairment review , rather than slowly marking down goodwill over a fixed period , could send the company 's profits into reverse . ""
That is the risk you take on with the policy we have adopted , "" he said .
One former adviser to the firm , who was working for Sage during the late 1990s , said the board took a conscious decision not to write off goodwill because it wanted to be seen as one of the few profitable British software firms .
Mr Harrison rejected this , saying analysts look at underlying earnings and cash flow rather than top line profits .
Given the size of the deals , any move to follow the rest of the industry would have seriously dented profits .
Sage , which has continued to be profitable throughout the downturn in the industry , is now the only software company in the FTSE 100 index of leading shares ."
2002-02-09,"Putnam Investments , the huge US money manager , was said to have been the seller of a 4.0 % stake in FTSE 250 software group Misys yesterday .
Misys shares closed sharply lower after Goldman Sachs placed the 26.3 m shares belonging to Putnam at 255p - a whacking 14 % discount to Thursday night 's closing price of 296p - with various City institutions .
Demand for the stock was said to have been strong with the deal completed before lunchtime .
The company refused to confirm the identity of the seller but traders were convinced it was Putnam .
After the Enron crisis , many US mutual funds have been taking a long hard look at their portfolios and deciding to adopt a more defensive stance .
Such thinking is said to have been behind yesterday 's sale .
Misys , which specialises in banking and healthcare software , closed down 17p at 279p .
Rentokil , off 7.5p at 255.5p , was also hit by a large share sale .
US investment bank Morgan Stanley placed about 30 m shares with a number of institutional investors at 259p - a slight discount to Thursday 's closing price of 263p .
Dealers believe the sellers were Danish investors who took Rentokil paper when Ratin , a Danish investment firm whose only holding is a 36 % stake in Rentokil , was acquired by the pest control group two years ago .
In the wider market , leading shares ended the week unchanged as investors , still racked by accountancy fears , sat on the sidelines and refused to deal .
The FTSE 100 closed a mere 1.1 points higher at 5,128.1 .
Stripping out turnover in Rentokil , Misys , and Vodafone , unchanged at 144.5p , market turnover was a disappointing 1.6bn shares .
Renewed concern about its financial position saw Invensys , the industrial controls and automation group , give back most of Thursday 's gains .
Citing "" limited financial flexibility "" and "" substantial refi nancing needs "" , Moody 's lowered its rating on the company 's debt to Baa3 - one notch above junk status - with a negative outlook .

2002-02-09,"Thousands of British employees of Enron are likely to have their careers damaged by the fall out from the scandal that has surrounded the energy corporation 's bankruptcy . ""
Hi - I used to work at Enron "" will hardly impress at an interview .
But there is hope for former Enron employees from a judgment in favour of BCCI employees 11 years ago .
In many ways Enron 's situation mirrors that of BCCI , which went into liquidation in 1990 .
Former employees of that company fought an extraordinary series of legal battles to secure compensation from the liquidator .
This litigation set precedents from which Enron staff and , possibly staff at its auditors Andersen , may well profit .
Those who worked for Enron could find they have suffered not only the loss of their jobs , and in many cases savings that were tied up with the company 's shares , but a loss to their reputations .
Prospective employers may not analyse the detail of what went wrong and who was to blame .
Instead , they will simply reject anyone with an Enron background because of the stigma attached to them .
Those who work for Andersen could be similarly affected , as the firm faces a potentially massive loss of business .
Companies which retain Andersen will be in a position to demand lower fees .
Cadbury Schweppes and Amvescap , two its biggest clients , were reported last week to be reviewing the connection .
Because of the confidential nature of an accountant 's work , those leaving Andersen - whether or not through redundancy -may find the stigma affects them particularly badly .
Former BCCI employees won compensation from the liquidator on the basis that the way the company had been run amounted to a breach of the implied term in an employment contract that each side would treat the other honestly .
Test cases were brought on behalf of among others , a stationery clerk , a payroll officer , a branch supervisor and the regional manager for South Africa .
The House of Lords decided in principle that they were entitled to compensation if they had been kept out of work by reason of the stigma .
The courts are still considering individual cases but have looked sceptically at those of people who remained unemployed for several years and blamed it all on the "" stigma "" .
Now , the BCCI precedent is partly dependent on showing that the company was corrupt through and through .
Enron employees will perhaps not face too many difficulties with this .
Those who worked for Andersen , which has a legitimate and reputable business particularly in the UK , will find it much harder .
Employees of the collapsed bank Barings could not pursue this line .
Although the bank failed due to the dishonesty of one trader and its senior management were grossly incompetent , there was clearly no systematic corruption .
However , those who work for any businesses - particularly professional firms - which collapse when , for instance , the owner disappears with clients ' funds , may well be able to bring a "" stigma "" claim .

2002-02-10,"Lord Wakeham was facing calls for his resignation last night as it emerged he gave US energy giant Enron advice on how to handle the media while he was chairman of the Press Complaints Commission .
The Observer has learnt that in 1997 and 1998 , Wakeham , the former Tory Minister now embroiled in the Enron scandal , had two meetings in London with Enron executives where he advised the corporation on how to get favourable Press coverage .
The disclosure that the head of the independent body regulating newspapers was giving media advice to a company where he earned £ 80,000 as a director has sparked demands for his immediate resignation .
Politicians and critics believe Wakeham 's action undermines the credibility of his office and gives rise to a clear conflict of interest .
One senior MP said : ' It whiffs of a PCC chairman for hire to the highest bidder . '
Wakeham agreed temporarily to stand down from the chairmanship of the PCC 10 days ago while he faces a series of investigations in the US over his role in the £ 50 billion collapse of Enron .
Since 1994 Wakeham has been paid £ 80,000 a year as a director of Enron and sat on a number of key board committees that were supposed to prevent any financial wrong doing .
Although Wakeham decided to stand down as PCC chairman for ' honourable ' reasons he is still receiving full pay of £ 156,000 a year .
His contract runs until June 2003 .
Last week an Enron insider told The Observer about meetings between the company and Wakeham in late 1997 and 1998 .
At the time Enron was engaged in a lobbying and media campaign to stop the new Labour government from banning new gas - fired power stations .
The Enron source said : ' We started a process whereby we were talking to the media ...
We were trying to put some balance into the political climate because at the time all the media were talking about the coal industry being disad vantaged .
We were trying to say there was an opposite view .
We took his [ Lord Wakeham 's ] advice .
He added : ' We had two meetings with him over a couple of years ...
He told us how we should handle the press .
The guy was a director of Enron so it was natural for us to have meetings and to take advantage of his experience . '
The Enron executive said Wakeham 's advice appeared to pay off : ' It did have some effect .
The type of stories that started to come out changed . '
David Lewis , a former vice - president of Enron , was unwilling to discuss details but confirmed the meetings with the former Tory Energy Minister took place .
He said : ' Wakeham gave the company general media advice based on his experience . '
Nick Harvey , the media spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , called for Wake ham to be sacked .
He said : ' These new revelations are far more serious than the issue on which he stepped aside and he must resign immediately . '
One has to ask the question , did Enron use the fact Wakeham was chair of the PCC to influence the way the company was covered in the press ?
It would also be interesting to know whether Wakeham engineered contacts between the company and newspapers . '
Rosemary McKenna , a Labour member of the cultural , media and sports select committee , said : ' This is further evidence to support calls for an investigation into Wakeham 's actions while chair of the PCC . '
The Wakeham disclosure has also led to calls that the chair of the commission should be banned from holding any outside company directorships .
Harvey said : ' The chairman of the PCC is meant to be completely impartial and it is wholly inappropriate that he should have any other interests at all . '
Wakeham has been criticised for holding numerous directorships during his tenure at the PCC , including investment bank NM Rothschild , recruitment consultants Michael Page and shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft .
He flew to the US last month to face questioning by a congressional hearing into the Enron scandal .
The Observer was unable to get any comment from Wakeham and his lawyer in the US did not return calls .
He issued a statement when he stood down from the PCC , which said : ' I am only too aware of the damage that can be done to individuals and institutions that are thrust into the public spotlight . '
He has been reported as telling friends that he had raised questions about Enron 's accounting procedures but did not receive any answers .
As The Observer revealed two weeks ago , Wakeham also faces a hearing in the UK by the Institute of Chartered Accountants , which could strip him of his accountancy qualifications and fine him . antony.barnett@observer.co.uk"
2002-02-10,"The full horror for Britain of the Enron crisis became clearer this weekend after it emerged that the administrator expects losses in this country to run into several billion pounds but recoverable assets to be no more than $ 750 m .
PricewaterhouseCoopers will tell creditors this Friday that the bankrupt Houston - based firm had 250,000 trading positions with 1,000 parties .
The administrator expects to recover £ 150 m from the trades .
Recoverable assets will not include proceeds from the sale of Wessex Water , which is not actually owned by the UK operation , or Enron 's Teesside power plant , which is UK - owned but not in administration .
UK companies could lose millions of pounds each in what is the world 's biggest ever bankruptcy because of the limited partnership structure of Enron companies .
News of Enron liabilities , which could top $ 60 billion globally , comes as shareholder anger increases at what many fear are widespread corrupt accounting practices that hide enormous losses or artificially raise profits .
The influential Pension Investment Research Consultants is calling for directors ' pay to be linked with a basket of other indicators rather than just total shareholder return .
The body is issuing new shareholder voting guidance this Wednesday .
PIRC 's Stuart Bell said : ' If you link rewards with factors that are easy to manipulate , there will be the temptation to do it . '
The move has won support from KPMG senior adviser Gerry Acher . '
Too much remuneration is geared towards the short - term share performance , ' he said .

2002-02-10,"When the Gladiator sent the boys into the ring to buy some IBM and Microsoft , he must have been dreaming of escorting Boadicea in an open chariot back from Londinium to Rome via Gaul .
What on earth possessed him ?
He mentioned last week the need to be vigilant of the adverse effect that ' Enronitis ' could have on the US stock markets .
The domino effect of inadequate corporate integrity could damage a host of key companies .
He was aware of the backlash from Tyco , Cendant , Elan and Global Crossing , but his judgment was well short of the mark , believing that Microsoft 's stock should be immune from rough treatment .
The weekend press became the obvious catalyst for this bellwether tech giant to be duly lambasted .
Add Lou Gerstner 's forthcoming departure as CEO from IBM and there you have it -
the full ingredients for a controlled financial meltdown .
US chips
Who but a congenital throwback would have bought these two US titans after a sharp drop in price , thinking they could rally , in the light of scant good news ?
The boys required no guidance to cut these ludicrous positions out .
The bell had hardly rung before a brave bookie agreed to accept the ' down ' wager in IBM , bought last Friday at $ 107.92 in £ 5 a point at $ 108.08 - an inexplicable and incredible profit of £ 80 .
However , the die was cast over Microsoft , and the best the troop could do was to sell back the position at $ 62.50 , which had been purchased at $ 64.20 in £ 10 per point - a horrendous loss of £ 1,700 .
But things could have been a good deal worse .
Tech stocks are at the crossroads and will not be able to withstand the loss of confidence that is sure to take place as a result of further examination on corporate profitability in this sector .
Crumbs from the table On Monday afternoon , the troop took instructions from the irascible Gladiator to liquidate the rest of the position , with the exception of Novartis , which resulted in BAT ( bought at 626p ) and ICI ( bought at 326p ) being sold in the March contract at 638p and 339p .
The positions were both in £ 10 per point - a modest profit of £ 250 , to offset the heinous losses incurred across the pond .
As for Novartis ( bought at SwF 59.22 ) , its results were always going to please investors , so the main man hung on until Friday morning .
The position was duly ' binned ' at SwF60.92 - a much - needed contribution of an ironic £ 1,700 - the same as the loss on Microsoft , to be added to the cause .
It was an infinitely forgettable week .
The Gladiator certainly failed to cover himself in glory , with only a net profit of £ 330 .
Lord of the ring It 's a bit like that in the training camp these days .
Thoughts are muddled .
There is a slightly better feel to the US markets , with improved economic data , but it is of limited value .
Goldman Sachs has come out with some upgrades for telecoms and media .
The Gladiator could not care less .
These stocks rallied strongly on Thursday and Friday , and he feels that there is a touch of ' After you , Marmaduke ! '
about those stocks .
Two weeks ago , the Gladiator knew that the moment he sold BSkyB at 690p , having bought them at 718p , he was on the wrong side of the trade .
At 1.45pm on Friday BSkyB was 739p after writing off its investment in Kirch for just under £ 1 billion .
So the boys decided to assemble a conservative portfolio for the week .
Glaxo SmithKline has dropped unreasonably low , so the troop bought some at £ 17.03 in £ 10 per point .
Gladiator also feels that , despite poor profits this week , Shell T&amp;T looks appetising at 475p , where it were purchased on Friday in £ 25 per point .
The troop obviously need some balance , so Mohawk Industries , countrywide carpetmakers , and Goodyear , which announced its figures today , were bought on strong recommendation from a Wall Street guru at $ 54.76 and $ 21.26 in £ 10 per point in the March contract as soon as the bell opened the session .
The rubber tyre industry is very much in the vanguard , so Goodyear may look a good bet if the motor industry gets its act together in six months ' time .
It so happens that Goodyear lost $ 174 million , so it is a very speculative call .
Finally , the troop noticed that the Racing Post was running some Oscar spreads on Friday .
Needless to say it thinks that Russell Crowe is a nailed - on - certainty for best actor .
However , a spread of 5.50 - 6.00 on the number of Oscars Lord of the Rings will win was too tempting for words .
The Gladiator strode into the ring and bought the spread at 6.00 in £ 25 per point on Friday ."
2002-02-10,"Investors ' irrational exuberance characterised the Nineties , but no one linked accountants to the psychosis .
Until Enron .
The collapse of the giant US energy trader has turned the spotlight on the accounting methods used to prop up profits and share prices and , more importantly , hide losses .
Investors are casting suspicion on some of the world 's biggest firms .
Off - balance sheet accounting now causes palpitations .
Recently General Electric , the US blue chip , and Elan , the Irish pharmaceuticals group , each suffered a wave of share selling as shareholders cast a jaundiced eye over what they saw as opaque accounting .
Even the Treasury has come under fire for ploughing on with public private partnership projects to build schools , hospitals and , most recently , to improve the London Underground .
The Enron - related argument says the PPP is fiendishly complex and keeps infrastructure investment off the public sector borrowing requirement .
The question is : at what cost ?
Another accounting scandal could cause investors to lose faith completely in the financial markets . '
Systemic risk ' is the new gloomy buzzword .
This is why the Financial Services Authority is reviewing its rules for company listings , which , as revealed by The Observer , could include the mandatory rotation of auditors .
The House of Commons Treasury Select Committee and Chancellor Gordon Brown himself are also conducting reviews to ensure it could n't happen here .
Demands for reform are raging : audit firms should n't consult ; directors ' pay should n't be linked to share options ; investors should understand the companies into which they casually sink other people 's money .
Yet we 've been here before .
The Nineties saw the collapse of BCCI , the Robert Maxwell empire and Polly Peck .
Inquiries were held .
They have brought us to this .
The consensus is that an Enron could n't happen here , yet Britain is not immune to accounting irregularities .
A £ 90 million asset write - down at publicly quoted golf club owner Clubhaus prompted an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry only last December .
DIY chain Wickes almost went under because of accounting problems .
It 's just that the scale is different .
Accountants are saying proudly that if they have n't already done so , they will separate their auditing and consultancy functions so conflicts of interest do n't arise .
Shareholder activists want more .
Stuart Webb of Pension Investment Research Consultants says : ' How much do they split functions ?
The position of tax advice and and tax compliance is unclear .
And major firms still have stakes in all sorts of related businesses . '
Meanwhile , it is not clear how much creditors will receive from the wreckage of Enron .
The limited partner ship structures - which hid losses - mean money will never be recovered .
Jeff Katz heads investigation firm Bishop International , which is representing firms owed tens of millions of pounds .
He says : ' Enron is a classic case of wanting to believe that everything will be OK because the potential returns look so good . '
It 's not so much a matter of greed as of dreams .
But dreams can turn into nightmares .
When sophisticated investors see a structure that does n't make sense or [ that ] they ca n't understand , they should either walk away or get someone they trust to have another look . '
It may be companies and accountants who do the obfuscating , but investors feed the bubble ."
2002-02-10,"Asian billionaire Li Ka - shing has put in the top bid for Wessex Water , the British utility put up for sale by bankrupt US energy group Enron .
Li 's offshoot , Cheung Kong Infrastructure , itself a part of Hutchison Whampoa , the Hong Kong - based telecoms and ports conglomerate , has bid about £ 1 billion .
But its chances of acquiring Wessex may be hampered by an investigation by Ofwat , the British water regulator .
Industry sources say Ofwat 's director - general , Philip Fletcher , is concerned that the bid must be seen to be ' squeaky clean ' to satisfy politicians who could complain that Ka - shing 's worldwide operations are not sufficiently transparent .
The four bids for Wessex , include offers from Italian utility Enel , Malaysian energy group YTL , and a UK financial buyer .
All are thought to be close in price , although Ka - shing is in front .
The auction may not ultimately depend on hard cash , but on Fletcher , attuned to the sensitivity of water takeovers in the UK .
Hutchison Whampoa , the flagship of Ka - shing 's empire , owns Felixstowe port , Suffolk .
Schroder Salomon Smith Barney , the US investment bank , is handling the Wessex sale .
A preferred bidder is expected to be chosen within five or six weeks .
If Ka - shing 's bid fails , the field may be clear for the Italians , who last year considered a bid for Southern Water .
Enron bought Wessex in 1998 for £ 1.36bn , but the stock market value of water companies has since fallen .
Financial institutions have expressed a growing interest in refinancing UK water companies using debt ."
2002-02-11,"Leaders of the congressional investigations into the Enron collapse said flatly last night that they did not believe the sworn testimony of the former Enron chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , and one congressman suggested that Mr Skilling could face formal accusations of perjury .
They challenged his testimony as they prepared to hear from Enron 's ex - chairman , Kenneth Lay , who is due to testify tomorrow .
Two committees snubbed by Mr Lay a week ago have ordered him to appear .
"" We will be respectful but tough in questioning Lay , "" Byron Dorgan , a Democratic senator , representing North Dakota , told CNN .
But while Mr Lay must show up , his spokeswoman said last night that he would reassert his right not to incriminate himself and refuse to answer questions .
"" Under the instruction of counsel , Mr Lay will exercise his fifth amendment rights at the Tuesday hearing , "" Kelly Kimberly said in Houston .
She declined further comment .
The scepticism expressed by congress members came after revelations that executives at the failed US energy firm were paid bonuses of up to $ 5 m ( £ 3.5 m ) shortly before it became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history .
The size of the awards , which emerged yesterday , will further outrage thousands of Enron workers who lost their jobs and in many cases their life savings as a result of the collapse .
After an intense week of hearings , lawmakers say they have strong evidence of illegal activity surrounding the bankruptcy .
A House of Representatives ' investigative panel heard hours of conflicting testimony on Thursday from Mr Skilling , who was chief executive officer of the Houston - based company , and other top company officials .
Mr Skilling said he knew few details of the complex web of partnerships that brought down Enron , and insisted that he had never been warned of problems with the arrangements .
But two Republican congressmen , Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana , told CBS television that they did not believe him . ""
He was totally incredible , "" Mr Tauzin said .
"" This is the guy who was in charge of the corporation _
I 'm afraid he may have put himself in some legal jeopardy as a result [ of his testimony ] .
"" Asked whether Mr Skilling could face a perjury indictment by federal prosecutors , Mr Tauzin replied : "" You ca n't come to Congress _ take that oath , as he did , and then not tell the truth . ""
Even Mr Skilling 's mother questioned what he had said : "" When you are the CEO and you are on the board of directors , you are supposed to know what 's going on with the rest of the company , "" Betty Skilling told Newsweek magazine .
"" You ca n't get off the hook . ""
Mr Tauzin and Mr Greenwood cited instances in which Mr Skilling said he could not recall details of key conversations that subordinates had testified they had with him about Enron 's finances .
The company 's president and chief operating officer , Jeffrey McMahon , said he had been transferred out of his job as treasurer shortly after he complained to Mr Skilling about the controversial partnerships in March 2000 .
Mr Skilling 's spokeswoman , Judy Leon , did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment .
The doubts were raised about Mr Skilling 's testimony on the same day as CNN revealed that some 500 Enron staff had received windfalls ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 5 m .
The payments were made to retain staff as the firm faced collapse .
To get the cash , the staff agreed to stay for 90 days .
The highest payment of $ 5 m went to John Lavorato , who ran Enron 's energy trading business , while Louise Kitchen , the division 's British - born chief operating officer , pocketed $ 2 m .
Both have taken up new jobs with UBS Warburg , the investment bank that now owns the division .
The details emerged as Lord Wakeham , chairman of the press complaints commission , came under fresh pressure to stand down entirely from the post after it was claimed that he had advised Enron on how to make its case in the media in Britain .
Lord Wakeham has stepped aside temporarily to give himself time to fight charges in the US that he was negligent in monitoring the state of Enron .
The fresh allegations in yesterday 's Observer follow complaints by an unnamed senior Enron executive that Lord Wakeham had held two meetings with the firm 's European branch to discuss the best media strategy for undermining the support for coal in the national press .
The bonuses awarded to the Enron executives are in addition to the millions of dollars made by senior executives from share options .
During the past few years , 29 executives together cashed in shares worth more than $ 1bn .
Workers laid off by Enron have , by contrast , been paid the minimum severance of $ 4,500 before tax and many are struggling to find work ."

Because they alone know how ill patients are at the start of treatment , they can shuffle off those least likely to respond .

But "" asymmetries of knowledge "" will always exist between providers of a complex service ( policing or medicine or education ) and inspectors .
Would n't a non - accusatorial alternative which built on the fact of professionals ' esoteric knowledge be better and cheaper ?
The question is all the more apt now that the public sector is awash with inspectors .
Over the shoulders of NHS staff can be looking , simultaneously , the national audit office ( which reports to the House of Commons ) , the audit commission ( a quango with some independence from Whitehall ) and the commission on health improvement ( a newish Labour invention ) .
A fuller list would include the national institute of clinical excellence , the national clini cal assessment authority , the health and safety executive and more .
All these inspections are based on a simple model : inspectors do n't "" do "" , they report .
Their effectiveness depends on somebody else using their evidence to enforce improvement .
This has always been one of the weak points of the audit commission , now one of the oldest and wisest kids on the block .
It examines Hackney and publishes a critical report .
But what if the political class in that dejected London borough has imploded ?
Inspectors , ultimately , are only as good as those who provide .
Labour thinks , it often seems , that all you need is for auditors ' reports to get screaming headlines and ministers to bludgeon .
But external inspection signals lack of trust .
It cramps the area within which a doctor or manager exercises any autonomy .
The control freakery attributed to Labour in health and education is based on ministers ' fear that service managers , left to their own devices , revert to some norm of non - delivery .
Hence the great apparatus of targets .
But the behavioural model on which all this is based may be flawed .
The audit boom of recent years is intellectually related to the mindset that used to say there is no such thing as society .
Where acquisitive individuals are said to be the mainspring of action , you need more and more inspectors because pursuit of individual gain will keep butting against the interest of the public at large .
But , it turns out , auditing is expensive and not so effective .
And , of course , inspectors need inspecting .
How about a league table for the comparative performance and costs of the audit commission , CHI and NAO ?

All these inspections are based on a simple model : inspectors do n't "" do "" , they report .
Their effectiveness depends on somebody else using their evidence to enforce improvement .
This has always been one of the weak points of the audit commission , now one of the oldest and wisest kids on the block .
It examines Hackney and publishes a critical report .
But what if the political class in that dejected London borough has imploded ?
Inspectors , ultimately , are only as good as those who provide .
Labour thinks , it often seems , that all you need is for auditors ' reports to get screaming headlines and ministers to bludgeon .
But external inspection signals lack of trust .
It cramps the area within which a doctor or manager exercises any autonomy .
The control freakery attributed to Labour in health and education is based on ministers ' fear that service managers , left to their own devices , revert to some norm of non - delivery .
Hence the great apparatus of targets .
But the behavioural model on which all this is based may be flawed .
The audit boom of recent years is intellectually related to the mindset that used to say there is no such thing as society .
Where acquisitive individuals are said to be the mainspring of action , you need more and more inspectors because pursuit of individual gain will keep butting against the interest of the public at large .
But , it turns out , auditing is expensive and not so effective .
And , of course , inspectors need inspecting .
How about a league table for the comparative performance and costs of the audit commission , CHI and NAO ?"
2002-02-12,"Fourteen Enron managers shared a commission of £ 6.2 m for helping to find a buyer for the collapsed group 's UK retail arm , one of the company 's creditors said today .
Enron Direct , Enron 's UK retail arm , was sold by administrators PriceWaterhouseCoopers to Centrica , the utility company , for £ 96.4 m last December , days after Enron Europe went into administration .
The highest bid for Enron Direct prior to the efforts of its staff was £ 30 m , said Enron Direct creditor Chris Fisher of consultancy Qualtrak after a creditors ' meeting .
"" Enron Direct [ staff ] participated in £ 6.2 m of commission , "" Mr Fisher told Reuters .
"" One or two people expressed some surprise .
They were paid £ 6.2 m for four days ' work . ""
The fee was shared equally among the 14 managers .
Mr Fisher said PwC confirmed the payment at today 's meeting .
PwC declined to confirm the size of the payment but said a scheme was in place to encourage the Enron Direct team to find a buyer for the company .
"" There is nothing out of the ordinary in that , "" PwC said .
News of the fee came after Enron Direct 's 270 creditors were told by PwC at the meeting they would get back between 55p and 75p pence for every pound they were owed .
PwC said it expected to distribute £ 94 m , raised from the sale of Enron Direct , to creditors who were owed between £ 130 m and £ 170 m .
PwC is due on Friday to tell the bulk of Enron Europe 's creditors how much they can expect to claw back of the billions of dollars lost in failed power and gas trading contracts spread across the continent .
PwC is expected to tell creditors that the bankrupt Houston - based firm had 250,000 trading positions with 1,000 parties .
The administrator expects to recover £ 150 m from the trades .
Recoverable assets will not include proceeds from the sale of Wessex Water , which is not actually owned by the UK operation , or Enron 's Teesside power plant , which is UK - owned but not in administration ."
2002-02-12,"Kenneth Lay , the disgraced chairman of Enron , today made his long - awaited appearance before Congress but declined to testify on the advice of his lawyers .
Mr Lay withdrew his voluntary testimony last week and appeared before the Senate commerce committee under subpoena .
He exercised his constitutional right not to testify , confining himself to a brief statement . ""
After agonising consideration , "" a sombre Mr Lay said , "" I can not disregard my counsel 's instruction , therefore I must respectfully decline to answer on fifth amendment grounds all the questions of this committee and subcommittee and of those of any other congressional committee and subcommittee . ""
Only a year ago , Mr Lay was mentioned as a possible energy secretary for George Bush , the recipient of generous political donations from Enron and Mr Lay - nicknamed "" Kenny Boy "" by the president .
Today , as Enron becomes a byword for corporate greed and financial skullduggery , Mr Lay was subjected to withering criticism as one senator after another laid into their mute witness . ""
Mr Lay , I regret that you have chosen not to explain to this committee , to the American public and to your former employees how you , and others in senior management and on the board of Enron , apparently failed so completely to fulfill your responsibilities , "" said Senator John McCain of Arizona , senior Republican on the committee .
With Mr Lay choosing to remain silent , senators were scheduled to hear from William Powers , an Enron director and dean of the University of Texas law school , who led an internal company investigation .
In prepared testimony , Mr Powers said that Mr Lay approved partnerships that helped hide debt , inflate profits and enrich certain employees .
Once America 's seventh largest company , Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2 in a collapse that cost thousands of jobs , wiped out billions of dollars in shareholder equity and raised questions about Enron 's political connections to the Bush White House and the Blair government .
The Powers report said Mr Lay was "" captain of the ship "" and , along with other executives , failed to keep track of partnerships created and managed by then Enron chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
Mr Lay "" bears significant responsibility for those flawed decisions , as well as for Enron 's failure to implement sufficiently rigorous procedural controls to prevent the abuses "" , Mr Powers said .
Mr Lay is the fifth person to stay silent , citing cited a constitutional right against self - incrimination ."
2002-02-12,"The lawyer who led the Nixon White House 's attempt to conceal incriminating evidence during the Watergate scandal has accused US Vice - President Dick Cheney of sinking to the same depths in the Enron affair .
John Dean , who served as the White House counsel under Richard Nixon , said Mr Cheney 's efforts to withhold details of his energy taskforce had put George Bush 's administration in "" cover - up mode "" .
In a stinging opinion article in yesterday 's New York Times , Mr Dean , who was briefly imprisoned for his role in Watergate , wrote that Mr Cheney 's stonewalling "" has a familiar ring to someone who served in the Nixon White House .
It is the sound of someone who has something to hide . ""
He scoffed at Mr Cheney 's claim that he was keeping the information secret as a matter of principle . ""
Richard Nixon was most vocal about maintaining this or that principle ... when he had the most to hide , "" Mr Dean wrote .
"" I can not but wonder what truly motivates Mr Cheney 's newfound interest in [ principles ] . ""
The vice - president is resisting a legal action from Congress ordering him to reveal what happened at meetings of his energy task force last year .
Such meetings can only remain secret if all those attending are government employees , but it is widely suspected in Washington that Enron executives , or other industry figures , may have wielded influence there .
Mr Cheney 's actions placed him "" knowingly or not in cover - up mode "" , Mr Dean said .
In a longer version of his article , published on the website Findlaw.com , he said of Mr Cheney and his legal advisers : "" They do n't care if their argu ments are baseless .
They are simply trying to cloud the air with smoke to obscure what would otherwise be a clear - cut legal answer - [ Congress ] has a legal right to the information it seeks , period . ""
The condemnation comes as Congress digested the news that Enron 's former chairman , Kenneth Lay , will assert his fifth - amendment right to silence when he is called to testify on the affair today .
On Sunday , Mr Lay made his first public appearance in a week , attending a Methodist church service in central Houston , where he told a reporter that things had been "" very tough "" but , "" with God 's help , we 'll get through "" .
This week 's edition of Newsweek magazine quoted Mr Lay as telling a friend : "" They are trying to trip me up .
They want to put me in jail .
Every fibre of my body wants to talk and tell my side of this . ""
He was worried for the health of Enron 's former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , who testified before Congress last week , the friend said .
Mr Skilling 's mother joined members of Congress in dismissing her son 's claim to have known little of Enron 's troubles , the magazine reported .
"" When you are the CEO , you are supposed to know what 's going on with the rest of the company , "" 77-year - old Betty Skilling said in an interview .
A Republican congressman , James Greenwood , spoke for many of his colleagues when he summarised Mr Skilling 's responses to questioning as "" the dog ate my homework "" .

The assistant labour secretary , Ann Combs , said she would seek agreement to replace them with independent experts ."
2002-02-12,"An old California politician called Jess Unruh used to say that money was the mother 's milk of American politics .
Over the next two days the House of Representatives will decide on a plan that reformers believe is the best chance ever to start the weaning process .
The Enron crisis , which has brought politicians ' dependence on donations into the headlines , may be the final impetus for a new scheme to restrict the handouts .
Though the vote could be desperately close , there are already signs of panic among supporters of the status quo .
They include the Republican Speaker of the House , Dennis Hastert , who has privately referred to the crucial vote , expected tomorrow , as "" Armageddon "" .
"" The stars are somewhat aligned in favour , "" says Trevor Potter , the former chairman of the regulatory body , the Federal Election Commission .
"" The Senate has already passed a bill , you have a major scandal , you have very persistent support for reform , and you have a president who has indicated that he will sign whatever bill passes Congress .
"" The connection between wealth and power will never be snapped .
The courts have made it clear that nothing can stop a billionaire such as Michael Bloomberg , the new mayor of New York , buying his way into office through weight of advertising , if he would rather spend his own money on that than a new yacht .
The bill before the House would , however , stem the flow of "" soft money "" .
This is generally paid in unregulated donations that evade the last major reform , passed in 1974 after the Watergate scandal , which stops anyone giving more than $ 1,000 ( £ 700 ) - "" hard money "" - to a single candidate .
But there are other , more creative , ways of handing out soft money .
Some candidates have run legitimate front organisations that do not mention the politician 's name .
All the executives of a major company ( this was an Enron ploy ) can give $ 1,000 each to the same politician .
And pressure groups , such as gun control and healthcare groups , organise single - issue ad campaigns that just happen to run at election time .
The House version of reform ( the Shays - Meehan bill ) is differently worded from the one that has passed the Senate ( McCain - Feingold ) .
However , both have the same principles , raising the ceiling on hard money , and clamping down on soft .
Normally , when the two chambers pass differing bills , a conference is called to reconcile them .
But Mr Hastert and other Republican leaders who oppose reform could pack the conference and quietly throttle the whole process .
If Shays - Meehan goes through , the reformers ' strategy will be to get the Senate to agree to the new measure at once .
Opponents are hoping to load it with enough unpalatable amendments to thwart that .
It will be a miracle , though , if any change makes life much harder . ""

2002-02-13,"Directors and senior employees of Enron Direct , the British retail arm of the collapsed Enron empire , received payments totalling £ 6.2 m for helping to secure a quick sale of the business , it emerged yesterday .
The commission payments are said by creditors to have been split between 14 unnamed directors and leading staff involved in negotiations that led to a £ 95 m takeover of the power retailer by British Gas Trading at the beginning of December .
Enron Europe administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers refused to comment on the payments after a closed meeting of Enron Direct creditors in London .
But joint administrator Neville Kahn said it was not unusual for incentive arrangements to be put in place in such situations .
He said similar schemes had been set up at other Enron Europe companies to maximise realisations for creditors .
According to the adminis trators , Enron Direct 's 270 creditors could now receive up to 73p in thepound compared with the 18p that would have been likely if no sale had taken place and the company had gone into liquidation .
Documents prepared for yesterday 's creditors ' meeting disclose that senior members of the company 's management team said they were unwilling to assist "" in progressing a rapid sale of the business "" unless incentive agreements were implemented .
The administrators said the subsequent sale - for £ 95.25 m compared with an indicative offer of £ 30 m from an unnamed bidder five days earlier - represented a recovery to creditors of between 55p and 73p in thepound .
"" This is a good result for creditors of this company , they will get a decent return , "" Mr Kahn told reporters after the meeting .
He said the administrators expected to be able to distribute about £ 94 m to creditors who are owed between £ 130 m and £ 170 m .
Creditors approved the proposals ."
2002-02-13,"Congressional investigators predicted that the unravelling of the Enron affair would now take "" several years "" after the fish everyone was most anxious to catch slipped away yesterday .
Kenneth Lay , the former chairman and chief executive of the fallen energy company , answered his subpoena to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee and , as predicted , answered no questions , asserting his right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate himself .
In a brief statement to the committee , Mr Lay said he was "" deeply troubled "" by the dilemma and had reached his decision not to give evidence only after "" deep soul - searching "" .
The senators were left almost gasping with frustration .
"" It 's not possible to determine why the Enron ship is at the bottom of the ocean unless we hear from the captain , "" said Ron Wyden of Oregon .
"" We are all reduced to a sense of futility , "" said John Kerry of Massachussetts .
With the enactment of this time - honoured and ritualised piece of Washington political theatre , the vast number of investigators working on the case have nowhere to go except towards reform of company law and/or a long slog of evidence - gathering to tie corporate executives - up to and including Mr Lay - to specific crimes .
The task is being complicated by absurd duplication .
Thirteen separate congressional committees are looking into the case : some of them do not expect to begin hearings before the autumn .
These are in addition to all the federal and local agencies which will eventually have to place their findings before a grand jury if prosecutions are to result .
"" The task is absolutely gargantuan , "" said a congressional source .
Enron had 2,832 offshore subsidiaries , all of which will presumably need to be studied .
So far most of the investigative headway has been made by the media .
The Wall Street Journal yesterday compounded the senators ' frustration by managing to link Mr Lay , for the first time , to at least one of the "" executive - run partnerships "" which helped hide Enron 's debts .
The Journal had a document with Mr Lay 's signature approving a deal with the LJM2 partnership , run by Enron 's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow .
Previously , Mr Lay had said he was not fully informed about the partnerships .
All the committee could do was force Mr Lay to listen , for an hour and a quarter , to the senators ' individual statements .
He sat , as upright and impassively as he could , while the politicians - many of whom had taken his money -lectured , hectored and occasionally insulted him .
Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois called him a "" most accomplished confidence trickster "" and added : "" I 'd say you were a car nival barker , except it would n't be fair to carnival barkers . ""
Barbara Boxer of California , whose state suffered an energy crisis last year in which Enron was deeply implicated , told him : "" I know you 're not going to talk to the committee .
You have the right , but I have the right to talk to you .
My state was bled dry by your price - gouging .
And what you did to your employees was without conscience . ""
Mr Lay said his refusal to answer questions was solely at the insistence of his lawyers and added : "" I come here today with a profound sadness about what has happened to Enron , its current and former employees , retirees and other stakeholders . ""
He is the sixth person involved in this scandal to plead the Fifth Amendment before Congress .
And the one significant exception , Jeffrey Skilling , also a former chief executive , was widely excoriated for his insistence that he was ignorant of the company 's practices .
Nearly all the senators refrained from overt political points , although the crucial House vote on campaign finance reform , expected today , provided a strong undertow to proceedings .
The one exception was the chairman , Fritz Hollings .
"" There 's no better example than Kenny Boy of cash - and - carry government , "" he said .
Mr Lay tried not to wince ."
2002-02-13,"Institutional shareholders are preparing to demand radical changes to the relationship between companies and their auditors , which could spell the end of accountants taking boardroom positions at firms they have monitored .
Investors are discussing ways to break up the traditionally cosy arrangement between public companies and the accountants who sign off their financial records , in an attempt to prevent any reruns of the Enron debacle .
They are ready to call for a five - year ban on lead auditors joining the boards of companies whose books they have regulated .
It has become common practice for auditors to join companies as finance directors .
Other measures being discussed include changing the person who acts as lead auditor every three years and insisting that the individual is identified in the report and accounts .
Currently lead auditors have to move on every seven years .
However , sources among institutional shareholders say they are unlikely to fall in line with the suggestions raised last month by the top City watchdog , Sir Howard Davies .
The financial services authority chairman is considering making it compulsory for auditing firms to be changed every five years .
Addressing the business audience at the recent World Economic Forum , he said the practice was "" helpful discipline "" in the public sector which had the "" useful effect of making auditors more ready to challenge clients "" .
The FSA 's proposals are expected to be contained in an overhaul of the listing rules which govern quoted companies .
The first draft will be issued for consultation this summer .
Big shareholders are understood to believe that this plan could be counterproductive , because it might allow company directors to hide potential problems from new auditors who are unfamiliar with the workings of the firm .
Shareholders would rather the senior partner , rather than the accountancy firm working on an audit , was rotated more often .
Investors are also likely to oppose any attempt to force companies to limit the amount of consultancy work that their auditors take on , as has been suggested by Sir Howard .
Many companies pay their auditors far more for consultancy services than for the basic audit function and there are fears that the auditors may be overly concerned about keeping the lucrative consultancy fees rather than questioning the management 's books .
This issue has been highlighted by the Enron case .
It is understood that sentiment among investors is running particularly high about the practice of auditors moving into full - time executive roles .
Critics believe this practice should be allowed only after a lengthy period of grace - probably five years .
Airtours , whose former Arthur Andersen auditor , David Jardine , was recruited , faced fierce questioning from shareholders at its annual meeting about the company 's continuing relationship with Andersen .

2002-02-13,"Downing Street today embarked on a high - risk rebuttal strategy over the prime minister 's controversial backing of the Romanian steel deal , dubbing it "" another Enron yawnathon "" .
After four days of constant bombardment from all quarters of the press , No 10 decided to go on the offensive ahead of this afternoon 's prime minister 's questions .
Mr Blair is "" unapologetic "" over his backing for Indian tycoon Lakshmi Mittal 's bid for a Romanian steel company , Downing Street said today .
Mr Blair 's official spokesman insisted that "" whatever the technical or legal definition "" of a British company , there were British interests at stake in the bid .
And he again insisted that neither the prime minister nor the UK 's ambassador to Bucharest had known of Mr Mittal 's £ 125,000 donation to the Labour party when the letter backing the bid was sent to the Romanian prime minister .
Mr Blair 's spokesman said : "" Whatever the technical definition of a UK company , this is an organisation which employs people in this country , which has its HQ in this country . ""
The prime minister is totally unapologetic about accepting foreign office advice and signing a letter , where that advice indicates British interests are involved . ""
The story of the connection between Mr Blair , Mr Mittal , and the Romanian steel deal first broke on Sunday - but was drowned out by the coverage of the death of Princess Margaret .
Since then , however , it has been revealed that Mr Mittal 's wife also gave a donation to the wife of Keith Vaz during Mr Vaz 's 1997 election campaign .
Mr Vaz , the controversial former minister for Europe , led a Westminster group lobbying for liberalisation in Romania ."
2002-02-14,"The Enron executive who blew the whistle on suspect accounting practices at the US energy conglomerate told a Congressional inquiry today that company executives were involved in "" sheer income statement manipulation "" designed to hide losses from shareholders .
Sherron Watkins , vice president for corporate development at Enron , said she "" was highly alarmed "" by information she had received about the company 's finances .
She repeatedly questioned Enron 's complex web of partnerships , run by executives who profited hugely from them , that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off the company 's balance sheet and hidden from investors and federal regulators . ""
My understanding as an accountant is that a company should never use its own stock to affect its income statements , "" she told a panel of Congressmen .
However , she said , employees at the company seemed to believe there was some accounting rule that made hiding the losses appropriate and legitimate .
The deals pushed Enron into bankruptcy in December .
Ms Watkins detailed a meeting in August with then - chairman Kenneth Lay in which she warned that investors were being misled by inflated profit statements .
Ms Watkins said she continued to ask questions and seek answers from colleagues who may have known more about the complex partnerships that eventually brought the company down .
"" I never heard reassuring explanations , "" she said in testimony to the House energy and commerce investigative subcommittee .
Ms Watkins said that when it appeared that Enron 's former chief financial officer and architect of the partnerships , Andrew Fastow , was being considered for promotion to chief executive , she decided to go directly to Mr Lay in hopes that the financial improprieties would be corrected .
After the August meeting with Mr Lay , she said , "" Mr Lay assured me that he would look into my concerns . ""
However , in response , Mr Lay only asked Enron 's law firm to investigate the matter , Watkins said .
Mr Lay resigned as Enron chairman last month , and has refused to testify in front of the committee on the grounds that he may incriminate himself .
Ms Watkins said she warned Mr Lay again on October 30 that "" we need to come clean "" and disclose the heavy financial losses from the partnerships .
Also today , Enron sacked two of its top accounting officers , chief accounting officer , Richard Causey , and chief risk officer , Richard Buy .
Both men were fired with immediate effect in a disciplinary action stemming from a review by the board of directors ."
2002-02-14,"An investigation was launched yesterday to determine whether the Enron Corporation was responsible for the blackouts that hit California last year and whether they artificially inflated the price of electricity in the state .
The new inquiry comes amid allegations that the company may have dishonestly manipulated the supply of electricity to west coast states .
The federal energy regulatory commission ( Ferc ) announced yesterday that a "" fact - finding "" initiative into Enron 's role was under way .
West coast Democrats have long suspected Enron involvement in the energy crisis , and there have been calls from Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington to explore the company 's role .
The issue is complicated by the fact that the commission 's chairman , Pat Wood , is the person recommended to the commission by the disgraced Enron chief , Kenneth Lay .
"" I 'm an independent guy , "" said Mr Wood yesterday , adding that his first move as chairman when appointed last year was to impose price caps which he said was "" clearly to tally antithetical to Enron 's point of view "" .
A further illustration of the labyrinthine connections thrown up by the scandal is that the California governor , Gray Davis , who is the politician most damaged by the blackouts , was also a recipient of campaign funding from Mr Lay .
The investigation will be carried out jointly by the securities and exchange commis sion , the commodities futures trading commission and the justice department to establish whether prices were manipulated .
"" We want to understand the whole story , "" Mr Wood said .
Investigators trying to sift through the wreckage of the fallen energy company have identified two figures they believe can help break the case .
One is Ben Glisan , the company 's former treasurer , whom the justice department reportedly favours as the most likely figure to be "" flipped "" - turned into a prosecution witness in return for possible immunity .
The other is Michael Kopper , who was seen as the right - hand man of Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and was managing partner of LJM , involved in one of the partnership deals used to hide Enron 's debts ."

Frustrated by the parade of senior Enron figures , including the former chief executive Kenneth Lay , who have gone to congressional hearings and either used the fifth amendment to exercise their right to silence or presented themselves as innocent know - nothings , the US justice department is hopeful that testimony from these two men could help their investigation . ""
Glisan would know , if not everything , then a heck of a lot , "" the investigator said .
"" He was deeply involved with both Enron and LJM and he ca n't pretend the partnerships were operating without his knowledge .
The same goes for Kopper . ""
The Financial Times said yesterday that the justice department inquiry was centring on two transactions , called Chewco and Raptor , in which Mr Glisan was involved .
The company 's own internal inquiry said that Mr Kopper and his domestic partner , William Dodson , made $ 10 m on a $ 125,000 investment in Chewco .
Mr Glisan is alleged to have turned $ 6,000 into $ 1 m .
The American press is beginning to claim possession of several "" smoking guns "" with Mr Lay 's fingerprints on them .
The Chicago Tribune said it had seen company minutes showing that the Enron board had witnessed detailed presentations by Mr Fastow about the partnerships and approved many of the techniques he used to hide the company 's debts .
The Wall Street Journal , meanwhile , said it had seen a memo suggesting that Mr Lay had deliberately misled the public over the reasons for the departure from the company of Jeffrey Skilling , who was chief executive until August .
There was some good news for Mr Lay yesterday : he sold one of the four houses he owns in the ski resort of Aspen , Colorado , for $ 10 m , more than five times the price he and his wife paid for it 11 years ago ."

But the Kenneth L Lay Chair in International Economics at the University of Missouri , it would appear , is that job .
As the former chairman of the collapsed Enron Corporation refuses to provide Congress with an explanation of his own innovative approach to international economics , academics at his alma mater are inviting applications for the post he established in 1999 with a gift of $ 1.1 m ( £ 767,000 ) in Enron stock .

"" And if you 're asking would we give the money back , the answer 's no . ""
Mr Lay received an undergraduate degree and a master 's from Missouri , and "" wanted to help the university , "" said Prof Troske .
Proving their worth as economists , the faculty cashed Mr Lay 's gift long ago , when the shares were worth $ 82 apiece , avoiding the plight of former Enron employees now mourning their retirement plans .
"" I do n't think the name will be a negative , "" the department 's chairman , Michael Podgursky , said .
"" It 's not the Osama bin Laden chair . ""
Prof Troske concurred .

2002-02-14,"The Institute of Chartered Accountants yesterday signalled it was ready to respond to calls from investors for a five - year ban on lead auditors joining the boards of the companies they have regulated .
Peter Wyman , deputy president of the powerful accounting body , said the moratorium - which might end the common practice of auditors becoming finance directors - would be adopted if it helped to "" restore confidence "" in auditors and accountants following the collapse of Enron .
The demands from investors , revealed in the Guardian , came as Mr Wyman flew to Washington to lobby the US securities and exchange commission for urgent changes to the "" serious system problems "" in American accounting rules in order to avoid more Enron - style debacles .
Mr Wyman is calling on Harvey Pitt , the head of the SEC , to embrace the concept of "" truth and fairness "" used by UK auditors before they endorse a company 's financial statement .
This truth and fairness test would allow auditors to use their judgement to override the prescriptive box - ticking rules of auditing .
Such a practice might have helped prevent the collapse of Enron where it does not appear that any accountancy rules were actually breached .
Auditors in the US are not currently required to exercise such judgment and are expected to adhere to strict rules - the heart of the systemic problem with US accounting in the eyes of Mr Wyman .
Mr Wyman is looking to make progress to unite the US with Britain in five areas : accounting standards ; auditing standards ; corporate governance ; ethical framework ; and enforcement policies .
He hopes that winning the support of Mr Pitt for the principle of a judgment test might help to speed up changes being demanded by Sir David Tweedie , chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board .
Sir David , who will will today give evidence to the US senate hearings on the demise of Enron , is trying to set a worldwide set of standards for accountants .
Mr Wyman said yesterday that his talks with Mr Pitt were given a new relevance following the Enron controversy . ""
Part of the problem is we have global companies and global investors , and there is an assumption that you read one set of accounts in one country in the same way as another , "" he said .
"" What we need to have is a single global financial language . ""
He acknowledged that the UK approach to accounting standards was not preventing concerns arising about the financial records of some British companies .
"" We are not complacent , "" he said .
The ICA , which registers and regulates accountants in England and Wales , is supportive of a sweeping review of the relationship between auditors and accountants .
However , Mr Wyman said , there was little evidence to date to link accountancy problems at companies where the auditing firm was also providing consultancy advice .
It is likely the ICA would resist any move - as raised by the financial services authority chairman Sir Howard Davies - to limit the amount of consultancy work that can be carried out by auditors .
Instead , Mr Wyman is calling for a clearer explanation of "" non - audit fees "" used by companies to differentiate between the money paid for auditing work and money paid for other services provided by firms .
He also called on rule makers and investors to avoid a knee - jerk reaction to change following the collapse of Enron . ""
We need a very considered review , "" he said ."
2002-02-14,"After marathon debate , the US House of Representatives gave its approval early today to the most sweeping overhaul of campaign spending rules since the Watergate scandals a generation ago .
The debate took place against the backdrop of the Enron scandal , in which the collapsed energy giant has been accused of exercising undue influence over the Republican administration 's energy policy .
In another recent controversy over the politics and money nexus , it was widely suggested that Michael Bloomberg , the billionaire and new mayor of New York , effectively bought his way into office by means of his massive advertising budget .
Financial scandal is not restricted to the Republican side of US politics .
The Democrats also received donations from Enron - $ 700 m ( £ 490 m ) , or slightly less than half that given to the Republicans , in 2000 .
And Bill Clinton was dogged throughout his term by accusations of financial impropriety in the Whitewater investigations into his land dealings in Arkansas .
There is a widespread feeling in America , which has been simmering for some time but has been brought to a head by the Enron debacle , that corporate influence has become far too pervasive at every level of US politics .
The bipartisan vote of 240 - 189 on the landmark campaign finance measure sent it to the Senate , where opponents held out the threat of a filibuster .
House Republican leaders battled to the end against the bill designed to reduce the role of money in politics , arguing it was stacked against their party and unconstitutional as well .
But the opponents of the bill were checked at nearly every turn by a bipartisan coalition led by Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican , and Martin Meehan , a Massachusetts Democrat .
"" People think money taints every decision that is made in this Congress , "" Republican Sherwood Boehlert said .
The New York lawmaker was one of 39 rank and file Republicans to buck their leadership on a 240 - 191 late afternoon vote , which bestowed preliminary approval on the legislation .
With so many lawmakers directly affected by the legislation , feelings ran high throughout more than 15 hours of debate .
Supporters and opponents routinely accused one another of hypocrisy as they bickered their way through a string of votes .
In the end , 198 Democrats , 41 Republicans and one independent voted for the bill , while 12 Democrats , 176 Republicans and one independent were opposed .
Senate supporters , led by senators John McCain and Russell Feingold , hoped for swift acquiescence that would send the legislation to President Bush 's desk for his signature , although a filibuster loomed as the last - ditch hope of opponents .
Mr Bush has generally stayed above the fray , even though the White House stepped in during the day to criticise a late change inserted by supporters as "" unfair , unwise and unwarranted "" .
Despite his reliance on funding from Enron and other corporate sponsors , Mr Bush had campaigned on a pledge to clean up the Oval Office .
The promise was meant to refer to his predecessor 's scandal - wracked term including his unorthodox use of the presidential offices while conducting an affair with one of his interns , Monica Lewinsky .
Mr Meehan and others insisted Republicans had incorrectly interpreted the provision that Bush opposed , which related to long - standing rules governing permissible uses of different types of campaign donations .
At the same time they drafted clarifying language and agreed to insert it into the bill before final passage .
Two senior Republicans who advise the White House said that Bush 's political team had determined that the bill would pass , and that the president had decided against a veto .
Still , the developments on and off the House floor underscored the unpredictability of an issue that has long veered between lofty constitutional concerns and bare - knuckled political combat . ""
The current campaign finance system is a disaster and it 's an embarrassment to American democracy , "" said Republican Bernard Sanders , one of a parade of lawmakers who argued that legislation was needed to rein in special interests .
Several supporters made mention of the scandal surrounding Enron , the bankrupt energy trading company .
But critics argued just as passionately the bill was unconstitutional , and a fraud as well . ""
This bill strips citizens of their political rights and unconstitutionally attempts to regulate political speech , "" said Republican Tom DeLay .
The House bill would ban unlimited "" soft money "" donations to the national political parties , typically donations of five and six figures made by corporations , unions and individuals .
State and local parties would be permitted to raise soft money , but only in amounts of $ 10,000 or less .
None of the funds could be spent on political commercials .
The bill , pushed to the floor over the opposition of Republican leaders , also would ban the use of soft money to buy "" issue ads "" within 60 days of an election or 30 days of a primary .
These ads are typically purchased by interest groups , and while they stop short of expressly advocating the victory or defeat of a candidate , they often are harshly critical .
The House voted 327 - 101 for an amendment offered by Mr Shays and Mr Meehan to strike a Senate provision that requires broadcasters to sell political candidates advertising time at the lowest rate charged to commercial customers .
The House also backed proposed amendments from Mr Shays and Mr Meehan to raise the regulated , individual hard - money donations to candidates and parties from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per election and raise contribution limits for candidates facing wealthy opponents who are financing their own campaigns ."
2002-02-14,"Another week , another scandal involving the government and business .
This week it 's the turn of obscure steel tycoon , Lakshmi Mittal , to join the list of wealthy friends - Bernie Ecclestone , the Hindujas , Enron and Andersen - for whom ministers are said to have offered favours in exchange for cash .
It will take more than a few mentions of "" garbagegate "" to see the prime minister helicoptered from office à la Nixon .
So far none of the facts detailing Labour 's business links justifies the implication of sleaze suggested in much of the coverage .
Whatever the faults of British politics , endemic corruption is not among them .
The real problem is far more depressing and insidious .
The conspiracy theorists are simply missing the point .
For New Labour , closeness to business is an ideological imperative , not a financial expedient .
Tony Blair would have bowed to pressure from Ecclestone , Enron and Andersen whether they had given money to the Labour party or not .
In each case the financial link was quite irrelevant .
For me it seems entirely plausible , for example , that Blair signed the letter on behalf of LNM without knowing that its owner had given money to the Labour party .
Unquestioning acceptance of the business view was long ago established as New Labour 's own peculiar form of political correctness .
The root of the problem lies in the crushing political defeats Labour suffered in the 1980s and early 90s to which the scorched - earth approach of Blairism was the ultimate response .
In a ruthless bid to expunge the failures of Old Labour no measures were considered too strong .
Splits and extremism were replaced by control - freakery .
Neil Kinnock 's media crucifixion gave birth to spin and a neurotic obsession with the leader 's image .
The impression that Labour was weak on defence was erased by a foreign policy made in Washington .
Since the forces of conservatism could not be defeated , they had to be incorporated or appeased .
This principle applied doubly to the business community whose leaders had inflicted such damaging wounds on Labour 's election campaigns in 1983 and 1987 .
To counter the accusation that Labour was anti - business , New Labour 's architects decided to sacrifice critical judgment to the all - out embrace of the profit motive .
In a "" dynamic market economy "" , the private sector could no longer be dismissed as Mammon or even treated as one voice among many to be reconciled in the public interest .
As the principal wealth creators of new Britain , entrepreneurs were to be regarded as bearers of the general interest and given special status accordingly .
Cosy relationships with wealthy entrepreneurs gave Blair something far more valuable than money : it gave him the business seal of approval .
In this context , the recent attempt to put distance between New Labour and Andersen , the disgraced consultancy firm , is quite laughable .
Those who were around before the ' 97 election can remember a time when Labour 's Treasury team openly boasted that control of tax policy had been taken from party members and given to a team of accountants from the very same Andersen .
It was a point of pride not a guilty secret .
It is here that any com - parison with the sleaze of the Tory years falls flat .
The scandals of the Major government were the result of hubris and the belief of senior Tories in their divine right to rule .
Aitken and Archer lied brazenly because they thought they were untouchable , above the law .
New Labour 's dalliance with questionable corporate interests is the result of something else - a profound and obsessive insecurity .
Whether Labour can address these psychological flaws is the big issue that will decide the fate of this government .
Defensive and rooted in the past , New Labour is incapable of providing a governing philosophy for the long term .
It has no fixed points of reference , except to define itself by what it is not - old Labour .
With each passing week , as the government flip - flops from u - turn to crisis , these limitations become more and more apparent .
Can Labour slay its demons and develop a more confident and positive style of governing ?
The signs are mixed , at best .
Gordon Brown signals his willing ness to open up a debate on tax and spend before retreating in the face of hostile coverage from the Sun .
Stephen Byers admits that the third way is "" flaky "" and then gives the go ahead to part - privatisation of London Underground , the flakiest third way idea yet .
Tony Blair 's pledges unswerving support for public sector workers before denouncing their unions as wreckers .
Times have changed , Mr Blair .
It is time to modernise yourself again , for even you must realise that the long - term future of your government depends more on its ability to motivate teachers and nurses than on its popularity in the boardrooms of Britain . ·
David Clark is a former special adviser to the government .

2002-02-14,"Barclays today said it has increased its provisions for bad debts by 35 % to £ 1.15bn to account for "" the current deterioration in economic conditions "" .
The move comes after the collapse of Enron and other companies such as the telecoms company , Global Crossing .
The bad debt charges at Britain 's fourth largest bank broadly matches market expectations for provisions of about £ 1.1bn .
The general view is that , unlike some continental European rivals , UK banks will come through relatively unscathed from corporate failures .
The bank also announced plans to split its shares into four in an attempt to make the stock more affordable to small investors .
Barclays shares currently change hands at over £ 22 each .
For 2001 , Barclays reported pre - tax profits of £ 3.6bn , a rise of 9 % from £ 3.3bn in 2000 .
"" These results were achieved despite a significant slowdown in all the major economies , volatile stock markets and the technology , media and telecoms sector rundown , and the tragic events of 11th September , "" Matthew Barrett , the chief executive , said in a statement .
Under Mr Barrett , Barclays has produced strong revenue growth from a broad spread of businesses , including business banking , wealth management , credit cards and investment banking .
As a result , the bank has been a strong performer in the markets .
The bank added mortgages in 2000 when it bought Woolwich , the mortgage provider .
Since then Barclays has turned its attention to acquisition opportunities in continental Europe .
There has also been speculation that Barclays is interested in acquiring Standard Chartered , the Asian specialist , which was at the centre of bid rumours late last year .
Mr Barrett said : "" Our business development over the next 10 years will be biased towards increasing the profit stream from outside the UK "" .
Refusing to rule out acquisitions , he said : "" We do n't feel a compulsion to do a transaction but if it was value - creating and made sense we would not take it off the table "" .
Barclays employs around 78,000 staff and has more than 2,000 branches in the UK ."
2002-02-14,"Tony Blair was battling last night to defend his lobbying on behalf of Indian steel boss Lakshmi Mittal after Downing Street , in a day of evasions and contradictions , admitted Mr Blair 's letter of support was altered to remove any reference to his personal connections with Mr Mittal .
The prime minister was forced to defend his actions to MPs , describing the row as "" not Watergate , but garbagegate "" .
He added : "" It 's the biggest load of garbage since the last load of garbage , which was Enron . ""
But the questions about why Mr Blair personally backed a bid by a Labour donor to take over Romania 's state - owned steel company gathered momentum during the day , with the issue dominating two confrontational Downing Street briefings to political journalists as well as prime minister 's questions in the Commons .
The government changed tack through the day , no longer asserting that Mr Blair had been ignorant of Mr Mittal 's £ 125,000 donation to the Labour party at the time the letter was sent .
Instead the Downing Street spokesman adopted a new defence , saying Mr Blair was not aware of the connection between Mr Mittal and his company LNM , which was bidding to buy the steel plant .
But the Guardian has established that Mr Mittal was a guest at a lavish thank you party for up to 150 prominent Labour donors , held at the home of chief fundraiser Lord Levy after the election , which the prime minister attended .
The party was just weeks before the letter of July 23 backing the bid to buy the steel plant , and Mr Mittal was one of three Asian donors present .
Downing Street last night said it did not know whether the prime minister encountered Mr Mittal at the party .
Mr Blair told MPs that Mr Mittal 's Labour donation was a matter of public record , adding : "" The letter that I signed did not mention Mr Mittal , but mentioned the company LNM , of which I had no knowledge . ""
Having said that , had I known that he was someone who is a supporter of the Labour party , it would have made no difference whatever to the signing of the letter "" .
A reference to Mr Mittal being a friend of Mr Blair had been removed from the original draft by the time it reached Mr Blair , the prime minister 's spokesman said .
The government denied that the removal had been at the instigation of Jonathan Powell , Mr Blair 's chief of staff and sometime party fundraiser .
Foreign Office officials in Bucharest confirmed the report in yesterday 's Guardian that Mr Blair 's letter backing Mr Mittal had been crucial to the businessman sealing the contract to buy the giant Romanian steel works Sidex last year .
Diplomats in Bucharest said the letter had been partly designed to stop a "" wobble "" caused by a late rival bid from the French steel firm Usinor .
The government , backed by a personal statement from Richard Ralph , the British ambassador in Romania , insisted that it is common practice for diplomats to support British firms seeking contracts .
But the Conservative leader , Iain Duncan Smith , demanded to know how the British government could describe LNM as British since it was owned by an Asian citizen whose headquarters is in the Dutch Antilles and who employs only 0.1 % of his workforce in Britain .
The challenge was given greater force when the Irish steel unions revealed that John Major 's government in 1996 had fiercely lobbied the European commission to prevent Mr Mittal 's firm taking over the Irish steel industry .
The Irish steel union said : "" No one suggested at the time Mr Mittal was leading a British take - over of the Irish steel industry "" .
But Mr Blair insisted the letter had been sent on the objective and justified advice of the British ambassador in Bucharest .
He told MPs : "" The reason why the embassy in Romania asked us to sign the letter is because it was an important contract .
We fully supported the Romanian government 's policy of economic reform . ""
Mr Ralph himself described the sale of Sidex as "" the privatisation of the decade "" and "" hugely important in terms of creating the fully functioning free market economy which the European Union has set as a fundamental criterion for Romanian accession to the EU "" .
He recommended the letter be sent since "" it would send a strong signal of British government support in the hope that this would stimulate in creased British investment in and trade with Romania "" .
Mr Blair 's spokesman also claimed the Romanian prime minister , Adrian Nastase , had debunked the central allegations against Mr Blair in a statement on Monday when he said "" the privatisation of a firm like Sidex could not be done on the basis of a letter irrespective of whom it would come from .
The letter came at a moment when the evaluation and examination process and the decision had been taken "" .
Last year however , Mr Nastase had stressed the importance of the British government 's support for Mr Mittal , saying some had described "" our partner as somewhat ineffable dwelling somewhere in the isles and using a post office box as an HQ .
Therefore I welcome Mr Mittal and his excellency the ambassador of Great Britain confirming that the LMN group is an extremely reliable partner setting forth on a sound economic endeavour "" ."
2002-02-15,"The whistleblower who warned of the impending accounting scandal at the US energy firm
Enron last August broke her silence yesterday , and pinned the blame firmly on the finance chief , Andrew Fastow , and the former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling .
In the most revealing day yet of the lengthy Capitol Hill hearings on the issue , Sherren Watkins , the Enron accountant who raised the concerns , portrayed a company where corruption was rife .
She said Mr Fastow had attempted to fire her and seize her computer after he learned of her memo to Enron 's chairman at the time , Kenneth Lay .
She also disclosed that Cliff Baxter , the Enron executive who killed himself two weeks ago , had warned Mr Skilling in March that the company was "" heading for a train wreck "" .
Enron became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history in December .
Ms Watkins shifted blame for the collapse away from the former chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay , who is a friend of President Bush .
She suggested that Mr Lay had been duped by Mr Fastow and Mr Skilling , and had not understood the gravity of the problems facing the company .
She later agreed that he "" just did n't get it "" .
It emerged that Ms Watkins , an accountant with 19 years ' experience , had issued a second memo to Mr Lay on October 30 last year urging him to "" come clean "" .
Ms Watkins also implicated Richard Causey , the chief accounting officer , and Richard Buy , the chief risk officer , who were both fired by the bankrupt company yesterday .
The tone of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing was markedly different from the hectoring and grandstanding atmosphere of recent weeks .
Quietly spoken , Ms Watkins , 42 , has been portrayed as the hero of the company 's fall and was described as "" an incredibly courageous woman "" .
Ms Watkins was working for Mr Fastow when she wrote her initial seven - page memo , which warned the company could "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
When he learned of the memo , she said , "" Mr Fastow wanted me fired and wanted my computer "" .
Ms Watkins also incriminated the auditors , Arthur Andersen .
She said she had raised the issue of the partnerships that were being used to inflate its earnings with a member of Andersen 's in August , who agreed there may be a cause for concern .
She said she had been shocked that the partnerships had been "" common knowledge "" in the company . ""
The facts were very easy to discover .
They were n't really hidden , "" she said ."
2002-02-15,"It is easy to understand why the US Congress is so eager to find the bad guy in the saga of Enron , the world 's largest ever bankruptcy .
The Enron debacle has been a bitter blow to the American psyche in the wake of September 11 .
The shock of the terrorist attacks on a nation that saw itself as invincible , both morally and actually , has now been followed by a scandal that has shaken faith in its foremost financial and political institutions .
America wants its certainties back - it wants to know who the bad guys are and how to deal with them , whether that 's the "" axis of evil "" of President Bush 's state of the union address or the baddies on Wall Street .
The House energy and commerce committee , which is leading the investigation into Enron , has its own little axis to hunt down .
But it is arguable whether the rush to vilify the former chairman and chief executive , Kenneth Lay , has made matters better or worse .
The grandstanding among the members of the committee , each trying to outdo the hyperbole of the next , has been ugly from the start .
Perhaps the presence of TV cameras and a gripped nation has had some small effect .
It is difficult to have too much sympathy for the Enron executives who made millions of dollars as the company slowly burned but it has been equally as tough to side with the lynch mob mentality of Congress .
The chairman of the committee , Billy Tauzin , this week referred to Enron as "" an incredible collection of miscreants "" .
Despite being billed as an investigation into the events surrounding the collapse of Enron , the committee seems to have already made up its mind .
Now it appears , from the compelling testimony of Sherren Watkins , the Enron whistleblower , that Mr Lay was guilty of nothing more than stupidity .
According to her version of events , Mr Lay found himself duped by senior executives at the company and had been unaware of the debts stashed off shore .
If true , Mr Lay 's decision to take the fifth amendment , because he felt the hearings were turning into a witchhunt , suddenly appears perfectly valid .
That shaken confidence in the foundations of Wall Street is being called "" Enronitis "" by investors - the tendency to develop Fox Mulder - like levels of distrust .
Another phrase that has been coined is financial McCarthyism , reflecting the intense levels of paranoia .
Investors no longer have faith in balance sheets , in the accountants that are supposed to ensure the accuracy of financial reporting or in the investment banks that are supposed to be giving clear independent advice .
The country has now witnessed three large bankruptcies in as many months - Enron , Kmart and the telecoms company Global Crossing .
The securities and exchange commission is involved with all three .
Few individuals are emerging from the Enron affair with much credit .
But away from the grandstanding , the urge to restore some belief in the financial and political systems is at least having some positive outcome .
Enron first made the real headlines , do n't forget , as a political scandal .
The Bush administration escaped with a light bruising .
But people , it seemed , were still shocked to find that Enron and other companies give money to politicians in the hope of getting something in return .
You could of course ask : why else would they ?
A firm like Enron , giving cash to both Republicans and Democrats , is not doing it for ideological reasons .
Campaign reform , which if not for Enron would likely have foundered , has become a reality .
So too on Wall Street , the big name accounting firms have now each announced they are splitting the consultancy and auditing arms that could cause conflicts of interest .
Analysts in investment banks who advise investors on where to put their money will be under new rules to guarantee more independence .
They will be forced for instance to declare personal holdings in shares on research notes .
Directors of companies , who in certain cases had a year to disclose share sales , will be made to report them within days .
The Enron collapse was horribly timed .
The financial world was only just beginning to recover from the dot.com bust , another reason to lose trust .
Then , as signs of recovery were detected , came September 11 .
After that came this latest wave of accounting scandals .
It would be much cleaner to find that the collapse of Enron was the fault of a few rogue individuals instead of a more systemic failure .
Truth is the bad guys are not all wearing black hats and they are not going to be that easy to pin down ."
2002-02-15,"Some of the most senior figures in the cabinet fear the Labour party is facing an unprecedented drought in donations in the wake of the controversy over two prominent donors , Lakshmi Mittal and Enron .
The crisis has been intensified by a secret decision by trade unions affiliated to the party last week to withhold funds previously given to Labour .
The withdrawal of the union fund - based on 10p per affiliated union members - means as much as £ 1.2 m will be held back from the party by the unions in a full parliament .
The unions ' decision , taken last Wednesday at a meeting with Labour 's general secretary , David Triesman , partly came after accusations that the party was trying to control use of the fund , which is intended to fund union activity in the party .
Labour is already £ 10 m in debt and can ill afford any further loss of funds .
The GMB union , which intends to be much more selective in its deployment of funds , agreed this week to only back Labour council candidates in the May local elections who oppose council services privatisation Tony Blair is edging towards support for some form of state funding for political parties , but believes he can not publicly lead the argument for change .
"" If we are the ones to start the debate , it will fall at the first fence , "" said one cabinet minister , aware that the taxpayer is not eager to fork out money for unpopular political parties .
Both the Conservative party and senior union leaders insisted yesterday that parties would lose their vitality and democratic integrity if they became reliant on state funding .
Downing Street wants more independent voices to lead the argument .
As a starting point , the Labour - controlled environment select committee yesterday announced an inquiry into state funding .
Its chairman , Andrew Bennett , said : "" It seems to be clear in the wake of this week 's controversies that it is going to be very difficult to get rich individuals to donate money to political parties .
Either the prime minister says the donation brought no favours , in which case a businessman might say "" why give money ? ' , or else the prime minister is accused of taking cash for favours , in effect a bribe .
Either way the position appears politically unsustainable .
"" The committee is to ask Sam Younger , chairman of the electoral commission , to give evidence .
Mr Younger has already announced an inquiry of his own into the issue .
The influential centre - left thinktank , the Institute of Public Policy Research , also announced its own inquiry yesterday .
The IPPR 's director , Mathew Taylor , said continuing rows over links between private donors and political parties only served "" to deepen people 's cynicism of politicians and politics .
This has serious implications for democracy and is a concern to all the main political parties .
The time is right for a hard - headed look at this issue "" .
Opposition to state funding from unions , the Conservatives and possibly public opinion might make a change impossible .
But Downing Street believes more thoughtful figures inside the Tory party may realise the continuing rows over cash for favours are damaging politics .
The Conservatives will be tempted to reply that Labour provoked the current crisis by attacking Tory sleaze when in opposition ."
2002-02-15,"It is two weeks since Tony Blair told Labour 's national executive that he remained opposed to more state funding of Britain 's political parties .
But that was then , mid - Enron , and this is now , mid-(or
mid - to - end ) Garbagegate .
As things stand , it would be false ( as well as a dreadful cliché ) to say the government is mired in sleaze .
But two brouhahas have followed hard upon one another .
The stuff sticks embarrassingly to the boots , and Mr Blair is exasperated by it .
This Mittal fatigue is why Mr Blair is now open to the idea that he dismissed so recently .
Public funding of politics is back on Downing Street 's to - do list .
Seizing the moment , the IPPR thinktank announced an instant inquiry yesterday .
More significantly in the long run , the statutory electoral commission , also plans to look at the issue early next year .
Good .
Labour 's annoyance that the money in politics issue will not lie down is understandable .
Mr Blair , after all , brought in a good law two years ago that put the facts and figures about political donations out in the open , and banned foreign gifts to British parties , two changes that the Conservatives would never have made .
But transparency has not done the trick .
It has made life even worse for the politicians in some ways , and it is no great shakes for the donors either .
What party would really want the cheque for £ 125,000 if it comes with such garbage attached ?
And who would want to write the cheque either , knowing the grief it would entail ?
In the world of political donations law , the cure can sometimes be as much trouble as the original disease .
That is how it has played out in the US , where the well - meant post - Watergate reforms begat the awful "" soft money "" culture which the House of Representatives , chastened by Enron , voted to scrap on Wednesday .
British politics is much , much cleaner than politics across the Atlantic .
But the unmissable lesson of the last month is that the way we do things needs to be cleaner still .
How can that be achieved ?
Two useful things can be done quickly .
First , bring in a short bill to establish a cap on individual donations .
Pending wider reform , the exact figure may have to be higher than in an ideal world ; but if America can get by with a $ 2,000 annual limit , as the bill passed by Congress proposes , we can manage in the end with £ 1,000 .
Second , put all - party pressure on the commission to place its inquiry on the fast track , so there is time for a wider reform this parliament .
The objective must be to diminish private funding , but without scrapping the right of individuals ( as opposed to companies and other organisations ) to support the party of their choice .
This will involve setting new spending limits , especially in elections , and such changes would be opposed both by Tories and unions .
It could also involve the system offering productivity changes to make state funding more palatable to taxpayers - fewer members of the two houses but better supported , for instance .
All this has to be seen as part of a wider rededication of public life , but without such an overall approach , politicians of all kinds will find it hard to shake off an often undeserved taint ."
2002-02-15,"Two of continental Europe 's top banks provided some relief for the sector yesterday , with Holland 's ABN Amro defying predictions of a dividend cut and Switzerland 's UBS turning in a smaller than expected fall in profits .
ABN Amro saw debt provisions soar 144 % to € 1.43bn ( £ 870 m ) , blaming the rise on "" the collapse of large corporates during the year "" and problems in the US small business sector .
ABN declined to give details beyond saying it had slightly increased its initial € 112 m provision against exposure to collapsed US energy group Enron .
With more staff than expected taking up redundancy or early retirement , ABN added a further € 147 m to the cost of its lay - off programme .
With efforts to cut costs beginning to bear fruit in the second half , partially offsetting the impact of the higher provisions , net profit was € 2.36bn , down from € 3.1bn the previous year .
"" We remain cautious about the health of the US and European economies despite some recent positive signs , "" chairman Rijkman Groenink said .
UBS was equally guarded .
"" The potential to outperform 2001 is limited , "" said Peter Wuffli , president of the bank 's executive board , after the bank had reported a 24 % fall in fourth - quarter net profit to Sfr1.1bn .
Bad debt charges in the fourth quarter totalled Sfr115 m , down from Sfr171 m in the previous three months but still ahead of the Sfr95 in the final quarter of the previous year ."
2002-02-16,"About 100 Enron energy traders stand to pocket commission payments of up to £ 24 m to help administrators unwind the company 's complex trading book .
Details of the proposed payments emerged during a series of meetings for creditors of the collapsed energy firm 's European operations in London yesterday .
Enron Europe has more than 5,000 creditors , among them former employees with claims of £ 30 m .
Sombre creditors leaving meetings of Enron Capital and Trade Resources and Enron Gas and Petrochemicals Trading , said the incentive schemes were put in place by the administrators , PricewaterhouseCoopers , in order to retain suitably skilled staff after making 1,100 UK employees redundant last November .
The administrators , who are processing the claims of employees who had to leave , are in the process of unwinding Enron 's trading book which had 250,000 outstanding trading positions at the time of their appointment .
Neville Kahn , joint administrator of Enron Europe , said the incentives were normal in such a situation .
"" A lot of information is in people 's heads , "" he said after the meeting .
"" Details of trades are very closely linked to traders .
Once we managed to get the incentives in place , traders were able to help us make the substantial realisations we have done .
""
The administrators said they expected to raise at least $ 750 m ( £ 524 m ) to $ 1bn cash from the sale of assets and recoveries from third parties .
About half of the expected final tally has been raised including £ 125 m that will come in from trading contracts .
The administrators have also sold the group 's British retail power arm , Enron Direct , for £ 96.4 m and are expected to pull in $ 250 m from the previously announced disposal of Enron Metals .

A US group of former Enron employees , backed by the political activist Jesse Jackson , yesterday appealed to a bankruptcy court for $ 100 m in severance pay ."
2002-02-17,"Wall Street 's most respected banks face legal action by Enron shareholders over their role as ' cheerleaders ' to the collapsed energy trader .
A lawsuit is set to be filed shortly in the US accusing analysts from Goldman Sachs , Salomon Smith Barney and JP Morgan Chase of recommending Enron shares in order to help their employers obtain lucrative work from the Texan group .
Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and others could also be targeted .
All deny wrongdoing , but the action is a further threat to the credibility of New York 's banks .
Many already face multimillion - dollar claims over the ' buy ' recommendations their analysts made during the dotcom boom .
Banks were also recently forced by the New York Stock Exchange to take extra steps to safeguard analysts ' independence .
The news comes as a separate lawsuit alleges that Enron 's former president and chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , misled concerned investors about the actions of two companies set up by Enron 's former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
In a conference call on 12 July last year Skilling - who last week was accused of lying under oath before a US congressional committee - was asked about Enron 's dealings with two Cayman Island firms , LJM and LJM2 .
According to a class action lawsuit filed before Houston 's Southern District Court , Skilling said the two firms had done only ' a couple of real minor things ' .
The revelation raises further questions about Skilling 's part in trying to hide Enron 's problems and Wall Street 's tacit acceptance of the company line .
More than a dozen American analysts continued to issue positive notes on Enron until the eve of its spectacular crash last December .
Many have since claimed they were duped by the company .
Lawyers acting for Enron 's victims are focusing on analysts at Goldman , Salomon and JP Morgan because these banks were either lending money to Enron , advising it , or pitching for work as the company teetered on the brink of collapse .
Damon Silvers , legal officer of the main US trade union organisation AFL - CIO , which represents thousands of Enron employees , said yesterday : ' This lawsuit is coming .
These banks stood to make a lot of money from Enron , and that made it impossible for them to produce independent analysis .
Propping up the share price was more important . '
Milberg Weiss , the New York law firm that is suing Enron and
its auditor Andersen on behalf of shareholders , said its claim will shortly be redrafted and ' there is a pretty good chance certain banks will be added to the list of defendants ' ."
2002-02-17,"After the biggest bankruptcy in American commercial history come the book deals .
Just when it seemed as if Enron executives were the only people who had made big money out of financial chicanery , the journalist credited with asking the first sceptical questions about the energy company 's dealings has signed a seven - figure book deal to write her version of the scandal .
Bethany McLean , 31 , a reporter with Fortune magazine , has been paid a $ 1.4 million ( £ 1 m ) advance by Penguin Books in New York for her account of the scandal , which has dominated front pages around the world for the last month but which she broke with an article in Fortune last March .
Headlined ' Is Enron Over - priced ? ' , McLean 's piece revealed glaring gaps in the company 's financial records and posed a question that the company 's ex - employees and stockholders are only now in a position to answer : just how did Enron make its money ?
At the time , her story attracted little attention outside the Enron boardroom .
Before it was even published , the company 's former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , accused her of being unethical and of not doing her research properly .
Three Enron executives turned up at the magazine 's offices in an unsuccessful attempt to get her sacked .
Kenneth Lay , Enron 's former chairman , called the magazine 's editor to complain that McLean had based her work on information from a source who stood to benefit if the company 's share price fell .
A lack of further information about the company 's dealings - ' we did n't have the goods , ' said Fortune 's managing editor , Rik Kirkland - meant the magazine did not follow up the story .
But as the scandal developed at the end of last year , McLean soon became a regular on the cable TV news circuit .
The $ 1.4 m advance , believed to be one of the biggest paid for a non - fiction book about a financial scandal , will be shared with two Fortune magazine editors , who will co - author the book with McLean .
Adrian Zackheim , the publisher at Penguin Books ' Portfolio imprint , which bought the title , compared the Enron scandal to Watergate . '
Like Watergate , the Enron collapse will beget a compelling journalistic narrative that breaks through the chatter and defines the story , ' said Zackheim . '
There may well be books in the future from Enron participants ...
but this is unquestionably the big breakthrough book , the book we most wanted to publish . '
In a separate deal , Doubleday Books in New York has paid $ 500,000 for a book by Texas - based writer Mimi Schwartz , who is believed to be writing her version of the scandal with the help of former Enron executive - turned - whistleblower Sherron Watkins , the corporation 's vice president for corporate development .
Watkins appeared before a Congressional committee earlier this week to accuse two leading company officials - one of them Skilling - of duping the board over details of business partnerships set up to hide the company 's parlous financial state .
Watkins told the committee that Skilling was ' highly intimidating ' and had sought to get her sacked .
It is thought that there are at least four other book proposals circulating around New York publishers ."
2002-02-18,"Enron shareholders are threatening to sue some of Wall Street 's most respected investment banking houses for their alleged role in continuing to champion the Houston - based energy trader as it headed for implosion late last year .
The threatened lawsuit calls into question the impartiality of analysts who continued to recommend Enron shares until the eve of its collapse .
It is alleged recommendations were made in order to help analysts ' firms win lucrative work from the group .
"" These banks stood to make a lot of money from Enron , and that made it impossible for them to produce independent analysis , "" Damon Silvers , legal officer for the US trade union organisation AFL - CIO , told the Observer .
"" Propping up the share price was more important . ""
Milberg Weiss , the law firm that is suing Enron and its embattled auditor , Andersen , on behalf of shareholders , told the newspaper that its claim would shortly be redrafted .
"" There is a pretty good chance certain banks will be added to the list of defendants . ""
Lawyers acting for victims of the Enron debacle are said to be concentrating their fire on analysts at a number of banks that were lending money to the company , advising it or lobbying for work as it wobbled on the edge of the financial abyss .
Many analysts who continued to recommend Enron have since complained that they were duped by the company .
News of the threatened law suit comes hard on the heels of legal action by former employees backed by AFL - CIO and the Rev Jesse Jackson to secure severance pay for Enron employees .
A hearing for that motion has been set for February 27 .
Debra Johnson , a former Enron employee , said many people laid off by the firm were unable to make ends meet . ""

2002-02-20,"Walt Disney narrowly saw off a shareholder vote trying to separate the companies it uses for consulting and auditing yesterday but said it intended to go ahead with splitting the two anyway .
The vote was the first in what is expected to be a series brought by shareholder activist groups to push for greater accountability in the wake of the Enron scandal .
Issues of corporate governance were also high on the agenda at the Disney annual meeting in Hartford , Connecticut , with a motion to limit stock options awarded to executives defeated by a wider margin .
Investors owning 473 m shares voted to prohibit Disney from using its outside accountants providing other services while 648 m voted against .
The big five accounting firms , burned by the Enron affair , have all now said they intend to spin off their consulting divisions .
Michael Eisner , Disney chairman and chief executive said he was eager to reassure "" shareholders and the market in general "" that the company had nothing to hide .
"" We 've been very prudent in this area over the years , with close and active oversight by the audit committee .
But , in the current world , it 's become more important than ever to make sure that our shareholders - and the market as a whole - have full confidence in our reports , including the integrity of the auditing process .
"" Disney uses accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake its auditing .
Disney shares were under further pressure yesterday when the US supreme court agreed to consider overturning a law that extends Walt Disney 's Mickey Mouse and millions of other copyrights for another 20 years .
A decision striking down the law would mean Disney would lose copyright protection on the character in 2004 , as well as that on Donald Duck , Pluto , Snow White , Goofy and Dumbo in the following years .
Shares have fallen by 35 % over the past two years .
Disney has suffered from the sustained fall in advertising , poor audiences for its ABC network in the US and the impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11 on its theme park attendance .
The company said efforts to cut out costs , including the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past year , would provide capital for further acquisitions ."
2002-02-20,"Some will say it had to happen : the Labour government has contracted Enronitis .
The whistle is being blown on the Treasury 's creative approach to accounting - the off - balance sheet - financing , the special purpose vehicles and other gizmos of financial engineering which sounded smart when the good times rolled , but which are parting at the seams at the first sign of trouble .
Spooked by the collapse of Enron in the US , large banks and big institutional investors worldwide have been questioning the basis on which they have been lending or investing money .
Balance sheets and executive competence have been queried , opaque accounts have been questioned - and quite a few supposedly well established companies have been brought to their knees .
Now it has spread to the government , whose voodoo financing habit is getting stress - tested by the money men .
The furore over the suspect funding of the national air traffic scheme threatens to expose the way Labour has been spoofing its stakeholders these past few years .
There are two ways in which this affair can be viewed .
The pre - Enron version has a modernising government owning up to the fact that its public sector management is ill - equipped to manage the fiendishly complex and extraordinarily expensive business of organising the flow of air traffic across Britain 's skies .
Mindful of its duty to avoid wasting the public 's money , the government arrived at a modern , pragmatic solution .
Private sector management and money would take over , under the astute gaze of an industry regulator , the Civil Aviation Authority .
Fees from airlines using British airspace would pay the debt incurred in modernising the system , and eventually costs would fall all round .
And air safety would be paramount .
The post - Enron view is more complex and sinister .
Faced with escalating costs and a trenchant , unionised workforce , the Treasury demanded that the Department of Trade privatise Nats .
The private bit of this partnership , in the shape of institutional investors and investment banks , was leery of the business proposition .
It looked too risky .
So the risk was "" managed "" .
Nats would borrow £ 1.4bn from four banks - Abbey National , Barclays , HBOS and Bank of America .
Half of this money would buy a 51 % stake in Nats from the government , 5 % of which would go to employees and management .
In return for a nominal payment ( £ 50 m ) , the remaining 46 % shareholding would go to a consortium of airlines headed by British Airways .
The fact that a good portion of Nats ' customers were also its shareholders was not addressed .
Historically , 40 % of Nats ' revenues have come from 15 % of its customers - those operating transatlantic routes .
These flights are down 10 % since September 11 , and air traffic control faces a cash crunch .
This is where Labour 's creative accounting comes unstuck .
A regular business would cut costs and/or raise prices or risk going bust .
Its lenders would provide more money if it was thought that the management could deal with the changed business environment and eventually repay the money .
But under this new public private partnership there is no clarity about the responsibilities of each of the parties involved .
The shareholder airlines enjoy ownership , but they have cash flow problems and certainly do not want to have to start paying higher air traffic fees .
The banks have a big liability , but no ownership , except that if Nats fails to meet its interest payments they can seize the 46 % stake in the hands of the airlines .
The government has minority ownership , but has unwittingly burdened itself with the role of underwriting the entire financing of the venture , since it can not risk the air traffic system failing .
In trying to pretend that it has transferred concepts such as "" risk "" and "" cost "" to the private sector , when the risks and costs remain , the government is guilty of the Enronesque crime of hiding its true exposure .
Like Railtrack , the part - privatisation of Nats was a piece of off - balance sheet financing - on the surface the mechanism met the government 's funding requirement , yet in reality the need for funding remains , because this key service has to be kept going .
It does not seem to have dawned on the Treasury that when the City deals with Labour it suspends the everyday rules of capitalism .
It happened with Railtrack , it has now happened with air traffic control , and it will most certainly happen with the tube .
If an important government project is being financed in the City then it carries an effective government guarantee , since the political cost of failure will be too great to bear ."
2002-02-20,"IBM , the personal computer maker , yesterday bowed to pressure from nervous investors and said it would in future provide a more detailed breakdown of its earnings .
The blue - chip company last week became the latest to find itself caught in the accounting storm on Wall Street that has followed the spectacular collapse of energy group Enron .
Any hint of a lack of transparency is making companies ' shares plunge in value .
IBM was trading almost 3 % lower at noon at just over $ 100 .
IBM became a flashpoint when a report in the New York Times highlighted the sale of a business at the end of last year that had been offset against the wider group 's costs .
The report suggested that IBM had used the process to massage its costs downwards and had not properly disclosed the sale .
The computer group defended the accounting method but said yesterday that it would provide increased disclosure in response to the concerns of investors .
IBM argued last week that the $ 340 m sale of the unit in December had been fully disclosed to shareholders in two separate press releases issued by the company that was buying the business .
A spokeswoman said the transaction , largely the sale of intellectual property , was in the ordinary course of company business and should not be recorded as an exceptional gain .
Proceeds of $ 300 m were offset against costs in the fourth quarter .
But the company will now expand the amount of information it provides about intellectual property income , the impact of gains and losses from its investment in other companies , the effect of amortisation of goodwill from acquisitions , gains on the sale of real estate and the impact of income from IBM 's pension funds surplus ."
2002-02-20,"Accountancy firm Andersen responded defiantly yesterday to news that it will face a disciplinary investigation by its professional body into its role as auditor to the scandal - hit Durex condoms maker , SSL International .
The inquiry by the accountants ' joint disciplinary scheme will look at allegations of incompetence and misconduct by "" members and member firms "" who were involved with SSL , which revealed last year that it had recorded £ 22 m of bogus sales .
In a sign that Andersen is tiring of constant bad publicity following its association with the collapsed American energy group Enron , the firm issued a statement casting doubt on the extent of the irregularities uncovered by new management at SSL .
The accountancy firm said it was "" not allowed to communicate with the directors , employees or customers involved "" , and that this led it to qualify its audit of SSL for the year to March 2001 .
It added that restatements of SSL 's accounts were "" not necessarily correct "" and that there was "" no prima facie evidence "" that it failed to detect a management fraud .
A sprawling Cheshire - based healthcare company , SSL makes products ranging from catheters to corn plasters and colostomy bags .
New directors of the SSL say that in 1999 and 2000 , dozens of consignments were driven around the outskirts of Man chester to company warehouses , in which goods were hidden away and booked as sales .
The serious fraud office is examining the allegations , which led to the resignation of the company 's executive team last year .
Yesterday 's announcement from the accountants ' joint disciplinary scheme followed a report by the institute of chartered accountants which concluded that there was a case to answer .
Christopher Dickson , executive counsel of the joint disciplinary scheme , said : "" The institute has decided that this is a matter of public interest , and that it should be taken on by us .
"" If the investigation concludes that misconduct has taken place , it can lead to accountants being reprimanded , disqualified from practising or facing unlimited fines .
Among those to face questions will be SSL 's former finance director Paul Sanders , former chairman Stuart Wallis and non - executive director Rodney Sellers , who are all qualified accountants .
In a surprise move , the disciplinary body said the scope of its investigation would extend to London International Group - the condoms company which merged with Seton Scholl in 1999 to form SSL .
That could mean questions for David Davies , the former finance chief of London International who now serves as finance director at engineering company Morgan Crucible ."
2002-02-20,"Hardly a week passes without revelations of some shortcomings in accounting and auditing .
Enron , Global Crossing , Elan , Transtec , Versailles , Resort Hotels and Independent Insurance are just the latest .
In each case , the companies concerned employed and remunerated accountants to massage their accounts .
In accordance with carefully developed plans , large amounts of cash were siphoned off .
Audit firms did not notice anything because in some cases , in their capacity as consultants , they created many of the transactions and opaque corporate structures .
Auditors collected fat audit and consultancy fees and blamed everyone else for their own failures .
Ordinary people lost their jobs , homes , investments , savings and pensions .
None of this has encouraged reflections on Britain 's reliance on failed auditing and accounting technologies .
Rather than developing alternative modes of accountability and institutions of democracy , failed auditing technology has been extended to almost all walks of life .
The expertise of accountancy firms has been used to sell off public assets , promote the private finance initiative and restructure the NHS .
With 250,000 qualified accountants , Britain has more accountants than the rest of the EU put together and one of the highest numbers of accountants per capita in the world .
This unparalleled investment in economic surveillance has failed to deliver better corporate governance , company accounts , audits and freedom from frauds or scandals .
Yet the ranks of accountants continue to swell .
Company auditors have more rights than the police .
They have access to all company records , files and documents .
They have a statutory right of information and explanation from any officer or employee of the company .
Yet this private police force of capitalism has always failed and will continue to fail .
The basic model of auditing is flawed .
It expects a bunch of capitalist entrepreneurs ( accountancy firms ) to invigilate and regulate another bunch of capitalist entrepreneurs ( company directors ) .
Profits , market share and the number of clients measure the success and failure of both .
Doing anything for the public is not part of the equation .
Accountancy firms enjoy a state - guaranteed monopoly of auditing .
This provides the basis for selling consultancy and generates a double - digit growth in profits .
Auditors are regulated by professional accountancy bodies who have no independence from the auditing industry .
Audit firms are not required to publish any information about the conduct of an audit .
No scandal has ever come to light because of audit firms or the professional accountancy bodies .
The practices of auditing firms encourage audit failures .
Partners are given bonuses for selling consultancy services to audit clients .
The prime concern of audit firms is to appease company directors .
The same partners want to squeeze more productivity from the trainees doing company audits .
They are expected to work evenings and weekends for free .
Most find the work boring and resent the exploitation .
More than 50 % admit to falsifying audit work .
The legal pressures for delivering good audits are weak .
Auditors only owe a "" duty of care "" to the company they audit , not to any individual shareholder , creditor or employee , no matter how negligent they are .
In the wake of audit failures , most lawsuits are by one accountancy firm , acting as a receiver or liquidator , against another .
Win or lose , they do very nicely out of it .
Ordinary stakeholders rarely do .
On some occasions the Department of Trade and Industry appoints inspectors .
This provides nice fees for accountancy firms , as one of the inspectors is usually a partner from a major accountancy firm .
Inspectors ensure that uncomfortable questions are avoided .
Many DTI inspectors ' reports never see the light of day .
Some , like the Maxwell report , are published some 10 years after the event .
The DTI does not prosecute audit firms for delivering poor audits or for colluding with companies .
That task is delegated to the accountancy bodies .
The disciplinary processes are under the control of big firms , with their partners occupying key positions within the accountancy bodies .
Any benchmarks with fines , firm closures and disqualification will come back to haunt them .
So a feather - duster approach is institutionalised .
With weak legal and institutional structures and the profit motive of accountancy firms , audit failures are institutionalised too .
But accountants make money at every stage .
More Enrons are inevitable , though the scale might differ .
Greater reforms are needed but unlikely as major firms have close links with government departments , senior civil servants and political parties .

2002-02-21,"General Electric , the world 's largest company , yesterday said it would provide further transparency in its accounting as another firm , Computer Associates , found itself under unwanted scrutiny .
A sprawling conglomerate , General Electric has come under pressure to provide better disclosure in its financial reporting since the collapse of energy firm Enron .
The company intends to break out revenue and operating details for 26 businesses , including more detailed information on the financial division , GE Capital , which provides 40 % of profits .
Wall Street has long held concerns about General Elec tric 's opaque accounting but the issue has become more pressing in the present market , which has also seen questions raised about accounting practices at Global Crossing and Tyco .
Shares in General Electric have been under pressure , falling 9 % this year .
IBM this week also bowed to investor pressure for better levels of disclosure .
General Electric , with businesses ranging from broadcasting to jet engines , intends to holdquarterly conference calls for analysts for the first time .
The wave of accounting scandals that has shaken Wall Street yesterday swept over Computer Associates , the third - largest software group in the world .
Shares in the company fell by as much as 23 % in early trading after reports in the US said the company was the focus of an investigation by the US attorney 's office and federal bureau of investigation .
New York - based Computer Associates attempted to calm investors and said it was not aware of any investigations .
"" We have not been contacted by the authorities regarding any investigation and do not know what , if anything , is being investigated , "" the company said .
In the present tinderbox of a market , analysts expressed little surprise that Computer Associates was the latest victim of the rumour mill .
The company has faced down repeated criticism of its accounting in the past few years .
Since October 2000 it has reported its results on a pro - forma basis instead of using standard accounting rules , drawing complaints that they are difficult to understand .
Texas tycoon Sam Wyley attempted a takeover of the firm last year and accused it of "" phoney accounting "" .
The reports said the FBI and attorney 's office were trying to establish whether Computer Associates had overstated its profits .
The reports said the inquiry was at the preliminary stage and no evidence of wrongdoing had yet been found .
Neither the FBI nor the US attorney 's office would comment ."

2002-02-22,"From the maple - veneer boardroom table to the marble - topped canteen bin , the luxurious furnishings of Enron 's European headquarters will go on public view in London today before being auctioned off next week .
Despite suffering the biggest corporate failure in US history , there are no signs that the energy company 's spending on the most lavish fittings was restrained in recent months .
And Enron 's already rock - bottom reputation was further sullied yesterday when it emerged the group had built a fake trading office at its Houston headquarters designed to impress Wall Street analysts .
According to a former employee , Enron staffed the office and told the employees to make it appear as if they were cutting deals as chairman Kenneth Lay and chief executive Jeffrey Skilling made a presentation to the analysts in 1998 .
The former employee , Joseph Phelan , told Reuters that the room was filled with television screens , computers and telephones and presented as the nerve centre of Enron Energy Services . ""
The intent was to use it , and a month after the analysts took off , the space was used for that purpose , "" he said .
"" But to time it right for the analyst conference , people were asked to come down and act like they were working on deals . ""
Elaborate plans were put in place to ensure the office was lively while the analysts were in attendance .
"" You were assigned a shift and told when to show up , and they actually scheduled calls with prospective clients and routed them to certain phones .
It was pretty stupid , "" Mr Phelan said .
The vast majority of the 9,000-plus items going under the hammer in London are less than two years old , and include top of the range gym equipment and a collection of modern art .
Also on sale are seven shredders , which may be snapped up as part of the growing trade in Enron memorabilia .
Online auction site EBay has been doing a roaring trade in mementoes such as Enron 's ethics handbook and its "" visions and values "" T - shirt .
The contents of Enron House in Grosvenor Place are valued at £ 15 m , and will be sold at auction from the headquarters itself .
There are 50 plasma TVs , ice - making machines , more than 40 refrigerated mini - bars and 7,000 nearly new items of computer equipment .
The standard office chair appeared to have been the Herman Miller Aeron , which retail at £ 800 each .
The boardroom is fitted with a 10mx3 m maple - veneer table with walnut edging , while executives enjoyed leather - upholstered Mario Bellini swivel chairs .
Peter Bache , of auctioneers Bache Treharne , said : "" This sale is unprecedented , not only because it is the result of possibly the biggest corporate failure in American history , but also because of the sheer scale of what is on offer - from striking works of art to IT equipment available in huge quantities .

2002-02-22,"The new chairman of the press complaints commission has fired a warning shot against the organisation 's critics , suggesting they are damaging the cause of press self regulation .
But Robert Pinker , who replaced Lord Wakeham when the Tory peer stood aside following the Enron collapse , conceded the embattled regulator needs reform and signalled his intent to meet senior newspaper industry figures .
The Telegraph editor , Charles Moore , took the opportunity presented by Lord Wakeham 's departure last month to lead a charge against the PCC .
His central concerns - that its decision - making process was opaque and had the appearance of a cabal - were backed by his Independent counterpart , Simon Kelner , and the Guardian editor , Alan Rusbridger .
Other editors , notably those on the tabloids , have given strong backing to the PCC .
Yesterday , Professor Pinker responded to the criticisms in a speech to the Commonwealth Press Union in Sri Lanka .
He expressed the hope that debate among newspaper editors would not result in damage to the system itself . ""
The thing above all else I am determined to avoid is that the two fundamental tenets of our system of self regulation - the sanctity of the code and the jurisdiction of a clearly independent body - are in any way damaged . ""
Sri Lanka and others in the Commonwealth look to Britain for a lead in how to make regulation work at the same time as guarding the freedom of the press .
It would be ironic indeed if they were following our path at the very moment when we were doing our best to undermine it . ""
Criticism of the PCC has centred on its role in the deal brokered between St James 's Palace and the News of the World after the newspaper learned that Prince Harry had been caught smoking cannabis .
The PCC 's director , Guy Black , is the partner of Prince Charles 's deputy private secretary , Mark Bolland .
Both have holidayed with Rebekah Wade , editor of the News of the World .
All have denied that their personal connections influenced their professional relationship .
Prof Pinker said the PCC "" is n't perfect "" , but warned against hasty change .
"" There will always be those who argue that we should be more ' proactive ' although that is , in my view , a path fraught with practical difficulty . ""
He also suggested that ordinary complainants - rather than celebrities - would lose out with any move away from attempts to resolve disputes by conciliation rather than adjudication .
He also said that the PCC was a better route to redress than the court - a route recently taken by Sara Cox . ""
These debates and others
I am quite happy to have as long as they end up strengthening self regulation , not handing ammunition to its detractors , whether they be in parliament , or the courts or elsewhere .
"" In his first big speech since he was appointed , Prof Pinker defended the role of the PCC and said "" ordinary people "" were treated as seriously as celebrities . ""
The issue of personal privacy , at least so far as the PCC and I are concerned , is not about the rich and glamorous , "" he said .
"" It is more than anything else about ordinary people .
For them , our role as mediator and conciliator - the task for which we were established - is what is crucially important because it delivers quick , cost - free justice . """
2002-02-23,"The crisis of confidence enveloping JP Morgan Chase , one of Wall Street 's most venerable banks , escalated yesterday after it emerged that a fresh regulatory investigation has been launched into its relationship with Enron , the collapsed energy group .
In New York shares in the bank plumbed levels last seen at the height of the emerging market and hedge fund crises of 1998 as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - the local arm of America 's central bank - confirmed it is scrutinising commodity - related trades between JP Morgan , Enron and an offshore vehicle called Mahonia .
The Wall Street firm 's reputation has already been battered recently by news of its heavy exposure to the financial crisis in Argentina and also the threat of heavy losses on loans extended to Global Crossing , the collapsed telecoms group which is also subject to numerous regulatory investigations .
Yesterday 's 7 % share price fall means that a third of the bank 's value has been wiped out since the beginning of the year .
The new Enron investigation centres on an offshore venture set up a decade ago by Chase Manhattan , the bank JP Morgan merged with 18 months ago .
A series of transactions between Mahonia and Enron - upfront payments for the future delivery of natural gas or crude oil - are now under the microscope .
Enron accounted for what were effectively loans as trades and the Federal Reserve is now examining how JP Morgan booked the deals .
Analysts said the vehicle was used to securitise debt from Enron and was described by one bank insider as a "" routine way "" for a company like Enron to take on more debt .
The Federal Reserve described the investigation as part of its normal banking supervisory role .
A spokeswoman said that current circumstances made it prudent to investigate exposures to Enron and how they had been accounted for .
JP Morgan Chase tried to play down the significance of the investigation .
A spokesman said : "" It is perfectly normal for the Fed in the course of its ongoing and continuing review of the banks it supervises to seek information on high visibility issues or transactions .
In all our dealing with the Fed we cooperate fully "" .
But that failed to soothe the financial markets , which have suffered persistent jitters over the fear of widespread suspect accounting practices like those uncovered inside Enron .
In its present form , JP Morgan Chase was created through the £ 23bn merger of Chase Manhattan and JP Morgan 18 months ago .
Industry experts note that many of its problems appear to stem from the old Chase Manhattan business .
At the time of their merger , the transaction was perceived as Chase taking over JP Morgan which was then regarded as the weaker of the two firms .
But the roles now appear to be reversed .
"" It seems to be more of a Chase problem than a Morgan problem , "" said Ray Soifer , a respected former Wall Street securities analyst .
Mr Soifer also noted that concerns about reputational risk are heightened during periods of economic downturn .
While JP Morgan Chase received the backing from ratings agency
Moody 's this week , its profits are feeling the pain .
The bank slumped to a loss in the fourth quarter ."
2002-02-23,"Congressional investigators yesterday lodged an unprecedented lawsuit against the White House to uncover the role that Enron and other energy firms played in shaping government policy .
The general accounting office ( GAO ) , the investigative arm of Congress , is seeking details of meetings between the companies and Vice - President Dick Cheney 's energy task force during the formation of energy policy last year .
The White House has vowed to fight the legal action , setting up a potentially bitter scrap between the two arms of government .
The GAO has threatened court action before , but this is the first time in 80 years that it has had to file a lawsuit to gain access to documents .
David Walker , head of the GAO , which acts as a government watchdog , has been attempting to wring the details of the various meetings out of the White House since last summer .
But the collapse of Enron , and the ensuing political and financial scandal , has invested the request with greater significance .
The GAO is pursuing the case at the request of Democrats who claim that environmentalists were kept out of meetings of the task force .
The group produced a policy that called for more oil and gas drilling and a revival of nuclear power .
Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , claims to have found 17 policies in the May 2001 plan that were either advocated by Enron or benefited the company .
A statement from the GAO expressed disappointment that it had been forced to resort to the courts .
"" We take this step reluctantly , "" it said .
"" Nevertheless , given GAO 's responsibility to Congress and the American people , we have no other choice .
Our repeated attempts to reach a reasonable accommodation on this matter have not been successful .
"" The Bush administration has so far managed to shrug off the barrage of criticism about its relationship with Enron , but the lawsuit drags it back to centre stage .
Enron gave financial backing to George Bush 's election campaign as well as a huge network of other politicians .
While the White House decision to stonewall has some support in Congress , others have warned that it risks giving the appearance of having something to hide by not disclosing details of the meetings .
Mr Bush has selected the solicitor general , Theodore Olson - who argued for him in the supreme court during the battle with Al Gore over the 2000 election - to represent the administration .
Mr Cheney has acknowledged at least six meetings with Enron executives .
The GAO wants a list of individuals who met the energy task force , as well as the subject and location of the meetings and how much each meeting cost .
The White House has denied being overly influenced by the energy firm .
It argues that giving up details of the meetings would damage its ability to get candid advice from the business community .
"" We have been ready to fight for this important principle since the GAO first indicated they were going to file suit last summer , "" a White House spokesman said .
The court case will be a testing ground to establish the extent of the GAO 's powers .
The White House argues the office is overstepping its bounds .
But even President Nixon backed down from a legal confrontation during the Watergate crisis ."
2002-02-23,"Non - executive directors are coming under increasing pressure to ensure that the companies they serve operate in their shareholders ' best interest .
The Enron saga and Paul Myners ' call this week for a review of the role of non - executives add to this pressure .
In the former case , the size of executive reward was outstanding and highlights the increasingly important role of remuneration committees .
The individuals making up these bodies will be under scrutiny to ensure that executive remuneration packages are not excessive .
At the same time , if they are to serve shareholders well , they must be able to attract and motivate the best .
Arrangements which enable executives , and indeed other employees generally , to acquire shares in the company for which they work have become a crucial part of this .
Consequently it has become vital that a proper value is placed on awards of shares and options under the growing number of arrangements being adopted by leading companies .
As we advise many companies and remuneration committees in these matters , my firm has developed the Present Economic Value methodology .
This builds on the Black - Scholes Option Pricing Model which was developed by Myron Scholes and Fisher Black and was awarded the Nobel prize for economics .
This model has been used for many years in the US to determine a time value on option grants rather than equate them to the face value of the awards .
The model takes account of : · The market price of the underlying shares at the date of valuation · Exercise price of the option · Expected dividend yield of the underlying shares going forward · Expected "" lifetime "" of the option · Expected future volatility of the underlying shares · Current risk - free interest rate .
Black - Scholes was developed originally for the valuation of traded options and as a result does not allow for "" real life "" factors which have an important influence on the structure and value of share incentives such as : ·
The imposition of performance targets · Exercise of the option after a particular time period over which company performance is measured · Variability in share price volatility and dividend yield .
The application of robust performance targets is a key safeguard for investors as is the length of time before awards granted under an incentive plan vest .
In assessing the true value of an award , consideration has to be given to what its value might be to the potential recipient .
If an award of shares is made to an executive who has an absolute right to that award in , say , three years , then the value to him or her is at least today 's value discounted for the deferral period .
If , however , the award can not vest unless a performance target has been achieved , then the present economic value ( PEV ) of the reward must be reduced .
The greater the number or more difficult the hurdles or targets , the lower the PEV .
If a typical annual grant of options for a chief executive or other main board director is twice their salary , then the same PEV might arise for a much larger multiple if the hurdles or targets were more numerous or demanding .
The PEV approach can be a win - win situation for participants and shareholders .
It puts the participant in the position of making substantial gains , but only if a series of hurdles or targets , which can each reduce the PEV , are fulfilled .
These might include the more typical financial measures such as earnings per share , total shareholder return , or Ebitda ( earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ) .
They might be combined with other targets such as a personal shareholding requirement , an escalating option exercise price or a longer period of deferral .
Such a combination of targets may be appropriate to ensure a company 's objectives .
The trade and industry secretary , Patricia Hewitt , last autumn stated that shareholders will be given the right to an annual vote on directors ' pay .
Consultation about this is taking place now .
It is clear that whatever the outcome of this consultation process , more openness and disclosure will be here to stay .
This will include comparison with other organisations with regard to both performance and levels of reward .
Some remuneration committees will want to stay with the single financial performance targets or plans that have become commonplace in the UK , stating that participants do not understand complex arrangements .
Others will wish to maximise the potential effect of what might at first appear a complex arrangement to ensure that they only pay out for performance .
If remuneration committees are prepared to go the extra distance through calling for more in - depth and rigorous financial modelling , they can create schemes that really do have the power to motivate while returning real value to shareholders .
As companies work at attracting and retaining key talent , the increasing use of both options and share awards and the financial modelling to assess the right PEV will become the norm , and this must be good for shareholders and participants .
A consistent and fair valuation will enable shareholders to see clearly just what is being offered to the executives while indicating whether a company is trying to operate a truly performance - related culture or is it prepared to adopt a static approach .
The pressurised non - executive director should welcome something that brings clarity and objectivity to his decisions .

2002-02-24,"The Government is to launch twin investigations into the roles of accountants and non - executive directors in the wake of the Enron scandal .
Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt is expected to announce the moves in a speech to a business audience at London 's Mansion House this week .
The accountancy inquiry follows deep concerns among investors about the objectivity and independence of auditors following the scandal at the giant American energy trading firm . '
Top five ' firm Arthur Andersen failed to monitor complex off - balance sheet transactions that hid losses .
These ultimately forced the $ 70 billion company to crash into bankruptcy .
A review , to be carried out by a group comprising offi cials from the Department of Trade and Industry , the Treasury , the Financial Services Authority and the Accountancy Foundation , is to examine what measures can be introduced to ensure auditors ' independence .
They will report back with recommendations to Hewitt - who worked for Andersen Consulting , then linked to the accountancy firm - before she entered Parliament in 1997 .
The management consultancy split from Arthur Andersen in 2000 to form Accenture .
Government sources indicated that the possible recommendations include compulsory rotation of auditors and compulsory retendering of contracts for the work .
Measures such as compulsory rotation are favoured by investor groups such as the Pirc corporate governance service and the National Association of Pension Funds , and by the head of the Financial Services Authority , Sir Howard Davies .
They are strongly opposed by big accountancy firms such as PricewaterhouseCoopers .
Hewitt will also announce a review of the independence and effectiveness of non - executive directors .
This , too , is prompted by Enron , where Lord Wakeham held one of his 16 non - executive directorships .
The former Tory Minister is to be questioned by a Congressional committee about his role at the Texas - based firm .
Ministers are also concerned about the performance of non executives in the UK , and their involvement in such crisis - ridden companies as Marconi .
The Government believes non - executives are drawn from a small pool of people , most of whom know each other and may be reluctant to scrutinise or criticise .
This review follows an attack by Paul Myners , former head of investment group Gartmore and author of a Government report on pensions .
He called the system a ' self perpetuating oligarchy ' , and recommended stronger links between non - executives and shareholders ."
2002-02-24,"The shockwaves of the Enron collapse continue to judder through the foundations of capitalism , knocking bits off as they go .
One bulwark looking particularly tottery is accountancy .
It 's as though the numbers had suddenly switched sides .
Instead of being the objective measure of everything else , they now seem about as trustworthy as a rubber ruler .
It 's a shock to find not only the auditors but the accounting authorities themselves in hock to big business .
There is something rotten in the state of professional accounting when auditors shred documents and the International Accounting Standards Board is found to be soliciting funds from Enron .
These circular dependencies are inherently corrupting and need treating at source .
Rules and standards need to be updated , but the real issues go much deeper .
The heart of the problem is the nature of numbers themselves , which makes them a duplicitous guide to managers who take them at face value .
Numbers are seductive but treacherous .
As David Boyle points out in his essential book , The Tyranny of Numbers ( HarperCollins , £ 14.99 ) , they pose a philosophical problem .
This is because to count you have to categorise - that is , identify differences and similarities between things and weigh their relative importance .
As a result , every categorisation is a compromise , every count a simplification .
A disconcertingly basic example : the Engineering Employers ' Federation wants to revise upwards the size of the UK manufacturing sector to reflect the fact that many manufacturing - dependent activities that used to be carried out in - house have now been outsourced , and wrongly classed as services .
The dispute is not trivial : if the EEF is correct , the manufacturing sector is 50 per cent larger than the official figures say , and correspondingly more important .
In inherently complex systems , such as accounting in large companies , compromise is stacked on compromise at many levels of aggregation until , as in a mad game of Chinese whispers , what comes out bears almost no relation to what went in .
Take two of the most spectacular and glamorous businesses in the world : movies and music .
At street level , these may be the most unpleasant industries in the world , vicious and voracious jungles of cheating , stealing and dodgy dealing of all kinds .
One multi - million pound recording deal reputedly all but collapsed because the star objected to the size of the bowl of cocaine that sealed it .
Hollywood movie accounting is as transparent as a concrete vault .
Hollywood , too , is the world 's porn capital .
Yet miraculously no trace of the ugly reality is visible as the compromises are aggregated upwards , eventually laundered by the numbers into such neutral abstractions as price - earnings ratios and free cash flow .
Counting washes whiter .
Even in less opaque businesses , the figures used by managers and shareholders are at best arbitrary .
It 's in the lore of the trade that six accountants preparing results from the same raw data will produce - legitimately - six different results .
Most company profits could be adjusted by 20 or 30 per cent either way without attracting the auditors ' ire , and they often are .
When Rover was bought by BMW it instantly plunged from black to red because of the more conservative German accounting standards .
Many new chief executives use their first set of results to write off the accumulated balance - sheet compromises of a predecessor .
When numbers fail , or are suspected to have failed , as at Enron , Global Crossing , Tyco and many others , the temptation is to demand still more of them .
This is wrong .
Managers are already drowning in numbers , with no obvious increase in traction on the things that matter .
Instead what is needed is a more realistic understanding of what numbers can and ca n't do .
Numbers are n't ' hard ' , as is usually assumed , but as soft and easily moulded as Plasticine .
Some important implications logically follow from this .
Numbers are of limited use as a guide to qualitative issues .
In a classic recent example , an educational study solemnly concluded that notwithstanding the availability of detailed statistics going back many years , it was impossible to tell whether exams were getting easier , or whether today 's students were better or worse than previous generations .
Again , UK students take more exams more frequently than any others in the world .
Yet only an idiot would claim they are the best educated - an entirely different matter .
We should beware of using the fallible calculus of one profession - accountancy - as the sole yardstick for judging the performance of others .
Comparative league tables may serve a function by revealing unacceptable differences in standards of medical treatment or education , but , as ought to be evident by now , accounting numbers often drive behaviour in exactly the wrong direction .
Like Enron , schools and hospitals disguise their ' liabilities ' by , say , excluding difficult pupils and manipulating waiting times , at the same time as boosting their ' successes ' by encouraging students to take easier exams and ' cherry - picking ' simple surgery .
Or take UK business schools .
Here , the combined effect of league tables , with their emphasis on international MBAs and their subsequent salary gains , and the Government 's own Research Assessment Exercise , which measures ' quality ' by the number of publications in a small number of academic journals , is to disengage the schools ' output almost entirely from the UK economy - a perverse result if ever there was one .
Numbers are not an adequate replacement for trust .
In fact , they destroy it .
This is perhaps the biggest paradox of all .
As Boyle notes , numbers are seen as the antidote to distrust , opening up ' the mysterious world of the professions ' to take back a measure of outside control .
But because the numbers are not what they seem , the promised control never materialises , and distrust grows .
Still worse is the result for those on the receiving end .
Obsession with ever more detailed numbers and targets drives management , Duke of York - style , smartly backwards , away from individual initiative , enablement and accountability towards the discredited centralised command - and - control world of turn - of - the - century ' scientific management ' .
This is the high road to Enronsville in the private sector ; to disillusion , demoralisation and proliferating bureaucracy in public enterprises .
Forcing people to play the numbers game destroys the only mechanism that could fill the yawning trust deficit that the numbers culture creates .
Numbers do n't make judgment , imagination and integrity redundant .
They put a premium on them .
As the arch - statistician W.E. Deming , who knew all about the value of numbers , commented , the most important things in life and business - trust , friendship , integrity and happiness - ca n't be quantified at all .
Managing by the numbers just gets you better numbers , but better numbers are just that - abstractions , not real life . Simon.Caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2002-02-25,"Dozens of US companies risk falling foul of the accounting practices which are blamed for the collapse of Enron and investment banks may have to be broken up to prevent a repeat of the scandal , a senior congressional investigator has said .
The stark warning by James Greenwood , who chairs one of the committees looking into the demise of the energy company , comes as Capitol Hill braces itself this week for three separate hearings into the causes of the collapse .
Mr Greenwood , who is heading an investigation for the energy committee , told the BBC : "" I 've not come to the conclusion yet that they [ Wall Street banks ] should be broken up , but I have come to the conclusion that this is real area of concern and potential conflict . ""
The conflict arises because Wall Street firms not only issue advice to investors on whether to buy or sell shares - but they also make money from the companies they are recommending .
He said that while the accounting practices used by Enron were not commonplace , it was likely that they had been used by other firms .
Enron used a number of off - balance sheet firms to hide the extent of its debt . ""
I think that if even a small fraction of the corporations in the US is guilty of these kinds of infractions , that could mean dozens of them , "" he said .
The BBC also quoted Mr Greenwood as saying : "" I subscribe to the cockroach theory : if you see one scuttling across the floor , there are probably others .
"" This week alone three Enron - related hearings are scheduled to take place , one of which will call Jeff Skilling , the former chief executive of Enron .
Mr Greenwood described the most recent testimony by Mr Skilling - who told Congress that he was unaware of the extent of Enron 's hidden debt - as "" not credible "" .
This week the banking committee will examine tighter rules for accounting while the senate commerce committee will question Mr Skilling .
The government affairs committee is planning to ask Wall Street firms why they kept issuing "" buy "" recommendations on Enron 's shares ."
2002-02-25,"The business press in the United States and Britain generally takes the line that Enron represents a technical , fixable problem about the failure of governance mechanisms such as audit .
While governance failure was an important part of how things went wrong , the underlying reasons why are quite different .
The era of "" shareholder value "" created opportunities for managerial enrichment which tempted a regional power elite and Enron represents a systemic problem which raises awkward political questions about our form of capitalism .
The suborning of governance was the modus operandi .
And this was important because it removed any control on the various scams whereby Enron traded with itself and did so on an ever larger scale so as to avoid discovery .
Every governance mechanism failed as Enron used money to influence the judgment of its auditors , audit committee , public regulators and politicians .
Most notably , Andersen and other advisers , who drew millions in fees , convinced themselves that Enron 's off balance sheet vehicles were no more than aggressive accounting ( by a valued customer ) .
But an analysis of the reason why needs to dig deeper and it could start by reviving the concept of a power elite which the American sociologist , C Wright Mills used to analyse Eisenhower 's America in the 1950s .
Enron 's senior managers , its auditors and the local politicos were part of a regional power elite .
Their Houston round of charity dinners , trade functions , political fund raisers , sports sponsorship and expensive clubs created a group which , in Mills ' terminology , exercised impersonal power on the basis of shared social intimacy .
This elite created an organisation with an internal culture of recklessness .
Enron recruited hundreds of young , aggressive MBAs whose bonuses and stock options incentivised them to deliver results - not to raise difficulties , like the middle aged .
The resulting balance between individual incentive and corporate risk might be acceptable in a professional services firm which lived by charging out hours ; in a trading house such as Enron , operating in areas where nobody understood the business model , the result was likely to be an unhealthy appetite for risk and a reluctance to accept bad news .
But , equally , the temptation of Houston must be understood in the broader institutional context of US capitalism in the 1990s .
This was a period of shareholder value and financialisation when the capital markets began to play an ever larger role in the calculations of corporate management who were offered unprecedented ( legal ) opportunities to get rich quick .
Finance academics confidently recommended stock options as a way of aligning shareholder and management interests and ending the agency problems that dated back to the separation of ownership and control .
In the 1990s , senior US corporate managers generally responded by writing undemanding stock option schemes which in a bull market effortlessly generated an ever larger proportion of senior management pay .
Enron 's senior management only went one step further : as wheeler dealers who owned large amounts of stock , they had a powerful incentive to ramp the share price by exaggerating earnings and hiding debt .
Recent stock market jitters about Enronitis indicate widespread suspicion that Enron managers were not the only ones who ramped up their share price .
But current paranoia contrasts quite markedly with the market 's previous acceptance of whatever was reported .
The stock market itself was complicit in the fraud insofar as every successful con trick needs a greedy gull who willingly suspends disbelief as much as the clever fraudster who pockets the gains .
If the Enron managers manufactured earnings , they did so because that was what the stock market wanted despite , or because of , the evidence that most sectors could not reach the 12%-15 % post - tax rates of return that the market required .
The market recognised a chronic shortage of growth stocks but responded by willingly buying dot.com stocks where there was no credible plan for cost recovery from the product market .
The question why has a simple answer : the general agenda of managerial enrichment in an era of shareholder value tempted some senior members of a regional power elite into venality which was sanctioned by their peers and developed by their juniors .
The remedy is not better governance but some fundamental rethinking about management incentives and shareholder expectations .

2002-02-25,"Dishonest employees present more of a threat to IT security for most businesses than external hackers or email viruses , according to a survey of 100 UK companies to be published this week .
Recent scandals at Allied Irish Banks and Enron have sent shockwaves through businesses around the world that could potentially face a threat from within .
Despite a number of high - profile corporate security breaches caused by teenage hackers and colourfully named viruses , just over half ( 51 % ) of British companies surveyed said they felt more exposed to fraud and industrial espionage from their own staff .
Ian Smith , managing director of Oracle UK , which commissioned the survey of 100 business with a turnover of more than £ 50 m , said many firms were reluctant to publicise staff dishonesty . ""
Most companies feel reasonably confident about their external firewalls , but there is real concern over sensitive or confidential information within companies .
"" It is a sensitive area and many firms do not want to introduce an internal police force . ""
Richard Baron , of the Institute of Directors , said employee dishonesty has always been an issue for many companies . ""
Department stores have always had more theft from their own staff than shoplifters ; bank fraud has always been more common among staff than customers . ""
Despite tough laws on data protection , concerns over data held on computer files - including credit card details - have heightened .
The San Francisco - based Computer Security Institute last year estimated that the average insider attack cost the target business an average of $ 2.7 m , compared with $ 57,000 for an outside attack .
Oracle said much of the time business were failing to take basic safeguard measures such as encryption or password protection , claiming they are a drain on performance ."
2002-02-26,"Enron 's chief executive failed to take action that could have saved the company when he was alerted to financial irregularities last year , senators heard today .
Sherron Watkins , a former vice - president at the energy company , spoke of her frustration at the lack of decisive action after she blew the whistle on the "" creative accounting "" that eventually led to Enron 's implosion .
"" I was incredibly frustrated with Mr [ Kenneth ]
Lay 's actions , or lack thereof , "" Ms Watkins told the Senate commerce committee .
One of the few people to emerge with any credit from Enron 's collapse , Ms Watkins sent an anonymous letter to Mr Lay in August expressing her fears about the company 's financial procedures .
But Mr Lay , to whom she was sympathetic , did not act upon her warnings .
"" I believe that Enron had a brief window to salvage itself this past fall
and we missed that opportunity because of Mr Lay 's failure to recognise or accept that the company had manipulated its financial statements , "" Ms Watkins told senators .
In a previous congressional appearance , Ms Watkins said that she believed Mr Lay had been duped by former Enron president , Jeffrey Skilling , former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and others about the state of the company .
But in a direct rebuttal of Ms Watkins , Mr Skilling , sitting at the same table as his former colleague , said : "" I did n't lie to Congress or anyone else . ""
As sceptical senators looked on , Mr Skilling said : "" I never duped Ken Lay .
I heard Ms Watkins testify as to her opinion .
I have no idea what the basis was for this opinion . ""
Enron eventually disclosed losses related to special partnerships that were used to hide Enron 's demand large debt .
The company had to restate profits going back to 1997 before making a record US bankruptcy filing on December 2 .
In what has become a familiar pattern , members of the committee opened the hearing by denouncing Enron 's conduct and citing huge losses to public pension funds in their states .
Once America 's seventh largest US company , Enron 's collapse is the subject of investigations by 10 congressional committees , the US justice department and the securities and exchange commission ."
2002-02-26,"The White House is considering new rules to make it more difficult for executives to dodge responsibility for a company 's collapse .
The proposals emerged as recriminations from the Enron failure continued when a group of insurance firms filed a countersuit against JP Morgan Chase , accusing the investment bank of fraud .
Ripples from the fall of Enron were also felt elsewhere on Wall Street .
Turmoil in the market was blamed for another firm , Williams Communications , heading for bankruptcy and there were reports that Enron 's auditor , Arthur Andersen , is facing an exodus of staff .
Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill said the Bush administration is exploring means of making it easier to punish directors for misleading shareholders .
Directors could be punished if it was decided that they should have been more aware of what was happening in their companies .
The rule changes would move the onus away from proving deliberate fraud .
Several senior executives at Enron have attempted to hide behind ignorance - claiming that they were unaware of the financial problems that led to the bankruptcy . ""
One of the things we 're talking about is to move the standard for chief executives from recklessness to negligence , which is an important change , "" Mr O'Neill said yesterday .
At a preliminary hearing in New York tomorrow , insurers of a contentious series of deals between JP Morgan and Enron will claim the bank disguised loans as commodity trades - the insurers argue that surety bonds can not be issued against loans .
The countersuit is in response to a claim by JP Morgan , which is suing the 11 insurers for refusing to honour $ 1bn of claims relating to its dealings with Enron .
The company described the counterclaim as "" without merit "" .
As well as exposure to Enron , JP Morgan has lost money in the Argentine financial crisis and arranged loans to the bankrupt Global Crossing and K - Mart .
At the end of last year , bad debts represented 1.15 % of JP Morgan loans against the average of 1.44 % - although that figure is likely to have worsened .
The shares , which have been under downward pressure , were trading 25 cents higher yesterday at $ 28.19 .
Telecoms group Williams Communications said it was considering seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection against creditors as options for refinancing were cut off in the skittish marketplace .
Andersen partners are reportedly seeking to quit in droves .
Dean McMann , chief of a Houston recruitment firm , told Bloomberg it had set up a ' war room ' to deal with the calls .
"" Hundreds of people are involved in negotiations to leave . ""
A spokesman for Andersen said turnover was normal ."
2002-02-27,"Jeffrey Skilling , the former chief executive of Enron , struck a defiant pose in his second appearance before Congress on February 26 .
Mr Skilling rejected accusations from a colleague that he had duped chairman Kenneth Lay and blamed the collapse on a "" classic run on the bank "" .
Here are some of best quotes from the testy exchanges during his appearance before the Senate commerce committee .
Jeffrey Skilling
On if he might have done things differently : "" Quite frankly , there is nothing I can come up with that I would think I would do different given the facts I had at the time . ""
On the partnerships to conceal Enron 's debt : "" Quite frankly , as long as the accountants had told me that they thought this was an appropriate structure , I felt comfortable with it . ""
On Enron 's finances : "" I am not an accountant . ""
On whether he duped Mr Lay : "" I had never duped Ken Lay .
I have no idea what the basis was for this opinion . ""
On whether he was donating any of the $ 66 m he made to the employees ' fund : "" I think at this point I have 36 separate plaintiffs ' lawsuits against me .
It 's my expectation I will probably spend the next five to 10 years of my life battling those lawsuits .
I do n't know if I 'll end have anything at the end of that . ""
Turning the tables : "" The entire management and board of Enron has been labelled everything from hucksters to criminals with complete disregard for the facts in evidence .
These untruths shatter lives and do nothing to advance the public understanding of what happened in Enron . ""
Sherron Watkins , the former Enron vice - president who wrote an anonymous email to Mr Lay in August warning of a financial implosion .
"" I believe Mr Andy Fastow [ Enron 's former chief financial officer ] would not have put his hands in the Enron cookie jar without an explicit or implicit approval to do so by Mr Skilling . ""
"" I believe that Enron had a brief window to salvage itself this past fall , and we missed that opportunity because of Mr Lay 's failure to recognise or accept that the company had manipulated its financial statements . ""
Senator Peter Fitzgerald
"" I approach your testimony with scepticism .
We have a chess game here ,
Mr Skilling , and our challenge is to find a way to check every single one of the moves you made on that Enron board . """
2002-02-27,"Jeffrey Skilling , the former Enron chief executive , yesterday said he did not "" dupe "" his chairman Kenneth Lay and denied lying to Congress in a heated day of hearings in Washington .
Mr Skilling said an earlier testimony of Sherron Watkins , the whistle - blower who blamed him for the spectacular collapse of the energy firm , was "" outrageous "" .
He angrily denounced what he described as the "" politicised witch hunt "" of the Senate commerce committee hearings to establish the events leading to Enron 's fall .
Mr Skilling and Ms Watkins , seated just one space apart , exchanged repeated acerbic asides in response to questioning from the panel . ""
Common decency suggests I should be treated as innocent until proven guilty , "" Mr Skilling said .
"" I have not lied , I have not duped Ken Lay . ""
Mr Skilling has maintained that he was not aware of the financial problems facing Enron , which became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history at the end of last year .
He said yesterday the company had been brought down by a "" classic run on the bank "" caused by fears of the firm 's credit and accounting methods - not by the offshore partnerships which hid debt . ""
Claiming an accounting fraud in the business world is tantamount to walking into a crowded theatre and screaming "" fire "" - everybody runs for the exits , "" he said .
Mr Skilling was in combative mood and repeatedly threw questions back at the panel or accused them of misrepresenting facts .
He said he had relied on advice from auditor Arthur Andersen .
Mr Skilling drew laughter from the assembly when he said he did n't recall a $ 5.6 m bonus he was paid in 2000 .
He said he still has most of the $ 66 m he gained from cashing in Enron shares .
"" I expect to spend the next five to 10 years of my life fighting lawsuits and I do n't know how much of that will be left , "" he said .
Ms Watkins hardened her view of Mr Lay , whom she had earlier portrayed as an innocent figure who had been hoodwinked by Mr Skilling and former finance chief Andrew Fastow .
She said yesterday : "" I was incredibly frustrated with Mr Lay 's actions , or lack thereof .
I believe that Enron had a brief window to salvage itself this past fall , and we missed that opportunity because of Mr Lay 's failure to recognise or accept that the company had manipulated its financial statements .
"" Both Ms Watkins and chief operating officer Jeffrey McMahon said Mr Skilling had been warned of the impending financial crisis .
Mr McMahon and Mr Skilling gave differing versions of a meeting they held nearly two years ago ."
2002-02-27,"The Enron scandal has saved the reputations of investment bankers , and may even have prevented some from going to jail , the legendary industrialist Jack Welch said yesterday .
The former chairman of the American GE corporation said that without the Enron collapse it would have been investment bankers facing questions on Capitol Hill - for their role in inflating the dot.com bubble , and the loss of billions of pounds of wealth when it exploded : "" You would have had the heads of every investment bank in front of Congress .
Enron saved their butts . ""
Mr Welch was in London speaking to bankers and executives at the Corporate Excellence Awards lunch , organised by specialist City newspaper Financial News .
His disdain for investment bankers is well known , and yesterday he said he was loath "" to ruin a nice lunch "" by talking about them too much .
But in a closed session with a small , hand - picked audience before the awards ceremony he had suggested that some bankers and analysts might have faced jail for irresponsibly promoting hi - tech companies , if attention had not switched to Enron .
He criticised analysts for inventing new terms to measure dot.com businesses and said that bankers had got so carried away with bringing unproven businesses to market that "" IPOs were made if someone just drove by an investment banking building "" .
He said the dot.com bubble was "" fifty times as big as Enron "" .
Mr Welch , who is regarded as one of the most successful businessmen of the 20th century , said there were clear lessons to be learned from Enron .
"" There 's one thing you ca n't cheat on and that 's cash , and Enron did n't have any cash for the last three years .
Accounting is odd , but cash is real stuff .
Follow the cash , "" he urged .
He warned against "" kneejerk "" new regulation , saying that a little more "" integrity and ethics "" would be the best safeguard .
He said new regulations on disclosure and to protect pensions cash would be welcome , but added : "" It is not about getting more people qualified to read a balance sheet , because Christ could n't do it in most of these places . ""
Instead , he said , companies needed to develop a culture "" where integrity rules "" .
But he conceded that such a change was unlikely ."
2002-02-28,"Wall Street analysts who encouraged investors to buy Enron shares even as the company stumbled toward bankruptcy yesterday claimed they were as misled as everyone else .
A US senate panel investigating Wall Street 's role in the Enron scandal expressed disbelief that the four analysts under questioning had maintained buy recommendations until days before the energy firm collapsed .
Each of the four banks had investment banking relationships with Enron .
The panel questioned whether the analysts had been compromised by the huge fees their firms were receiving for investment banking services .
They also poured scorn on the "" Chinese walls "" inside banks that are intended to ensure analysts ' independence .
Jim Bunning , senator for Kentucky , said the investment banking industry was in sore need of a shake - up .
"" You are asking us to intercede , "" he said .
"" What I hear from you is very difficult to believe .
I know about the walls , and the walls are not impenetrable . ""
The four analysts being questioned represent Credit Suisse First Boston , JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup and Lehman Brothers .
Each of the banks was involved in the sale of $ 25bn in stock and bonds issued by Enron and advised on numerous takeovers .
Salomon Smith Barney , a division of Citigroup , advised on $ 5bn of acquisitions and CSFB worked on deals worth $ 4.45bn .
CSFB 's Curtis Launer rated Enron a "" strong buy "" on October 23 last year , a week after the company had announced $ 1bn in third - quarter losses as off - shore ventures were exposed .
Lehman 's Richard Gross repeated his "" strong buy "" recommendation on the same day .
Each of the four denied any pressure or inside knowledge from the investment banking arms of their firms .
"" Inaccuracies in Enron 's financial reporting affected my conclusions and recommendations , "" Mr Launer said .
His comments were echoed by the others on the stand , but the panel remained unconvinced ."
2002-03-01,"Enron rewarded its top executives with at least $ 320 m in bonuses last year as the now bankrupt energy giant hit share price targets , it emerged today .
But the bonuses are being scrutinised by federal investigators as Enron stands accused of improperly inflating company profits during 2000 , the period on which the bonuses were based .
The figures obtained by federal prosecutors and cited by the New York Times show , unsurprisingly , that those on top of the Enron pyramid received the biggest amounts .
Former chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay received $ 3.6 m on January 11 2001 and then $ 7 m a month later .
Former president and chief operating officer , Jeffrey Skilling , received $ 7.5 m at the beginning of last year .
Revelations of the enormous bonuses are certain to fuel public anger and confirm impressions of uncontrolled corporate greed at what was once America 's seventh largest company , lauded for its innovative approach to financial and energy markets .
While top executives were rewarded lavishly , Enron 's foot soldiers have seen their savings and pension plans dwindle to virtually nothing in its collapse .
Enron has defended itself by describing the bonus payments as "" pretty standard "" in the corporate world .
That is true enough , but investigators will question their validity as they were based on inaccurate statements of Enron 's financial status .
Enron filed for bankruptcy last December , a few months after disclosing a $ 1.2bn reduction in shareholder equity , partly in connection with partnerships run by then chief financial officer Andrew Fastow .
Mr Fastow received over $ 3 m in bonuses at the beginning of last year .
Legal experts say the massive bonuses may have been an incentive for the financial skulduggery that went on . ""
A strong financial motive is probably the best evidence a prosecutor can get to promote or to establish criminal intent , Stephen Meagher , a former federal prosecutor , told the New York Times . ""
The levels of compensation that we are talking about here would certainly seem to be a powerful incentive for anyone to do anything . ""
Federal and congressional investigators are focusing on the secretive partnerships with fanciful names such as Raptors and Jedi that were used to conceal Enron 's debt and present the company in the best light .
Credit Suisse First Boston ( CSFB ) , the investment arm of Credit Suisse Group , has admitted links with the controversial partnerships that brought down Enron . ""
The partnerships that CSFB worked on were reviewed by the rating agencies , outside counsels , and the accounting firms , "" CSFB said , in response to a report in the Financial Times that a group of CSFB bankers played a central role in creating the partnerships ."
2002-03-01,"BP , Britain 's biggest company , is to scrap all political donations worldwide as criticism mounts about corporate influence on government policy , following the Enron collapse in the US and the "" Garbagegate "" row in Britain .
The world 's third - largest private sector oil group donated $ 840,000 ( £ 600,000 ) in the US last year .
Its close relations with the British government - with key executives moving between the two - have left it dubbed "" Blair Petroleum "" , athough it has made no political donations in Britain for a decade .
Lord Browne , BP 's chief executive , told a meeting of the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House in London that large multinationals must tread warily from now on . ""
"" We must be particularly careful about the political process because the legitimacy of that process is crucial both for society and for us , a company working in that society . ""
That is why we 've decided , as a global policy , that from now on we will make no political contributions from corporate funds anywhere in the world .
We 'll engage in the policy debate , stating our views and encouraging the development of ideas , but we wo n't fund any political activity or any political party . ""
Company officials denied the Enron affair had influenced its judgment and made clear it would not halt its lobbying of governments .
The move comes at a sensitive time for Downing Street .
This month Tony Blair was accused of helping a party donor , Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal , with a Romanian steel deal - and yesterday the Guardian revealed that another business donor , Uri David , is under investigation for helping to launder money in Switzerland .
Last night the issue prompted a call for a "" mature debate "" on the problems of party finances from the leader of the Commons , Robin Cook , a long - time supporter of state funding for political parties .
"" We can not simultaneously say the Labour party can not be funded by trade unions , that no party should be funded by business and at the same time say "" you 're not going to get taxpayers ' money "" .
Political parties have to be funded by someone , "" Mr Cook told reporters at Westminster .
BP and rival Shell were regarded by some government ministers in the past as arms of the foreign office and close ties remain .
The prime minister 's right - hand woman Anji Hunter recently moved over to become director of communications at BP .
Company director David Simon - now Lord Simon of Highbury - moved the other way , becoming a minister for competitiveness in Europe .
Among other users of the revolving door between Whitehall and BP is Byron Groat , head of chemicals at BP , who has been helping the Department of Trade and Industry on competitiveness issues , while Bryan Sanderson , a former head of BP 's chemicals division stepped down and became chairman of the government - backed Learning and Skills Council ."
2002-03-01,"After suffering scares about pension liabilities and exposure to Enron , speciality chemicals company ICI yesterday finally had some good news .
A US court dismissed a lead - in - paint lawsuit against its US subsidiary , Glidden .
The superior court of Rhode Island ruled that Glidden had no case to answer because the company came into existence only in 1986 and had therefore not been involved in the manufacture or sale of lead products for use in paint . ""
Although a different company - also called Glidden - existed previously , that company was a separate legal entity from the Glidden company of today , "" ICI said in statement .
ICI is still a defendant in 15 other US cases concerning allegations of lead in paint , but the Rhode Island litigation was viewed by analysts as the most important because it was being led by an attorney general .
The news came too late , however , to help the ICI share price which fell 5p to 285p yesterday ."
2002-03-02,"The focus on Wall Street 's role in the Enron debacle switched to Credit Suisse First Boston yesterday and the part it played in creating controversial offshore partnerships for the US energy trader .
The investment bank has handed documents relating to its dealings with the bankrupt company to investigators working for Congress .
Enron was said to have depended heavily on a team at the investment bank to help set up the network of offshore ventures that have since come under intense scrutiny .
Enron used off - balance sheet ventures to mask debt and poorly performing assets ; it was their discovery that triggered the rapid decline of the group at the end of last year .
But a spokesman for CSFB said the partnerships it worked on had been legitimate ventures to raise capital , not those that led to the company 's collapse . ""
The partnerships that CSFB worked on were reviewed by the ratings agencies , outside counsels and the accounting firms "" , the bank spokesman said .
Investigators are also seeking materials from other Wall Street banks .
A team at CSFB , led by Laurence Nath , worked with the former finance chief of Enron , Andrew Fastow , to set up the ventures named Osprey , Marlin and Firefly , which together held $ 4bn of assets .
Fallout from the energy trader 's failure has shifted from the White House to accountant Arthur Andersen , and now to the banks that advised Enron ."
2002-03-02,"Graduates and final - years watching the news recently could be forgiven for thinking that some of the shine usually attached to the world of accountancy has disappeared .
The collapse of the Texas utilities giant Enron has not only dealt its firm of auditing accountants , Andersen , a potentially fatal blow , but it has also placed the rest of the industry under the spotlight - particularly those firms offering both auditing and consulting services to their big corporate clients .
A year ago consulting overtook the Foreign Office as the number one choice for graduates .
For some reason accountancy has always lagged behind somewhat in the glamour stakes .
Many recruiters say graduates were put off by the perception that its professional exams are difficult but , frankly , it 's probably more a case of who wanted to stand in the kitchen at parties discussing auditing .
However , the events in New York last September put paid to the plans of many a high - flying graduate and the resulting downturn in City fortunes left several consulting firms shedding staff rather than recruiting them .
And many grads are now opting to don a pinstriped suit and head into something a little more secure .
The Enron factor
The first question you 're bound to ask is whether this is a particularly good time to go into accountancy ?
On the face of it , it is n't , but as usual these things are often more complicated than they first appear .
Most of the dirt that has been flying around will undoubtedly end up hitting Andersen 's fan .
But while there is a possibility that a big corporate lawsuit from Enron 's creditors could bring Andersen down , the big firms do have a habit of getting out of these scrapes .
While questions remain about the way firms offering clients both consulting and auditing services will operate in the future , it 's worth noting that none of the other big firms have been implicated in any similar cases and are probably just as safe a bet as they were before the Enron scandal broke .
Vote with feet If you were hoping to join KPMG later this year
, I 'm afraid you have left it too late .
The company has closed its books for this September 's intake and has already started recruiting for 2003 .
According to Keith Dugdale , KPMG 's director of graduate recruitment , recent events have meant demand to join his graduate programme has never been higher . ""
While the Enron scandal has undoubtedly caused a lot of negative publicity for the profession , this has been more than countered by the events of September 11 .
Just as demand for graduates to go into consulting and other City - related jobs has fallen away in the light of those events , we started receiving a flood of applications as graduates reappraised accountancy as a career option .
"" We are being asked about the fall - out from Enron , but we are able to reassure graduates wanting to join us that we are separating the auditing and consultancy parts of our business .
I certainly do n't think that the Enron affair is going to have an impact on graduate recruiting to the profession as a whole . ""
The interesting thing we are noting is that we are seeing far more applications from foreign students - particularly from the US , but also from Eastern Europe , "" he says .
dot.gone
While Keith Dugdale puts accountancy 's resurgence among graduates down to the effects of 9/11 , Charles Macleod , head of recruitment at rival PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PWC ) , says it can be traced back a little further to the bursting of the dot.com bubble . ""
The recent slowdown in the aftermath of events in New York has been a factor , but so too has the huge shrinkage in the dot.com and IT sectors , "" he says .
"" A few years ago those areas were very attractive to graduates - their decline , and in many cases removal , from the market place has resulted in a lot of graduates returning to what a few years ago would have been considered a slightly conservative career path . ""
PWC , unlike KPMG , is still taking applications , which is n't surprising when you consider the numbers involved - this year the company is looking to recruit between 850 and 900 students , slightly down on last year 's figure . ""
Not only have we seen a significant jump in the number of applications but there has also been a very pleasing increase in their quality .
This year 's intake will reflect the slight downturn in the consulting side of our business and most graduates we take on will go into the accountancy side .
"" At the moment I do n't think the Enron episode will affect recruitment .
I suspect it is going to have an impact on the industry , but it 's too soon to say what that will be - only once we are in possession of the facts will we be in a position to say more . ""
Which brings us neatly to Andersen 's position .
The company says it still plans to take on around 550 graduates in the UK this year , which is roughly the same figure as last year .
It says the Enron saga has not dented its number of applications and it currently has more accepted offers than at this time last year . ""
Naturally , candidates have had lots of questions , particularly during the early media coverage , but ultimately they have been making the decision to join on the quality of experience and training
Andersen can offer , "" says a spokeswoman ."
2002-03-04,"I bet you 've never wondered how fast your TV signal travels .
If you have , then you 're sadder than an Enron shareholder on a wet Sunday in Scunthorpe .
And yet , this week , we 're supposed to hang out the bunting and sing hallelujah because BT has finally , finally brought its wholesale price for 500k DSL down to something approaching a sensible level .
It 's clear that BT 's 512 kilobits a second is merely the opening bid in high - speed internet poker .
As Einstein said , speed is relative and it 's easy to get mixed up among the bits and bytes ; but one of the simplest measures is the 1.5 to 2 megabits needed to deliver full screen , high - quality TV images .
My own company , Telewest , has already announced that it will launch a 1 megabit per second service later this year .
And other people are going much further - NTT in Japan is dropping 1 megabit into people 's homes , and the nirvana of Internet 2 delivers 1.5 megabits to lucky staff and students in ritzy US universities and research institutes .
Mass market 512k is a powerful tool for surfing the current world wide web , though do n't necessarily expect BT 's DSL to deliver this - in the real world , DSL speeds can lumber at around half that .
On top of this , the viral gloop that sloshes around the internet is like an alien life force choking its development .
Nonetheless , 512k is the start .
So , hip , hip and we 'll hold the hooray .
Those of us trying to develop broadband content , and who believe in the unique interactive properties of high - speed internet , are relieved at the notion that the world 's biggest companies are breathing life into the drowning surfer that is broadband Britain .
But we know that we need more speed to achieve significant breakthroughs .
Much current broadband and interactive content is like granddad at a rave -
it 's just amazing that it 's there at all .
But despite advances in compression , delivering IP - based , full motion video to devices such as computers , TVs , and networked game consoles will need serious speed to rival the current broadcast experience .
The government can help the creative community enormously by spending intelligently on high - speed internet content for health , education , culture and so on .
And consumers can help by actually spending money on online entertainment .
But speed is a double - edged byte .
On the positive side , Sony has just announced the development of a broadband hub for PS2 .
This will enable anyone connecting to a broadband network via the console to gain access to music , games demos , IP telephony and entertainment .
Now that 's exciting .
The chance to partner with the people who 've sold hundreds of millions of entertainment devices worldwide is the Beatles moment for broadband - you knew that CDs would last as a format when Sgt Pepper came out on shiny plastic .
But here 's the troubling bit .
Our old friends the rip - off merchants are upping the ante in the poker game .
In the US , users of a peer - to - peer network called Audiogalaxy have turned to an old technology to deliver new problems .
Instead of individual MP3 tracks , the P - to - P pirates are zipping whole albums and their artwork .
Even with 512 connections it takes a matter of minutes to download the whole of Sgt Pepper and the gatefold ( and probably all the out - takes ) .
Similarly , a site in South Korea is happy to offer you downloaded movies for a fee .
All you do is turn up , forget the fact that the artists are n't getting paid and that copyright is fundamentally important for the development of creative arts , pay your two bucks and you can steal whatever you want .
Hey , that 's what the web 's about , right !
Freedom .
The next time someone nicks your mobile , see how free you feel .
So there you have the paradox : speed enables and speed kills .
There will be a competitive dash for increased bit rates over the next five years , and each improvement will enable broadband content providers to explore and exploit this fabulous medium .
And each time the legitimate businesses expand , the pirates will rush in .
There will be ways out of this conundrum .
The post September 11 world is one in which government monitoring and regulation of the world wide web will become ever more vigilant .
There 's strong evidence from the US that P - to - P is under intense regulatory scrutiny .
I even heard one New Labour guru speak longingly of the China solution for the UK - namely a UK - based intranet which will protect our happy citizens from nasty foreign websites .
On top of this , network - based billing solutions are emerging that will make life easier for the legitimate online consumer .
At the moment , even in 512 world , we make it extremely difficult for people to do simple things .
Finally , and intriguingly , it 's difficult to pirate interactive media , because the audience makes it what it is .
You ca n't pirate an interaction .
So the message to content providers is , chin up , it 's happening and close down all your personal P - to - P services immediately .
They want to kill you . ·

2002-03-06,"JP Morgan Chase , the battered Wall Street investment bank , was delivered another blow last night when it lost an attempt to force 11 insurance companies to honour $ 965 m ( £ 678 m ) in bonds related to failed firm Enron .
US district judge Jed Rakoff sided with the insurance firms , some of which have launched a countersuit against JP Morgan alleging fraud .
The insurers claim the oil and gas contracts against which they issued the surety bonds masked straightforward loans .
The contracts were between Enron and Mahonia , a JP Morgan affiliate .
Judge Rakoff said the insurers had provided enough evidence that the bonds "" were the product "" of fraud by the second - largest bank in the US , to deny JP Morgan immediate payment . ""
These arrangements now appear to be nothing but a disguised loan - or at least have sufficient [ indications ] thereof that the court could not possibly grant summary judgment to the plaintiff . ""
A JP Morgan spokesman said : "" This is a case about a commitment made by the insurance companies and a commitment not kept .
We expect to prevail on the merits of our arguments . ""
A trial has been set for December 2 .
JP Morgan fell $ 325 m into the red during the most recent quarter as a result of bad debts .
The bank wrote off $ 456 m of trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure to potential losses of $ 2.1bn .
It emerged yesterday that a second analyst claims he was fired for issuing a sell recommendation on Enron .
Chung Wu , former financial adviser at the Houston office of UBS PaineWebber , said he was fired after emailing the advice to more than 10 clients in August .
In a filing to the National Association of Securities Dealers , Mr Wu wrote : "" Enron management was not pleased and due to the employee stock option relationship UBS PaineWebber has with them , the pressure came from my corporate office _ to dismiss me . ""
UBS said Mr Wu was fired for failing to obtain approval before sending firm correspondence to clients ."
2002-03-06,"Signs of economic recovery may be helping to bolster confidence in stock markets , but the mood remains fragile .
Financiers and investors alike know that many of the concerns raised by the collapse of Enron still hold worryingly true .
For a start , nothing has been done to address the fact that so many big companies are still saddled with huge debts .
Market participants on both side of the Atlantic are wising up in the post - Enron world , investigating areas of corporate accounting which should have been looked at years ago .
This has prompted Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm of Barclays , to come up with tips for investors concerned about unclear accounting practices , which could also be used by companies trying to calm investor jitters .
Designed with an eye to debt - laden and acquisition - hungry telecoms companies - where many of the post - Enron jitters have surfaced - the main points could transfer to any other sector . ""
At its simplest , you need to ask if you understand what a company does and do you understand how it makes it 's money , "" said Laura Winchester , a telecoms analyst at Barclays Capital .
She is at pains to avoid suggestions that the practices she outlines at companies such as France Télécom , Telecom Italia and Ericsson are dubious .
But she points out that they have had an impact on the companies involved .
She describes four broad forms of so - called financial engineering : things you can not see ; things you can see but are not necessarily measured ; things you can see but can be forgotten ; and things that are visible on the balance sheet but open to interpretation .
"" The numbers are just part of the story .
The balance sheet is just a snap shot .
It captures some of the picture but not all of it so that 's why the notes to the accounts are important . ""
She admits : "" If there is misrepresentation or poor disclosure , as in the case of Enron , no one will know until it 's too late . ""
So the biggest question here is to ask how much confidence you have in management . ""
The things you can see but are not necessarily measured are often found in notes to the accounts but left out of headline debt figures .
Among events to watch for is France Télécom 's well - known obliga tion to support MobilCom and its far - from - clear exposure as a result .
Another warning from Ms Winchester is that accounting practices may be clear but investors ' memories fail .
She cites Ericsson 's earnings from its handset joint venture with Sony .
Only half of the losses from the alliance will be reported in the operating line .
She asks whether investors will remember in coming months that the boost to Ericsson 's numbers related to this transaction .
Judgments used by companies in their accounting policies make up her fourth point .
In telecoms , there is the question of whether revenues from deals should be booked as a one - off or during the lifetime of a deal .
She says her watch points have not yet been put to the test since the collapse of Enron because most of the debt issues in the bond markets have come from the strongest companies .
If investors are worried they should ultimately put their questions to the management , who will need to provide answers .
"" Full disclosure acts as a security blanket and we may well see investors less willing to part with their money without it . ""
1 The things you ca n't see No one will spot these until it 's too late 2
The things you can see but are n't necessarily measured The contigent liabilities that should have been added back
3 The things you can see but can be forgotten as time goes on Accounting changes or adjustments made in previous years 4 The things you can see but are subject to different interpretations Is it debt or equity ?
should it be in the balance sheet or not ?

2002-03-08,"Enron spent three times as much on lobbying the Bush administration last year than it first admitted , it emerged today .
The disgraced US energy company now says it lavished nearly $ 2.5 m ( £ 1.6 m ) on lobbying in the first six months of the Bush administration rather than the $ 825,000 it reported last summer .
Enron 's revised 17-page report now states that it lobbied the administration on appointments to the securities exchange commission ( SEC ) - the US financial watchdog - and to the commodity futures trading commission , as well as other regulatory agencies .
The old report omitted any mention of lobbying on nominees for these two key agencies .
In another amendment , the revised report contains eight references to White House lobbying ; the earlier version had just two .
But even this latest account may still be incomplete .
Enron is still so uncertain of its accuracy that not one of the company 's executives would step forward to sign the document .
Enron was among George Bush 's biggest campaign contributors , and its former boss Kenneth Lay enjoyed a warm relationship with the president , who called him "" Kenny Boy "" .
Mr Lay tried to capitalise on his close ties to the Bush team when he made a series of telephone calls to members of the cabinet asking for help when the energy conglomerate went into free fall .
Enron aggressively lobbied the administration to push its free market agenda for the energy industry .
Mr Lay put forward eight names to the White House when it was making appointments to the federal energy regulatory commission ( Ferc ) last spring .
Mr Bush eventually appointed two of the people on Enron 's list .
Mr Lay gave the list of names to Clay Johnson , Mr Bush 's personnel director .
Among the eight or so names were Pat Wood , now Ferc chairman , and Nora Brownell , a member of the commission .
The justice department , the SEC and a dozen congressional committees are investigating Enron and its auditor , Arthur Andersen , after Enron filed for bankruptcy last December in America 's most spectacular corporate failure .
Thousands of employees saw their savings and retirement plans wiped out ; yet top executives walked away with huge bonuses .
The latest report on Enron 's lobbying activities showed that the company spent as much on lobbying in the first six months of Mr Bush 's presidency as it did in all of the previous year when lobbying came to $ 2.1 m .
The figure for all of 1999 was just under $ 2 m .
The centre for responsive politics , a Washington group that tracks political contributions , uncovered a discrepancy a month ago that led to the revised filing .
Enron earlier reported spending only $ 825,000 on lobbying , but outside lobbying firms reported Enron 's expenditure as coming to $ 1.8 m during the same period ."
2002-03-08,"In one of the most egregious abuses that occurred in the Enron scandal , top executives walked away with huge bonuses , while company workers saw their retirement and savings plans wiped out .
President George Bush has now unveiled a blueprint on corporate governance in direct response to the Enron scandal , designed to prevent a replay of such corporate excess .
The 10-point action plan includes a provision that would bar heads of companies from profiting from false financial statements .
In other words , they could be forced to forfeit their salaries and bonuses if the books are not clean .
Enron led investors and analysts up the garden path by using colourfully named partnerships such as Jedi and Raptor to conceal large amounts of debt .
When the energy trading company restated its accounts last year , it admitted to having overstated profits dating back to 1997 by $ 600 m .
In other measures , accountancy firms would be barred from engaging in both accounting work and consulting for the same clients and there would be stricter disclosure rules on the personal share transactions of top executives .
However , the Bush administration backed away from wielding the really big stick .
Paul O'Neill , the treasury secretary and former chief executive of Alcoa , the aluminium giant , wanted a much tougher measure : take away the insurance cover and limited liability that protects company directors from lawsuits .
The respected chairman of the Federal Reserve , Alan Greenspan , also advocated such a move .
But this was too hard to stomach for an administration that enjoys highly intimate ties to corporate America .
This is a White House that does not want to bite the hand that feeds it .
Besides , republicans are traditionally averse to plaintiffs ' lawyers , who traditionally support democrats .
The White House clearly fears a flood of frivolous lawsuits , but such a measure would have provided a powerful disincentive to executives for indulging in the kind of shenanigans that eventually led to Enron 's collapse .
The Bush proposals mark a good starting point , especially the plan to bar accountants from also working as consultants for the same firm .
This conflict of interest has always been a problem with accountancy firms and it reached epic proportions at Enron , which paid Arthur Andersen over $ 20 m for audit work and the same again for consultancy work .
With such lucrative fees , no wonder that the accountancy firm pulled its punches when looking at Enron 's books .
Of course Arthur Andersen is paying the price for its lack of professionalism as one big client after another takes their business elsewhere .
Congress is considering its own measures on corporate governance .
So far the democrats have criticised the Bush proposals for their lack of teeth .
Be that as it may , President Bush has made decent start ."
2002-03-10,"Upstairs , Downstairs may have passed over to digital TV but attitudes towards people in ' trade ' seem hardly to have changed in the last 100 years .
There is a brooding atmosphere of suspicion , where business is cast as chief suspect , there to rip off customers , exploit the workforce and make huge profits at the expense of the environment .
The dramatic collapses of Railtrack and Enron clearly do n't help ; unfortunately business has its failures just like every other area of life .
I have yet to meet anyone in business who deliberately sets out to fail .
And yes , within its ranks , business does have people who are dishonest .
I only ask for not all of us to be tarred with the same brush .
Business is a reflection of society .
There are failures in teaching , journalism , trade unions and politics as well .
The vast majority of people in business today work damned hard , care passionately about their workforce and are proud of their ability to create wealth .
After all , it is the wealth created by business - directly or through the jobs that deliver taxpayers , community growth and social inclusion - that provides new hospitals and schools .
Business does not shout enough about when it is a force for good .
Many companies quietly put a great deal back into the areas in which they operate through myriad special community projects at home and abroad .
I do a lot of travelling around the UK , Europe and beyond , talking to the communities that business affects .
So many schemes , educational , cultural and in some cases life - saving , have achieved dramatic results and really changed peoples ' lives for the better .
But this work is often ignored or belittled by those whose prejudices and suspicions make it difficult for them to accept this reality .
I feel privileged to have seen some of these schemes in action - they really do have the ability to restore one 's faith in human nature .
Corporate social responsibility is alive and well in the UK , and I hope increasing numbers of businesses will want to put more back into their communities .
So please , put to one side the Enron factor - good business would be the first to deplore it .
We need a sense of perspective .
I am never slow to cast the spotlight on the jungle of regulation that seriously affects our businesses in this country but , of course , dishonesty in business must be tackled .
Honesty , integrity and trust are essential ingredients to business success .
But I do n't want the UK to deliver the business equivalent of the Dangerous Dogs Act .
To muzzle a handful of Rottweilers , every Labrador in the country is visited with the problem .
I also want our politicians to be able to fight the cause of UK business on the world stage , without fear of ill - informed , destructive abuse .
Of course , motivation must be clear and integrity beyond doubt .
But other governments never hesitate to promote the interests of their countries ' companies , and it is important that ours be free to do the same .
What 's more , our politicians are good at creating goodwill around the world .
The UK is seen as a fair - minded , decent country - and UK businesses can use that , and build on it to create more jobs and more success .
Too often , UK companies take the criticism for business involvement in developing countries when media - and political - attention should be focused more on the rulers of the countries in question .
The UK can not operate in isolation - our competitors would take full advantage if we were walking to the beat of a different drum to everyone else .
Globalisation can be such a force for good .
People enjoying a better standard of living , better healthcare and a better education tend not to go to war so readily .
There is a job to be done , and it 's for business and politics to do it together .
We need to show that globalisation does not mean Americanisation - so many more countries have an active role to play .
That 's why the UK 's global champions need to be successful throughout the world .
A great deal depends on it .
No profits means no jobs , no taxes and no money to fund the improvements everyone wants to see delivered .
Reform of our public services is such a massive task that it will require the best of all sectors - public , private and voluntary - all working together .
There are already worrying signs that some very able companies may be turning their back on public - private partnerships , asking ' who needs the hassle of anti - business sentiment ' ?
But we all lose if they walk away .
It seems crazy that UK businesses that are operating successfully around the globe , delivering major improvements in infrastructure and services in every area imaginable , are not being given the chance to use their expertise at home .
Our public services employ some of the most committed and talented people in the country - it is the system and the management structure that is letting them , and us , down .
Let them work together with the best of the private and the voluntary sectors and even the impossible starts to look attainable .
Open minds , a willingness to do things differently and a ' can - do ' customer - focused attitude could make a world of difference .
Give business a break .
If we suspend the atmosphere of distrust and use every available resource , together we can all make not just a difference but the difference ."
2002-03-10,"One minute , there was no crisis .
Lord Wakeham was doing an excellent job and Prime Ministers and princes flocked admiringly to the door of the Press Complaints Commission .
Then , like Enron , Lord W 's hegemony imploded ; and the PCC was back in the pits .
This time , though , the problem did n't come from outside - no royals moaning about sneak photographs ; no Blair folding Euan 's comfort blanket .
This time the problem came from within , from broadsheet editors - Moore of the Telegraph , Rusbridger of the Guardian , Kelner of the Independent - dumping publicly on the Commission 's supposedly chummy and flexible way with mediations .
Do governments and restless backbenchers think all is well with press self - regulation ?
They tend not to when the papers they read - from left or right - are full of doubts and sorrows .
They look round for reform , for a better way .
One such a reforming idea is already familiar to Observer and Guardian readers ; and it may spread .
Readers ' editors , there to dispense instant corrections , clarifications or admonitions , begin to cluster in the shadow of the PCC .
Ministers such as Tessa Jowell are sitting up and taking interest .
If what we have goes belly up , here , perhaps , is a ground - up replacement .
Alan Rusbridger certainly thinks so .
The relationship between newspaper and reader is central , he says , to what happens after Wakeham .
His own ( 1997 ) ' decision to create the first readers ' editor in Britain was inspired by the seriousness with which the larger American daily papers approach the task of getting things right ' .
The PCC 's workload - 2,225 complaints against all British newspapers and magazines in 2000 , compared with 7,634 in the same year to the Guardian 's readers ' editor alone - ' suggests that it can not be regarded as a rigorous self - policing mechanism for the industry at large ' .
Rusbridger is right to be bullish .
His first and continuing readers ' editor , Ian Mayes , not only provides a swiftly efficient service , but writes about it with a wry wisdom .
Readers seem to love this particular editor of their own .
Piers Morgan at the Mirror and Roger Alton on The Observer are finding similarly enthusiastic responses .
So why not roll the scheme out across all national papers ?
No reason , at least in theory : everybody , the PCC included , has an interest in innovative self - regulation .
Acting chairman Robert Pinker says so openly .
The problem lies with the word ' scheme ' .
America , serious or not , does n't have a scheme .
A few big papers ( most influentially the Washington Post ) have ombudsmen who write a column and correct errors .
But these are ad hoc initiatives .
The US , for all its love of regulation , has no Press Complaints Commission , no code of practice , nothing .
Utter such words and editors run from the room .
Almost to a man , they see self - regulation as undermining their First Amendment rights .
Better still , because they basically operate regional monopolies of the one - paper - fits - all variety , they can opt out of any industry - wide initiatives while adopting a lofty Rotarian gravity which leaves tabloid taint suitably distanced from their lives : on a separate supermarket shelf .
Nothing to do with us , guv .
The question for Britain is very different .
How does a fiercely competitive press get its act together when every move , every miscalculation , may spell personal doom for an editor devoid of readers ?
We had readers ' representatives for a brief while at the start of the Nineties , and some were distinguished outsiders .
( The Independent chose Sir Gordon Downey , who went on to be parliamentary commissioner . )
But that scheme was spottily conceived and implemented .
This paper , like others , simply re - titled and defined its existing managing editor ( who always dealt pretty well with readers ' complaints anyway ) .
It was all , with hindsight , a transit zone to the broader church of the PCC .
It was a passing on , not a drawing back .
And now the parcel is passing back and forth again .
The PCC , it seems , used to be the answer : now , maybe , it 's not - too inbred , too cosy , too prone to conciliate rather than regulate .
These are n't foolish criticisms .
A regulator wearily and uniquely used to bellyaches from Buckingham Palace or Downing Street every five minutes is bound to hunch in introversion and celebrate success by throwing florid parties for its most important clients .
A stiffer regulatory zeal may be just what 's needed .
But the basic problem is deeper .
Since Wakeham 's reign imploded , what we 've seen , variously from the dissenting broadsheets , is fracturings of the common cause that produced the Commission and would drive it forward .
Meanwhile , judges in cases from Naomi Campbell to Jamie Theakston go about their own law - creating business .
Readers ' editors are a very bright idea .
There should be more of them and that would help the PCC turn more regulatory .
But how ( for editors and their readers ) do you build a consensus behind that when the problem , all too evidently , is a lack of consensus ?
Once upon a recent time , editors Rusbridger and Kelner would have served their time as PCC commissioners inside the tent .
Now they 're left on the outside , devising their own ways to do better .
When Pinker counsels against rapid change , he maybe underestimates how much has changed in the PCC 's first decade .
When Fleet Street is abruptly asked to concentrate in a crisis , we also see how the sweetly peaceful years of Wakeham have deluded newspapers into thinking a problem that sleeps is a problem solved ."
2002-03-11,"Arthur Andersen is reportedly holding merger talks with rival Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as the accountancy giant fights for survival after being tainted in the Enron scandal .
"" There are discussions in New York between Andersen and Deloitte , "" a source told the Washington Post .
"" There are a lot of options possible , including a merger or a sale of a lot of the parts being discussed . ""
Andersen in London declined to comment on the reports that emerged over the weekend .
The negotiations by the two big accounting firms were said to have begun in earnest last week around the same time that Andersen learned that it faced a possible indictment on obstruction of justice in connection with the shredding of thousands of documents .
Such an indictment would be unprecedented for a large accounting firm - usually individuals and not the entire firm is pursued - that relies on its good name as its stock in trade in reviewing financial statements .
In any case , Andersen 's reputation has been in tatters since the Enron debacle , where it stands accused of failing in its duties as auditor .
Andersen has admitted and apologised for the destruction of documents in its Houston office .
But it tried to blamed the shredding on David Duncan , the chief partner on the Enron account , who has since been sacked .
But Mr Duncan , who is cooperating with prosecutors , said he was acting under orders from the firm 's Chicago headquarters .
Mr Duncan 's colleagues have backed up his version of events in sworn statements to plaintiffs ' lawyers .
The biggest sticking point in any merger is how Deloitte would avoid taking on all the legal and financial liabilities
Andersen faces for its role in Enron .
In addition to potential fines from criminal charges , Andersen faces possible regulatory action by the securities and exchange commission as well as lawsuits from companies and individuals hurt by Enron 's collapse .
A possible solution is for Deloitte to acquire all but Andersen 's American operations and let the US arm stand alone temporarily to deal with Enron - related problems .
But , if Deloitte acquired Andersen , the Big Five accounting firms would become the Big Four , raising potential monopoly issues .
Deloitte , the No 2 accounting firm would almost catch up with the industry leader , PricewaterhouseCoopers , if it acquired Andersen ."
2002-03-12,"The embattled accountancy firm Andersen , facing possible criminal charges for its role in the Enron scandal , and an exodus of big - name clients , has offered itself for sale to its rival Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu .
Andersen 's ability to survive the shockwaves of the Enron bankruptcy has been increasingly in doubt in recent weeks .
There have also been reports of a rush for the door by Andersen workers who fear that their careers might be blighted by the Enron affair .
The power giant became the biggest bankruptcy in history in December and faces a wave of lawsuits and investigations for inflating its profits by hiding debts offshore .
Andersen approved the accounts and subsequently admitted that its Houston , Texas , office had shredded Enron - related documents later sought by investigators .
Andersen approached Deloitte Touche after it became apparent last week that it might face criminal charges for obstruction of justice .
Julia Irvine , deputy editor of Accountancy Magazine , said : "" It looks as though Andersen has thrown in the towel , and that will have a profound effect on the profession .
They could have weathered this if they had n't shredded the documents .
That was fatal . ""
City analysts voiced concern that a merger would stifle competition and increase the stranglehold of a select few accountancy firms on the auditing of the UK 's largest companies .
A merger would mean that the global auditing business would be reduced to just four large companies .
Government contracts could also be affected .
Accountancy firms are heavily involved in private finance projects and a reduction in the number of firms bidding for work could raise questions of price fixing .
Andersen is the world 's fifth largest accountancy firm , with revenues of $ 9.3bn ( £ 6.5bn ) , and employs 85,000 people in 84 countries .
Deloitte Touche is the second largest , with revenues of $ 12.4bn .
Combined , the two would still not match the size of the market leader , PricewaterhouseCoopers .
Andersen has lost at least 36 clients since Enron went under .
The exodus has gathered momentum in recent weeks , with companies including the drugs group Merck and Delta Air Lines switching auditors .
It swiftly sacked the accountant in charge of the document shredding , David Duncan , and demoted several other workers in its Houston offices .
But congressional investigators believe that people higher up in the organisation may have known what was going on .
The takeover discussions depend on the complex issue of how Deloitte Touche could avoid taking on the liabilities facing Andersen .
As well as possible criminal charges , it faces myriad lawsuits .
Patrick Dorton , a spokesman for Andersen , refused to comment directly on the discussions . ""
Andersen is considering many options , "" he said .
"" We are committed to making changes to our business that will restore the public 's trust . """
2002-03-13,"US congressional investigators have turned their attention to Global Crossing , the telecoms company that fell into bankruptcy in January and is under scrutiny for its accounting methods .
The house energy and commerce committee , which has led the Washington inquiries into Enron , yesterday wrote to Global 's chief executive , John Legere , requesting a number of financial records .
The spate of inquiries into the accounting practices of the telecoms industry in the US widened when WorldCom said it , too , had been asked to provide materials to the securities and exchange commission , the US financial regulator .
The SEC is looking into accounting issues as well as loans to the company 's top executives .
Shares in WorldCom sank by 13 % in midday trade to $ 7.82 despite attempts by chief executive Bernie Ebbers to calm investors .
"" I feel in my heart of hearts that there are no issues that shareholders need to be concerned with , "" he said .
Qwest , one of the so - called Baby Bells formed from the break - up of AT&amp;T , said on Monday that the SEC had opened an informal inquiry into the company .
The letter to Global Crossing , signed by committee chairman Billy Tauzin , has 22 separate requests for information .
A spokeswoman for Global Crossing said it had received the letter and was still reviewing the requests .
The inquiry focuses on the accounting of capacity swaps , where telecoms companies use each other 's networks to fill gaps in their own infrastructures .
The letter asks for the names of several workers as well as the Andersen staff who ratified the accounts .
A former Global Crossing worker has alleged a conspiracy within the company , which Global Crossing denies ."
2002-03-15,"Joseph Berardino , the chief executive of Arthur Andersen , recently issued a mea culpa emblazoned in full - page ads in US newspapers after the Enron collapse .
The document shredding that occurred during Enron 's demise was a rogue operation , Mr Berardino argued , and not something that came from the top .
But Andersen 's damage limitation exercise has failed and now it faces the lash of the US justice department , which yesterday indicted the company on criminal obstruction charges .
The indictment marks the first criminal charges filed in connection with the Enron scandal as well as the first ever indictment against one of the big five accountancy firms .
The US government does not issue criminal charges against corporations lightly , and this is the most high - profile case since Washington accused Drexel Burnham Lambert , the employers of junk bond king Michael Milken , of securities fraud .
Drexel subsequently disappeared .
Andersen might well describe itself as appalled by the indictment , as the consequences of the government action could spell doom for one of the world 's mightiest accountancy firms .
Even before the indictment , which is an allegation and not a conviction , as Andersen reminds us , the company was frantically trying to find a merger partner to ensure its survival .
But talks with rival firms such as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and PricewaterhouseCoopers went nowhere .
The most likely outcome is a fragmentation of the firm into different national partnerships .
The non - US member firms of the Andersen worldwide network provide employment to 60,000 people in 83 countries outside America , and these member firms will probably go their own way .
Quite apart from affecting the fate of tens of thousands of employees , the likely disappearance of Andersen as a global player will have serious repercussions for the global accountancy business , as the Big Five will shrink to the Big Four .
This should be a lesson for US regulators , who allowed such consolidation to occur in the first place .
America likes to boast of the virtues of competition , and yet allowed the number of competitors in the global accountancy business to dwindle to a handful .
With Andersen heading towards extinction , the already small number of competing firms is about to diminish further ."
2002-03-15,"Former prime minister John Major has put himself at odds with his former energy minister Lord Wakeham by endorsing a decision by engineering group Mayflower to drop Andersen as its auditor .
Mayflower is the first British client to dismiss the US accountancy group since it was tarnished by involvement with stricken energy trader Enron , where Lord Wakeham was a non - executive director and sat on its audit committee .
Mr Major is a non - executive director at Mayflower and sits alongside David Harland and Rupert Hambro on the audit committee which took the decision to switch accountants after a long relationship with Andersen .
Mayflower declined to comment on the move which will be confirmed when shareholders are asked to vote on a new auditor at the annual meeting on April 18 .
Andersen confirmed the loss of Mayflower but denied it was anything to do with the Enron scandal . ""
Of course we are sorry that the board of Mayflower Corporation have chosen to change auditors ; however , this is part of a normal audit review and corporate governance process which many organisations undertake , "" a spokeswoman said .
Andersen has lost several big US clients but had managed to hang on to its British customers ."

EO may fold as flotations sink The dearth of flotations has forced EO , the online financial portal intended to link brokers with retail investors , into a strategic review which could see the London firm closed down .

2002-03-16,"Arthur Andersen which is still reeling from an indictment for obstruction of justice , was yesterday barred from working with the US government .
The announcement was another blow for Andersen which faces an exodus of clients and a wave of lawsuits related to its auditing of Enron .
The Bush administration has also suspended business dealings with Enron .
The general services administration said Enron was struck off new government business for a year while Andersen , charged by the justice department on Thursday night , was suspended for the duration of the indictment .
Andersen vowed to "" vigorously defend itself "" against the criminal charges and said it was "" appalled "" .
"" This action will cause uncertainty for the clients and people of our US member firm , and appears to be the result of overreaching on the part of prosecutors , "" it said .
The accounting firm also hinted at a break - up of the business .
Some partners in Europe have said they want to cut their ties to the US division , which has been devastated by the Enron collapse .
Andersen 's London office , dragged into the scandal by deputy attorney general Larry Thompson , reiterated claims that it had done nothing wrong .
The UK office hired law firm Herbert Smith to investigate the issue in recent weeks and concluded that documents were shredded only by three people , on secondment from the Houston branch .
The Enron team in London consisted of about 40 people .
But the fallout from this revelation continued yesterday as Psion , the wireless technology group , came under fire from institutional investors who want it to end its relationship with the accounting firm .
The company refused to comment .
The eight - page indictment alleged that "" literally tons "" of Enron documents were shredded by the firm .
A court appearance has been set for Wednesday ."
2002-03-17,"Andersen , the embattled accounting firm , could be banned from government work only five years after a previous block was lifted .
A ban is one possible result of a review launched across Whitehall last week after it emerged that Andersen , which audited Enron 's accounts , has been barred from US government work following the collapse of the Texan energy company .
A Downing Street spokesman yesterday confirmed that the review is being led by agencies and departments with procurement responsibilities , such as the Office for Government Commerce , the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry .
A new bar would not only be financially damaging for Andersen , but would be humiliating , as the firm was previously prevented from doing government work during the Eighties in the wake of the De Lorean scandal .
It returned to favour only when Labour came to power in 1997 .
The news comes as Andersen faces potentially devastating criminal charges in America over an alleged attempt to cover up the firm 's role in the Enron scandal .
The company , which employs 85,000 people worldwide , is expected to break up or merge with another of the accounting ' Big Five ' .
In the US , it has been deserted by its biggest clients .
Mayflower , the listed bus and coach operator , last week became the first audit client in the UK to drop Andersen .
A number of other British blue - chip clients , including BSkyB and WPP , yesterday said they were ' monitoring the situation ' ."
2002-03-17,"Sir Peter Davis appeared to cause New Labour some blushes last week .
But if reports that he refused the invitation of Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt to investigate the role of non - executive directors are correct , he has probably done her a favour .
Two of the concerns that Hewitt 's review - prompted by the collapse of Enron - will examine are that individuals hold too many directorships ( Enron non - exec Lord Wakeham had more than 10 ) and that cronyism is as rife as ever in Britain 's boardrooms .
Davis says he is too busy as chief executive of Sainsbury .
Indeed , had he accepted and his share price had then slumped mid - investigation , the fact that he is a non - executive director of banking group UBS , a director of the Royal Opera House , chairman of Business in the Community , and director of several other non - business bodies would have undermined the review 's credibility .
Nevertheless , many of Davis 's peers would not find his clutch of jobs unusual .
Examination of the top 350 companies shows an inner circle of influence , comprising the captains of industry in the FTSE 100 ( see Glaxo graphic left ) , radiating out to smaller companies , where there are links between lesser known names .
Predictably , shareholder groups are pleased about the review .
The role of non - execs is not differentiated from that of executives in law , and most agree that it has changed dramatically in the past 20 years .
Pirc , the shareholder action group , defines two roles - to scrutinise executive decisions , and to advise on strategy - without becoming associated with management .
Clive Garston , managing partner of law firm Halliwell Landau and a non - exec of three companies , says : ' Twenty years ago they were seen as largely decorative .
Now the scrutiny role is far more pronounced - so the risks have grown . '
David Gould of the National Association of Pension Funds adds : ' We feel that , given what is now demanded of non execs , they should not have too many directorships . '
How many is too many ? '
Four or five for someone who is a full time non exec . '
To see if shareholder groups had cause for concern , The Observer cross - checked Companies House records for those on the top 350 boards in the country to identify Britain 's most widely employed non - exec directors .
The exercise threw up a list of 80 ' serial directors ' - those , according to our definition , with at least three directorships among the top 350 companies .
Here the workload , and the fees , are highest - headhunters told The Observer the going rate was £ 30,000 - 40,000 for a 15- to 18-day year in the FTSE 100 , £ 20,000 - 30,000 for a FTSE 250 - with fewer days - and £ 15,000 - 18,000 below that .
The results offer a fascinating insight into the way influence is concentrated .
Of the serial directors , six hold five top 350 directorships and 15 hold four .
But that is just the start - many also sit on smaller boards .
Our table shows that Sir Angus Grossart , luminary of the Scottish financial scene , and Sir Bob Reid , former head of British Rail , have collected 17 directorships each .
Holding multiple directorships naturally creates a cadre of influential people , which worries shareholders and government .
Gould says : ' The pool of NEDs is neither wide enough nor deep enough .
If they are choosing their own people all the time there 's little diversity . '
Those who hold many directorships of big companies worry shareholders most , yet the biggest companies are most likely to employ the busiest people .
Of the FTSE 100 , 63 companies employ ' serial non - execs ' .
Five sit on the British Airways board , BP and Daily Mail General Trust each have four , while Cable and Wireless , Gallaher , HBOS , Invensys and Legal and General have three apiece .
As our Glaxo diagram shows , personal connections can spread from one major FTSE 100 company to the boards of others through a core of influential and well connected non - execs .
Oliver Stocken does not have the profile of Sir Richard Sykes .
However , his five directorships in the FTSE 100 and 250 ( 13 in total ) indicate how acquaintance with a few influential people coincides with seats on some choice boards ( see graphic ) .
There is no suggestion of impropriety .
But those who believe in the power of networking will be intrigued .
One shareholder group said : ' It shows you only have to go two or three companies down the line
and you are back to where you started .
It is certainly possible that there could be connections which cause lack of objectivity . '
Hewitt is also reviewing accountancy firms and the auditing of big companies .
Audit committees composed of non - executive directors are there to scrutinise the audit process , ensuring investors get a clear picture of company and management performance .
Enron 's audit committee , which included Lord Wakeham , manifestly failed .
As our graphic shows , there can be close connections between executives and members of these committees .
The key issue this highlights is whether lack of diversity shades into lack of independence .
Pirc and NAPF both have guidelines - which are consistently broken by companies in the FTSE Allshare .
These include that executives should not subsequently become non - executives in the same company ( 14.2 per cent of directors do ) ; hold the post for more than nine years ( 26.2 per cent ) ; hold cross directorships with other individuals ( 3.1 per cent ) ; hold share options ( 7.9 per cent ) ; or be a director of another company with significant shares in the one of which he is a non - exec .
Pirc identifies nine FTSE 100 audit committees with non - independent non - execs .
One of these - Daily Mail General Trust - has no independents .
Problems magnify when shareholders see a majority of ' non - independent ' directors on a board under these definitions - as has happened recently at EasyJet and Securicor .
Reappointments of three EasyJet directors - including Stelios Haji - Iouannou - were opposed by Pirc , along with the reappointment of KPMG as auditors , as their non - audit fees consistently dwarf their audit fees .
For some , these concerns are overstated .
One City headhunter said : ' Since the Greenbury and Cadbury reviews , nearly all FTSE 100 and 250 companies go through executive search procedures for non - execs .
There may be a network , but it is shrinking . '
And if you are not Sir Henry Bloggs but Allan Leighton
there is something to be said for plural directorships . '
Allan Leighton - a full time non - exec with directorships including BSkyB
, Scottish Power , Wilson Connolly , BHS , Leeds United , Dyson , Consignia and Lastminute.com - would agree .
Others would not .
One former headhunter says : ' Executive search means nothing .
Head - hunters have their favourite non - execs and vice versa . '
Once you are one of them you 're in the money . '"
2002-03-18,"Lord Wakeham has quit as chairman of the press complaints commission just weeks after stepping aside to answer questions about his role in the Enron scandal .
Pressbof , the funding body of the press watchdog , said it had agreed to accept his resignation "" with regret "" at a meeting earlier today .
Just last month , Lord Wakeham insisted his absence from the role would be a temporary measure .
He agreed to step aside while a US senate committee looked into his role as a director of collapsed US energy giant Enron .
Before the Enron controversy erupted , it is understood Lord Wakeham planned to ask for his PCC contract to be extended beyond the summer of 2003 , when it was due to expire .
Instead , he will leave immediately , forcing the commission to step up the search for his successor .
His departure led to calls for an overhaul of the PCC , with the Telegraph editor , Charles Moore , leading the charge against the watchdog .
Professor Robert Pinker , who took on the job of chairman on a temporary basis following Lord Wakeham 's decision to step aside , will not apply for the post .
Among the contenders are the former parliamentary standards regulator , Elizabeth Filkin ; the outgoing cabinet secretary , Sir Richard Wilson ; the high - profile barrister and newspaper columnist , David Pannick ; and the former presenter of Radio 4 's Today programme , Sue MacGregor ."
2002-03-18,"Andersen 's Swiss unit today joined the growing list of the accountancy giant 's European branches wanting to break away from the US operation in the wake of the Enron scandal .
Andersen 's Switzerland spokesman , Claude Baumann , said that the branch planned to leave Andersen Worldwide and merge with a rival company .
"" We are still in discussion with our competitors , "" Mr Baumann said .
"" Probably in the next few days something will come up . ""
Elsewhere in Europe , Andersen 's Polish division said it started talks late last week with its competitors ' Polish branches , while the German arm is also poised to break relations with the US partnership .
Andersen UK confirmed that "" a lot of discussions have been going on "" about possible merger talks .
The Andersen network is also unravelling in China , where the company 's operation said it was holding talks on its future with other auditing firms in the country .
Andersen China said in a statement that mounting woes at its US counterpart would not affect its own operations , the accounting giant 's third - largest in Asia after Japan and Australia , with more than 2,000 employees . ""
Andersen China is actively engaged in discussions about its future with other accounting firms in the country , "" Andersen China said .
"" The company is confident that we will soon provide a satisfactory solution to interested parties , various branches of government , our clients and our own loyal employees . ""
Accountancy sources said Andersen was seeking to reassure customers in China worried that its growing misfortunes might end up hitting operations in Shanghai , Beijing , Guangzhou , Shenzhen , Xi'an and Chongqing .
Andersen , one of the world 's "" big five "" accountancy firms , began to unravel when it was indicted by the US government for obstruction of justice by destroying thousands of documents and deleting computer files about its audit on Enron .
Andersen denies the charges .
The Bush administration has announced a one - year suspension on new government business and Andersen faces a similar move in the UK .
Andersen only recently won the right to bid for government contracts when Labour lifted a previous ban in connection with the De Lorean scandal in the 1980s .
The US arm has also seen an exodus of high - profile clients such as Delta Air Lines and Merck , the drug giant .
In all , about 36 companies have deserted Andersen in the US .
The company has held talks with its big five rivals about a possible sale of some or all of its assets .
But talks have faltered over concerns about Andersen 's potential liabilities from the Enron case .
Rival firms in Europe reportedly have received a flurry of calls from Andersen staff for jobs as the worldwide partnership threatens to disintegrate .
While there is talk among the European partnerships to preserve as much of the European network as possible , they are also planning for the worst ."
2002-03-19,"It has drama and corruption , heroes and villains , violent death and a mystery ending .
So perhaps it is hardly surprising that the bidding wars have started as studios enter the race to make the first film about the Enron scandal .
Four separate film ventures based on the multi - billion - dollar collapse of the energy company are now under way and others may soon enter the field .
Books and articles about the "" debacle "" , as the television news channels like to call it , are being speedily optioned .
When the Enron scandal first broke , the general feeling was that there was an absence of the necessary dramatic and sexual elements to turn it into a successful film .
It seemed to be a story about white men in suits in corporate offices , although violence and tragedy were added to the mix when company vice - chairman Cliff Baxter committed suicide in his Mercedes in January .
But now , according to the trade paper Variety , four projects are already under way .
One film is likely to be based on The Enron Wars , an article by Marie Brenner in the April edition of Vanity Fair .
Brenner 's heroine is Jan Avery , a former accountant with Enron who noticed something fishy about the accounts back in 1993 .
As her very first assignment she was asked to justify a loss on the books of $ 142 m .
Her boss told her : "" We had a little problem , "" which seems to have the necessary ring of familiarity and ambiguity .
Producer Scott Rubin of Paramount has optioned the article by Brenner , who also wrote the original article on which the Oscar - winning film , The Insider , was based .
That , too , was a story about corporate malpractice and intimidated whistle - blowers .
Lowell Bergman , the investigative journalist who was played by Al Pacino in The Insider , is also working as a consultant on an Enron - based drama .
This project sprung from Bergman 's remarks to New York Times ' columnist Maureen Dowd , to whom he suggested that the Enron drama was essentially "" The Women vs The Men . ""
The day after the column appeared , a producer was on the phone to Bergman telling him to go ahead with the project .
"" I thought - why not ? "" said Bergman , who added that the project was still in very preliminary stages .
Bergman , who made an Enron documentary called The Electric Cowboys , said he believed that the story had all the necessary ingredients for a movie .
"" There 'll be sex in the Enron movie , "" he said .
"" These guys were up to hi - jinks - this was a skyscraper filled with young men and young women and there are lots of stories of strippers in the building ...
But more to the point is that they had a kind of ideological belief system that did not accept that they could be wrong .
The only ones to question them were the women . ""
The forthcoming book , Power Failure by Mimi Swartz , is also seen as a potential basis for a film .
It features prominently the Enron whistle - blower Sherron Watkins who is one of the few people to have emerged well from the scandal so far .
It is being offered to film - makers as an excellent source by the ICM agency and Watkins is seen as a potential leading character .
The small screen is also interested in Enron projects .
CBS plans to make a television movie entitled The Crooked E which is based on the book , Anatomy of Greed , by a young Enron employee called Brian Cruver .
As the scandal unravels , more characters are emerging on whom the film could focus , with Kenneth Lay ( Gene Hackman ?
Jon Voight ? ) and his wife Linda likely to emerge as key characters .
Linda Lay has already had much small screen exposure , when she misguidedly took to the airwaves to say that her husband knew nothing of what was going wrong at the company and to proclaim that "" we 've lost everything "" - actually the Lays still had property and pay - offs amounting to more than $ 40 m .
While Hollywood is wary of such complex dramas , producers have been encouraged by the success of Erin Brockovich to believe that there is a market for stories about underdogs exposing the misbehaviour of big companies .
There are many potential titles available .
But perhaps one of the most appropriate for Enron , Secrets and Lies , has already been used by British director Mike Leigh ."
2002-03-19,"Andersen 's British operation today dismissed allegations of a coordinated destruction of documents at its London office as an "" outrageous smear "" .
John Ormerod , the managing partner of the stricken accountancy firm 's UK partnership , reacted angrily to suggestions that the London office was involved in the systematic shredding of Enron related papers .
At a press conference in London to discuss merger talks between Andersen 's European operations with rival accountancy firm KPMG , Mr Ormerod said : "" There was no destruction of material documents .
That is an outrageous smear on our practice .
We are moving on from that . ""
The London office has claimed that its destruction of Enron - related papers was part of a long - delayed and much - needed tidying up .
UK Andersen 's strong denials followed an indictment of Andersen in the US that has precipitated frantic efforts by the company 's European operations to find a merger partner and keep as much of the worldwide Andersen network intact .
The US justice department 's indictment last week said that the London office undertook coordinated destruction of documents just weeks before the spectacular collapse of Enron , once America 's seventh largest company .
Mr Ormerod told reporters that he was confident that Andersen 's European operations would not be exposed to any legal liabilities that may engulf Andersen in the US . ""
As far as the UK operation is concerned , it is separate from the US operation , "" Mr Ormerod said .
"" I see no basis why those [ liability ] questions should be raised . ""
On plans to merge with KPMG , Mr Ormerod said : "" Our two organisations complement each other well - both geographically and in people skills ...
We have been keen to maintain the integrity of as much of the Andersen network as well .
The proposed combination with KPMG achieves this . ""
A merger of the two would create a company with about 140,000 staff and $ 12.2bn in revenues outside the US .
Andersen , the smallest of the "" big five "" accountancy firms , currently has 85,000 employees and $ 9.3bn annual revenues worldwide .
KPMG has 100,000 staff and revenues of $ 11.7bn globally .
But any transaction faces the possibility of getting hit by Enron liabilities , by objections from competition regulators around the world and by the possibility that some national partnerships could decide to go it alone ."
2002-03-19,"The chairman of the press complaints commission , Lord Wakeham , is to be paid his full salary until he steps down from the organisation in September .
It was revealed yesterday that the Tory peer , who stepped aside on a temporary basis in January while his role in the Enron scandal was investigated , had asked to be released from his contract permanently .
Pressbof , the press watchdog 's funding body , said it had agreed "" with regret "" .
But the decision to allow Lord Wakeham to be paid his full salary , £ 156,000 a year , has raised eyebrows among some newspaper industry figures : the peer is not working for the PCC while his role as a director of the collapsed US energy giant is investigated by Senate committees in the US .
Pressbof will make an announcement on the peer 's successor on September 1 , the same day that Lord Wakeham will be released from his contract .
Until then , the PCC will continue to be run by its acting chairman , Professor Robert Pinker , who took the reins after Lord Wakeham stepped aside "" as a matter of honour "" on January 31 .
In the intervening seven months , Lord Wakeham will have been paid £ 91,000 for , officially at least , doing nothing .
The Tory peer was an £ 80,000-a - year non - executive director of Enron , and was facing pressure to answer questions about the energy firm 's multi - billion dollar bankruptcy .
He has since resigned as a director of the company , which is the subject of a series of investigations in the US .
It was widely expected that he would not return to his post , because the investigations into Enron could take years .
In a statement Pressbof paid tribute to Lord Wakeham , 69 , saying : "" The board wishes to record its appreciation of his outstanding contribution to self - regulation of the press over the past seven years . ""
The board also moved to shore up the position of Guy Black , the PCC director whose friendship with the News of the World editor
Rebekah Wade has been called into question .
Its statement read : "" Pressbof is confident that in the period until the new chairman is in position , the PCC under the competent and skilful guidance of its acting chairman , Professor Robert Pinker , and director Guy Black , will continue to provide a first - class service to the public and uphold the tough ethical code on which self - regulation of the press is based . ""
Pressbof yesterday began the process of finding a successor to Lord Wakeham .
Reports that the broadcaster Sue MacGregor was to be approached were dismissed as fanciful .
Other names mentioned include the data protection registrar , Elizabeth France , and the former Commons watchdog , Elizabeth Filkin .
But industry sources suggested the speculation was premature .
It is suggested that the PCC will need a robust chairman as its role comes under pressure from the encroaching influence of human rights legislation .
The selection process will be managed by a sub - committee of the Pressbof board , consisting of chairman Sir Harry Roche ; Jeremy Deedes , managing director of the Telegraph group ; David Newell , director of the Newspaper Society ; Robin Miller , chief executive of Emap ; and Grahame Thomson , secretary of Pressbof ."
2002-03-20,"The proposal is included in a discussion paper from the Association of British Insurers , which represents many of the biggest institional investors , in order to strengthen the audit process in the wake of the Enron scandal .
Other suggestions include forcing audit partners to be rotated every three to five years , rather than seven years , and making firms ' audit committees more accountable for ensuring that the process is fully independent .
However , the ABI has rejected some of the more draconian proposals that have been mooted since the Enron collapse - such as forcing firms to change their auditors every five years and banning auditors from also providing non - audit managment consultancy services . ""
Knee - jerk reactions would be dangerous , "" says the ABI in the paper , which was sent to the Treasury and the DTI yesterday .
"" There should be widespread and careful debate about any changes to make sure that they are genuine improvements . ""
The ABI 's institutional investors say it is "" not practicable "" to force audit work and non - audit consultancy services to be kept strictly separate and always awarded to different firms of advisers .
But they suggest that audit committees must be made far more accountable for ensuring audits are independent and that non - audit work goes to the right consultants .
The ABI plans to write to audit committees for explanations of how non - audit consultancy contracts are awarded ."

2002-03-22,"Although few positive things came out of the Enron scandal , the collapse of the US energy giant has played a key role in the breakthrough on campaign finance reform .
Enron poured money into the coffers of the Republican party - sprinkling some cash for the Democrats as well - and its ignominious fall gave a vital boost to those who have campaigned long and hard to clean up American politics .
Cash is king in US politics , and American politicians spend huge amounts of time and effort raising money to run for or retain office .
Office holders will openly boast about their war chests in order to frighten off potential challengers .
It does not always follow that those with the most cash end up in office , but it certainly can help .
Michael Huffington , the son of a rich Texas oilman , came close to defeating the popular Democrat , Dianne Feinstein , for a senate seat in California in 1994 after spending nearly $ 30 m ( £ 21 m ) of his own money .
He lost by just two points .
But more often than not , money talks .
Just look at Michael Bloomberg , who spent wads of money on his way to getting elected as the mayor of New York , ditto for Jon Corzine , who used a fortune accumulated as a partner at Goldman Sachs to win a senate seat in New Jersey .
The Centre for Responsive Politics , an invaluable source of facts and figures on money and American politics , calculated that money spent by candidates in the 2000 congressional and presidential elections soared to $ 3bn from $ 2.2bn in 1996 and $ 1.8bn in 1992 .
A large chunk of that financing comes in the form of "" soft money "" - unlimited contributions to the national political parties for "" party - building "" activities .
Now , thanks to the Shays - Meehan bill approved in the House and the McCain - Feingold bill in the Senate , America has moved closer to choking off soft money .
It 's not a done deal yet though .
President George Bush will probably sign the bill into law to wipe off the taint from Enron , but its opponents , led by Republican senator Mitch O'Connell of Kentucky , plan a legal challenge led by a team including Kenneth Star , the infamous prosecutor who led the Monica Lewinsky investigation .
That battle is set to head all the way to the supreme court .
But if the bill succeeds , the effort to ban soft money will have a big impact .
After all , the Democratic and Republican parties raised nearly $ 500 m dollars in soft money for the 2000 elections .
Because it may be given in unlimited amounts of $ 100,000 , $ 250,000 , or more , soft money allows corporations , unions , and wealthy individuals to wield tremendous influence that will now be curbed .
That still leaves hard money , the cash that goes directly to candidates .
Under the new rules , individuals will be able to give $ 2,000 to a candidate , rather than $ 1,000 .
Likewise , the maximum aggregate amount an individual donor can give to all candidates and party committees will go up from the current $ 25,000 per year to $ 95,000 per two - year election cycle .
The super - donors will become extinct , but a new class of mid - sized donors is expected to emerge .
The changes will benefit the Republicans , as they are masters at hard money fundraising thanks to a vast network of small to mid - sized donors .
The Republicans ' mailing list produces millions of dollars every year .
That was why soft money assumed such importance for the Democrats , as it gave them a way to fight back in the fundraising stakes .
Luckily for the Democrats , they have a chairman , Terry McAuliffe , who is supposed to be the most prolific fundraiser in Democratic history .
With soft money on its way out , the big donors can be expected to shift their attention to the state level , where there is less scrutiny of their activities .
Some states have no limits at all on contributions to state committees , and many have much looser rules on who can donate - companies and unions can , for example .
All that should not detract from the fact that advocates of campaign finance reform have won a famous victory - the first major change to campaign finance since the Watergate scandal .
It just took another scandal to help things along ."
2002-03-22,"You do not have to listen hard to hear the sound of a dead man walking in the City .
Arthur Andersen was once one of the Five Friends , the group of world 's biggest accountancy firms .
It is now walking slowly into oblivion for its part in the collapse of the US energy giant Enron .
But Andersen could now live again , revived by its former acquaintances who appear happy to marry the non - US bits of the firm with their own operations .
The plan to merge the operations of KPMG and the parts of Andersen that Enron did not reach would create a firm with revenues of $ 16bn , making it the second largest accountant in the world .
Such a prospect has rightly brought baleful glances from regulators .
And no wonder .
Accountancy is a profession that has grown much bigger than many of the companies it serves .
The Five Friends combined global revenue tops $ 65bn and , to thoughtful critics of globalisation such as the New Economics Foundation , they represent a sinister , unaccountable concentration of corporate power .
In fact , Enron has highlighted the fact that accountants appear willing to do whatever their clients want - whether that means shredding documents or producing misleading balance sheets .
What should be done ?
Accountancy in Britain needs to be rescued by radical reform , like that suggested by the Financial Services Authority watchdog or through a recommendation from competition authorities .
Auditors need to be able challenge their clients .
That could be done by forcing companies to rotate auditors frequently , say , every three years .
Also , accountants need to separate their activities .
Accountancy firms face conflicts of interests by having lawyers who offer opinions to companies where they are also collecting consultancy and auditing fees .
Perhaps auditors should disclose all contracts they have with their customer .
In extreme circumstances , they should be forced to sell services that hinder their ability to audit without being compromised .
But it is in a global sense that the biggest changes are required .
The biggest accountancy firms sprawl across national boundaries and more cooperation between the US and European regulators is needed to offer a coherent regulatory framework .
Big Accountancy should not end up like other global industries such as oil or pharmeuticals .
Auditing needs to be tamed before it becomes too large for governments to control easily ."
2002-03-24,"Can masters of the universe catch Enronitis ?
It is a question growing louder each day as the fallout from the world 's biggest bankruptcy spreads around the globe .
With Andersen , Enron 's accountants , on the critical list and Wall Street looking decidedly sick for its part in ramping Enron stock , questions are being asked about whether McKinsey is about to suffer collateral damage .
Enron is the house that McKinsey rebuilt .
The brightest minds at the world 's most prestigious consulting firm helped turn the lumbering old - economy gas distribution dinosaur into a new - economy success story envied by every corporation in America .
The transformation earned the McKinsey mob a strong following in Enron . '
I found them very bright thinkers and just good people , ' recalls former Enron employee John Allario , founder of the satirical Enron site Laydoff.com . '
They took a very objective view of business .
They could gauge the potential for success or failure pretty quickly . '
McKinsey thinking helped Enron switch , seemingly overnight , from being a company that simply piped stuff around the US to a giant market place in which companies could ' cherry pick ' commodities such as oil and gas contracts , seeking out new suppliers and cheaper prices over the web .
Enron made its money from trading on their behalf and offering a range of additional high - margin services , which brought in far greater returns than its old , vertically integrated model of producing and shipping gas .
McKinsey called the process ' atomising ' .
In one of its influential quarterly reviews it gushed : ' Enron has built a reputation as one of the world 's most innovative companies by attacking and atomising traditional industry structures .
Enron no longer produces oil and gas in the US , no longer owns an electric utility , and has never held a large investment in telecom networks .
Yet it is a leading value creator in each of these industries . '
Margins stretched massively , and Enron revenues exploded .
During the first nine months of 2000 , Enron profits rose by 45 per cent to $ 919 million as revenues doubled to $ 60 billion .
It was consistently voted one of the most admired companies in the world - and one of the best to work for .
Even the staff 's daily Starbucks ' fix was subsidised .
But no one was allowed to rest on their laurels .
Each year Enron 's combative chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , a Harvard Business School graduate who worked for McKinsey between 1979 and 1990 , would hire 250 MBA graduates .
And each year the lowest - performing fifth would be ruthlessly jettisoned , a practice known as ' rank or yank ' .
Those who remained were given the freedom to invent ingenious new ways of maximising profits .
It was a McKinsey way of working , based on the consultancy 's belief in the ' loose - tight ' management model , which decreed that certain aspects of the business , like budgets , should be kept under central control while staff should be given a huge amount of freedom to ' think outside the box ' .
There were mistakes , but as Skilling observed : ' No shots , no ducks ' .
Such thinking was based on the seminal management book
In Search of Excellence by former McKinsey employees Tom Peters and Bob Waterman .
Enron employees read it avidly .
They were also big fans of another book , The War for Talent , by McKinsey consultants Ed Michaels , Helen Handfield - Jones and Beth Axelrod , which used Enron as a textbook example of how to incentivise staff .
The ideas germinated . '
Skilling brought in a lot of McKinsey employees and the cream of the Harvard Business School , ' says Julian Birkinshaw , associate professor of strategic and international management at the London Business School . '
The processes and principles he allowed were very McKinsey .
The consultants used Enron as their sandbox . '
McKinsey declined to talk about its relationship with Enron other than to confirm it was a client .
However it is known that McKinsey used the firm on 20 different projects .
In addition , one senior McKinsey partner , Richard Foster , author of yet another Enron bible , Creative Destruction , is reported to have attended six Enron board meetings between October 2000 and October 2001 .
Questions are also being asked about the ties between Enron and a former McKinsey consultant , now commissioner with the Texas - based company 's chief regulator .
It has emerged that Brett Perlman , who was appointed a commissioner of the Texas Public Utility Regulator by George W Bush , worked for McKinsey for five years , during which time he helped Enron build its electronic trading system .
Enron and McKinsey also appeared together at prestigious energy conferences - such as the annual Interactive Energy jamboree in Houston - with the former talking about how it was transforming its business model while the latter talked about how such moves would pay huge dividends .
Enron 's faith in McKinsey surprises few management experts . '
McKinsey has a reputation for having the smartest , brightest people , ' Birkinshaw says . '
Some of the other consultancies are into relatively standardised offerings , but over the past few years the fresh ideas are coming out of McKinsey . '
The links between the two go back to at least the mid-1980s , when the power giant was created through the merger of InterNorth and Houston Natural Gas .
McKinsey and Skilling , then its head of energy consulting , advised Enron on how to smooth gas prices through the creation of forward contracts .
This was the first step in Enron 's journey to become America 's biggest gas and oil trader .
Chief executive Kenneth Lay was so impressed he brought Skilling into the company , with a remit to think the unthinkable .
But the loose - tight culture McKinsey and Skilling engendered carried the seeds of its own destruction .
The pressure to continue the Enron transformation success story created new tensions .
Says Birkinshaw : ' It ratcheted up the risk - reward potential .
People could get phenomenally rich , but they did n't see the by - product .
If you give people a lot of money , they will break the rules .
They will bend the margins where nobody is going to look . '
It appears McKinsey did try to rein in some of Enron 's more unrealistic ambitions , but with little success . '
McKinsey people at Enron fell out of favour with certain Enron business leads , ' says former employee Allario . '
I heard McKinsey contributed greatly to the early establishment of a good portion of the broadband division .
Once the business gained momentum , most of their ideas were ignored in favour of current Enron management directives .
It may have been that Enron listened only when it suited them . '
Scores of McKinseyites , among them David Berberian , managing director of Enron Networks , and Stephen Abbanat , a director with its broadband division , left Enron to join start - ups as the giant started to stumble .
So far McKinsey has managed to distance itself from the Enron débcle .
The 7,000- strong partnership has consistently denied that it gave Enron advice on financing issues or that it had suspicions the company was using improper accounting methods .
Nor has it been summoned before the Department of Justice to explain its role .
But Enronitis is virulent .
As Allario says : ' Enron has become the laughing stock of the entire world .
It has become a detriment to have it on your resumé . '
McKinsey might agree ."
2002-03-25,"Cynthia Price Arden was due to become a partner at Arthur Andersen in September this year , the result of more than a decade at the accountancy firm 's New York offices .
It is a goal she now fears she will never reach as the embattled accountancy firm fights for survival against criminal charges related to the collapse of energy group Enron and a reputation that lies in tatters .
"" I joined from campus as soon as I graduated , "" Ms Price Arden , 33 , said .
"" Andersen is all I 've ever known .
This is personally very disappointing , to have worked so hard for almost 12 years and then have the rug pulled from beneath me .

This will affect me dramatically .

It 's a tough job market out there . ""
Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker detailed a rescue plan for Andersen on Friday which would involve removing senior management and criminal charges being dropped .
While lawyers battle it out in court , the firm has begun to mobilise potentially its best weapon .
The firm 's 26,000 US staff are being encouraged to deluge lawmakers with letters and emails and draw attention to lives that will be affected if Andersen goes under .

2002-03-27,"Joseph Berardino , chief executive of the global accounting firm , Andersen , resigned yesterday in the wake of criminal charges and loss of clients because of its involvement in the bankrupt energy trading company , Enron .
Mr Berardino yesterday denied any top management involvement in the shredding of Enron documents by its auditors in Texas .
He described his resignation as a "" sacrifice "" intended to save the careers of Andersen employees .
The chief executive , who joined the company in 1972 , said he would stay on for "" a few days "" while the board chooses a replacement .
His announcement came four days after a former Federal Reserve chairman , Paul Volcker , urged senior Andersen executives to step aside to allow the appointment of a new , independent board .
The company hopes that the appointment of a new board together with full cooperation would persuade the US justice department to drop its indictment of the firm , which threatens Andersen with bankruptcy .
Speaking to CNN , Mr Berardino said : "" We 're in deep straits .
There 's no question about it .
I ca n't begin to predict what the justice depart ment will do .
I would n't have thought they would have indicted us , given the fact that we self - reported , we were so forthcoming .
"" I 'm speaking out in the loudest way I know how to with my resignation , saying we can be a positive force in this market , if people let us . ""
Asked whether the accounting firm would go bankrupt , he said : "" We 've got a US management team that 's looking at every option in terms of how we might go forward .
And clearly that has to be included as an alternative , but it 's certainly not where we want to go . """
2002-03-27,"The resignation yesterday of Joseph Berardino , the chief executive of international accounting giant Andersen , was by his own admission an attempt to save the company by offering up a sacrificial lamb for its document - shredding involvement in the Enron scandal .
However , analysts today were unconvinced that his gesture would convince justice department officials to cancel the criminal charges facing the company after employees shred thousands of Enron documents at its Houston offices .
Andersen has admitted that its employees destroyed documents sought by federal investigators after its former client , Houston - based energy company Enron , collapsed in December .
The company argued that the employees were acting on their own , not following policy from headquarters .
In the immediate aftermath of the Enron scandal , the company sacked David Duncan , an Andersen partner based in its Houston offices who the company blamed for the shredding .
His head did not satisfy the justice department .
In January Mr Berardino attempted to salvage the firm 's reputation by issuing reassurances that the document shredding at Enron was a one - off , not company policy .
He said : "" What was done was not in keeping with the values and heritage of this firm .
It was wrong .
There 's no other word for it .
But 85,000 people did not work on the Enron engagement .
85,000 people did not destroy documents .
And 85,000 people did not encourage anyone to destroy those documents . ""
Mr Berardino , 52 , only took over as CEO in January 2001 , and he said yesterday that he hoped his resignation would allow former federal reserve chairman Paul Volcker to form an independent board to take the company forward .
However , Enron was not the only client that Andersen 's auditing unit stands accused of protecting with dodgy accounting practices .
Under Mr Berardino 's two - year watch as head of Andersen 's US audit practice , the company was forced to settle serious cases of alleged auditing irregularities .
One former client , Waste Management , has been under investigation for by the SEC for four years .
In court documents filed yesterday , the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) alleged that Waste Management executives inflated company earnings by $ 1.7bn , a move that cost shareholders $ 6bn when Wall Street discovered the truth and share prices plummeted .
The SEC sued Andersen last June , alleging it issued false and misleading audit reports that inflated Waste Management 's earnings from 1993 to 1996 .
Andersen agreed to pay a $ 7 m civil fine to settle the suit , without admitting to or denying the allegations .
With or without the criminal charges , the aura of sleaze has cost the company dear .
Andersen has been haemorrhaging high profile clients since December : Federal Express , Delta Airlines , pharmaceuticals company Merck , and housing finance group Freddie Mac have all switched auditors , and a total of 70 clients have defected .
Andersen maintains this is a small percentage of its 100,000-strong worldwide client base , but the fear is that as the big names jump ship , others will follow .
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the company is pressing ahead with talks to sell the non - audit parts of the US business to rivals KPMG and Delloite and Touche .
The paper reckons the deal could bring in between $ 1bn and $ 5bn .
As Mr Berardino noted , in the end the company has a duty of care to the thousands of employees who had nothing to do with Enron or any other auditing irregularity .
The justice department does not .
There is the off chance that his resignation can stave off damaging criminal prosecution , and he owed it to those employees to try ."
2002-03-27,"The relationship between the White House and the energy industry , including bankrupt trader Enron , came under further scrutiny yesterday .
As the first wave of documents related to the formation of the Bush administration 's energy policy were released , it emerged that 10 of the United States ' largest oil and gas groups gave more than $ 20 m ( £ 14 m ) to politicians between 1999 and 2002 .
Enron , which contributed $ 3.4 m , led the league of donations .
Three other companies donated more than $ 2 m - Southern , Chevron Texaco and El Paso .
BP , which has since announced that it intends to end such donations , spent $ 1.7 m over the three years .
Vice - president Dick Cheney 's energy task force has been under pressure to reveal which groups it met ahead of the publication of its energy policy on May 16 last year .
The task force devised a strategy of increasing US energy production to reduce reliance on foreign oil and prompted controversy because of proposals to drill in an Alaskan wildlife refuge .
The initial review of the 11,000 documents appeared to support claims of Democrat lawmakers and environmental groups that the task force had bowed to the industry .
Early documents released showed that US energy secretary Spencer Abraham met with 36 energy industry representatives but no consumer or conservation groups in preparing the policy .
A separate inquiry from the House energy and commerce committee has asked for details of contacts between Enron executives , including Lord Wakeham , and the White House ."
2002-03-30,"Centrica , the gas and electricity supplier that trades as British Gas , has ditched plans to take over a former Enron business in America after failing to secure court assurances that it would not be responsible for liabilities which might stem from Enron 's collapse .
The group , which is keen to expand in the US through acquisition , announced plans to buy NewPower Holdings in a $ 130 m ( £ 91 m ) deal last month .
Acquisition of the business , 40 % owned by the bankrupt energy trader , would have given it 650,000 residential and small business power customers in states such as Texas , Michigan , Ohio and Georgia .
Centrica made the offer conditional on NewPower being freed from any tax and pension liabilities that might arise from the time it was a wholly owned Enron subsidiary .
It decided to abandon the takeover when Enron 's bankruptcy judge refused to provide such protection at a hearing in New York this week .
Despite pulling out of the offer to buy the company , Centrica still hopes to build up its US presence by acquiring some of the NewPower assets .
It said the court room setback had not deterred it from seeking further expansion in America .
"" We remain committed to developing our business in the US , "" said a company spokeswoman .
"" We believe there are a number of accelerated opportunities as a result of changes taking place in the market there . """
2002-04-04,"A high - profile body charged with setting the government 's views on accounting policy after the collapse of Enron has yet to meet , despite its existence being announced by trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt two months ago .
The group was billed as uniting ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry and Treasury with representatives from professional regulator the Accountancy Foundation and the financial services authority , the City watchdog , to address any issues arising from Enron that may "" question the integrity of markets "" .
While officials are unable to confirm that a date for the body 's first meeting has even been set , it became clear yesterday that regulatory authorities in the US are taking strenuous steps to learn the lessons from the collapse of Enron .
US financial regulators have begun an unprecedented crackdown on accounting fraud with a near - threefold increase in investigations so far this year .
The securities and exchange commission , the US financial watchdog , said yesterday it had begun investigations into 49 companies in the first two months of the year , broadening the scope of investigations into some of Wall Street 's biggest companies .
That contrasts with 18 investigations in the first two months of 2001 .
The US investigators have moved beyond problems highlighted by Enron to arcane accounting practices that have flourished in recent years .
Among the issues raised by Enron 's collapse were ways companies could hide the true extent of their debt and the way they valued certain trading positions .
Although Enron was a US company , Ms Hewitt said when she announced the new body in a speech to industry leaders at the Mansion House in February , that the scale of the Enron collapse required a review of the UK 's financial reporting and auditing rules .
The DTI said yesterday efforts were being made to convene the first meeting , perhaps by the end of the month , and it would have a remit to "" overview "" the accounting industry .
No single UK body has a similar remit to the SEC in the US .
A number of organisations including the DTI and the finan cial reporting review panel cover that ground .
Accounting standards are also different between the US and Britain .
The DTI is charged under the Companies Act with reviewing the way big firms present accounts .
Its company investigation board is not believed to have increased its workload in that area .
This contrasts with the more legalistic US approach , which is said to help explain the higher number of investigations . ""
Every year we have had progressively more financial fraud cases , "" said Charles Niemeier , head of accounting at the SEC 's enforcement division .
"" That is not the big story .
The bigger story is the size of the companies being investigated .
We are investigating more Fortune 500 companies than we ever have .
"" The more intense scrutiny is designed to restore investor confidence after Enron but it has thrown a long shadow over Wall Street .
The watchdog , which normally carries out spot checks on only a few companies ' annual report filings , is trawling through all Fortune 500 firms in the US this year to ensure there are no other Enron - type surprises in the balance sheets .

2002-04-06,"John Kenneth Galbraith can not conceal a twinge of satisfaction after the collapse of the American energy giant , Enron , and the hundreds of millions of dollars lost by the Allied Irish Bank through fraudulent trading .
Author of the long - time best - seller The Affluent Society , and one of the sternest critics of American capitalism , he feels the human tragedy for employees and investors who have lost their savings .
But the broader lessons vindicate everything he has been saying for more than half a century .
Galbraith 's strong support for the public sector went out of fashion during the Reagan revolution which made a fetish of small government and deregulation .
After Enron , people may re - examine his views .
"" We need , and surely will have , an end to freedom from regulation and at least some of the oratory of the magic of free enterprise "" , he prophesies .
Now 93 , the grand old man of American political economy is still hammering away despite weakening health .
He was putting the finishing touches to a new book , The Economics Of Innocent Fraud , due out this autumn , when the Enron catastrophe hit , providing , as he sees it , the perfect example of his general thesis .
By "" innocent "" he means beyond the reach of law .
He thought of changing the title but has decided to stick with it "" because we can still have serious trouble from the doctrine that has cloaked the corporate world "" .
"" One of the most questionable distinctions in our time is that between the public and private sectors .
It has concealed the extent to which the private sector , particularly corporate management , has moved to take over or otherwise nullify public responsibility , "" he says .
"" In the Enron disaster there was enormous misappropriation of company funds , especially by executives , and a major financial threat to all stock - holders .
There was also the cooperative acquiescence of the supposedly independent accountants .
Public surveillance simply did not serve "" .
None of Galbraith 's Enron allegations has been the subject of any prosecution .
Galbraith has always seen fit to go beyond his special field of economics and comment on a wide range of public issues , usually in entertaining or ironic language .
He is one of the few members of the American elite who has dared to utter some criticism of Washington 's "" war on terrorism "" .
America 's response to September 11 and the Taliban "" seems on the whole to have been appropriate "" , he says , before cracking "" If you are choosing an enemy it should be one without an army , navy , air force and effectively without government or civilian order .
I confess I never imagined a war almost without military casualties - much better than the Somme . ""
Galbraith hopes that Americans might be beginning to take the view that suicide bombers are not just thugs : "" There has been a new consciousness of the religious commitment .
This has been extensively disguised by the word terrorism , "" he argues .
A forceful opponent of the Vietnam war , he believes the United States is getting too deeply engaged , which creates fear in and fear of America .
He was a tenured professor at Harvard for more than 50 years and has commuted between academia and government , advising many American presidents starting with Franklin Roosevelt and going on to John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson .
If the 20th century was the American century , Galbraith can claim to have had one of its most extraordinary careers .
He was long known as America 's leading public intellectual until a trite recent book by Richard Posner , an American judge , reduced the category to people most frequently mentioned on websites .
Even then , Galbraith is only one of two living economists to get into the top 100 ( the other is Milton Friedman ) .
But Posner was right to say that academic over - specialisation has left too many of America 's brightest people afraid to speak their minds , leaving the field to celebrity sound - bite merchants .
Not Galbraith , though he is less in public demand nowadays .
His health is weak and he was recently in hospital for pneumonia .
The voice has cracked , and like some people with hearing aids he tends to shout .
He did not tower above his guests ' distinguished heads in his usual Olympian way last year at the annual garden party he gives with his wife on the lawn of their large rambling wooden house in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
After a series of falls and bone fractures , the 6 ft 7 inch giant held court from a chair .
By common consent in Harvard , the party is high up in the university 's social calendar , so when he says with characteristic immodesty "" if we did n't have it , they 'd come anyway "" , you can believe it .
Galbraith began his career as a young administrator in the 1930s New Deal .
He ran the successful system of price control in the second world war . ""
Every afternoon I had a delegation of well - groomed men , making more money than they had ever made before , coming to say how poor they were and how they needed higher prices , "" he recalls .
His only problem was choosing the moment to step in and "" stop the bullshit .
I became probably the most unpopular person in the United States , "" he grins .
These experiences , plus his Keynesian belief in tax - and - spend policies , gave rise to a series of books in the 1950s on managerial capitalism and the unacceptable gap between "" private affluence and public squalor "" .
When John F Kennedy was elected president in 1960 Galbraith turned down the chance to be an economic administrator again , opting instead to be ambassador in India , the foreign country he loves most .
From New Delhi he bombarded the president with astonishingly forthright letters about economic and foreign policy .
David Halberstam , the journalist who chronicled the Kennedy years in his book The Best
And The Brightest ( Fawcett , 2001 ) , almost runs out of epithets in describing Galbraith : ""
He 's lion - hearted .
He 's a warrior .
He 's invincible , vibrant , as vital as ever .
He 's funny , tart , and sceptical all at the same time "" .
Galbraith has always had a controversial reputation among academic economists and never won the Nobel prize for economics , but he is lavishly praised by many who did . ""
His is an artistic , speculative mind .
He sets up hypotheses which go beyond the data , and some of the greatest scholars in history have been of that type , "" says Professor Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Harvard 's neighbour and rival , author of a famous textbook for undergraduate economists .
"" Part of Galbraith 's strength is that he writes well .
Some economists believe writing well is a defect that creates too much spurious impact on thought .
If it 's a crime , it 's not one that many of my profession are guilty of . ""
The Nobel economics prize - winner Amartya Sen , Master of Trinity College , Cambridge , calls Galbraith "" the most widely read economist in the world "" , adding "" he does n't get enough praise .
The Affluent Society is a great insight , and has become so much a part of our understanding of contemporary capitalism that we forget where it began .
It 's like reading Hamlet and deciding it 's full of quotations .
You realise where they came from , "" Sen says .
Galbraith 's reputation has always been highest outside the academic world .
For a man who deliberately chose to enter the public arena rather than bury himself in teaching or research this is the greatest accolade , especially now that new entrants to the field continue to recognise his influence .
Thea Lee , the bright mid-30s chief economist of America 's trade union movement , the AFL - CIO , says "" He inspired and encouraged my generation to look more critically at the neo - classical model and the role of economic and political power .
He has always been supportive of a younger generation of activists and critical thinkers .
""
When Naomi Klein , the young Canadian star of the anti - globalisation protests , interviewed Galbraith , whom she calls a hero of hers , she found it sad that he did not seem to realise his views were catching on again .
"" I told him you 've got to stop getting your information from the New York Times and other mainstream media .
Something really big is happening internationally .
I told him his questioning of GDP and the laws of trickle - down economics are being adopted by the new movements . ""
Galbraith , like Klein , is Canadian .
Born in Ontario on October 15 1908 , the second of four children , Galbraith 's father was a teacher and farmer as well as being active in local politics on the shores of Lake Erie .
A flat , dry , forested region , it was settled by people invariably known as the Scotch .
Their Calvinist life - style was matched by a deeply cultivated reserve , and Galbraith describes them as "" notably wary of any person who allowed his emotions to rule him "" .
His book on the Scotch is being republished this year .
True to type , the chapters in his autobiography that he devoted to his childhood and adolescence as well as to his wife and children are terse .
He describes nature more fully than his loved ones .
He is tight - lipped on his own emotional development .
At school he was clearly bright but useless at games , including basketball , in spite of being unusually tall .
He had two tragedies in his early life , but you would not know the depth of them from his book : his mother died when he was 14 , and his father was killed when a car in which he was a passenger was hit by a train at an unmanned level crossing .
Galbraith was doing research in England at the time and could not afford to return for the funeral .
His first college degree , in agricultural economics , was from Ontario Agricultural College , part of Guelph University , and a place he once described as "" the cheapest and possibly the worst in the English - speaking world "" .
His life changed when he saw a note on the board advertising scholarships at the University of California in Berkeley , already a hotbed of radical ideas .
"" It was the depths of the great depression , and among my student - colleagues there were no defenders of the system , "" he growls now .
"" There were one or two we knew about , but they were regarded as eccentric .
You were either a socialist or a communist . ""
During the McCarthyite hysteria after the war , Galbraith was never summoned to testify about his political past .
It has sometimes been suggested the anti - communists on Capitol Hill feared his rapier wit .
On this point Galbraith does not boast : "" It was the result of a lifelong exercise of personal caution .
I had a sense that being a socialist was somehow safer than being a communist .
That saved me from the examination that would later have come from McCarthy , "" he admits .
The FBI prepared a file on him , but the only allegation of note came , ironically , from Arthur Roosevelt , a rightwing dissident relative of the late president , and there was no corroboration .
Galbraith first went to Washington in 1934 to take a summer job in the agricultural adjustment administration , one of the most radical government departments .
Still keen on university life , he moved to Harvard as a lecturer in the autumn .
In 1937 he went to England to study under Keynes , but the great economist had just had his first heart attack and was away for the whole year .
Shortly before taking the boat for Southampton , Galbraith married Catherine Atwater and took out American citizenship .
Catherine had graduated from Smith College and took an MA in comparative literature at Radcliffe before later lecturing in languages at Harvard .
Dropping his Canadian passport was no big deal .
"" It never bothered me more than five minutes , "" he says , though he still sometimes calls himself a Canadian and is proud to have been one of only two non - citizens to get the country 's highest award , the Order of Canada .
He is equally proud that his father advocated the parliamentary resolution in Ottawa that called on the King not to confer any more knighthoods on Canadians .
Galbraith remembers explaining his change of citizenship at a press conference in Canada :
"" When I graduated I had the choice between spending my life in the heavy disciplined labour of an Ontario farm or a leisurely academic existence in California - and I do not think any member of this press corps would not have taken the same decision . ""
He has no hesitation in saying his life 's most significant contribution was not his books but his work as deputy head of the office of price administration , one of the most interventionist departments in the history of American government .
Maximum prices were set and only at the OPA 's discretion could they be raised .
The aim was not just to control inflation but to allocate resources to war industries by holding down , for example , the price of cars so that manufacturers would prefer to invest in tanks and aircraft .
Beginning with a staff of seven , the OPA ended with 15,000 . ""
In the first world war prices doubled in two years .
In the second world war prices were virtually stable through the whole period , "" Galbraith says .
Business resistance never slackened and its criticism gradually had an effect on Roosevelt , whose support for OPA dwindled .
Galbraith 's boss was sacked and he himself left in 1943 , exhausted .
As the war reached its end , Galbraith got a new government job as director of the US strategic bombing survey .
The purpose was to analyse the effect of American bombing and , in a result which was to become equally relevant in the Vietnam war , he and his team concluded that the air attacks "" were a major failure , considering all the lives and costs that had gone into them "" .
In 1945 he was one of the first to interview Albert Speer , Hitler 's armaments minister , who boasted of Germany 's "" armaments miracle "" .
Galbraith concluded , however , there had been massive teutonic inefficiency and that the German system had been in many ways less productive than that of the allies .
He saw Speer as "" a very intelligent escapist from the truth "" .
One member of Galbraith 's survey team was the British economist , Nicholas Kaldor , in whose house he later wrote large chunks of The Affluent Society .
Another was Paul Baran , one of the United States ' most distinguished Marxists .
Despite his caution on ideological choices , Galbraith was always relaxed about those he employed or associated with .
Galbraith was later given a job advising the post - war administrations in Germany and Japan .
This produced his withering crack about the American overlords in each country , Generals Lucius Clay and Douglas Macarthur : "" Clay was not impressed with my guidance in economic affairs , and Macarthur may not have been aware of it . ""
There followed a job with Fortune magazine , part of the stable , along with Time and Life , of the rightwing magnate Henry Luce .
Galbraith says it helped sharpen his writing .
He later criticised his hero , Keynes , for the "" almost unique unreadability of The General Theory Of Employment , Interest , And Money .
As Messiahs go , Keynes was deeply dependent on his prophets . ""
Galbraith returned to Harvard in 1948 but only got tenure after the economics department threatened to resign en masse when conservatives on the board of overseers tried to block him .
Already in his 40s , Galbraith had not yet written a book .
In 1950 came the greatest personal tragedy for Galbraith and his wife : their eldest son , Douglas , died at the age of seven .
Galbraith has never spoken at any length about the experience of seeing his boy slowly succumb to leukaemia , but Richard Parker , an Oxford - trained economist who is writing Galbraith 's biography , believes the horror made him bounce back with creative energy . ""
Galbraith is a man of enormous repression when it comes to personal pain .
Perhaps the pain gave him a new impulse , "" he suggests .
Whether this theory of private grief and public eloquence is right , it is certainly the case that Galbraith plunged into a fury of writing .
His first book A Theory Of Price Control was short .
It had little effect and he told friends he would never again place himself "" at the mercy of technical economists who had the enormous power to ignore what I had written .
I set out to involve a larger community . ""
A few months later came American Capitalism , then a book on the great crash of 1929 , and finally The Affluent Society .
The central concept of American Capitalism was "" countervailing power "" .
It was already accepted , at least outside a narrow band of classical economists , that perfect competition did not exist .
The notion that companies which charged high prices would be undercut by competitors had faltered in the face of oligopoly , where a few large companies could control prices .
Galbraith 's novelty was to argue that "" power on one side of a market creates both the need for , and the prospect of reward to , the exercise of countervailing power from the other side "" .
Strong corporations eventually begat strong unions which could bargain for higher wages .
Strong suppliers also begat strong buyers in the form of the powerful retail chains like Sears Roebuck which could switch their business if companies charged too much .
Countervailing power was a kind of regulator , and the role of the state was to know when and how to support its development .
In The Affluent Society he criticised the cult of consumerism and explained how advertising and marketing created artificially high demand , leading to a "" dependence effect "" among consumers .
Another result was the neglect of public sec tor goods .
The book also invented the phrase "" the conventional wisdom "" in chapters that showed how liberals and conservatives clung to ideas which had become out - of - date
but no one dared challenge .
"" Familiarity may breed contempt in some areas of human behaviour but in the field of social ideas it is the touchstone of acceptability , "" he wrote at the start of a passage criticising earlier economists .
The New Industrial State devised the concept of a "" techno - structure "" to describe the chain of specialists , including market analysts , pollsters , promoters and designers , who indirectly control corporations by creating the environment in which investment decisions are made .
He argues that they turn managers into virtual robots in a system in which no one has the power to understand where a string of decisions is leading .
Galbraith had become a leading light in the Democratic party , and it was natural that he became one of the first advisers to Massachusetts Senator John Kennedy in his presidential bid .
He wrote the candidate a series of letters and memos , later published , which were astonishingly frank .
After one speech he told Kennedy : "" When it comes to oratorical flights and rhetoric , you give a reasonable imitation of a bird with a broken wing .
You do get off the ground
but it 's wearing on the audience to keep wondering if you are going to stay up . ""
Kennedy was not upset and Galbraith was asked to give advice for his inaugural speech .
He produced key phrases such as Kennedy 's pledge never to negotiate out of fear but never to fear to negotiate , as well as the promise of aid to developing countries "" not to defeat communism , not to win votes , but because it is right "" .
When Kennedy won the election , Galbraith surprised many of his friends by not wanting to chair the president 's council of economic advisers .
True to the view , which he still holds , that income tax must be strongly progressive , he opposed Kennedy 's tax cut proposal .
Instead , he asked to become ambassador to India , a country where he had spent months as an adviser , but warned Kennedy he would send him regular letters of advice on a range of issues .
A fierce opponent of the state department bureaucracy as well as being no admirer of its boss , Dean Rusk , Galbraith told the president he wanted to be able to have direct access . ""
Communicating through the department would be like fornicating through the mattress "" , he wrote .
The Galbraiths loved their time in India .
They travelled widely in the subcontinent and Catherine co - authored a book , India
Now And Through Time , with an Indian colleague .
Galbraith visited South Vietnam and strongly urged Kennedy not to send American troops there .
He urged him to adopt a "" rational , non - militarist policy "" toward Vietnam and other countries in the Third World , arguing that communism was not as serious a threat as US propaganda claimed .
It followed that he broke with Lyndon Johnson on the issue and spoke for the radical anti - war candidate Eugene McCarthy at the Democratic convention in 1968 .
This , plus his strong support for George McGovern in the 1972 election , meant he was sidelined when the Democratic party finally regained the White House with Jimmy Carter in 1976 .
By the time of Clinton 's election in 1992 Galbraith was too old for a government job .
Now , apart from occasional assisted walks round the lawn , he rarely leaves home .
Most of the time he half - sits and half - lies upstairs in a chair which he can control with a button .
He comes upright for photographs , explaining "" I want to fool people to the extent that they do n't think I 'm an invalid "" .
He spends his summers with his wife on a farm in Vermont which they bought half a century ago .
Two of their three sons continue in their father 's footsteps : James is a professor in the department of government at the University of Texas ; Peter was US ambassador in Croatia at the height of the Bosnian war ; Alan , the eldest , is a lawyer in Washington .
In retirement Galbraith has continued in articles , speeches , and books to argue for strong government , progressive taxes and public spending .
He is not a "" Third Way "" man .
He ridiculed the Reaganite trickle - down theory of wealth distribution , preferring the earthier phrase "" the horse - and - sparrow theory "" - "" If you feed the horse enough oats , some will pass through to the road for the sparrows . ""
He welcomes the progress by which most Americans can enjoy decent lives but points out that this "" culture of contentment "" replaces the old dialectic of capital versus labour with a new one - now it is the rich and comfortable versus the concerned and the poor , and since many of the poor do not vote , democracy becomes "" a democracy of the fortunate "" .
A man as outspoken and high - profile as Galbraith was bound to have many critics , and not only from the the right .
Paul Samuelson , a longtime friend and supporter who used his presidential address at the American Economic Association in 1961 to chide fellow economists for not paying enough attention to Galbraith , says Galbraith 's view of managerial capitalism was overtaken by the 1980s .
The wave of hostile take - overs and corporate mergers has produced an older , rougher form of capitalism with very little "" countervailing power "" , Samuelson says .
He also points out that the number of PhD students Galbraith advised "" can be counted on one hand "" , in contrast with Milton Friedman , the arch - monetarist from Chicago , who shaped at least 50 theses and created a Friedmanite school .
Robert Solow , a Nobel economics prizewinner , acknowledges that people needed to be made to stand back and ensure some reality test was passed "" but I wish Galbraith did n't feel obligated to make fun of academic economists "" .
Galbraith has also been attacked for not being sufficiently rigorous or mathematical .
The fact remains that his tax - and - spend ideas have been eclipsed over the past 20 years .
He was disappointed they were not taken up by the most recent Democratic president , Bill Clinton .
Robert Reich , who was secretary of labour during Clinton 's first term , says "" In today 's world Galbraith would be called a social democrat or a socialist , and there are no social democrats in America now . ""
Galbraith himself says he is a "" liberal democrat "" .
Charles Derber , sociology professor at Boston College and author of Corporation Nation , one of the best critiques of contemporary American capitalism , says "" Galbraith is the symbol of the L - word : liberalism is the thing which everyone in the Republican party , and most people in the Democratic party , want to bury .
Beyond the political parties the right sees it as dead ; the left feels it does n't touch issues of gender , environment , and globalisation . ""
Galbraith acknowledges that he took too benign a view of transnational corporations in his earlier work , but does not agree with globalisation 's critics .
He goes back to his own experience to argue that the internationalisation of the global economy dampens the clash of interests between capitalists in nation states , such as that between France and Germany which led to the first world war .
He also thinks that national governments can regulate corporations ' international behaviour if they show political will .
He insists he remains optimistic .
While Naomi Klein believes the Green and social democratic elements in Galbraith 's ideas are making a comeback , other young economists of globalisation feel less inspired .
They believe his view that the protesters against the World Bank and IMF are protectionists is out of touch .
But Galbraith has no illusions about the power of corporations within America , and his ideas may find a new audience .
His forthcoming book analyses how managers of the big corporations have taken direct control over politicians .
"" The Bush administration manifests this perfectly , "" he says .
"" How can this be reversed ?
I 'll leave that to someone else .
I 'll be content now to have it understood , "" he laughs .

2002-04-08,"Barclays and other top financial institutions are to be added to the hit list of an expanded class action suit in connection with the Enron collapse , it was announced today .
William Lerach , the lead attorney in the case , said the banks ' knowledge of questionable partnerships and financial vehicles gave them an inside view of Enron 's financial condition as they sold securities to investors . ""
Every bank bears significant complicity for their involvement , "" Mr Lerach said .
The banks named in the suit are Barclays Bank , JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup , Credit Suisse First Boston USA , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , Bank of America , Merrill Lynch , Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers .
Original defendants included current and former Enron officials who sold more than $ 1bn in stock from October 1998 to November last year and Arthur Andersen , Enron 's former auditor .
The $ 25bn lawsuit was originally filed in December on behalf of large investors , including the lead plaintiff , the University of California , which lost $ 150 m after Enron collapsed last December .
Lawyers for the board of regents at the university alleged in the 502-page complaint that the banks and securities firms participated with Enron in a scheme to deceive shareholders and investors by helping the energy company with bogus deals to inflate profits .
The expanded lawsuit also lists 24 Andersen partners , including Joseph Berardino , the former chief executive of Andersen Worldwide , the international umbrella network for Andersen .
Andersen in the US has been charged with obstruction of justice by the US justice department for shredding thousands of documents .
The lawsuit names
Andersen 's offices outside the US in the UK , Brazil , Cayman Islands , Puerto Rico and India .
The lawsuit could pose even more problems for any potential buyer of those offices as they may inherit those legal liabilities , although Andersen Worldwide has denied any legal exposure of offices outside America .
Mr Lerach said subsequent investigation pointed to liability on the part of banks that were Enron 's lenders and underwriters before alleged accounting abuses exposed last year led to the company 's meltdown in America 's biggest bankruptcy .
Barclays provided loans of $ 251 m to special purpose vehicles at the centre of the Enron scandal .
The financing was provided by Barclays ' investment banking division , Barclays de Zoete Wedd , in 1997 and was used to help the venture Chewco to acquire assets from Enron .
Barclays has maintained that the loans were straightforward and that it has done nothing wrong ."
2002-04-10,"Andersen 's UK arm moved to distance itself against any litigation that might spread across the Atlantic last night as it emerged that one of the top executives responsible for auditing Enron had agreed to plead guilty to obstructing the US goverment 's investigation into the collapse of the energy company .
David Duncan , an Arthur Andersen auditor , was expected to admit his guilt at a hearing that was scheduled to take place in Houston , the one - time base of the once - mighty Enron , last night .
Mr Duncan , who left the troubled accounting firm earlier this year , is accused of persuading Andersen partners and employees to "" alter , destroy , mutilate and conceal "" information related to the audits carried out into Enron .
Andersen is denying that it obstructed the US investigators by shredding documents but sources suggested last night that if Mr Duncan intended to enter a guilty plea it might put pressure on the firm to admit any guilt .
The uncertainty caused by a series of legal proceedings in the US is exacerbating the difficulties facing the firm world wide in securing a merger with a strong partner and the threat of any wider legal action could further worsen the prospects of any deal being done .
This is why Andersen 's managing partner in the UK , John Ormerod , yesterday insisted that any attempts by US plaintiffs to bring litigation to the UK "" would have no basis in law "" .
"" Naming our firm has no legal basis , "" Mr Ormerod said .
"" While we have sympathy for those affected by Enron 's failures , Andersen in the UK has no obligation to satisfy the legal liabilities of other member firms "" .
The UK practice has already failed in orchestrating a deal that would complete a merger with all the arms of Andersen outside the US after parts of the sprawling empire broke away from the core negotiations .
In the US , reports said that Mr Duncan would co - operate with the US investigation and would become a key witness in the case against his former employer .
Last night his attorney , Robert Giuffra , was not confirming that his client was preparing to make a guilty plea .
However , Mt Giuffra was reported as saying : "" He 's continuing to co - operate with government investigations in this matter "" .
Andersen 's attorney , Rusty Hardin , said he would be surprised if Mr Duncan did plead guilty . ""
He 's always told us he did n't do it , "" Mr Hardin told the Reuters news agency .
Mr Duncan is said to have called a meeting with his auditing team on the day after US regulators announced in October that they were investigating Enron at which he asked for the destruction of some files ."
2002-04-11,"A lack of competent non - executive directors could lay Britain 's corporate sector open to an Enron - style collapse , MPs were told yesterday .
Asked by members of the treasury select committee if he was certain the current system of non - executives could stop an Enron - type scandal , Michael Groom , president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales , said : "" I suspect not .
There are a whole host of issues which need thinking about .
"" Welcoming the review of the role of non - executives announced last month by the trade and industry secretary , Patricia Hewitt , Mr Groom 's deputy , Peter Wyman , added : "" The problem is not the structure , or the system ; the big problem is finding quality people .
It takes time , and it takes competence . ""
But Mr Wyman admitted that good non - executives had become even less willing to come forward since the collapse of Enron exposed how much they could be blamed when things go wrong . ""
A number of people who are or would have expected to become non - executive directors have said to me in the last three months in the light of everything that has happened that the reputational risk is too great . ""
While keen to accept a strengthening of the role of non - executives , leading accountants argued their rules were tight enough to prevent Enron - style debts being kept off UK balance sheets .
But David Bishop , from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants , said Enron had dented confidence ."
2002-04-11,"Andersen , the disgraced accounting firm , is prepared to admit that it broke the law by destroying documents related to Enron , paving the way for a settlement with the government , it emerged today .
In return for the admission , the government would defer prosecution , or put the firm effectively on probation for several years .
The New York Times reports that a draft agreement is expected to be completed today , although several issues have yet to be settled and the deal could still collapse .
Andersen decided to try to reach an out of court settlement after one of its former partners , David Duncan , pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice by destroying thousands of documents in the collapse of the US energy firm Enron .
His guilty plea and decision to cooperate with the government this week put the US justice department firmly in the driving seat in settlement talks .
Under the potential settlement , the government would postpone prosecution for several years , unless Andersen broke other laws .
But if the company keeps a clean bill of health , the indictment of obstruction of justice would be dropped .
Still to be settled , in the current talks , is the extent to which Andersen is prepared to admit culpability .
Andersen wants the admission of guilt to be limited to Mr Duncan , who was sacked in January , while the government wants the acknowledgement to cover other Andersen executives .
In case the settlement talks collapse , Andersen is preparing the groundwork for a trial due to start on May 6 .
The strategy would consist , unsurprisingly , of portraying Mr Duncan as a rogue accountant among 1,700 honest colleagues .
Deferred prosecutions have taken place before .
In 1994 , Prudential Securities was put on probation after it was accused of defrauding investors in the sale of limited energy partnerships .
The government 's interest in a deal stems from its reluctance to see the total collapse of a major accountancy firm with the loss of thousands of jobs .
In a sign that it favours compromise , the justice department refrained from turning Mr Duncan 's guilty plea on Tuesday into a major media circus .
In addition , Mr Duncan identified by name no other Andersen employees who may have had a role in the shredding or possible wrongdoing ."
2002-04-12,"The anguish of the former Enron vice - chairman who killed himself in January was revealed yesterday when the police released the contents of his suicide note .
John Clifford Baxter wrote that he had lost his sense of pride .
He died from a single gunshot wound to the head and was found in his car , half a mile from his home in Sugar Land , an affluent suburb of Houston , Texas .
The brief intimate note was addressed to his wife Carol and provided no further clue to the collapse of the scandal - hit energy company .
It read : "" I am so sorry for this .
I feel I just ca n't go on .
I 've always tried to do the right thing , but where there was once great pride
, now it 's gone .
I love you and the children so much .
I just ca n't be any good to you or myself .
The pain is overwhelming .
Please try to forgive me .
Cliff . ""
Baxter 's family tried to prevent publication of the note , pleading their right to privacy .
But the Texas attorney general , John Cornyn , ruled in favour publication , "" given the substantial public interest in the causes of Enron 's failure and its far - reaching consequences "" .
Baxter , 43 when he died , left Enron in May last year , seven months before it became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history .
Like other senior Enron executives he made $ 35 m ( £ 24 m ) by selling stock .
Many of the company 's employees , on the other hand , lost their life savings as it careered towards bankruptcy .
Since his death he has been praised as one of the few senior figures to voice concern about Enron 's dubious accounting practices .
In a letter written last August the whistleblower Sherren Watkins referred to him as someone with deep reservations about the "" veil of secrecy "" in the company , and said he had "" complained mightily "" ."
2002-04-12,"Arthur Andersen is said to have reached the outlines of a settlement with the US justice department that could allow the battered accountancy firm to stay in business .
The firm , which has been brought to its knees by the Enron scandal , is seeking to defer its prosecution for shredding documents that were wanted by federal investigators .
Under the agreement , Andersen would accept responsibility for the shredding in return for a probationary period , according to US reports .
If , during that period of several years , Andersen did nothing further wrong , the indictment for obstruction of justice would be dropped .
If , in that time , Andersen did find itself back in hot water then the firm 's admission could be used against it .
A settlement could also hinge upon Andersen agreeing to give full cooperation in the prosecution of Enron and former executives of the failed energy firm that it once audited .
Enron fell into bankruptcy in December after it emerged that the company had been hiding huge debts offshore .
Pressure to reach a settlement ahead of the trial , scheduled for May 6 , intensified after this week 's plea by former partner David Duncan to an obstruction charge for destroying the documents last autumn .
Andersen partners are also facing a race against time to ensure there is anything left worth saving .
Amid largescale client defections , the US affiliate last week confirmed plans for 7,000 job losses and agreed the sale of its tax business .
Offices outside the US , in cluding the UK , are being bought by rivals .
The wording of any admission of culpability by Andersen will be key to any settlement being finally reached .
The accountancy firm needs to avoid an actual guilty plea , which would effectively sound its death knell .
A guilty plea would wipe out its ability to do business in most US states , which strip licenses from any convicted felons .
Andersen had initially attempted to pin the entire blame for the shredding of documents on to Mr Duncan , who ran the relationship with Enron from the firm 's Houston offices .
The firm fired Mr Duncan in January and suspended or demoted several others in Houston .
Even if Andersen manages to avoid a criminal prosecution it still faces class - action lawsuits from aggrieved Enron shareholders ."
2002-04-12,"A judge in Australia has thrown out British American Tobacco 's entire defence against an anti - smoking lawsuit , ruling that the company jeopardised the chances of a fair trial by shredding thousands of relevant documents .
In a judgment which prompted comparisons with the bankrupt US energy firm Enron , the court awarded A$ 700,000 ( £ 260,000 ) to Rolah McCabe , a 51-year - old woman with lung cancer , saying BAT 's "" deliberate obliteration "" of records had prejudiced proceedings .
Anti - smoking campaigners said that if upheld on appeal , the ruling could trigger a "" litigation armageddon "" in Australia and elsewhere .
BAT 's shares fell 12.5p to 666.5p , wiping £ 270 m off the group 's market value .
Ms McCabe , who has a life expectancy of "" at best months "" , smoked BAT 's Capstan and Escort cigarettes for 40 years .
She sued BAT , claiming its advertising targeted children and it took "" no reasonable steps "" to reduce the health risks of its tobacco .
In the supreme court of Victoria , Mr Justice Eames complained that BAT 's Australian subsidiary had pulped every single document prior to 1998 relating to the chemical effects of nicotine .
Marketing material from 1955 to 1987 , discussion papers , memorandums and surveys were all shredded .
The judge found that the company also destroyed CD roms and computer disks , which could not be justified by pressure on filing space , and it failed to keep a list of the lost material .
He said : "" The decision to destroy all such lists and records can only have been a deliberate tactic to hide information . ""
BAT argued that it had acted in accordance with a "" document retention policy "" drawn up by its law firm , Clayton Utz .
But the judge said this policy was designed "" to provide a means of destroying damaging documents under the cover of an apparently innocent housekeeping arrangement "" .
After the ruling , a barrister representing the Victoria health centre for tobacco control suggested that BAT could be investigated for contempt of court and perverting the course of justice .
Clive Bates , director of Action on Smoking and Health , said the shredding was done with the knowledge of BAT 's London headquarters .
"" What plaintiffs around the world will be wondering is whether this legal argument can be relevant where they are . ""
This is going to give BAT a major headache in Australia if they lose on appeal .
There 's certainly a suggestion it went on elsewhere , as it involved the company 's head office . ""
BAT 's company secretary in Australia , John Namey , was singled out by the judge for giving "" misleading and less than comprehensive "" evidence .
The ruling says the subsidiary 's former chief counsel , Nick Cannar , made the decision to begin a shredding blitz .
Mr Cannar is now chief executive of the Australian arm of Imperial Tobacco .
A BAT spokeswoman said yesterday the company 's actions were "" totally ethical "" ."
2002-04-13,"Legal claims against Enron from shareholders and creditors could add up to $ 100bn ( £ 69bn ) , according to the man brought in to keep the bankrupt energy business trading .
In his first address to the company 's dispirited workforce , Stephen Cooper , the turnaround expert hired as chief executive in January , tried to offer some assurance that the business could re - emerge from bankruptcy , albeit in an attenuated form . ""
Enron has been in the unfortunate position of being the whipping boy or the flashpoint for much of what has gone wrong with corporate America , "" he told more than 1,000 workers gathered in a Houston hotel .
"" I think we 're just going to have to behave differently .
We ca n't pretend it did n't happen because it did .
The only way that we 're going to be credible again is by showing everyone that we 're credible . ""
But he warned of further pain .
He said there would be more job losses ahead and that these would not be "" insubstantial "" .
About 8,000 jobs of a once 31,000-strong workforce have already been cut .
He said that the claims against the company were likely to be worth between $ 60bn and $ 70bn but that they could go as high as $ 100bn .
After such an enormous burden , there was unlikely to be anything left for existing shareholders .
Enron 's debts are in the region of $ 40bn , including the controversial off - balance sheet financing that led to the company 's downfall .
"" There was just an incredible amount of debt that was accumulated all around the company , "" he said .
"" I just do n't see how we ever get close to getting through the unsecured claims . ""
Under bankruptcy rules , creditors come before shareholders .
That will offer cold comfort to the workforce , many of whom had life savings invested in Enron stock .
In an attempt to rouse Enron 's battered workforce , Mr Cooper promised to reintroduce the water coolers which have been removed from the firm 's Houston head office .
"" It 's crazy , "" he said , to loud applause .
"" We 're not prisoners of war . ""
Mr Cooper , who runs the consultancy Zolfo Cooper , said the new Enron would be a far smaller producer and distributor of energy .
The business , which will change its name to put some distance between it and the scandal that has ensued , will focus chiefly on markets in California , Florida and Brazil .
In recent years , Enron had become a bloated organisation with operations stretching to Wessex Water in Britain and a trading operation that attempted to create a market for broadband capacity .
Mr Cooper needs to persuade creditors that the company would be more valuable as an ongoing operation than it would be if they were to simply to break it up and sell off the assets .
The Enron board will present their plans to creditors in early May.
"" This is not a Chapter 7 , which is a liquidation , and it is not conceivable to me that it will ever become a Chapter 7 , "" Mr Cooper told staff .
He said that keeping a pared - back business operating was the best option for creditors . ""
Over time we could deliver substantially more value .
I 'm relatively confident we can persuade them . ""
Enron may join the list of companies and individuals suing auditor Arthur Andersen and a clutch of Wall Street banks ."
2002-04-13,"Central to the post - Enron debates are questions about the role of auditors and non - executive directors .
Enron 's auditor , Andersen , is breaking up , and non - execs are finding that being a board member of a company under scrutiny for misreporting is no trivial matter .
Reviews of both functions have been launched in the UK .
At the heart of these inquiries will be the nature of the information that companies present to their shareholders - and more specifically the journey that corporate information takes as it travels from the foothills of real business transactions via the base camp of accounting conventions to the lofty ( and evidently misty ) heights of external disclosure .
What the investigators will find is that a multinational company with 100 subsidiaries , each recording 1,000 individual accounts ( sales , expenses , balance sheet values ) , generates at least 100,000 numbers a month .
That 's 1.2 million numbers a year .
Add in budgets , forecasts and currency conversions , and the total annual raw material for audit inflates to around five million numbers .
However , the air is much thinner at the top of the information peak .
The annual report typically contains around 2,500 numbers , or double that counting interims and other briefing documents .
In other words , in the consolidation steps between local recording of real transactions and final disclosure to shareholders , information content has been reduced at least a thousandfold .
The off - balance sheet transactions that brought down Enron existed as real transactions at the bottom of the information pile , but somewhere along the line they were filtered out and lost in the fog of the disclosed figures .
To prevent a repetition we need to address the question of how we can prevent the evidence being squeezed out in the necessary information consolidation .
In theory auditors have access to all the underlying numbers at any time .
In practice the need to be cost - effective means that audits are a compromise .
Importantly , they happen only once a year , and focus typically on the difference between year - end account balances year on year .
Much less scrutinised are individual intervening months or underlying trends .
An auditor wo n't flag high sales or profits in December 2001 as exceptional if they were also high in December 2000 .
Such regular ploys as ' stuffing the channel ' ( booking excess sales of returnable goods to a distribution network ) or ' inflating the GP ' ( recording unrealistically high gross profit on sales in the final month of this year and correcting it in the first month of next ) .
The audit process of ' analytic review ' is supposed to help root out such practices , but the economics of auditing militates against it .
From the auditor 's perspective , it 's a management responsibility to maintain the integrity of the information mountain : the auditor 's job is to check that the task has been competently done .
But this provides little comfort for non - execs , few of whom have the time or expertise to challenge the management team or auditors , with the result that it frequently falls between two stools .
Is there an answer ?
Yes
: and it is by no means rocket science .
It involves using computers for what they are particularly good at : combing low - level information for anomalies in the patterns of the underlying data .
For example , any old PC can crunch standard deviations in data series , easily identifying suspicious variability in the figures consolidated from local subsidiary records .
Put simply , for a normal distribution , a value of two standard deviations above the average has a less than 5 per cent chance of being consistent with normal variability ( and therefore kosher ) ; or a 95 per cent probability of benefiting from further investigation ( dodgy ) .
Such techniques - which can be automated - can provide a quick and objective first filter for unusual transactions .
But , as Marconi and other cases show , the checks need to be run monthly , not just yearly .
From press accounts , Marconi collapsed when demand fell catastrophically overnight , leaving directors with no time to communicate with banks and shareholders .
But in a fast - changing industry , using annual or interim audit figures as early warnings is like ' trying to catch a train using last year 's Bradshaw ' , to borrow Harold Macmillan 's expression .
By applying straightforward automated techniques every month to the existing consolidation system , multinational auditors have a matchless opportunity to carry out a comprehensive early - warning analysis across all the company 's subsidiaries .
The ' all ' is important .
Normally , small subsidiaries are ignored on the grounds that ' they can never make much of a contribution to the group ' .
In positive terms , that 's true : but while in a good year a £ 5 million subsidiary might contribute £ 1 m profit to the group , in a bad year it could easily lose £ 3 m or more .
Multiplying this by the number of small subsidiaries gives a frightening result .
The combination of this ' iceberg syndrome ' and the need for early warnings strongly suggests that the company should issue both board and external reports at least monthly .
These should include a risk analysis of unusual activity for the subsidiaries , however small .
For non - execs , the key points can be summed up in ' 10 questions to ask the auditors ' ( see below ) .
Of course , there 's no reason why some of these checks ca n't be run by the internal financial team ; but as Enron shows , in some circumstances an internal audit will not be enough to assure non - executives that they are doing their duty .
Pressing for answers is in any case a low - risk strategy .
If the worst comes to the worst , such a move will at least provide evidence of personal concern .
In less dramatic circumstances it will serve to remind the rest of the board that there is - still - no such thing as a free lunch .

How often do you perform a diagnostic review of the contents of our consolidation system ?
4 .
Do you apply automated tests to detect unusual subsidiary performance ?
5 .
Have you identified any turning points in business indicators , such as orders or sales ?
6 .
Do you check our smallest subsidiaries ( since while they may never make much profit they could record huge losses ) ?
7 .
Does our board reports contain the results of tests 4 , 5 and 6 above , or is this information presented only to divisional management ?

2002-04-13,"Now that Enron has destroyed Andersen , could the fallout from the dotcom boom destroy Merrill Lynch ?
Wall Street 's greatest stockbroker is under assault from the New York state attorney general , who has armed himself with sheaves of emails that raise severe doubts about the integrity of its advice .
The American public has been shocked to discover that Merrill 's analysts produced positive investment recommendations on a number of hi - tech stocks , while referring to them disparagingly in internal communications .
How could a stock be crap to an internal audience but a worthy investment to a client ?
It is unlikely that professional investors will be at all surprised to learn of this apparently confused recommendation system .
The conflict of interest inherent within investment banks - in which corporate financiers draw on the expertise of the same analysts that advise investors - has been widely recognised for years .
Many major investors choose to ignore the headline recommendations on broking research .
They use brokers ' analysts to give them insights into the financial dynamics of companies and to keep them abreast of corporate developments , but then employ their own valuation models to determine their buy and sell decisions .
Only a small fraction of investment recommendations on Wall Street - or on the London market for that matter - are sells ( or some euphemistic equivalent such as "" reduce "" ) .
Since by definition half the stocks ( by capitalisation ) in the market must underperform the index , investors can not rely on brokers to steer their portfolios clear of the rocks .
The investment banks mount a very weak defence when confronted with their unbalanced recommendation lists .
We only research those companies we believe have inherent value , they say .
And anyway , what we tell our clients over the phone might differ from our published advice .
After all , if we offend a company with a sell conclusion , they 'll never talk to our analyst again .
There is some truth in this defence .
Corporates are notoriously badly behaved when they see a sell recommendation in print .
Even if they have no banking or advisory relationship with the investment bank concerned , this does not stop them jumping on the phone to a senior executive in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the analyst concerned .
When an advisory relationship does exist , a sell recommendation , or often even a neutral hold , can prove incendiary .
Few analysts feel empowered to speak their minds in public on companies that their bank advises .
In many banks mechanisms exist to ensure that corporate financiers see research on the companies they advise before it is published .
They can then prove formidable barriers to it ever seeing the light of day .
Before you start to feel sorry for the poor , put - upon analyst , remember that they are the stars in the investment banking firmament .
Their pay is determined by their ability to build a reputation among investors for giving timely , profitable advice , and then to leverage that reputation to win lucrative work for their banks .
They might squeal when their independence is compromised , but that does not stop them spending the bonuses that corporate fees generate .
Professional investors tolerate the conflict of interest ingrained within the current investment banking structure for broadly two reasons .
First , they value the ability to tap the minds of bright analysts who have privileged access to companies and to pay little in the way of commissions in return .
Secondly , they want priority treatment when an investment bank is distributing shares in a hot new issue .
Private investors , by contrast , have all of the downside and none of the upside from the flaws in the analytical system .
The major investment banks servicing institutional and retail investors typically send condensed versions of their institutional research to their private clients .
Caveat emptor does not seem to be sufficient in these circumstances .
This problem is greater in the US than over here , for America has an investment culture that runs deep .
Thus Henry Blodget , the former Merrill analyst whose emails have been laid bare for public scrutiny , is something of a national celebrity , having made his reputation in the dotcom boom .
It is almost impossible to conceive of a financial researcher achieving similar status in the UK .
Merrill is fighting to hold back a tide of reform of its working practices .
Each of the other major banks is watching with fear .
The only thing unique about Merrill 's case is that it is first in the queue before the beak .
If they are lucky , the banks will escape with an agreement to tighten up their disclosure procedures .
If they are unlucky , structural change will be forced on them .
Either way , there is likely to be a substantial diminution in the size and cost of research departments .
The best analysts will be absorbed into corporate finance teams entirely , or will jump the fence and join the investment management industry .
Private clients will probably end up paying more for advice , but this in turn should ensure an improvement in its quality .
One final thought : what company or industry could stomach the publication of its staff 's private views of its products ?
There is a warning in the Merrill affair for all businesses .

2002-04-14,"David Blunkett , the Home Secretary , is preparing to endorse plans for a national squad to tackle white collar crime , which costs an estimated £ 14 billion a year .
The force would unite the fraud squads of the 43 police forces of England and Wales for the first time and absorb the Serious Fraud Office , which is responsible for investigating large and complex financial crimes .
The move would reverse previous Government policy , but a police source said ministers ' interest in the scheme had been rekindled by fears that Britain could suffer an Enron - style corporate disaster .
The change of heart follows intense lobbying by Rosalind Wright , director of the SFO , and the City of London police commissioner , Perry Nove .
Both argue that fighting fraud is a low priority for many hard - up forces and that officers would be better trained in a specialist force .
A national crime squad has also been recommended by the Fraud Advisory Panel , a government - backed body set up to recommend new ways to fight white - collar crime .
The squad would be modelled on the National Crime Squad , set up to fight serious organised crime , and its creation would not require legislation .
The Association of British Insurers recently estimated that the annual cost of crime in the UK was £ 35bn , and that fraud accounted for up to 40 per cent of this .
But hundreds of suspected cases are not investigated .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' We are considering the best way to take this forward .
Ministers are looking at the proposals as a matter of urgency . '"
2002-04-15,"Investors will be watching intently as US companies this week issue their first quarter results to see whether profits have started rolling in .
The reporting season got off to a rocky start last week , when General Electric ( GE ) , the world 's largest company , reported profits of $ 2.5bn ( £ 1.7bn ) for the quarter , down 3 % on the same period a year ago .
It was the first time that GE reported its profits using new , tougher accounting rules introduced after the Enron scandal .
Shares in GE , a traditional profits powerhouse , have fallen by 14 % since the beginning of the year , chiefly because of concerns over its opaque accounting .
In releasing its results , GE was noticeably downbeat on the outlook for profits .
Its chief financial officer , Keith Sherin , said there was little evidence of a broad recovery in the economy to kickstart earnings .
The market then received another jolt , when IBM , the computer giant , issued its first profit warning for years .
The news from two of America 's bluest of blue chip companies came as a sobering counterpoint to some of the euphoria of the last few weeks as signs pointed to a quick US recovery .
True , the American economy has bounced back from recession remarkably quickly , with growth returning in the fourth quarter of 2001 .
But questions persist about the strength of recovery .
Much of the growth can be put to corporate America 's need to restock inventories after these had been run down during the economic slowdown that began in March last year .
But for serious growth to kick in , American companies have to start investing in new capital equipment .
But if profits are hard to come by , such investment will not be forthcoming .
Moreover , American companies over - invested heavily in the boom years and it will take more than a couple of quarters for them to work out the excesses of a classic investment bubble .
As if that was not enough , the Enron scandal has made a huge dent in investor confidence .
The bull market of the 1990s was sustained by the willingness of millions of small investors to play the market .
Many have been badly burnt and they feel angry at the analysts who allegedly led them down the garden path .
In the fallout from Enron , Wall Street has come under sustained attack for allegedly massaging the numbers of companies in order to hype up investor interest and seduce your average punter .
Merrill Lynch has been the focus of such accusations as the attorney general of New York state , Eliot Spitzer , wages a campaign against analysts who trashed companies in private , while extolling them in their public research .
He says his aim is nothing less than a restructuring of the financial industry .
All this makes for interesting contrasts in America at the moment .
Politically and militarily , the US appears omnipotent .
If anything , its pre - eminence is all the more marked after September 11 .
But America 's economic base looks distinctively wobbly , something that has been reflected in the unease of the markets lately .
That sense of nervousness is unlikely to change as the reporting season gets underway ."
2002-04-15,"Derek Higgs , a former Prudential director and corporate adviser at Warburg , is to head the government 's inquiry into strengthening the role and quality of non - executives , ministers announced last night .
After rebuffs from several leading chief executives and company chairmen , including Sainsbury 's Sir Peter Davis and Granada 's Charles Allen , Patricia Hewitt , trade and industry secretary , said Mr Higgs would lead the independent inquiry she opened in late February .
The review comes as ever more searching questions are asked about the role of non - executive directors in the wake of the Enron debacle in the US and undetected crises at British firms such as Tomkins and Marconi .
Also of concern has been the sheer number of such posts amassed by often ageing industrialists and financiers .
Ms Hewitt said : "" Derek Higgs brings a wealth of relevant experience as a non - executive director , executive director and institutional investor .
A well - respected figure in City and business circles , he is admirably equipped to lead this review . ""
From the point of view of UK productivity performance , the progressive strengthening of the quality and role of non - executive directors is strongly desirable .
The review will consider how more independent and more active non - executive directors drawn from a wider pool of talent can play their part in raising productivity . ""
Mr Higgs , chairman of Partnerships UK and a non - executive of , inter alia , Egg , British Land and Allied Irish Banks , made plain he was a strong believer in "" a relentless meritocracy "" , a phrase coined by the consultants McKinsey .
"" You could say there 's a clear need for shaking up the old pals ' act but that would be overstating it , "" he said , insisting he did not belong to any such clique .
"" You have continually to seek to improve the quality and range of people who can fill this role . ""
Mr Higgs , a lifelong Coventry City supporter with no political allegiance , said his remit included examining the accountability of non - executives .
"" Well , it 's not for every chalk - stroke of management but equally they ca n't say this has got nothing to do with us ...
you can help by clarifying and defining a little more clearly just what those accountabilities are . ""
Similarly , Mr Higgs said non - executives could not be paid so little that they would be of poor quality while they could not be paid so much that they lost their objectivity .
"" This is where the trade - off is difficult .
If someone becomes dependent for too great a proportion of income on too great a role , the ultimate sanction of resigning and making the reasons known gets lost . ""
Mr Higgs , who endorsed the government 's decision to avoid fresh regulations or laws , said he no longer had a single full - time job so he could take on this new role .
Sir Peter and Mr Allen turned down the chance because it would deflect them from their main jobs ."
2002-04-16,"The US government was dragged back into the Enron scandal yesterday with reports that federal investigators are studying possible insider trading by army secretary Thomas White .
Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are said to be focusing on calls and contacts Mr White had with Enron executives in October , two months before the company collapsed .
Mr White , a former vice chairman of the failed US energy firm , sold half of his shares during the month , netting more than $ 3 m ( £ 2 m ) .
According to the reports , the FBI has interviewed friends and former colleagues of Mr White to find out whether he sought any information on Enron 's financial position as it stumbled toward bankruptcy .
Mr White has told congressional investigators of 73 contacts with current or former Enron employees since he joined the Bush administration 10 months ago .
The majority were between the August resignation of chief executive Jeffery Skilling and the December 3 bankruptcy filing .
Mr White has maintained that the calls were motivated by concern over the fate of former colleagues and that he did not act on any inside information .
He has also denied knowledge of the off - shore partnerships that masked Enron 's debt and eventually triggered its demise .
Colonel Jim Allen , a spokesman for Mr White , told the Wall Street Journal : "" He [ Mr White ] was given a deadline to sell , he asked for and got an extension , then the war in Afghanistan came along and he was busy .
By the end of October he 'd totally divested himself of stock .
The secretary has answered all these questions repeatedly . ""
A spokesman for the FBI in Washington declined to comment .
The Bush administration 's relationship with Enron has come under intense scrutiny since the energy firm became the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history .
Kenneth Lay , another former chief executive , was a personal associate of the president and Enron was one of the biggest backers of the Bush election campaign .
Talks aimed at ensuring the survival of Arthur Andersen , the accountancy firm that audited Enron 's accounts , were continuing last night .
The US offices of Andersen are attempting to settle an indictment for obstruction of justice ahead of a trial due at the beginning of next month ."
2002-04-23,"Hopes for the survival of Arthur Andersen faded further yesterday when it emerged that Paul Volcker , the former banking chief brought in to develop a survival plan for the stricken firm , is considering stepping down .
Mr Volcker has been disheartened by the failure of Andersen last week to reach a settlement in the criminal indictment brought by the US justice department .
Andersen is due in court on May 6 to face obstruction of justice charges in the Enron scandal .
If the firm is found guilty , it will lose its licence to practise in most US states .
A decision by Mr Volcker to resign would be an effective acknowledgement that there is little left to save .
Andersen has now lost about 250 clients in the US , about 10 % of its total base .
The firm has already announced plans to cut 7,000 staff and is selling its tax and consultancy businesses .
Offices of Andersen around the world , hobbled by the events in the US , have been rapidly breaking away to join rival firms .
Proposals by Mr Volcker , a former Federal Reserve chairman , for overhauling Andersen were tied to conditions , including the settlement with federal prosecutors and the resolution of the civil cases against the firm .
He told the Wall Street Journal : "" It 's a question of whether you have a useful role to play .
We offered to make our assistance available if conditions were such that it was useful . ""
It comes to the point where , if conditions are n't met , you do n't have a useful role to play .
That 's a conclusion , not a resignation . ""
Mr Volcker , who was appointed by Andersen in early February , proposed a seven - member oversight board , which he would have chaired .
Andersen 's hopes of avoiding a conviction were damaged when David Duncan , the former partner who ran the Enron account from the firm 's Houston offices , pleaded guilty and became a key witness for the prosecution .
The settlement talks came agonisingly close .
Andersen eventually walked away , unable to agree to the length of a probationary period or to the wording of a public admission of culpability .
Mr Duncan has admitted shredding Enron - related documents when he was aware prosecutors were seeking them .
Mr Volcker had aimed to rebuild Andersen as a smaller , independent auditing firm .
Those efforts face further obstacles because many of the firm 's remaining partners in the US are said to be resigned to the fact that their futures lie elsewhere ."
2002-04-24,"The pressure on Wall Street intensified yesterday when the US justice department said it may pursue investment banks for offering misleading information to shareholders .
A group of US state securities regulators also launched an investigation into the claims of conflict of interest inside banks .
The move could significantly broaden the impact of the inquiries already under way into individual banks and analysts related to the internet bubble and the collapse of Enron .
Michael Chertoff , head of the justice department 's criminal division , said he expected to see cases against analysts that offer biased recommendations to help their firms win investment banking fees .
Punishing analysts for "" breaking the rules in the way they disseminate and handle the information of publicly traded companies seems to me to be one of the front - burner white - collar enforcement issues for the next several years , "" he said .
"" We 're going to be doing a lot of cases involving financial reporting .
"" The justice department 's involvement would raise the stakes by introducing the possibility of criminal wrongdoing , fines and prison sentences .
Mr Chertoff is overseeing the investigation into possible fraud at Enron , the energy firm that fell into bankruptcy at the end of last year .
Wall Street banks have already come under the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission , the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange , all of which have recommended improved Chinese walls in banks .
Eliot Spitzer , the New York state attorney general , has launched an action against Merrill Lynch for allegedly misleading investors during the internet - driven stock market boom .
The North American Securities Administrators Association , a Washington - based trade group , said it was creating a multi - state task force to investigate "" possible securities law violations by Wall Street firms "" .
Joseph Borg , the organisation 's president , said the investigation would focus on the issues raised by the New York attorney general .
Merrill Lynch has agreed to proposals to provide better disclosure of its investment banking relationships on research notes prepared by analysts .
But it is still in discussions with Mr Spitzer about a broader settlement ."
2002-04-24,"Accountancy firm Andersen , indicted in the United States for its role in the collapse of failed energy trader Enron , has become embroiled in another scandal , this time involving BBVA bank in Spain .
The auditor yesterday denied reports in El Mundo newspaper that it had helped Spain 's biggest bank disguise the fact that it returned £ 100 m of "" black cash "" from a secret account in Jersey to the parent bank two years ago .
"" The affirmation made about a supposed pact to hide certain information is radically false , "" Andersen said in a statement yesterday .
El Mundo printed part of a Bank of Spain report into the BBVA affair which , it claimed , provided proof of a pact between BBVA co - president Emilio Ybarra and the auditor . ""
This matter is known by the auditor who has spoken with Mr Ybarra , "" Bank of Spain report said .
"" The auditor has no intention of mentioning this matter in its report . ""
Andersen included the operation in the extraordinary profits section of the bank 's accounts , made sure tax was paid and informed the Bank of Spain , thereby complying with accounting rules , it said .
"" It is evident , reading the [ Bank of Spain ] report , that there is no mention of any pact , "" Andersen said .
The BBVA scandal , sparked by the return of the money that had been hidden for more than a decade in the bank 's offshore subsidiaries , has forced the resignation of half a dozen of the bank 's directors and executives .
Some of these were found to have had pension packages that were financed by the secret funds ."
2002-04-26,"The securities and exchange commission has announced a formal inquiry into the increasing concerns about the practices of Wall Street analysts .
Harvey Pitt , chairman of the US financial watchdog , said the inquiry would focus on the potential conflicts arising from the relationship between research and investment banking , the need for further rules to ensure the independence of research departments and whether any laws have been broken .
The move will intensify pressure that has been growing on Wall Street since the dotcom boom and bust , and more recently the collapse of Enron .
The inquiry will pull together a number of investigations recently begun .
It will be conducted jointly with the New York Stock Exchange , the National Association of Securities Dealers , New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and the North American Securities Administrators Association .
The SEC has been conducting an informal look at analysts for the past year but was pricked into action by Mr Spitzer 's very public campaign against Merrill Lynch .
Two weeks ago , he published a series of incendiary internal emails which showed analysts making derisory comments about stocks while recommending them to investors .
Mr Spitzer has alleged that Merrill Lynch was issuing misleading research in order to secure investment banking business .
"" This is the next step - and a critical one - in the commission 's year - long review of analyst practices , "" Mr Pitt said .
"" The recent disclosures that resulted from the investigation by the New York state attorney general , as well as the practices uncovered by the staff of the SEC , the NYSE and NASD , reinforced the commission 's conclusion that further inquiry is warranted . ""
The SEC is understood to have been anxious to take control of the investigation to ensure that any changes in regulations would be consistent across the US .
Mr Spitzer has also issued subpoenas to Salomon Smith Barney .
If the SEC finds that banks have broken the law , it could open them to a wave of civil suits .
Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $ 400,000 last year to settle a case brought by a private investor who allegedly lost money by following the advice of one of the firm 's analysts .
Salomon Smith Barney now faces a similar suit .
The SEC will consider on May 8 separate proposals for reforming the rules governing analysts .
They have been put together by the NASD and NYSE after consultation ."
2002-04-27,"Merrill storm brewing over Atlantic
When David Komansky , chief executive of Merrill Lynch , apologised to clients , shareholders and employees last week , he was breaking one of the unwritten rules of American business life : never say sorry .
It opens you up to the full array of legal sanctions that American lawyers can employ , and which can - in theory - bankrupt a mighty institution and send its executives to jail .
Nobody involved in the whole Enron scandal has yet said sorry - unless you count a suicide note .
That is how serious it is for Merrill .
It will get worse .
So far , the research analysts have carried the can , and only one investment banker appears on Eliot Spitzer 's hit list .
That can not be right .
The analysts , after all , were only doing the bidding of the bankers who pulled in the fat commissions on which the firm thrived in the good years .
Some analyst will soon come up with the defence that he was ' only obeying orders ' .
The Thundering Herd 's finest corporate financiers must be trembling every time they hear a knock on the door .
And not just at Merrill 's .
The practices they are accused of were common on the Street in the height of the internet boom .
And our own complacent Financial Services Authority will soon find they were common on this side of the Atlantic , too .
Pearson puzzle Pearsonologists are sharply divided on the significance of last week 's boardroom manoeuvring .
Does Marj go sooner , or later ?
Is John the man for the top job after all ?
And is Peter the dark horse in the race ?
Marjorie Scardino says she wants to stay , but the real question is whether investors agree she is the right person to oversee a Pearson recovery , having presided over a dizzying rise , then an equally vertiginous fall , in the share price since 1997 .
Many shareholders are probably ready for a change .
John Makinson has been finance director all that time , so is tarred with the Scardino brush .
There is a theory that his move to head Penguin was meant to give him some time at the coal - face before easing him in to replace Scardino , but that does n't hold water .
The book publisher is kid 's stuff compared with the tough jobs at Pearson , like sorting out NCS or the US educational market - much more realistic rites of passage to the chief executiveship .
So step up Peter Jovanovic , former head of the education business , now on the main board .
He has as much sharp - end experience as you could want , in Pearson 's biggest business .
It looks as though Scardino has found her successor .
Riled by Ritblat Many shareholders dislike John Ritblat , head of British Land , the property company that owns the Broadgate development in the City of London .
Ritblat is one of the shrewdest businessmen of his generation , but he has been criticised for running the firm like a family business .
He does n't take to criticism kindly , although few would deny his strategy has paid off in the past .
But things are different now .
The company has been on the defensive since the summer of 2000 , when Ritblat failed to win backing for his bid to acquire a stake in rival Liberty International .
British Land 's share price has languished , but there is more to this than meets the eye .
Investors are worried about who will succeed Ritblat , a sprightly 66 , while others complain that he is both chairman and managing director , which runs counter to good corporate governance .
It is no surprise , therefore , that some shareholders have bridled at Ritblat 's refusal to strengthen the group 's stock price by buying back its shares .
Now Laxey Partners , which holds 2 per cent of British Land 's equity , is to table a proposal at the annual meeting this summer that could force a share buy - back .
But Laxey 's ideas are extreme : they would force the company to buy back so much stock that British Land would soon cease to exist .
Shareholders have stated that Laxey 's ideas are too wacky , but they could still fire a shot across Ritblat 's bows by abstaining in large numbers rather than voting against the resolution .
We suggest they do exactly that .
Man for the Pru ?
David Clementi , deputy governor of the Bank of England , would be a great catch for the Prudential , which is looking for a chairman to replace Sir Roger Hurn .
Clementi is retiring from the Old Lady this summer and is strongly rumoured to be one of the frontrunners for Hurn 's job .
It is tailor - made for him : the Pru is the only UK insurer that has not signed a major deal to sell its products through a high street bank - so there would be scope to tap into Clementi 's tremendous talent for innovation .
In 1984 , as head of investment bank Kleinwort Benson , Clementi masterminded BT 's privatisation .
The idea of a simultaneous offer of shares to private , institutional and international investors was a novelty in those days ; now it is the norm .
In 1989 Clementi advised Abbey National on its conversion from mutual building society to stock market - listed company , and pio- neered the concept of free shares for members .
Every building society that has since shed its mutual status adopted the same practice .
The Pru needs someone like Clementi to help it to develop new ideas as well as to provide support for chief executive Jonathan Bloomer , who suffered a setback last year when the UK group 's bid for American General was gazumped by US insurance giant AIG .
Clementi will not , of course , be short of offers , so Bloomer and his team need to move quickly ."
2002-04-29,"The vast majority of senior PR executives say the 24-hour news environment is putting corporate reputations at risk as company spokesmen and women struggle to stay "" on message "" .
Nearly 80 % of corporate PRs say they are struggling to meet the demands of a non - stop news industry that spans the globe , according to research from the UK 's largest PR agency .
As events such as September 11 and the collapse of Enron have shown , crisis situations cause the biggest headache .
Keeping public relations staff on message while maintaining consistency across time zones and national boundaries was the biggest challenge , according to the survey commissioned by Weber Shandwick and PR Week . ""
The era of ' no comment ' is well and truly dead , "" said Mark Wood , the chairman of ITN .
"" The growth of round the clock news across all platforms is inevitable and will , if anything , gather pace as technology makes it easier to transport material across different media , faster . ""
Tessa Curtis , the managing director of corporate communications at Weber Shandwick , added : "" There is real concern in corporate communications departments .
"" You only have to look to recent examples of companies in trouble , Enron , for example , to see how quickly stories build and travel . ""
Corporate reputations will need to be managed in a real time , fully integrated manner - which will present many organisations with major challenges in the way they work . ""
Ms Curtis said it was more important than ever for companies to employ strong communicators at the forefront of their business .
The survey also revealed the effective disclosure of financial information was a top priority .
Companies conducting cross - border deals had to decide how to juggle time zones to give the world 's media an equal opportunity for stories . ""
As financial reporting increasingly moves online , the timing of the release of information can be difficult - particularly across large geographical areas , "" said Ms Curtis .
"" The collapse of boundaries between corporate and product news means press offices now need a far more sophisticated understanding of the news agenda . ""
This presents a real threat to many companies but also great opportunities - if correctly handled , "" she added ."
2002-05-03,"Aero - engine maker Rolls - Royce put in one of the worst performances by a blue chip yesterday as concern over its accounting practices resurfaced .
The City has long harboured reservations about its accounts , in particular the way Rolls treats joint venture revenues and off - balance sheet debt .
The concerns came to the fore following the collapse of US energy trader Enron , and were back on the agenda yesterday as Schroder Salomon Smith Barney revealed its initial thoughts on Rolls 's recently published reports and accounts .
Of particular concern to Salomon was the fact that Rolls only paid £ 6 m of mainstream UK corporation tax in 2001 , down from £ 58 m in 2000 .
This , it says , suggests that profits in its UK businesses are very low .
It is also worried by the large disparity between reported profits and cashflow , something it claims is caused by the use of long - term total care packages , and the Rolls ' pension fund liability .
Rolls shares ended 16p lower at 674p ."
2002-05-03,"Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers plans to shed almost a third of staff at its British consulting arm ahead of a $ 9bn ( £ 6.2bn ) flotation of the global consultancy business that will net 1,000 London partners bonuses totalling more than £ 600,000 each .
Senior partners at PwC in New York and London yesterday gave the go - ahead to plans for a public offering in the autumn .
The decision follows the Enron debacle and accusations that accounting firms which also do consultancy work face potential conflicts of interest .
Staff at the consulting arm were informed by email yesterday that 350 jobs , amounting to 30 % of the workforce , would disappear as part of a restructuring before flotation .
A spokesman for the firm refused to discuss the email or confirm the number of redundancies .
He said in a statement : "" PwC Consulting is proposing to make a number of employees redundant in the UK .
All staff affected have already been informed and a consultation process has begun with them .
"" This decision has not been taken lightly and is as a result of our constant need to review our skills base against our market and client requirements .
As a result of this assessment , we need to reduce our staff numbers . ""
The company added : "" PwC Consulting has considered all the options available , including retraining , which is not suitable for all consultants or all our skills areas at this time . ""
That has been taken as a hint that compulsory redundancies are likely .
The job cuts follow a round of voluntary redundancies last year .
Staff who opted to stay with the firm are understood to be angry about the terms offered now , which they believe are less generous than the voluntary scheme .
If the flotation goes ahead as planned , it is expected that $ 9bn will be shared among 10,000 partners worldwide .
PwC Consulting , which saw a $ 18bn trade sale to computer firm HP fail last year , has 33,500 employees and had revenues of $ 6.7bn last year ."
2002-05-04,"Enron , the bankrupt energy firm , yesterday presented its plan for survival as a stripped down company with power and pipeline assets across North , South and Central America .
The Houston - based business presented the 42-page blueprint to a committee of creditors in the hope of persuading them that it will have more value as an ongoing operation .
The business , which became the biggest ever bankruptcy in December , would have 15,000 miles of pipeline assets , 75,000 miles of distribution and 6,700 megawatts of power generation .
The company , once the seventh largest in the US , would employ just 12,000 people .
The company 's creditors need to approve the plan before it is sent to the bankruptcy court to rubber - stamp .
The business would be separated from Enron 's liabilities .
The creditors could then take shares in the new company , tentatively named OpCo Energy Company .
It is estimated that OpCo would have $ 10.8bn in assets and core earnings of $ 1.3bn during 2003 .

2002-05-05,"One by one , the great gods that towered over the Nineties US business landscape are crashing down .
The sorry list - the internet , Enron , financial analysts , the brokerage houses , the woozy dreams of synergy - was joined last week by the upstart telecoms empire MCI - WorldCom .
Although the company , the leading carrier of internet traffic and America 's second - largest long - distance phone company , had long been troubled by a mountain of debt and falling revenue , the departure of colourful chief executive Bernard Ebbers , to become ' chairman emeritus ' and an unpaid consultant , came as confirmation that the telecoms industry is in financial meltdown .
No executive better represented the entrepreneurial era of telecommunications than Ebbers .
In early 1983 , the former milkman and junior high school basketball coach from Alberta , Canada , was running a chain of Mississippi motels .
The impending break - up of Ma Bell offered opportunities and Ebbers established LDDS to sell cut - price long - distance calls . '
The only experience Bernie had before operating a long - distance company was he used the phone , ' said Carl Aycock , an original LDDS investor .
Ebbers built MCI - WorldCom from a backwater operator into a potential rival of AT&amp;T in just 19 years .
In the past five years alone , Ebbers ' WorldCom acquired more than 70 smaller telecoms and capped the frenzy in 1998 with a $ 38 billion merger with MCI .
But a vast overcapacity of bandwidth , combined with a consumer price war and the rise of mobile telephones , sent the high - flying MCI - WorldCom stock crashing .
$ 100 invested in WorldCom stock in 1990 would have been worth nearly $ 9,000 in mid-1999 .
Last week , it was worth just $ 330 .
As a measure of trouble in the sector , telecoms stocks have generated more than $ 1 trillion in losses ; more than $ 500bn telecoms debt has been written off .
During the boom years , Ebbers could do no wrong .
Wall Street was eager to fund his growth - by - aquisition , market share by price cutting mantra , and the future appeared to have no limit .
But when the severity of telecoms ' overcapacity became apparent - less than 10 per cent of fibre optic capacity is being used - and new investment was used to pay interest on existing debt , the spigot closed .
Although MCI - WorldCom was also undone by forces beyond any one executive 's control , Ebbers ' forced departure was also self - inflicted .
He owes the company more than $ 366 million on loans and loan guarantees to cover his losses on WorldCom stock .
As a result , he may have to shed some of his assets - a 160,000-acre ranch in Canada , a wide swathe of timberland in the southeastern United States and a yacht named Aquasitions - to settle the debt .
A classic business maverick , Ebbers may have left the company with one of the largest debt burdens in corporate America , but he helped lead the industry through a period of breakneck change ."
2002-05-06,"A couple of tourists in shorts and T - shirts , one with a video camera fixed to his eye , amble down Smith Street in downtown Houston .
They stop briefly outside the latest attraction , the gleaming Enron tower , and take pictures of themselves in front of the now infamous square logo at the front of the building .
Like many big American cities , downtown Houston is dead at weekends .
The nine - lane freeway that disgorges the city 's workers back into the suburbs every evening is relatively quiet .
Sugar Land , the expensive suburb where the former Enron finance executive Cliff Baxter took his own life , is supremely calm .
The gated communities of vast houses each built around a series of artificial lakes is a testament to the wealth created in Houston over recent decades .
Jus ' Stuff , the shop set up by former Enron chief executive Ken Lay 's wife , Linda , to sell off family furniture on the edges of downtown is packed with white china rabbits and frilly cushion covers but has yet to open .
It is hard to escape the sense that this is the calm before the unwelcome storm that will break out over the city again this morning .
Just a couple of blocks away from the Enron tower , in a squat , mean - spirited - looking court house opened by John F Kennedy in 1961 , the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen will begin its last , desperate fight for survival .
The auditing firm will be defending itself against criminal charges of obstruction of justice and , lawyers say , it will have a tough fight on its hands .
Even if it wins the case , to be tried in front of US district judge Melinda Harmon , a 55-year - old Republican , there will be little left of the firm to rescue .
The indictment was opened in March , accusing Andersen of destroying "" literally tons "" of documents and emails related to the Enron audit while federal investigators were investigating the energy firm 's spectacular collapse .
If the firm is found guilty , it will be a "" death sentence "" , according to Frank Velie , a former federal prosecutor now at New York 's Salans law firm . ""
A criminal fraud prosecution , which is really what this is , will bar them from doing audits for financial statements of public companies , "" he said .
"" It would put them out of business . ""
The prosecutors ' key witness will be David Duncan , the former Andersen partner in Houston who last month pleaded guilty to shredding the documents .
Top Andersen officials maintained under questioning by Congress that Mr Duncan was solely to blame for the destruction .
But even that , some legal experts say , is tantamount to an admission of corporate liability .
The speed with which Andersen has fallen apart has astonished the business world .
Senior management at the firm admitted on January 10 that the document destruction had taken place .
Barely four months later , the Chicago - based firm has been wrenched apart .
It has lost more than 200 clients while almost all of its worldwide affiliates , including the British office , have broken away and announced plans to merge with the local operation of one of the other large accountancy firms .
Enron last week presented to its creditors its plans for a pared down company that would take it back to its former core pipeline and power generation business .
Similar moves to return Andersen to a smaller , US - only business , focused on auditing , now appear hopeless .
A rescue plan by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker depended upon the settlement of charges with the justice department and with the army of Enron shareholders and creditors that have filed suit against the accounting firm .
Both have failed .
Andersen said last week that talks which were aimed at a broad settlement of the claims against it had fallen apart , largely due to wrangling among the plaintiffs over the division of the spoils .
The firm had at first offered $ 750 m to settle the claims but , as clients began to walk , it reduced its offer to $ 350 m .
Although the local Houston economy appears to have weathered the Enron debacle so far , "" there was clearly a psychological impact "" , said Barton Smith , an economics professor with the University of Houston .
"" But in Houston that had already been dissipating .
A year from now , we will hardly hear about Enron , I hope . """
2002-05-07,"Lawyers for Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm , came out fighting yesterday as the first criminal trial to emerge from the bankruptcy of US energy trader Enron began .
The jury selection process opened with an unusually large pool of 108 potential jurors packing six rows of benches in the 1960s federal court in downtown Houston .
The difficulties presented by the reach of Enron and Andersen in the local area became apparent when more than one - third disclosed some kind of association with either company .
Another five jurors said they did not believe it was fair that the entire firm should be held accountable for the actions of a few - the basic tenet of the justice department 's obstruction of justice case .
"" It 's no defence to say just a few people did this , "" government lawyers said .
But before the process even began , Rusty Hardin , the urbane , wisecracking Texan acting for Andersen , accused federal prosecutors of attempting to ambush the defence by withholding the witness list .
He asked that the defence be given at least three days ' notice of who was being called .
"" If we are going to do this by ambush then let 's at least have a three - day ambush , "" he said , arguing that the defence would need time to prepare for cross - examination .
Mr Hardin also accused prosecutors of throwing in a "" skunk "" during the selection process when they asked if anyone had ever been asked to shred documents by their employer to hide them from federal investigators .
Prosecutors listed about 60 potential witnesses , including more than 50 present or former Andersen staff .
David Duncan , the Houston partner who has already pleaded guilty to the destruction of Enron documents , was among those named - as was the Andersen lawyer , Nancy Temple .
It was Ms Temple who had sent a reminder of the Andersen document retention and destruction policy that Mr Duncan claimed to have been acting upon .
Mr Hardin , in a tan suit and bright yellow tie , said there had been no further attempts to settle with the justice department over the weekend .
Judge Harmon warned jurors not to be swayed by media coverage as hordes of TV cameras waited outside the courtroom .
She is aiming to get the trial over within four weeks ."
2002-05-08,"The break - up of Arthur Andersen , the firm embroiled in the Enron scandal , today moved a step closer as KPMG Consulting announced plans to buy its consulting businesses .
KPMG Consulting said that it had signed a letter of intent to acquire up to 23 independent Andersen consulting units in America , Europe , Asia and Latin America , in a deal worth $ 284 m ( £ 194 m ) .
The Andersen consulting units included in the deal made net revenues of about $ 1.4bn last year .
But KPMG Consulting , which split off from the KPMG accounting firm in 2000 , added that the plan to acquire Andersen 's US consulting arm was contingent on resolving potential liability issues stemming from Andersen 's role in the Enron collapse .
Worries about potential legal liabilities have undermined attempts by Andersen to merge with other "" big five "" rivals in recent months .
As a result , many of Andersen 's overseas operations have deserted Andersen Worldwide , the umbrella organisation , and struck their own separate deals with other accountancy and consulting firms .
The US partnership is currently locked in a court case in Houston , after being accused by the US Justice Department of obstruction of justice .
It suffered a big blow yesterday when Judge Melinda Harmon allowed federal prosecutors to present evidence of the firm 's role in previous accounting scandals .
Andersen was taken to court by the American government after a failed attempt to reach an out of court settlement .
The accountancy firm is accused of shredding tons of documents in connection with the collapse of the US energy firm , Enron .
Federal prosecutors alleged that Andersen , which audited Enron , began plotting the destruction of documents in early October when it realised the energy firm was crumbling ."
2002-05-08,"Enron faced calls for a criminal inquiry yesterday as evidence emerged that it manipulated energy prices during last year 's power shortage in California .
The state 's two senators - Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer - demanded the investigation after the federal energy regulatory commission released documents written by Enron lawyers that described the company 's electricity trading strategies during California 's power crisis .
The suggestion that the company profited from the crisis is embarrassing for the White House , which yesterday said regulators would "" vigorously "" investigate the new evidence .
President Bush counted Enron executives among his top campaign contributors .
Two memos written in December 2000 suggested that Enron was deliberately moving power out of the state , then reselling it back in California to obtain higher prices in a technique it called "" ricochet "" .
Enron directors also faced a US senate investigative panel yesterday .
Senator Carl Levin , chairman , accused them of approving complex financial arrangements knowing the management "" handed out bonuses like candy at Halloween "" .
Four of the five directors appearing at yesterday 's hearing - John Duncan , Herbert Winokur , Robert Jaedicke and Charles LeMaistre - headed , respectively , the board 's executive , finance , audit and compensation committees .
The directors accused Enron executives and its auditor Arthur Andersen of hiding the information they needed to exercise proper oversight .
But senators said the directors shared responsibility for the collapse and failed in their duty to protect shareholders .

2002-05-08,"Arthur Andersen , the stricken accountancy firm , yesterday suffered a heavy blow in opening exchanges of the first criminal trial to emerge from the collapse of the energy firm Enron .
In a ruling that infuriated Andersen lawyers , Judge Melinda Harmon allowed federal prosecutors to present evidence of the firm 's involvement in previous accounting scandals .
Andersen faces charges of obstruction of justice for destroying Enron - related documents .
Prosecutors argued successfully during a pre - trial hearing in Houston that its previous brushes with controversy could be presented as a motive for the shredding of Enron documents .
The crucial event appears to have been Andersen 's involvement with the Fortune 500 firm Waste Management .
The waste haulage firm was forced to admit to improper accounting between 1993 and 1996 and restated $ 1bn of earnings .
In June last year , Andersen entered into a $ 7 m settlement with the securities and exchange commission in which it undertook not to make the same mistakes again .
Assistant US attorney Sam Buell argued that fear of breaching that "" probation "" prompted the document destruction at Enron .
He also said the previous experiences would have given Andersen partners knowledge of the kind of documents that investigators were seeking .
Evidence can also be presented relating to Andersen and another US firm , Sunbeam , which went into bankruptcy last year .
Andersen agreed to pay $ 110 m to Sunbeam shareholders to settle a lawsuit alleging the firm helped the appliance maker to inflate profits in 1997 - 98 .
Rusty Hardin , the colourful Texan lawyer defending Andersen , told the judge that introducing the former cases would unfairly damage his client in the eyes of the jury .
He accused the prosecutors of "" throwing things on the wall to see what would stick "" .
In his opening statement , assistant US attorney Matt Friedrich told the 16 jurors that Andersen had begun plotting the destruction of Enron documents in early October when it first realised that the energy firm was crumbling .
Andersen "" saw a window of opportunity between the time they knew the law was going to come and the time the law got there .
And they would use that window to sanitise their files . ""
Andersen had been too closely entwined with Enron , and partners knew they could be in "" deep , deep trouble "" when investigators began work .
With typical flamboyance , Mr Hardin described the case against Andersen as "" one of the greatest tragedies in the criminal justice system "" .
Wielding a wad of bound documents , he said less than one box of records per member of Andersen 's Enron audit team had been shredded .
"" This is an obstruction of justice case based on the evidence of documents we preserved and gave to them .
Is there a certain irony in that ? ""
Prosecutors , he said , were presenting Andersen as an organised crime outfit .
If there had been a conspiracy , it was the most "" incredible incompetent conspiracy "" that left a trail of clues in open discussions , emails and conference calls .
"" There was no massive destruction of documents .
When this is over you will not find a corrupt persuader , you will find a destroyed company . ""
He also urged that Andersen employees should not be held accountable for the acts of particular partners .
The hearing continues ."
2002-05-09,"Arthur Andersen told financial watchdogs it had "" learned its lesson "" after settling an accounting scandal at US firm Waste Management last year and assured officials that there was no need for further sanctions .
In the second day of testimony in the criminal trial for obstruction of justice , federal prosecutors attempted to portray Andersen as a company that had repeatedly broken the rules .
The accounting firm is accused of shredding "" literally tons "" of documents related to its audit of Enron , the failed energy firm , when it was aware they would be sought by federal investigators .
As the trial in Houston continued , so did the break - up of the firm .
It reached agreement to sell as many as 24 of its business consulting offices to rival KPMG for $ 284 m ( £ 197 m ) .
The offices had accounted for about 15 % of Andersen revenues .
Securities and exchange commission official Thomas Newkirk gave evidence yesterday on the restatement of earnings at Waste Management and another US firm , Sunbeam .
Both had been Andersen clients .
Mr Newkirk said that after reaching a $ 7 m settlement with the SEC over the $ 1bn restatement by Waste Management , Andersen partner Gary Goolsby had offered assurances that there would be no repeat of the scandal .
It was Mr Goolsby who signed the settlement .
"" I recall him saying on several occasions that Arthur Andersen had learned its lesson , "" Mr Newkirk said .
Rusty Hardin , the lawyer defending Andersen , had attempted to prevent the admission of evidence on the prior cases .
At one point yesterday he complained that he had faced "" six hours of volunteering [ information ] about irrelevant cases "" .
Mr Hardin sought to discredit the SEC , noting the speed with which the conviction had been brought against Andersen and the reliance placed upon the Wall Street Journal as a source of information . ""
Do we need the SEC when we have the Wall Street Journal ? "" he asked .
He asked whether Mr Newkirk was biased about Andersen . ""
Did you give a talk in December 2001 suggesting in any way you were going to get Arthur Andersen ? ""
Mr Hardin asked .
"" I certainly did not , "" the SEC official replied .
By introducing the previous cases , the government hopes to show that Andersen shredded the Enron documents because it was aware of the "" deep , deep trouble "" it faced because in the Waste Management settlement it had submitted to an injunction against further wrongdoing .
The defence counters that the current case against Andersen is without precedent and the firm would not have been aware of the consequences of the Enron investigation .
The key witness , David Duncan , is expected to appear today .
He is the former lead partner on the Enron auditing account and has already pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
He made a plea deal with the government in return for his testimony .
A second SEC official , who opened the original inquiry into Enron , said interest had been sparked by the sudden departure of former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling in August last year .
The notes and records kept by auditors were "" critical to any investigation "" ."
2002-05-09,"Dynegy , the troubled US energy trader , came under the cosh again yesterday as the securities and exchange commission said it was upgrading an inquiry into the company 's natural gas supply deal into a full - scale investigation .
Loss - making Dynegy , whose gas storage platform off the Humberside coast at Rough was hit by a factory fishing vessel yesterday , forcing staff to evacuate , has lost more than half its value since Enron collapsed and pulled out of a $ 9bn ( £ 6bn ) deal to take over its rival .
The Houston - based group said it would "" continue to co - operate fully "" with the SEC , America 's premier stock market regulator , over its Project Alpha , a five - year natural gas deal signed just over a year ago with a Lousiana supplier .
Its shares fell sharply , slipping at various points below $ 10 .
The deal , which provides Dynegy with some 8bn cu ft of natural gas a month , brought a tax benefit of $ 80 m but also accusations of misleading accounting methods .
It has denied suggestions of manipulating prices during California 's power crisis ."
2002-05-10,"David Duncan , the former Arthur Andersen partner who ran the Enron account , was yesterday described as someone who stretched accounting rules "" to excess "" .
As the criminal trial , in which Andersen is charged with obstruction of justice , moved toward the end of its first week in Houston , federal prosecutors continued to portray a firm that had repeatedly bent the rules .
Andersen is charged with destroying "" literally tons "" of Enron documents to keep them from the hands of federal investigators .
Mr Duncan pleaded guilty to the charge last month and his testimony will be pivotal to the outcome of the case .
Ben Neuhausen , an Andersen partner for the past 17 years , told the court of clashes between the accounting firm 's Chicago head office and the team that worked on Enron in Houston .
He said Enron was "" very aggressive .
They were always probing the limits of any given transaction or issue "" .
Mr Duncan , he said , also "" pushed for aggressive interpretations of accounting standards "" .
Prosecutors believe they only need to prove that one member of staff broke the law to convict the entire firm .
The aim appears to be to build motive for the document destruction .
Mr Neuhausen said Mr Duncan had lobbied to allow Enron to account for its four Raptor entities together , allowing the profits of two to cover the losses of the other two .
Carl Bass , a member of the Andersen standards group , said the Raptors were separate entities and needed to be treated as such - something that would have led to Enron recording a loss .
They ignored the advice and had Mr Bass removed from the account .
It was only later when the Chicago Andersen offices realised what had happened that Enron had to restate its earnings .
Mr Neuhausen also said Mr Duncan had broken with an approach agreed by Andersen on the treatment of the $ 1bn charge disclosed by Enron last year .
The standards group said the sum should not be referred to as "" non - recurring "" but the phrase did appear ."
2002-05-14,"A senior partner at Arthur Andersen yesterday denied that an email asking staff to comply with the accounting firm 's document retention policy was a coded message for the destruction of Enron papers .
The Andersen criminal trial moved into its second week yesterday with the continuing testimony of Amelia Ripepi , head of the accounting firm 's professional standards committee .
The firm is on trial for obstruction of justice for allegedly shredding Enron documents to thwart a gov ernment investigation into the collapse of the energy firm .
Ms Ripepi said the now notorious email sent by in - house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple in October reminding staff of the firm 's policy on which documents should be kept , and which destroyed was an innocent reminder .
"" I did not take from her comments that it was an indication that someone ought to destroy something , "" she said .
In a letter on Friday Ms Temple invoked her fifth amendment right against incrimination but in congressional hearings in January , she denied that she had instructed anyone to destroy documents .
Ms Ripepi said on Friday that in a conference call , three days before the shredding is alleged to have begun , she had warned that problems with the Enron audit could result in disciplinary action against David Duncan , the former partner who ran the business from Andersen 's Houston offices .
But Ms Ripepi 's testimony was overshadowed by the expected appearance of Mr Duncan , star witness for the prosecution .
Prosecutors hope the testimony of Mr Duncan , who has already pleaded guilty , will be the key evidence , believing they only need to prove that one employee deliberately destroyed Enron - related documents to keep them from the hands of investigators to convict the accounting firm .
But he needs to be shown to have acted in the interest of the firm .
Andersen defence lawyers , led by the larger than life Rusty Hardin , had hoped to discredit Mr Duncan by showing that he had only pleaded guilty at the eleventh hour to protect himself ."
2002-05-15,"Arthur Andersen , the accountancy firm on trial for obstruction of justice , considered dropping Enron as a client in February 2001 because it feared the consequences of the energy firm 's recklessness .
The concerns were disclosed yesterday by David Duncan , the former Andersen partner who resumed his testimony in a Houston court .
Mr Duncan ran the Enron account and is expected to be pivotal in the government 's case against the accountancy firm .
Prosecutors have accused Andersen of destroying Enron audit documents to thwart an investigation into the energy firm 's bankruptcy .
He said a high - level meeting in February debated whether Enron , worth an annual $ 58 m ( £ 40 m ) to Andersen , should be retained .
A memo from the meeting described Enron as "" aggressive "" and continually searching for "" where the lines of acceptability are "" .
The accounting firm also questioned its future independence because fees from Enron , already its second largest client , were growing by about 20 % annually .
"" It was not inconceivable they would continue to grow and reach very high levels , and I wanted to know from the group if there were some parameters where that would become troublesome from an independence standpoint and how we could manage that . ""
Senior partners told Mr Duncan that fees could eventually reach $ 100 m a year without a problem as long as Andersen did not begin taking on management responsibilities at Enron , he said .
Mr Duncan , who has already pleaded guilty to the charges , said he was aware of the potential consequences of a federal investigation .
In trying to establish a motive for the shredding , prosecutors last week cited a case involving Andersen and waste haulage firm Waste Management .
Andersen last year agreed to pay $ 7 m in a settlement with the securities and exchange commission and undertook that there would be no repeat of the affair .
Mr Duncan , 43 , said yesterday he was aware that Andersen had been on""probation "" which meant any further problems would cause the SEC to come down hard .
He worked at Andersen for 20 years and before being fired in January was earning $ 700,000 a year .
Starting his testimony on Monday , Mr Duncan said bluntly : "" I obstructed justice .
I instructed people on the Enron engagement team to follow the document retention policy , which I knew would lead to the destruction of documents . ""
He faces a prison term of up to 10 years .
Much depends on the interpretation of an email from in - house counsel Nancy Temple sent on October 12 reminding staff of the Andersen document retention policy .
That called for the destruction of drafts , redundant papers and other extraneous materials .
Prosecutors complained yesterday to Judge Melinda Harmon about the conduct of Andersen 's lead attorney , the flamboyant Texan Rusty Hardin .
Mr Hardin described the government lawyers as "" whiners "" and said : "" This is the most silly , thin - skinned motion that I can imagine . """
2002-05-15,"Vosper Thornycroft , the warship builder , yesterday changed course as a support services group by appointing a new chief executive and chairman and signalling plans to move to headquarters on the outskirts of Southampton .
Martin Jay , chief executive since 1989 when the end of the cold war heralded a substantial downturn in warship building , is to make way on July 1 for Paul Lester , group managing director at Balfour Beatty .
Mr Jay , architect of the revised strategy of building support services to account for two - thirds of current sales , is to step up to chairman , replacing Lord Wakeham , the Tory peer who will carry on as deputy chairman for just a year as he sheds more directorships following the Enron debacle .
The changes come ahead of the group 's annual meeting on July 5 which will be asked to approve a share split , offering four new shares for each old one in a move said by Mr Lester to make them "" more affordable "" to investors .
Shares changed hands at nearly £ 15 yesterday .
The company is also changing its name to VT Group , while retaining the Vosper Thornycroft brand for its warship business which , ironically , is now set to grow more substantially as defence budgets increase for the first time in a decade .
Mr Lester , in charge of construction and facilities management at Balfour Beatty , said he hoped to step up the pace of Vosper 's outsourcing business which is already set to grow by up to 20 % a year after six acquisitions last year .
But both he and Mr Jay signalled expansion in the warship business which has been boosted by the award of a £ 200 m contract to build the "" front third "" , or 20 % , of the first six Type 45 destroyers for BAE Systems and the Royal Navy . ""
This gives us a secure order for six years and the opportunity to get a follow - on order for another six , taking us up to 2010 , "" Mr Lester said .
Mr Jay said Vosper also hoped to win work for its new Portsmouth yard on both the two new aircraft carriers and new Type 23 frigates .
"" There 's no prospect of us giving up warship building , "" said Mr Jay .
"" The whole success of our Type 45 campaign was based on the belief that the ministry of defence wanted alternative suppliers to BAE . ""
Vosper , which has seen its order book increase £ 500 m to a record £ 2bn this year , with 80 % of that in support services , reported annual sales up 26 % at £ 479 m and operating profits up 14 % at £ 34.1 m .
Pretax earnings rose marginally because of the spate of acquisitions ."
2002-05-18,"David Duncan , the sacked Arthur Andersen partner , yesterday told the federal court in Houston he had not told his 100-strong staff to "" destroy "" Enron - related documents .
In a testimony that appeared to strengthen the case for Andersen in its obstruction of justice trial , Mr Duncan said he mentioned his firm 's document retention policy during a 30-minute "" pep talk "" to the audit team last October but did not order destruction of material .
Mr Duncan , who ran the Enron audit business , has pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and is the government 's star witness .
"" I did n't want them to do anything more or less than comply with the policy , but I wanted them to work toward that end , "" he said .
"" I was probably more focused on the notion of getting rid of extraneous information . ""
Earlier the judge said she would review alleged inconsistencies between government summaries of interviews with Mr Duncan and his testimony this week .
The defence has tried to discredit Mr Duncan and show he pleaded guilty to reduce his time in prison .
Judge Melinda Harmon erupted on Thursday , criticising the "" underhand "" tactics of the defence .
Defence lawyer Rusty Hardin said to her : "" Your bias toward us is clearly reflected in your outburst .
For you to impugn my integrity and our effort , I deeply resent it . ""
The judge replied : "" Well resent away , "" and stormed out ."
2002-05-20,"Never has the role of the independent non - executive director been so much in the spotlight .
Recent dramatic examples of corporate failure such as Enron and Marconi , where shareholder value evaporated , have highlighted yet again the need for good corporate governance .
The government clearly attaches a good deal of importance to the issue , having called for pension fund trustees and fund managers to intervene more proactively in companies , and set up a review of the role of non - executives , headed by Derek Higgs .
However , opinion on the value of the non - executive is not unanimous .
To take just one high profile example , in his closing address as president of the Institute of Directors , Lord Young questioned whether there was any need for non - executive directors at all .
So why should we care about non - executives ?
And what should we expect from them ?
To take Lord Young 's point , what can non - executives do that full - time executive directors ca n't ?
The answer is simple .
As investors , we are looking increasingly to the independent directors on the boards of UK plc to be more effective in protecting shareholders ' interests .
The National Association of Pension Funds ' view is that it 's time for companies to be honest with themselves and recognise that a sea - change in perception is under way .
Boards need voices among their members which are not constrained , be it for financial or fraternal reasons , from exercising independent judgment , and who are not afraid to challenge boardroom consensus if this means better returns for investors as opposed to simply a larger , but poorer , company .
Independent non - executives need to be , and be seen as , the representatives of the vast body of shareholders ; and within the company as a whole , not just the boardroom .
Enron and Marconi surely bring home the message that taking on the role of an independent director is not simply about "" being there "" .
Being an independent director is about playing an active role ; contributing to strategy , testing the conclusions and actions proposed by executive directors and playing a leading role in areas such as audit and executive remuneration .
Rather than confining themselves to the lunch room and boardroom , they should be talking and listening to people at all levels of the company .
They should be asking the kind of awkward questions which would otherwise go unasked and unanswered .
Of course those who say that non - executives can not become involved in the detail of corporate operations are right , but the point is , independent non - executives do n't need to .
It is true that even the best prepared and fully briefed independent non - executive will not necessarily be able to uncover any and every misdemeanour by executive directors who wish to cover their tracks .
By insisting on timely , relevant and accurate information and by exercising effective oversight of strategy and internal controls , good independent non - executives not only oversee the running of the company but also help to shape the ethics of the enterprise .
And companies which operate well from this perspective also tend to do well financially too .
To do this of course takes time - certainly more time than the average non - executive director commits to each company at present .
It is extremely difficult to say what the right amount of time is , but in general we feel it is likely to be hard to manage more than five non - executive directorships effectively .
This may come as a shock to those with more non - executive directorships than fingers , but in return for a more active role , it is only fair they should be better rewarded for each post they do take on .
This month , the NAPF published a guide for independent directors aimed at helping them understand investor concerns , and to encourage them to greater effectiveness .
It should also prove valuable reading for pension fund trustees , elected representatives , fund managers and all those interested in the health and prosperity of the companies in which they invest .
Let 's hope that when he comes to look at the role of non - executives in our society , Derek Higgs finds it useful too . ·

2002-05-23,"A Senate committee yesterday voted to subpoena members of the Bush administration to detail contacts between the White House and the failed energy firm Enron .
The move by the Senate governmental affairs committee , carrying out one of the dozen or so investigations into the Enron bankruptcy , thrusts the US government back to the forefront of the scandal .
The committee is issuing two subpoenas for documents , one to the office of President Bush and a second to that of the vice - president , Dick Cheney .
A spokeswoman for the White House said the administration was bemused by the move . ""
Senator Lieberman 's subpoenas are unnecessary and we are perplexed that he chose to pursue this confrontational approach rather than work cooperatively with the White House . ""
An initial batch of information has already been prepared to hand over .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut Democrat who leads the committee , has expressed increasing frustration with the Bush administration and said a week ago that he would seek subpoena powers .
The committee sent its first request for details relating to the government 's involvement with Enron in March , and has since traded several letters with officials .
"" This back and forth has continued , which has ultimately frustrated the committee 's work and exhausted my patience , "" Mr Lieberman said yesterday .
In the most recent letter to the White House counsel Alberto Gonzales on May 17 , Mr Lieberman said he had received virtually no information . ""
Indeed , the only material you have sent us is copies of letters responding to other Congressional inquiries and a transcript of a presidential press conference , "" he wrote .
Enron , once the seventh largest company in the US , became the country 's largest bankruptcy to date in December after it emerged that the firm had hidden huge debts in offshore ventures .
That sparked events that rapidly led to the collapse of the company .
The Bush administration 's links to Enron came under intense scrutiny at the beginning of the year .
Enron had provided millions of dollars to President Bush 's election campaign ; the president in turn referred to Enron 's former chief executive and fellow Texan Kenneth Lay as "" Kenny boy "" .
The company had also spent heavily on lobbying efforts to deregulate electricity markets and sought government assistance on a number of overseas projects .
The White House has acknowledged that Mr Cheney or his energy taskforce aides met Enron executives six times last year but claims that the energy company 's precarious financial position was never discussed .
Mr Lay also made a series of phone calls to members of the Bush administration , including treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and commerce secretary Don Evans as Enron spiraled into collapse .
The decision to issue subpoenas followed a fractious two - hour meeting of the Senate committee during which Mr Lieberman was accused of being politically motivated .
A vote on whether to take the step was split down party lines - with the Democrats tipping the balance 9 - 8 .
The highest ranking Republican on the committee , Senator Fred Thompson , said the subpoena request was premature and too broad .
"" There has been no indication that the executive office of the president has had any involvement in any of these matters , "" he said ."
2002-05-25,"A corporate collapse similar to the fall of US energy giant Enron could happen in the UK , according to nearly two - thirds of in - house company lawyers ..
A survey by Legal Director magazine , conducted in conjunction with law firm Halliwell Landau , also found that 15 per cent of lawyers thought such a corporate calamity ' very likely ' to occur here .
In - house lawyers are now the main source of advice for boards of directors on corporate governance issues .
De spite the nervousness of the legal advisers , however , there has been a change of attitude among boards of directors to matters of corporate governance .
Clive Garston , senior partner in Halliwell Landau 's London office , said : ' When the first Cadbury Report into corporate governance came out , a lot of boards of directors felt it was an issue that would be here today and gone tomorrow .
There is not much of that culture around now . '
Lawyers polled in the survey were gloomy about the possibility of an Enron - style collapse , despite reporting that most of their companies complied with the requirements of the Turnbull report on corporate governance .
This set out how companies should identify , evaluate and manage risks and assess internal control systems .
Nearly three - quarters of respondents said their companies did comply with Turnbull , compared with just three in five when a similar survey was conducted 12 months ago .
The survey identified a demand among in - house lawyers for non - executive directors to have their duties and responsibilities clearly defined , or to sign up to a code of conduct .
Nearly 90 per cent of lawyers said there should be a limit on the number of directorships that non - executives should be able to hold .
Nearly two - thirds of the lawyers thought non - executives should have fixed - term appointments and should serve for a stipulated maximum period ."
2002-05-25,"Arthur Andersen suffered another blow yesterday when Texas officials filed a motion to revoke the accountancy firm 's licence to carry out audits in the state .
The Texas State Board of Public Accountancy also said it was seeking at least $ 1 m in fines for Andersen 's role in the collapse of Houston - based energy firm Enron .
The motion was filed as federal prosecutors moved to wrap up their case against Andersen in the trial for obstruction of justice .
Andersen is accused of shredding "" literally tons "" of Enron audit documents to keep them out of the hands of investigators .
The Texas accounting board 's filing suggested it had already made up its mind regarding Andersen . ""
Andersen 's failure to comply with professional standards was not the result of the actions of one ' rogue ' partner or ' out of control ' office , but resulted from Andersen 's organisational structure and corporate climate that created a lack of independence , integrity and objectivity , "" it said .
In court , Andersen has tried to argue that David Duncan , the partner in charge of the Houston offices , had acted alone in ordering shredding .
They have also argued that no material documents were destroyed .
The motion will likely be heard in the next 90 days .
Andersen said it was regrettable that the Texas board has rushed to judgment .
The board is seeking $ 1000 from the firm for every alleged violation of accounting rules - a list it said could "" number into the thousands "" .
Further evidence against Andersen was presented in court .
Andersen 's chief records keeper said the firm had shredded up to 20 trunks of documents , each weighing 100 pounds , in a three - day period last October .
Sharon Thibaut , who oversaw records in the accounting firm 's Houston office , said the request for the trunks came in on October 24 , around the time that Enron 's troubles began to mount .
She said the call was so urgent that staff had to empty trunks as they arrived and send them back to the 100-strong Enron audit team for refilling ."
2002-06-05,"An immediate shake - up in corporate governance to prevent a British version of the Enron scandal is demanded in a report published today by one of the UK 's leading actuarial consultancy firms .
RSM Robson Rhodes argues that there should be restrictions on the kind of consultancy work offered by accountancy firms to clients for which they already provide audit services .
It also calls for the combined code on corporate governance to be a compulsory requirement for firms listed on the London stock exchange .
And RSM says at least half of listed company boards should be made up of independent directors rather than the present requirement of one sixth .
It argues that some of the changes should be imple mented by the government and financial services authority within 12 months . ""
Creating a climate of genuine independence is essential to building more stable and productive businesses , "" says Chris Connor , senior partner at RSM , the world 's eighth largest accountancy and consultancy firm .
"" Not only have public per ceptions of auditors been compromised , there is also a sense that too many boards tick boxes rather than open them and bow to conventional wisdom rather than challenge it , "" he continued .
The report points out that the whole country 's economic well - being is linked to the way British companies are run , be it through pensions , jobs or money for public services .
The government is already looking at the role of non - executive directors and on the way financial reporting and auditing is undertaken .
RSM believes that companies should be encouraged to seek independent directors from the public and not - for - profit sectors and should publicly advertise independent director positions .
Listed firms should produce an operating and financial review which details non - financial , as well as financial , measures of the business to provide a better assessment of current and future risks and prospects .
"" To avoid another Enron experience we need a corporate governance system that prevents problems starting rather than trying to correct them once they have happened , "" says Anthony Carey , a partner at RSM ."
2002-06-05,"The Enron scandal took centre stage in Washington again yesterday , with the White House giving a Senate investigating committee access to more than 1,745 pages of documents relating to contacts between President Bush and officials from the bankrupt energy group .
Mr Bush , whose successful electoral campaign was given huge financial backing by Houston - based Enron , has so far refused to hand over what are considered the most vital documents , however , arguing there must first be agreement on procedures to safeguard the security and confidentiality of the papers .
The documents were subpoenaed by the Senate governmental affairs committee which had set a June 3 deadline for delivery of the information , which was only just met .
The office of Mr Bush and his deputy Dick Cheney said no instance had yet been found of Enron officials asking anyone in the White House for help before the company 's bankruptcy last December .

The combined Atos KPMG Consulting will employ 30,000 staff in 30 countries , but last night there were fears about job prospects for the new 1,600 UK and 1,200 Dutch staff .
Paris - listed , Amsterdam - based Atos declined to comment on the issue .
Last month it laid off 1,000 of its own employees .
The agreement will mean substantial cash payments to the 700 UK partners of both KPMG Consulting and the wider accounting group KPMG , which began separating its consulting operations in 1999 .
No one was willing to comment on the scale of those payments but both sides said the new enlarged group would compete more effectively in a tough market . ""
In Atos Origin management we have found an organisation that shares our vision of what it will take to succeed in the marketplace , "" said Jeremy Anderson , managing partner of KPMG Consulting in the UK , who becomes a member of the Atos board .
"" We see this merger as an important step towards the creation of an elite global player in the business consulting and technology integration market . ""
KPMG Consulting in the US was floated on the stock market last year and was the only other group alongside Atos bidding to take control of the UK and Dutch arms , which have been operating independently from the accountancy side for 18 months .
Under pressure over alleged conflicts of interest , the large accountancy firms have gradually been parting company with their consultancy arms .
This has become even more acute following the bankruptcy of Houston - based energy group Enron which has triggered the break up of the Andersen empire .

An influential committee of the New York Stock Exchange believes the boards of US companies should be have a majority of independent directors who would meet without the full - time executives .
Mr Higgs , who was appointed by Gordon Brown and Patricia Hewitt , the trade and industry secretary , will lookat the lessons that can be learnt from foreign boardrooms .
His review , which is open to consultation until September 6 , was welcomed by the Association of British Insurers , whose members control about 20 % of the stock market through investments on behalf of insurance policies and pension funds .
"" We are pleased at the broad range of questions Mr Higgs is asking , "" said Peter Montagnon , head of investment affairs at the ABI .
"" In particular we think it will help to have a closer look at the role of audit committees in the wake of Enron as well as to have a clearer elaboration on the position of the senior independent director . ""
Mr Higgs , who was appointed to head the review after a number of other City figures shied away , is also going to look at how the role of non - executive directors differs between large and small stock market - listed companies ."
2002-06-09,"Just two years ago , Enron 's Ken Lay , WorldCom 's Bernie Ebbers and Tyco 's Dennis Kozlowski , three of the most influential businessmen in the world , were lionised as epitomising all that was best in American capitalism .
They were , we were told , dealmakers and innovators standing in stark contrast to European chief executives presiding over staid companies languishing in over - regulated , over - taxed and underperforming economies .
If only Europe could adopt Wall Street 's stock markets , incentives and financial freedoms , ran the argument , Europe , too , could share the benefits of American - style capitalism .
For much of the last decade , the American economy has been uncritically admired as a standard - bearer of enterprise , dynamism and innovation .
And the means to that end - extravagantly paid executives consecrating all to the maximisation of profits - have been seen as a necessary price to be paid for growth and productivity .
Now America is learning the hard way the importance of more prosaic virtues such as integrity and patient investment .
The scale of the fall from grace of America 's corporate leaders is stunning .
Each one has been exposed for exploiting a lack of regulation to manipulate their balance sheets , profit and loss accounts and tax liabilities .
Last week , in the latest scandal , Kozlowski was charged with personally evading tax .
Tyco is now investigating to see if the impropriety encompassed the affairs of the company .
Enron and WorldCom have been laid equally low .
Meanwhile , investment banks Merrill Lynch and CSFB have each been fined $ 100 million for bad practice .
Enron 's accountants , Andersen , have collapsed .
The fantastic scale of such personal greed , fraud and impropriety not only casts a long shadow over the glib argument that American free market capitalism is a model for the world .
It is also seriously undermining hopes for a US economic recovery .
Wall Street touched an eight - month low on Friday as investors become ever more wary of the credibility of many American companies ' stated profits .
The Augean stables need to be cleaned urgently , with new standards of accounting and corporate behaviour policed by tough regulation .
Equally , Britain and Europe must be more cautious in future about simply imitating what we can now see is some of the worst of unregulated capitalism , rather than some of the best ."
2002-06-09,"Would you rely on a journalist to tell you what you need to know about something important ?
More - or less - than a lawyer or accountant ( remember Enron ) ?
What about a politician ?
Stanley Baldwin , British Prime Minister in the 1930s , tarred journalists with a phrase that has stuck in the memory , accusing us of wielding ' power without responsibility - the prerogative of the harlot through the ages ' .
That does n't mean we 're amoral .
Journalists aim to report the facts without fear or favour , a task that can sometimes require a burning sense of duty to the truth as we see it .
We present the world , as Walter Cronkite used to say , ' the way it is ' .
But these descriptions of journalistic practice rest on a classic liberal theory of journalism that usually remains tacit and unexamined .
One participant , Bob Jobbins , then head of news at the BBC World Service , gave a rare articulation of the theory . ""
Conflict resolution , "" he declared , "" may be made harder or easier as a result of my reporting .
But that 's a judgement that is made afterwards . ""
But experience has taught us that life is more complicated .
A media - savvy world
The very air we breathe has become saturated with information - invisible digital signals , bringing the news to us when we switch on the mobile phone , pick up emails , wait in the departure lounge or walk along the street .
And of course , it 's there , 24 hours a day , on radio and TV .
Many people who 've grown up in this information age have acquired a profound understanding of how news works .
Maybe from teachers or professors , since Media Studies is a boom subject in many countries .
In other cases a lifetime 's immersion in the news , as reader , viewer and listener , inculcates an instinctive grasp of process .
Moreover , news is now global .
On the streets of any shanty town , corrugated iron roofs vie for space with satellite dishes .
It means that actors in news stories all over the world , from corporate PR , through apparently unsophisticated militias in poor countries , to sensation - hungry celebrities on the make and members of the public at the centre of ' human interest ' stories , all turn out to be media - savvy .
Journalists may still say that ' we just report the facts ' , but increasingly , in this media - savvy world , the facts are being shaped or even created for us to report .
There is no way for journalists to know that what they are seeing or hearing would be happening in the same way - if at all - if no - one ever thought we would cover it .
The ' War on Terrorism ' Once bombs began dropping last October , a media village sprang up , about a mile inside the Afghan border with Pakistan .
Nothing was actually happening there , you understand , but it did create an ' Afghanistan dateline ' for reports of the conflict - a must - have in a highly competitive commercial market for news .
In this situation , the simple expedient of reading agency copy down a satphone to your correspondent in the field , who then repeats it back to your studio presenter in a live two - way , is indispensable - but only goes so far .
Sooner or later you want original material , which is where the Northern Alliance media campaign came in .
Television teams would be escorted to see our trusty allies ' on patrol ' or ' clearing territory ' - one enterprising Belgian crew showed gunmen firing on orders , not from their commanding officer , but from the producer of another TV station , who could check first that the camera was running .
Then there was ' the biggest explosion since World War Two ' when Marines taking part in Operation Snipe ' discovered ' a cave full of ammunition , presented as belonging to the Taliban or al Qaeda .
The more curious reporters asked around and were told that its owner actually owed allegiance to the other - our own - side , and that the Brits had been told about it months earlier - but those reports came through after the dust had settled .
Back on the home beat , there was a dripfeed of ' intelligence reports ' supposedly linking Iraq with the atrocity of last September 11 .
And all the while , for those sated with serious news , there was the return of Survivor and Big Brother
, their competitors adept at cultivating outrageous ' personalities ' , saleable to the tabloids , and keen to follow past winners
Charlotte ' the Harlot ' Hobrough and Welsh hairdresser Helen into a media career .
The Feedback Loop How can any of these people know what to do , in order to be reported in the way they imagine will bring them fame , fortune or political gain ?
Only from their experience as readers , listeners and viewers .
It means that when reporters report the facts today , we are adding another layer to the collective understanding of how similar facts are likely to be reported tomorrow .
That understanding then conditions people 's future behaviour , whether consciously or not .
This is the Feedback Loop , a way of describing the influence of news on the complex processes at work in world events .
Isolating it as a measurable factor in those events can be like trying to retrieve a single colour from a tin of mixed paints .
But its presence , no matter how diluted , remains visible as part of the blend .
The writing is on the wall - every journalist bears , at any time , an unquantifiable proportion of the responsibility for what happens next .
An ethic of responsibility If the responsibility is unquantifiable , is it also unpredictable ?
Or can we trace the cumulative influence of particular patterns of reporting on the course of subsequent events ?
That might lead to uncomfortable ethical questions .
Can we make judgements , about the consequences of our reporting , before and during the reporting itself ?
How would those judgements affect the way we report ?
The prime issue of responsibility in the Reporting the World discussions has concerned the way we explain violence - how the explanation arises from , or is constructed by , the choices we make about what to report and how to report it .
Think back to September 11 .
New York Magazine 's Michael Wolff , reviewing the coverage offered by US media , noticed how dramatic blow - by - blow accounts had mostly drowned out in - depth investigation and explanation of the purpose and strategy behind the suicide hijackings .
This had left us in a state of "" notionlessness "" , he said : "" knowing almost nothing , we 've settled for identifying the villain as some pure spasm of all - powerful , apocalyptic irrationality "" .
The explanation arising from so many accounts is , as Gore Vidal observed , that America 's enemies are driven by "" motiveless malignity . ""
The impact on policy
It 's a policy - maker 's lament that so many policies have to be made as remedies to unexpected problems - what another British Prime Minister , Harold Macmillan , famously called "" events , dear boy , events "" .
In the Feedback Loop , as any policy is being formulated , a calculation is underway about whether it is likely to be reported as a realistic solution .
The calculation - and , therefore , the policy - depends , in part , on how the problem has been diagnosed .
Diagnose violence as autistic - mad , bad , irrational - and you can more easily accept violence as the remedy . '
String 'em up - it 's the only language they understand ' .
The alternative is to diagnose it as arising from unresolved issues of structural and cultural violence .
For journalists that would mean spelling out the links with - to take just a few examples - the impoverishment of millions in the oil - rich Arab world ; strife in the Israeli - occupied Palestinian territories and the deprivation and ravages of colonialism that reduced Afghanistan to such a condition that the Taliban could take over in the first place .
Shortly after September 11 , the Pew Research Center found that most opinion leaders in most of the world believed fellow citizens in their own countries saw the attack on America as ' blowback ' - a malign growth from a seed planted , or at least incubated , by American foreign policies .
How do we examine this claim ?
How is US policy implicated , if at all , in the conditions listed here ?
How are the connections understood in the bazaars of Cairo or the coffee bars of Riyadh ?
What about on the streets of Croydon , or Burnley , or the West Midlands ?
What is going on in our own society ?
What happens to young men from Muslim communities , that leads them to Guantanamo Bay by way of Kandahar or Kashmir ?
Anyone who had read White Teeth , the award - winning novel by Zadie Smith , would have been struck by its prescience as news of the ' British Taliban ' filtered out .
Among other things , it is a highly impressive , sustained imaginative treatment of the interplay of factors that go to construct fundamentalisms in a multi - cultural society .
But how often in the journalistic endeavours of the last nine months can we find the sustained , factual investigation of how this actually works ?
To report on these aspects of conflicts is to send another incentive around the Feedback Loop , making it appear more logical to respond with what European Commissioner Chris Patten called ' smart development assistance ' rather than ' smart bombs ' .
It is not for journalists to advocate one approach or the other , but , if we are to command any kind of public trust and understanding , we must be able to equip readers and audiences to reach their own informed judgements about the relative merits of alternative policy responses to important events .
The liberal theory demands balance and fairness in reporting , making news an essential civic tool in a democracy .
The evidence is that to get them , this theory needs updating to take account of the effect we journalists have on the facts we report .
Only then can we keep our footing on the tricky territory of a commercialised , media - savvy world , thinking through stories for ourselves from the solid ground offered by a reliable set of first principles .

2002-06-14,"Jurors struggling to reach a verdict in the Arthur Andersen criminal trial yesterday hinted that they were considering a conviction of the accounting firm .
The jury asked Judge Melinda Harmon if they all had to agree on who at the accounting firm acted as the "" corrupt persuader "" and caused others at the firm to destroy Enron - related documents .
The note was sent to the judge an hour into the eighth day of deliberations .
Judge Harmon sent the jury back after they said they were unable to reach a verdict late on Wednesday night .
Yesterday 's note read : "" If each of us believes that one Andersen agent acted knowingly with corrupt intent , is it for all of us to believe it was the same agent ?
Can one believe it was agent A , another believe it was agent B , and another believe it was agent C ?
The government argued that four dif ferent people were guilty .
The jury is asking if we all need to believe that the same person is guilty . ""
Andersen is on trial for obstruction of justice .
Government prosecutors claim that the accounting firm destroyed "" literally tons "" of documents related to the audit of Enron to thwart a federal investigation into the energy firm .
If found guilty Andersen faces a $ 500,000 ( £ 340,000 ) fine and will lose its licence to audit public companies in the US .
The jury subsequently made a number of other requests .
They asked for a rereading of parts of the testimony of David Duncan , the fired partner who ran the Enron account from the firm 's Houston offices as well as some of the testimony of Amy Ripepi , who ran the Andersen in - house standards group .
They also wanted a training tape outlining the firm 's document retention policy replayed .
Lawyers from both sides were locked in meetings with Judge Harmon at midday in Houston to press their arguments for how she should instruct the jury .
Prosecutors will argue that the jury may disagree about which Andersen worker was at fault .
The deadlock in the jury on Wednesday raised fears that a mis - trial could be declared , delivering a damaging blow to the government 's assault on white - collar crime ."
2002-06-16,"The future of the international accountants Arthur Andersen was in doubt last night after it was found guilty of obstructing justice as auditor for the failed energy firm Enron .
A federal jury in Houston , Texas , decided that Andersen ' criminally intended ' to keep Enron 's books away from a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry .
The jury had deliberated for more than nine days after a five - week trial which heard that the the auditor 's staff went on shredding documents for more than a week after being ordered to stop .
The verdict means Andersen can no longer audit the books of public companies , and faces fines of up to twice whatever value the judge puts on the results of its actions ."
2002-06-16,"Martha Steward , the all - American Queen of Clean who captivates the nation with tips on such matters as how to keep a peeled banana fresh - is to be unpeeled herself .
The diva of domesticity and all things proper is under investigation by a Congressional committee for alleged insider dealing in the latest in a run of corporate scandals which began with the disgraced Enron Corporation earlier this summer .
The case involves Stewart 's friend ( and daughter 's lover ) , the celebrity immunologist - turned - entrepreneur and
New York socialite Dr Sam Waksal , who was arrested on Wednesday on nine charges of conspiracy , securities fraud and perjury .
The scandal concerns the ImClone biotech company , of which Waksal was chief executive until he handed over to his brother , Harlan , last month , and for which Stewart 's personal broker , the dashing Merrill Lynch executive Peter Bacanovic , used to work .
FBI agents arrested Waksal in his pyjamas at his masterpiece - lined apartment in chic SoHo .
They charged him with having sold off millions of dollars - worth of holdings in his own company - Enron - style - and tipping off members of his family to do likewise after it became clear the government might rebuff his company 's application to market a tumour - fighting drug , Erbitux .
Stewart has been brought under the scandal 's shadow because she dumped close to 4,000 shares in the company on the same day as Waksal and his relatives , 27 December last year .
She denies impropriety .
The Congressional Energy and Commerce sub - committee questioned Waksal on Thursday .
It wants to know whether deficiencies in Waksal 's drug were known to his company and the major investor in the rights to Erbitux ( and in ImClone ) , the Bristol Myers drug giant .
A staffer on the committee told The Observer that ' untoward connections ' between ImClone and the Food and Drug Administration , which licenses medicines , were also being investigated . '
Would it be fair to say , ' asked committee member Jim Greenwood , ' that your strategy at ImClone was to put personal profiteering ahead of patients ? '
To this and all other questions , Waksal remained silent , pleading the Fifth Amendment that protects a witness from self - incrimination - as deployed by Enron chief Kenneth Lay in the same chair only weeks ago .
Stewart is a cult figure in America , having built a multi - million dollar fortune advising Americans how to keep house - in books , on television and in her own magazine , Martha Stewart Living .
She also has a stake in the K - Mart supermarket chain , which sells her products .
But now the Congressional committee has subpoenaed her association with the phone records and other documents in connection with the share sale .
In early December , executives at ImClone got word that a government refusal of their application to manufacture Erbitux was ' one of the possibilities ' .
The formal announcement would come , said the FDA , on 28 December .
Between 26 and 28 December , Waksal tried to sell nearly $ 5 million - worth of stock , and his family 's shares - $ 9 m in total .
Stewart told Waksal she was going to Mexico for Christmas , and left a number she could be contacted on .
In a statement on Thursday , she said she had instructed Bacanovic to sell her shares if they fell below a value of $ 60 .
She was duly informed on 27 December that the value had been reached , and says that after instructing her broker to sell , she then ' placed a call to Dr Waksal 's office to inquire about ImClone .
I did not reach Dr Waksal , and he did not return my call , ' she said .
Ken Johnson , spokesman for the House committee , says the log shows Stewart 's call was made from San Antonio ( where her plane re - fuelled ) at 1.43pm , the same time her broker executed the sale of her shares .
As for Waksal , the arrest marks a stunning downfall for a Holocaust survivor 's son who had only weeks ago been put under board pressure to quit his position .
He had been the toast of the biotech community , dating Stewart 's daughter Alexis - less than half his age - and hiring the Doobie Brothers to play at a glittering gathering of cancer specialists in 2001 .
He threw a sparkling Christmas party last year , while the alleged share - dumping was in progress .

2002-06-18,"Enron , the failed US energy firm , paid $ 681 m ( £ 461 m ) to 140 top managers in the year leading up to its bankruptcy on December 2 , it was disclosed yesterday .
The figures , filed with the New York court handling Enron 's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case , will further enrage shareholders who lost billions of dollars in the firm 's collapse , and workers , many of whom lost life savings .
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal , the payouts include at least $ 67.4 m in compensation to the former chairman and chief executive , Kenneth Lay .
Another company that has been buffeted by the accounting scandals , telecoms firm Qwest Communications , ousted chief executive Joseph Nacchio yesterday .
Qwest is under investigation by US fi nancial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission .
The Enron payments are said to include $ 135 m in restricted stock that vested in 2001 and $ 240 m in salary and bonuses .
Share options , deferred compensation and expenses made up the remainder .
Enron is set to return to centre stage after the conviction of its auditor , Arthur Andersen .
The Enron task force , set up to investigate the breath - taking collapse of what had been the seventh largest firm in the US , hopes to build on the momentum from the guilty verdict .
Last autumn Enron reported a loss after taking a $ 1bn charge on poorly performing investments kept off the balance sheet .
In November it admitted overstating earnings by almost $ 600 m in the previous four years and fell into bankruptcy .
Investigators are considering a range of charges , including securities fraud , illegal insider trading , obstruction of justice and filing false financial reports .
Many ordinary workers at Enron who lost savings in the collapse have thrown the levels of compensation earned by senior staff at Enron into relief .
Workers were encouraged to invest their pensions in Enron stock and were prevented from selling in a crucial fortnight last year while Enron changed the firm operating the programme .
Former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , who controlled a number of the offshore entities that hid debts , made $ 5.6 m in salary and bonuses during 2001 .
Jeffrey Skilling , the former chief executive who resigned in August , made about $ 40 m , according to the report .
A spokesman failed to return calls ."

CHINA DISPATCH
A fatal fire in an internet cafe has brought into focus the deprived backgrounds of the young arsonists , reports John Gittings .
The cartoon this week in a Chinese newspaper is crudely to the point .
Two young boys are shown creeping up to the door of an internet cafe - one is holding a can of petrol . ""
The staff here are worse than those women my Dad picks up "" , says the boy with the petrol .
"" Anyone who keeps us out will get flattened , "" replies the other .
Early in the morning on June 16 in Beijing , as widely reported in China and abroad , two boys aged 13 and 14 firebombed the Lanjisu Cyber Cafe in the Haidian university district .
Two dozen of those inside , mostly students surfing the web or playing games on a cheap night rate - more than half of the clients - died .
The cafe was illegal : its door was locked and most of the windows were barred .
Initial reaction dwelt on these tragic circumstances .
There have been several fatal fires in places of public entertainment around China which were operating illegally and without proper safety precautions .

TODAY 'S
CROSSWORD CLUE Animal with desire to break into laugh ?
( 5 ) DAN ROOKWOOD ON SPORT
They were all there yesterday .
I know because I saw their sunburned , Union - Jack - painted , strawberries - and - cream - smeared faces .
Henmania has returned to SW19 .
It 's clearly got to people at the All England Club too because they have renamed that little hillock outside Centre Court ( you know , the one on which the plebeians watch the big screen )
Henman Hill .
All the flags of St George which were made prematurely redundant by Brazil last week have found new employment , but I fear it will once more be on a short - term contract .
Tim Henman is not capable of winning Wimbledon .
Henman could really do with England still being in the World Cup to deflect some of the attention away from him .
Every year he tells us that he is not affected by the pressure , but every year it does eventually get to him .
Yesterday however he was a picture of calm - dare
I say boredom - as he dispatched Jean - Francois Bachelot in straight sets with embarrassing ease and terribly un - English ruthlessness .
Of course , he ca n't go out yet , he has to raise our hopes first .
His serve looked good , he stretched like lubricated elastic at the net and he bettered everything which his French opponent could offer - which admittedly was n't much .
But somehow you just know that Tiger Tim will get to the semis again , and then mess it all up again .
Henman will never have as good a chance to win his beloved Wimbledon as he did last year when a combination of wildcard entry Goran Ivanisevic and rain breaks conspired to rob him of a final place .
He did n't do it then and he wo n't do it now .
So I for one will not be backing Henman this year .
As I left Wimbledon last night , I saw the line of people forming for today 's play .
Tents had already been erected , tea was being supped from expensive - looking Thermos flasks .
These were a different class of vagrant .
And they , quite sensibly , were queuing for Greg Rusedki who should start his own campaign for Wimbledon glory by beating HT Lee of South Korea - conspiracy theories notwithstanding .
As for Tim .
"" The bookies have you as favourite , "" said a Beeb interviewer .
"" What do they know ? "" he replied .
"" I thought France were favourites for the World Cup . ""
Quite .
Go Greg .

2002-06-27,"The US justice department investigation of the Enron debacle is reported to be looking into two British banks .
The inquiry into the events that led to the energy firm becoming the biggest ever bankruptcy is attempting to identify the complex entities used to hide Enron 's debt .
The US government is said to have stepped up its examination of one of those partnerships , dubbed Chewco after a character in Star Wars .
The financing for the partnership included loans from Barclays Bank that had been structured to hide them from Enron 's auditors , the New York Times said .
Investigators are also said to be looking at whether former employees of Greenwich Natwest , now part of Royal Bank of Scotland , profited from the entities .
Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , who was in charge of the most contentious entities , was said to have been close to at least one of the British bankers at the former Greenwich Natwest .
Royal Bank of Scotland was this week sued by the Dutch bank Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen - Boerenleenbank over a $ 517 m loan that it took on from an affiliate of Enron .
Another bank associated with Enron , JP Morgan Chase , faces lawsuits for alleged "" disguised loans "" to Enron .
The following apology was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and Clarifications column , Friday June 28 2002 We said - quite incorrectly - that the Royal Bank of Scotland was this week sued by the Dutch bank Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen - Boerenleenbank over a loan which it took on from an affiliate of Enron .
In fact , it was the Royal Bank of Canada that was the subject of that action in which the Royal Bank of Scotland was in no way involved .
Apologies ."
2002-06-27,"Stock markets around the world were sent reeling yesterday as the biggest corporate fraud in history was uncovered at a former high - flying US firm , shattering already - fragile investor confidence .
WorldCom , the second biggest long distance telephone company in the US , admitted to a $ 4bn hole in its accounts , leaving it close to bankruptcy and delivering another devastating blow to the reputation of corporate America .
The size of the fraud shocked a nation rapidly becoming used to a wave of financial scandals that began with the bankruptcy of energy firm Enron at the end of last year .
The latest piece of wrongdoing prompted a renewed bout of panic selling in stock markets across Europe , Asia and the US .
The Dow Jones Index fell 140 points to 8987 in early trading on Wall Street , coming within 50 points of its lows in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks .
The Nasdaq high technology index went below its post - September 11 low for the first time , losing 19 points to 1406 .
But last night both the Dow and Nasdaq recovered ground after the US federal reserve boosted confidence in the shaken markets by keeping key US interest rates unchanged .
The Dow ended down only 6 points at 9120 , and the Nasdaq rebounded to close up 5 points at 1429 .
Earlier in London around £ 24bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 although the index - down 200 points at one stage - recovered some ground to close down 100 points at 4531 .
Germany 's Dax index and Japan 's Nikkei 225 index both fell by 4 % .
This latest scandal brought vows from financial watchdogs in the US to clamp down on pervasive levels of fraud and restore credibility to America 's flagging markets .
President Bush at the G8 summit in Kananaskis , Canada , for the first time acknowledged the depth of the financial crisis facing the US .
He described the events uncovered at WorldCom as outrageous .
"" I am deeply concerned about some of the accounting practices that take place in America , "" he said .
"" We will fully investigate and hold people accountable for misleading not only shareholders but employees as well .
There is a need for renewed corporate responsibility in America . ""
There were too many cases , he added , of people "" abusing "" their positions .
"" In many respects this case appears to be eerily similar to the accounting hocus - pocus that occurred at Enron , "" said Billy Tauzin , chairman of the house energy and commerce committee , currently investigating the failure of the energy firm .
The dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro for more than two years as investors unnerved by the latest scandal to hit corporate America fled for safer havens abroad .
Investors in the US have been rattled by a succession of frauds , allegations of tax evasion and alleged insider dealing and the massaging of balance sheets over the past six months .
A series of big name companies have already filed for bankruptcy , leaving shareholders nursing losses of billions of dollars .
There was speculation yesterday that WorldCom , once worth close to $ 200bn , would be the next to go bust . ""
If you ca n't trust the accountants or the companies then the whole thing falls down like a pack of cards , "" said Henk Potts , an investment analyst at Barclays Private Clients .
One European analyst said : "" The problem is more than WorldCom ; it 's which companies , which people can you trust ?
We all knew about Enron and we had hoped it would stop the scandals . ""
Instead of a profit of $ 1.4bn last year and $ 130 m in the first quarter of 2002 , WorldCom actually made a loss , although the company did not say by how much .
The company also said it would axe 17,000 workers , around a fifth of the total , in an effort to stay in business .
Some 150 UK jobs , mostly at WorldCom 's Reading base , are likely to go .
WorldCom , which has fired its chief financial officer , Scott Sullivan , was accounting for day - to - day operating costs , like network maintenance , as capital investments , and therefore not offsetting them against earnings .
The company , which recently also replaced its chief executive , discovered the problems during a routine internal audit .
Worldcom was already the subject of an investigation by the US financial regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission , because of its accounting practices .
The SEC said this latest fraud was of an "" unprecedented magnitude "" .
In a statement , the organisation promised to track down the individuals responsible .
The US justice department has opened a criminal investigation into the events at WorldCom .
Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm already crippled by its relationship with Enron , was auditor to the WorldCom accounts .
The accounting firm said it had fully complied with standards and blamed the company for withholding information . ""
The WorldCom chief financial officer did not consult Andersen about the accounting treatment , "" the firm said .
The scandal is the latest to emerge from a company that rode the hubris of the dot.com boom in the late 1990s .
WorldCom carries much of the internet traffic in the US and reinvented itself through a series of big acquisitions .
In the late 1990s , it snatched the company MCI for $ 37bn from beneath the nose of British Telecom , which had announced plans to merge with the US firm .
WorldCom also attracted the scrutiny of the SEC when it emerged that the company 's board had approved massive loans to its former chief executive , Bernie Ebbers .
The stetson - wearing executive quit in April , owing the firm $ 408 m .
"" Our management team is shocked by these discoveries , "" said John Sidgmore , who replaced Mr Ebbers at the top of the company .
WorldCom 's debt rating has now been downgraded to junk and the company will find it difficult to raise any further money .
Howard Schilit , author of the book Financial Shenanigans , said people found responsible of fraud needed to be held accountable .
"" People need to be sent to jail .
It very rarely happens in white collar crime but it would be an important deterrent . """
2002-06-27,"In May 1998 , the American business magazine Fortune warned its readers of the perils of investing in south - east Asia : "" You ca n't trust the companies , you ca n't trust the governments , you ca n't trust the analysts , you ca n't even trust the mutual fund managers . ""
After the revelation of a £ 2.5bn accounting scam at US telecoms giant WorldCom , which comes in the wake of the collapse of Enron and a number of scandals involving the leading Wall Street investment banks , the same words might just as accurately be applied to the American business scene .
For many years , the US financial and political establishment has lectured the rest of the world on how to conduct its business affairs .
Now the once - vaunted Anglo - Saxon way of capitalism is looking distinctly less appealing .
Large corporations are disappearing under the weight of excessive debt or collapsing under suspicion of accounting fraud .
The supposed gatekeepers of the system - the auditors , stock - market regulators , company analysts , professional fund managers and investment banks , as well as the business media - have failed , with a few honourable exceptions , in their policing duty .
The continued decline in the stock market reflects a new distrust of the American way of business .
Stock - market bubbles are normally accompanied by nationalistic hubris .
One thinks of the "" bubble economy "" of the 1980s , when it was argued that Japanese business success could be explained by its corporate and bureaucratic structures and the innate superiority of its workforce .
A decade 's recession in Japan and the more than two - thirds decline of the Nikkei stock market from its 1989 peak have put an end to such talk .
The American bubble of the late 1990s was also rationalised on the basis of the superior flexibility and innovation of the US business world .
With their ability to harness new technology and exploit new markets , companies such as Enron and WorldCom were seen as paragons of the US business model .
Foreign countries were implored to follow this model .
This meant following the dictates of "" shareholder value "" .
Companies were to be run for the exclusive benefit of their shareholders , regardless of the interests of their employees and customers and the localities where they operated .
Management was to be incentivised through bonus payments linked to the share price , normally in the form of stock options .
Companies which failed to deliver shareholder value risked being taken over by their more successful competitors .
Management consultants were brought in bearing faddish analytical tools with names such as "" market - valued added "" , "" total shareholder return "" and "" enterprise value added "" .
The shareholder - value philosophy was spread throughout Europe and beyond by the cartel of US investment banks , which during the 1990s established an unparalleled dominance in the global financial marketplace .
Their analysts uncritically lauded companies that were able to grow their earnings in line with market expectations .
They hyped the prospects of new - economy businesses , which the investment banks floated on the eager stock markets .
At the same time , the mergers and acquisitions departments of the investment banks egged their corporate clients on to ever larger deals .
In 1999 , these banks advised on takeovers worth more than $ 1 trillion in Europe and the United States .
Now the bubble has burst , we can see the consequences of the unfettered pursuit of shareholder value .
According to a study by KPMG Consulting , more than a third of the largest takeovers of the bubble period are now being unwound .
Vodafone , the UK mobile operator , which took over its rival Mannesmann in 1999 , has lost more than three - quarters of its value .
Vodafone 's boss , Sir Christopher Gent , is vilified for the £ 10 m bonus he received for completing the Mannesmann deal .
Vivendi Universal , the French media company which acquired a Hollywood studio in 2000 , is now floundering under debt .
Its deal - making chief executive , Jean - Marie Messier , once praised for his vision of the convergence of media and telecommunications in the new economy clings desperately to his post .
France Telecom , another acquisitive company of the bubble period , appears close to bankruptcy .
The deep - rooted failure of the shareholder- value philosophy , however , is not captured by these high - profile failures alone .
Rather , it lies in the notion that a company 's share price is an accurate reflection of its true worth and that management should be paid in relation to their ability to boost the share price .
Warren Buffett , America 's best - known investor , is fond of citing the words of his mentor , Benjamin Graham , that "" the market in the short run is a voting machine , but in the long run it is a weighing machine "" .
What he means is that over the long- run , market price will come to approximate intrinsic value , but in the short - run , sentiment may cause shares to be overvalued .
In retrospect , we can all agree that market sentiment was distinctly overenthusiastic about the prospects of new - economy firms at the time of the millennium ( ie the market was then operating as a voting machine ) .
Without exception , the formerly favoured growth companies have sunk back to earth ( ie the market is now operating as a weighing machine ) .
Shareholder value , however , takes no account of the discrepancy between market price and true value .
On the contrary , it demands that management pursue the business strategy dictated by its share price .
For instance , the European telecoms companies paid out more than € 100bn for their "" third - generation "" ( 3 G ) mobile - phone licences - an untried technology with uncertain demand - in the spring and summer of 2000 , not because the managers believed they were worth this sum , but because the exalted share prices of their companies required them to do so .
Only a few months after the 3 G auctions , the market had changed its mind and the shares of the successful licence - holders began to plummet .
Such is the fate that befalls those who would pursue the shareholder - value grail .
The pursuit of shareholder value is synonymous with the granting of equity - linked incentives to senior managers .
This has resulted in a huge inflation of chief executive pay over the past decade .
Leaving aside whether the enormous pay disparities between CEOs and their employees are healthy for society , we can question whether linking pay to share price is good for businesses , investors , or the economy in general .
Stock options as a means of compensation suffer from several flaws .
As with all aspects of shareholder value , they involve a confusion of market price and intrinsic value .
Why should an executive receive a huge bonus simply because his company 's shares are in demand ?
Does this reflect a genuine contribution to shareholder value or simply the fad of the market ?
Equity - linked bonus schemes provide a clear incentive for management to fix the numbers .
During the bubble period , the market tended to reward companies which managed to supply annual per - share earnings growth of 15 % - a magic number chosen , it would seem , because it implied profits would double over five years .
In the real world , in a period of low inflation , this was an absurd target .
Nevertheless , it became commonplace .
Earnings - growth targets were achieved through a number of ways .
First , it became common to report to investors unofficial and unaudited earnings figures - known as "" pro forma "" - which ignored certain costs such as depreciation charges .
Second , growth in earnings per share was frequently boosted by taking on debt to repurchase shares .
Third , some companies looked to reduce normal business expenses , such as investment in research and development or marketing , in order to create the illusion of sustainable earnings growth .
Fourthly , many companies - such as the conglomerates General Electric and Tyco - bolstered their earnings by acquiring other companies , whose shares were less highly valued .
In addition , a number of more dubious techniques have been employed to enhance profits .
Enron is just one of several companies to have used off - balance - sheet entities and derivatives to hide debts and exaggerate profits .
Sunbeam , the consumer appliance business run by Sir James Goldsmith 's former hench man , Al "" Chainsaw "" Dunlap , increased its turnover and profits by booking sales from future quarters - a practice known as "" bill and hold "" , since the customers never took delivery of the goods .
Many US and European telecoms companies artificially inflated sales by swapping capacity on each other 's networks .
As the telecoms bubble imploded , WorldCom , it would appear , went even further by reporting certain expenses as capital outlays .
Company analysts and auditors might have been expected to anticipate some of these failures .
However , their employers - the investment banks and accountancy firms - were eagerly receiving advisory and consultancy fees from corporate clients at the time .
Options - laden chief executives brooked no criticism from their professional advisers .
Unsurprisingly , they received little .
In the past 12 months , the shareholder - value obsession has produced the world 's largest bankruptcy ( Enron ) and the world 's greatest accounting fraud ( WorldCom ) .
The two largest acquisitions in history ( Vodafone / Mannesmann and AOL / Time Warner ) have destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholders ' funds .
When the stock market was climbing ever higher , few seemed to care about the excesses of shareholder value - the dubious accounting practices , the reckless corporate strategies , and the excessive corporate pay .
The US and European markets have now been in decline for more than two years .
Investors are finally waking up to the follies and frauds of the shareholder - value fad .
The scandal at WorldCom is hastening the approach of a genuine new era , one quite different to that hyped by the bubble technocrats .
It is a new era in which the probity and prudence of management is stressed above its entrepreneurial ability .
The pursuit of long - term corporate goals replaces an emphasis on short - term share - price appreciation .
The shareholders ' position in the corporate hierarchy is diminished and that of employees and customers enhanced .
Americans may feel humbled by the apparent failure of their brand of capitalism , as the Japanese have been in recent years .
The United States found itself in a similar position in the 1930s , when corporate and Wall Street scandals ushered in a period of reform , including the separation of investment banking from commercial banking and the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
To date , the Bush administration has recommended only cosmetic changes , hoping that the economy and stock market would recover and the scandals would soon be forgotten .
However , there is a need for more significant reforms - such as the separation of research departments from their investment banks , and consultancy from auditing firms .
In addition , there should be tighter restrictions on the use of corporate stock options .
The American system could easily adapt to these changes , and would emerge the stronger for them . ·

2002-06-28,"One year after being fired by energy giant Enron , Christine Nielsen was positively giddy when she told her father she had finally found a new job .
Yes , it was with another big corporation , only this time it was publishing .
And yes , the salary offered was good - incredible , actually .
And unlike working at Enron , where long skirts and sensible shoes were de rigueur , in this new job the dress code was really , really , really loose .
Dad 's reaction ? ""
He said , ' Well , it sounds OK , but do n't let them make you do it with your legs open . '
And I said , ' Dad , I promise it will be very tasteful . ' ""
Ah , nothing like quoting the old I - promise - it - will - be - very - tasteful mantra when everybody from your parents to your priest asks why you posed naked in Playboy 's Women of Enron issue , which hits stands in the US this morning .
Better than admitting you want your 15 minutes of fame or the chance of a lifetime to give corporate America the finger .
"" It 's the American way , is n't it now ? "" says Mediaweek columnist Lisa Granatstein .
"" Women go from a scandal to the pages of Playboy .
Who 's next ?
The women of WorldCom ? ""
Well , why not ?
In the US , Playboy has long cornered the market in scandal - plagued women - from Paula Jones , who sued former president Bill Clinton on charges of sexual harassment , to Jessica Hahn , mistress of disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker .
The difference is that those women had sex scandal written all over them .
The 10 current and past employees of the bankrupt Houston energy giant , who decided to shed their clothes "" tastefully "" ( Shari Daugherty , 22 .
a graduate of Fort Bend Baptist Academy , posed atop Enron 's parking garage , wearing only shoes and a belly chain ) in the "" pink - slip pictorial "" have n't done anything to make them famous other than being fired .
So in the new century , the goalposts for women who want to become Miss July have shifted .
No longer do you have to behave badly to land a pictorial - you just have to take dictation for someone who did .
But why would former employees of Enron , which collapsed amid one of the worst accounting scandals in US history , want to shed their clothes for a porn mag ?
Well , why not ?
It seems almost socially acceptable these days when your company has hit the skids .
In Britain , the Women 's Institute and trusty old farmers went the naked route to raise funds - gracing the covers of calendars rather than magazines .
The move raises eyebrows but not outrage .
"" The truth is I did it for the fun , not the money , "" says Nielsen , 28 , who made the cover .
She insists that getting naked boosted her damaged self - esteem . ""
When you lose your job it takes something out of you , and doing Playboy has given me my confidence back . ""
And an estimated six - figure boost to her bank balance .
Another Enron playmate , Courtnie Parker , 27 , laid off as an Enron recruiter last December , was the only model to avoid frontal nudity in the pictorial because she did n't want to offend her grandparents .
Nielsen had no such qualms .
"" I say if you do it , go all the way .
I was worried about telling my 91-year - old grandmother , but she said she did n't have a problem with it .
Her only concern was that after I did the layout I did n't get involved with the mafia .
I guess in her era that happened . ""
"" We live in a celebrity culture , "" says Granatstein .
"" This is their quick shot to get famous .
How else besides committing a crime or getting naked do you get attention these days ?
I mean , try putting Enron on your résumé today and see how far you get ?
For some of these women , this will be an opportunity to change careers and go into modelling .
They think that with this much exposure , maybe somebody will see something in them . ""
And it will be hard not to , because they are soon to be everywhere .
On Thursday , four former Enron employees - turned - bunnies began a publicity tour around America , meeting and greeting their new adoring public .
Nielsen calls from a cellphone in the back of a stretch limo shepherding her around New York City all day for appearances .
By 11 am she has already done a radio interview and a photo shoot .
It sure beats sitting behind a desk in Houston trying to make sense of numbers that do n't add up .
But you wonder whether the 15 minutes of fame these Enron women are claiming - as is their birthright these days - is worth it in the long run .
What about their chances of getting another job in corporate America ?
Do n't they realise this stunt is just helping to sell copies of Playboy , which has been plagued by declining circulation as men go elsewhere for their kicks ?
But to hear Playboy and Nielsen tell it , they are not exploiting these women , they 're helping them .
"" We 're looking at this as something fun for them to do while they 're looking for another job .
This might even turn into a modelling career for them , "" said Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeth Norris when the call went out for fired employees to pose .
"" I do n't think I thought when we decided to do this that these were women of scandal .
These are women who are out of a job .
We are offering what you could view as a part - time job , or what might turn into a new career . ""
Cover girl Nielsen , a former projects coordinator at Enron , has a degree in environmental science and anthropology .
She says she loved working at the company .
"" It was - pardon the pun - electric to work there , very exciting . ""
But the collapse of the bankrupt giant hurt her .
She says doing Playboy is her way of fighting back .
"" I know people who lost their life savings .
I had stock that was given to me during my time there .
My father had quite a bit of stock that he lost . ""
After being unemployed for a year , Nielsen is back at college studying to be a midwife .
She says she responded to the call from Hugh Hefner to bare all - along with 300 other Enron women - because , well , secretly , who does n't want to be in Playboy ?
"" I did n't want to see the magazine in a a few months and say , ' Woulda , coulda , shoulda . '
I do n't want to be 90 and think , ' Well , Grandma could have been in Playboy . '
"" In fact her boyfriend Jesse , a loyal Playboy reader , took the photos of Nielsen that led to her being selected .
"" I certainly do n't feel exploited at all .
I wanted to do this , nobody forced me .
I understand that Playboy needs us to sell magazines , but this is an adventure we will never forget .
"" If people have a problem with it , that 's their issue .
Doing this , I am not less moral , I am not a slut .
I am proud of it .
In 30 years I will look back and say , ' You were in Playboy . '
"" Not everybody sees her point of view .
The message board at EnronX.org , a site for fired Enron staffers , is full of scorn for the 10 women who posed nude .
Debbie Perrotta , a former senior administrative assistant , told the Fort Worth Star - Telegram , "" We 're fighting for our severance pay and reforms , and Playboy is just in it to make some money . ""
Yes , but as the women see it , they might make some dough as well .
Nielsen admits coyly that if Hollywood came calling she would consider every offer on the table .
"" You never know where doing something like this might take you .
I remember the morning of the shoot , I lay in bed for a minute and said , ' You signed up for this , this can make you or break you . '
If somebody offered me a movie , sure I would consider it . ""
Of course she will .
In the meantime , more than a few people are wondering why it 's just women who have to do all the dirty work .
Why wo n't men pose nude in Playgirl and cash in on their scandal status as well ?
Please do n't say it 's because they have more dignity than us . ""
Men like the charge from looking at pictures of naked women , and if they are involved with a scandal , all the better , "" says Granatstein .
"" I do n't think women have that need to see scandalous men in the nude .
I do n't think it would sell . """
2002-06-28,"The government yesterday sought to reassure investors that America 's corporate malaise would not infect Britain by expanding the remit of its accountancy hit - squad to examine the lessons of fraud - hit WorldCom .
Gordon Brown , the day after barely mentioning the stricken telecom company in his annual Mansion House speech , told the cabinet yesterday that there was "" no room for complacency "" in Britain despite recent improvements to the regulatory system .
The chancellor made it clear that the group set up following the collapse of Enron would now produce an interim report within the next month and had been asked to include the implications from the latest crisis to hit Wall Street as a "" matter of urgency "" .
The discovery of a $ 4bn fraud at WorldCom , America 's second biggest telecoms group , earlier this week rekindled the fears first sparked by the collapse of Enron last year that the once sacrosanct nature of company accounts could no longer be taken for granted .
Yet , despite the chancellor 's reassurance that the issues were taken seriously , the group he set up in February with Patricia Hewitt , the trade and industry secretary , to look at auditing and corporate governance issues , has faced criticism that it was too slow to convene its first meeting .
Yesterday , it emerged that it has only met twice .
Its members include Ruth Kelly , economic secretary to the Treasury , Melanie Johnson from the Department of Trade and Industry , and representatives from the accountancy and financial regulators .
Ms Kelly said yesterday that it would be irresponsible not to analyse the potential fall - out from crisis such as Enron and WorldCom . ""
The recent corporate collapses and events in the United States mean that we have to take auditing and ac counting issues extremely seriously , "" she said .
Among the groups demanding change yesterday was the Institute of Internal Auditors , which warned about the role of external auditors at companies .
In the face of jittery markets yesterday , the Bank of England said that the international financial system had shown remarkable resilience despite the string of bankruptcies and corporate scandals .
But , in a report prepared before the latest revelations concerning WorldCom , it also said that risks would have to be closely monitored in the future .
The Bank noted that the largest ever sovereign and corporate bankruptcies - Argentina and Enron - had failed to undermine capital markets . ""
The international financial system proved remarkably resilient to the Argentina and Enron defaults and should benefit from an improvement in the outlook for the world economy , "" said the outgoing Bank deputy governor , David Clementi .
Warning that issues of accounting , transparency and corporate governance raised by Enron had clouded investor confidence , Mr Clementi said that the weakness of equity markets was putting pressure on some financial institutions .
The report warned that the insurance industry in Britain had been hit by September 11-related claims , while falling shares were squeezing the pensions sector .
Britain 's banking system was in good health , the Bank said , although it warned that banks faced "" challenges "" responding prudently to consumers ' demand for credit . ""
Banks in most of the industrialised world , including the UK , though not immune to recent problems , have generally reported profits and continuing high basic capital ratios and are generally better diversified than in the slowdown a decade ago , "" the report said .
"" Events have , though , inevitably drawn attention to some underlying vulnerabilities that lenders , borrowers and policy makers need to consider further , such as opacity of company accounts ( and ) corporate sector liquidity risk . ""
The weakest sectors identified by the Bank were the heavily indebted telecoms sector which is still getting over the hangover from its investment splurge of the past three years .
The Bank also warned that while complex new financial instruments for offloading credit risk had enabled the financial system to withstand the Enron storm , they were also making it increasingly hard to pinpoint which firms were heavily exposed ."
2002-06-28,"The financial scandal that has enveloped WorldCom , one of America 's largest phone companies , was unearthed by an employee running a spot check on the Mississippi - based company 's books , it emerged yesterday .
Cynthia Cooper is about to become corporate America 's second famous female whistleblower , following in the footsteps of Sherron Watkins , whose warning to the board of the energy trading giant Enron that the company would "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" proved all too prescient .
Ms Cooper 's role came to light as the US Congress called on WorldCom 's executives to answer for their role in the $ 4bn fraud - the largest in American corporate history .
The US financial markets regulator , the securities and exchange commission , has started a fraud inquiry while the department of justice is also likely to begin a criminal investigation .
Yesterday the house financial services committee subpoenaed the Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman , who was the company 's No 1 fan on Wall Street during the boom times .
He stopped recommending that his clients buy WorldCom 's shares just a day before the disclosure of the financial scandal .
WorldCom 's own links with Capitol Hill also came under scrutiny yesterday as it emerged that the long - distance phone company had made political donations to the Republicans .
Days before WorldCom became the latest byword for corporate corruption , the company handed over $ 100,000 to the Republicans at a fundraising gala attended by President Bush .
But there is no evidence that the payment was an attempt to persuade the administration to save it from disaster .
The company made the same contribution last year and , unlike Enron , WorldCom does not appear to have been well - connected in the Bush White House .
So far there is no evidence that company executives attempted to contact administration officials , as Enron 's Kenneth Lay did , to help protect them when the extent of the accounting scam became known .
An analysis carried out by the Centre for Responsive Politics , a money - in - politics watchdog in Washington , found that the Mississippi company had made campaign contributions of $ 7.5 m since 1989 , split roughly equally between Republicans and Democrats .
WorldCom 's gala contribution was a routine part of its $ 3 m a year lobbying effort in Washington , aimed at influencing tax policy and the planned deregulation of the long- distance telephone market - legislation to which WorldCom is opposed .
The company focused on cultivating Mississippi politicians , particularly the Republican leader in the Senate , Trent Lott .
Three years ago WorldCom contributed $ 1 m to the University of Mississippi to help set up the Trent Lott Leadership Institute , just a few weeks after the Mississippi senator had appointed a company official to an advisory panel on the issue of taxing internet sales .
Another recipient of WorldCom largesse was the attorney general , John Ashcroft , who took $ 10,000 in contributions from the firm for his 2000 Senate campaign .
It was unclear yesterday whether Mr Ashcroft would excuse himself from the investigation of WorldCom , as he had done in the case of Enron , another campaign contributor .
Much of the credit for bringing WorldCom 's fraudulent accounting to light yesterday went to Ms Cooper .
Employed as an internal auditor , she was asked to check spending records by the company 's new chief executive , John Sidgmore , just weeks after he took over from WorldCom 's cowboy boot - wearing founder , Bernie Ebbers .
She discovered that over the space of almost a year and a half the company 's chief financial officer , Scott Sullivan - who helped build the business with Mr Ebbers - had been using unorthodox techniques to account for charges paid to local phone companies to complete WorldCom 's long - distance calls .
The fraud , which involved one of the company 's largest costs , had inflated WorldCom 's profits by hundreds of millions of pounds - helping it to post good results through most of last year while the rest of the world 's communications industry was heading into the worst slump in living memory .
The fiddle distorted WorldCom 's figures to the tune of almost $ 4bn - almost six times the size of the hole in the books of Houston - based Enron .
But unlike in the case of the Enron whistleblower , Ms Cooper 's information was acted on immediately by senior management .
They contacted the head of the company 's auditing committee , Max Bobbitt , and then used Ms Cooper 's evidence to back up the sacking of Mr Sullivan late on Tuesday night ."
2002-06-28,"In a report headed Enron inquiry looks at two British banks , page 23 ( Finance ) , yesterday , we said - quite incorrectly - that the Royal Bank of Scotland was this week sued by the Dutch bank Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen - Boerenleenbank over a loan which it took on from an affiliate of Enron .

2002-06-28,"Enron , WorldCom , stock market crashes , house prices .
Right now it 's hard to be an optimist .
I have seen the future , and it is ugly .
With shares falling and pensions shrinking , my generation of 30-somethings wo n't be quietly tapping golf balls in the Algarve upon their retirement .
Oh no , they 'll be roaming the streets with handguns , robbing banks just to feed themselves .
By 2030 , the few young people in work will be living in gated communities to protect themselves from marauding pensioners , driven to desperation by poverty and cheap Viagra .
Of course this is nonsense , but you would n't think so to read some of the tabloids this week .
It emerged that the US telecoms company WorldCom , like Enron before it , had been cooking the books , and the stockmarket responded by falling sharply , wiping an estimated £ 24 billion off shares .
Investors are now so jittery that all you have to do is give them a bit of bad news and they 're off , furiously selling shares to limit their losses .
The WorldCom debacle is just the latest headline - grabbing fall that shareholders and fund managers have endured for the past two years .
And though it is easy to think that it 's just a bunch of champagne swilling suits in the City who have taken the punishment , it 's your pension that 's also being hammered .
Most younger people now rely on pensions that are linked to the stock market , rather than their final salary .
So when the market falls , your comfortable retirement home in Florida moves just a little bit further out of reach .
If you are in an old - style pension scheme or are working for the public sector , then you will probably end up with a decent retirement income .
For the rest of us , it 's a bit touch and go .
If markets recover and start powering away over the next decade , we 'll all be laughing .
But they 'd better start doing that soon , because some pension companies are currently finding it a bit of a struggle to meet government requirements on solvency .
The good news is that over the long term , shares outpace cash and beat inflation .
So even though this has been a terrible couple of years , it does n't mean it 's always going to be this bad .
Part of the reason for the recent Buy to Let housing boom has been that people view bricks and mortar as a sound investment alternative to the bloodletting that they see going on all around them in the stock market .
It 's hard to see house prices slowing down until the stock market becomes a more attractive place to put your spare money .
This week 's screaming headlines have been a wake - up call for the millions of people who thought that someone - the state , their employer , their pension company - would see them right in their old age .
It has also been a rude awakening for the unions , who have suddenly twigged that employers who change a workplace pension from a guaranteed final salary scheme to one linked to the stockmarket are effectively cutting the pay of their workers .
However , given that this has been such a grim week for anyone who has to work for a living , I offer the following reasons to be cheerful : 1 . Shares can go up as well as down .
2 .
Inflation is low , so although you you 're not earning much on your savings account at present , its real value is not being eroded .
3 .
We are currently enjoying some of the lowest mortgage rates for forty years .
There , now I 'm off home to bolt all the doors ."
2002-06-29,"Corporate America suffered a fresh accounting scandal yesterday as Xerox , the photocopying and printing giant , admitted it had overstated its revenues during the past five years by almost $ 2bn ( £ 1.3bn ) .
The revelation , following the alleged frauds at WorldCom and Enron , threatens further damage to confidence in the US economy , Wall Street 's integrity and the dollar , which came within a fraction of parity with the euro yesterday amid further heavy selling pressure .
Meanwhile , Sir David Tweedie , the Scot who heads the international accounting standards board , warned in an interview with today 's Guardian that the UK is not immune from huge accounting failures such as the $ 4bn apparent fraud at WorldCom .
"" People are saying this could n't happen in Britain .
Oh yes it could , "" said Sir David .
"" It 's corporate governance failures .
It could happen to us , too . ""
The UK 's chief financial regulator , the financial services authority , acknowledged the wide concerns yesterday as it tried to bolster confidence in the fragile stock market by changing solvency rules that could have forced insurance companies , among the biggest equity investors , to dump shares in a falling market .
The move appeared to work as the FTSE 100 index rose 115.8 points to 4656.4 .
The scandal at Xerox , though , is doubly shocking because its problems seemed to have been resolved by an investigation in April by the securities and exchange commission , the chief US financial watchdog .
That audit estimated that Xerox 's overstatement of revenues , achieved by bringing forward equipment sales , was $ 3bn .
Under the new accounts the equivalent figure is $ 6.4bn , which sent Xerox 's shares tumbling 10 % yesterday .
The company , however , was able to claim that the net overstatement of revenues was $ 1.9bn because of various other revisions to its accounts .
Nevertheless , it still admits that its profits during 1997 - 2001 were overstated by $ 1.4bn .
Xerox , founded in 1906 , has almost 80,000 employees around the world , including 3,000 at its European head office in Uxbridge .
Its accounting scandal erupted last year and its auditor , KPMG , was fired after working for the firm for 30 years .
The SEC accused Xerox of having "" misled and betrayed investors "" via a series of accounting tricks designed to manipulate its earnings and enrich top executives .
One Xerox accounting scheme was known internally as "" project Mozart "" because of its supposed creative brilliance .
Xerox agreed to pay a $ 10 m fine to settle the charges but the SEC has still told a number of former executives and KPMG that it is considering filing civil charges against them .
Although the Dow Jones was barely affected by the Xerox scandal in early trading in New York , concern over the dollar is mounting .
Intervention by the Bank of Japan , which is concerned about the impact on Japan 's export - led recovery , reversed the dollar 's slide in afternoon trading but it is becoming clear that financial institutions outside the US are losing faith in the currency .
Stephen King , chief economist at HSBC , said : "" It seems to me that we are on verge of some kind of breakdown as far as the dollar is concerned .
Foreign investors in the US have not seen the returns they expected .
The major beneficiaries have been American consumers .
If it is contained to a small fall in the dollar , it may not be too bad .
But if it continues and we see a major drop , it is destructive for European competitiveness and that is not good for European growth . ""
Sir David , in his interview today , called for changes to the structure of the audit committees that oversee company accounts , suggesting that one of its members should be a finance director from another company or one who had recently retired : "" A lot of finance directors do n't like having another finance director looking over their shoulder . ""
Sir David , who is credited with introducing new accounting rules in the 1990s after the Maxwell scandal , warned that the implications of not making changes are grave . ""
These are big issues , "" he said .
"" If the stock market becomes so wary of accounting numbers , share prices are going to continue to fall .
That 's going to affect insurance companies and pension funds . """
2002-06-30,"This time last year , most Americans probably thought that Enron was some kind of hip hop band .
Only its collapse made it a household name .
WorldCom is different : millions of Americans use its services , and those who do n't still know it is one of the country 's biggest telecoms suppliers .
So the revelation that its accounts may have been wrong to the tune of $ 3.8 billion ( £ 2.5bn ) - roughly twice BT 's profits last year - is a far bigger shock to investors .
The sharp falls in US and UK markets were not because the suspected fraud means WorldCom is at risk of going bust - its future was in doubt long before .
Nor is it because executives were again shown to be looking after themselves at the expense of everyone else .
It is because WorldCom 's accounting scandal suggests purging excesses from the US corporate system could be more painful than feared .
The more surprising , then , that after nine months of relentless bad news about everything from company accounts to senior executives , the stock market is still valued at around 30 times what brokers expect earnings to be for this year .
So far , there is little sign of a recovery in profits .
First - quarter earnings were poor , and few expect second - quarter reports to be much better .
So forecasts for the full year could be reduced yet again .
Much of the rise in US stock markets over the past five years was driven by for eign investors , taken in by euphoria over a new era of corporate profitability .
But they are even more shocked by the corporate scandals than domestic investors , and the flood of foreign money looks set to go into reverse .
And that is not bad news only for the stock market ; it is also bad for the trade deficit - which could be $ 450bn this year , and must be financed through foreign investment flows - and bad for the dollar .
The dollar is already falling .
Richard Burns , manager of the Monks investment trust , which has more than a third of its assets in the US , believes the slide will get worse : ' It is now clear the dollar 's peak was in Febru ary , and we are into quite a long period of weakness . '
The good news about the WorldCom scandal is that it shows the clean - up of corporate America has started in earnest .
But it will be a long process , and there is a big risk of another downward lurch in the market .
There is nothing to be gained by jumping in now ."
2002-06-30,"No nation has a monopoly on credulity , but after the Enron and WorldCom scandals and a week in which the hard - nosed goddess of home - making , Martha Stewart , was accused of insider dealing , the American people do seem to be nudging the North Koreans at the top of the index of blind faith .
Maybe I put this a little sharply , but when you factor in the failure of all the agencies that were charged with protecting America last autumn - the FBI , the CIA , the Immigration and Naturalization Services , the National Security Agency , the Defense Intelligence Agency and , while we 're about it , consider the hopeless tardiness of the Securities and Exchange Commission over WorldCom - there does seem to be something downright lax about American institutional life .
And that can only be explained by the complacency , perhaps better described as implicit trust , of the American people .
I put this down to a characteristic which is not generally acknowledged on either side of the Atlantic , the reverence for prophets in America - in other words the unquestioned annuities of faith which are paid to one individual 's vision , whether it comes from Bernie Ebbers , the persuasive Canadian good ole boy convert who founded WorldCom , or Louis Farrakhan , or Martha Stewart , or for that matter the late John Gotti .
America is so vast , so diverse , that its people opt for certain tribal solutions when it comes to trying to find a place for themselves in the seething life of the only superpower .
The remoteness of many from Washington DC and national politics , and the sharp distinctions that exist between groups of Americans means that they cleave much more to these visions than perhaps Europeans do .
As H.L. Mencken pointed out , ' More than any other people , we Americans are afraid of one another . '
It 's perhaps a kind of defensiveness which allows so much to go unchallenged in American life , a worry that if you question the order and wisdom that comes from on high , you are doing something perilously unAmerican and destructive .
This is particularly true of business life .
Every American knows that the country 's health and strength is founded on the success of the country 's corporations .
Thus there is just that much more reluctance to criticise a company , even though it may be wrecking the environment , harming individuals with its products or simply stealing the savings of the small - time shareholder .
We think of America as a nation of individualists and whistleblowers , and indeed there are many examples of heroic bloody - mindedness in American history , but the culture to be found in its sprawling suburbs and the vast compounds and business campuses is generally rather less brave .
There is a drive to conformity , a need for homogeneity , that in the Eighties expressed itself in the emergence of political correctness , which sought to standardise opinion and behaviour in matters of race , gender , age , sexual orientation and disability .
Whatever the benign genesis of PC , we can agree that it was hardly the product of a nation which values independent thought .
The reality of office life is also far removed from the image nurtured in Europe .
While many of us imagine that Americans are manic workaholics , surveys show that they actually work one or two hours fewer than Britons each week ; and yet the fevered brow is much in evidence .
While we assume that they are innately more efficient than us , in fact there is nothing as literal - minded and as unresponsive as bureaucracy in the United States .
When we learned that the Immigration and Naturalization services sent out immigration forms to dead hijackers two months after 11 September it seemed unsurprising that Mohamed Atta had managed to fly under the radar in the first place .
Given the American obsession with management science , it 's odd that they are still so wedded to the vertical structure which places so much emphasis on one individual 's judgement - still almost always a man 's judgement .
Halfway between coach and messiah , the boss 's wisdom goes pretty much unchecked because , as a worker , your life depends on him to lead you to the promised land .
The people immediately around the boss become adept at reading his moods and adjusting their tastes and views to his .
A good deal of sucking up goes on and if he wants to kick the day off with a prayer meeting , as the Attorney General John Ashworth does and Bernie Ebbers did , it pays to join in .
It is hardly surprising that so many come to believe in divine guidance or their own magic , even when they are wildly and transparently wrong .
Of course a lot of this goes on in British offices too , but in America the gaze of the average employee is that little bit more fixed on the boss because that is how you get on .
Advancement does n't come from causing a fuss , making the top man look an idiot when he has palpably screwed up , or even reminding him of the company 's moral obligations .
Rather , it comes from working with the grain , rising on pre - ordained career thermals and , well , kissing ass ."
2002-07-01,"The US securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) is usually described as America 's financial watchdog .
But the watchdog appears to have been dozing in its kennel as Wall Street totters from one scandal to another .
Enron and WorldCom have tarnished corporate America 's good name and pushed President George Bush on to the defensive .
Much of the heat has fallen on the SEC chairman , Harvey Pitt , who was appointed by Mr Bush last year .
Mr Pitt suffered from a handicap from the outset .
In the past he had frequently clashed with the SEC and had a reputation as being too close to his business chums .
Mr Pitt did himself no favours when the SEC took a back seat when the New York attorney general , Eliot Spitzer , turned up the pressure on Merrill Lynch , the big Wall Street firm .
Mr Spitzer accused Merrill of bamboozling investors , alleging that its analysts recommended internet companies while rubbishing them in private .
Mr Spitzer had Merrill on the run and the company introduced new rules to ensure that analysts gave truly independent advice .
Only when Merrill was on the verge of a $ 100 m out - of - court settlement with Mr Spitzer did the SEC step in with its own investigation .
At the weekend Mr Pitt was on the TV news shows , vowing to stay in the job and accusing Democrats of trying to make political capital from Wall Street 's problems .
Well , if the Democrats did n't try to get some mileage from Enron and WorldCom , they might as well give up politics and join the Hare Krishna .
Unfortunately for him , Mr Pitt has come under fire not only from "" opportunistic Democrats "" , but also from his own constituents .
There have been grumblings from the business community that he has been too tardy in wielding the cosh against Wall Street 's big - time muggers .
Even that booster of market capitalism , the Wall Street Journal , has stuck the knife into Mr Pitt .
In a recent editorial , the Journal ridiculed the White House 's claim that Mr Pitt is doing a good job .
"" We doubt , "" the Journal opined , "" anyone at the White House really believes that .
At least we hope they do n't ; because no one anywhere else does . ""
In his defence , Mr Pitt pleads lack of resources and points out that Enron and WordCom flourished under the Clinton administration .
Fair point , but it was congressional Republicans who made the running in deregulating the markets in energy and telecommunications ; Democrats are n't blameless either as they should have resisted corporate interests more stiffly .
And Mr Pitt will not be able to plead poverty of resources much longer .
The House of Representatives last week voted to approve $ 776 m , ( £ 506.9 m ) funding for the SEC , a rise of more than 75 % over this year , and the Senate looks to set to follow suit .
The SEC has been quicker off the mark with WorldCom .
It immediately filed a civil lawsuit against the telecommunications giant for fraud and ordered the company to produce a report by today to explain how it overstated revenues by $ 3.8bn .
Mr Pitt may still salvage the SEC 's reputation as America 's watchdog if he acts expeditiously on WorldCom .
If he does not , the blame could drift higher up the food chain , to President Bush himself .
Mr Bush , after all , was the man who appointed Mr Pitt , someone who shared his indulgence towards business .
Come to think of it , Mr Bush 's other major economic appointment , treasury secretary Paul O'Neill , hardly inspires confidence either .
It 's not the strongest team to tackle the most serious financial crisis of confidence in years .
For that Mr Bush only has himself to blame .
Mark Tran is business editor at Guardian Unlimited"
2002-07-01,"A powerful handful of accountancy firms have turned into global octopuses , simultaneously auditing , advising managements and inventing schemes to help their clients avoid paying taxes .
But there has been growing unease about their multiple roles .
In the wake of US accounting scandals at Enron , WorldCom and Xerox , alarms have sounded about the dangers of conflict of interest when auditors depend for lucrative consultancy contracts on the very firms whose books they are supposed to be casting a gimlet eye over .
But the Guardian 's investigation shows that there is also cause for concern by the taxpayer .
All over Whitehall , millions of pounds are being paid for advice to these supposedly neutral private - enterprise management consultants .
KPMG is one of the biggest recipients of such government cash , with more than £ 70 m paid to it since 1997 .
But it is also one of the biggest offshore operators , giving advice to others on how to deprive governments of tax revenues .
KPMG 's infrastructure and government department also received £ 292 m in UK fees last year .
Much came from helping Whitehall place private finance initiative ( PFI ) projects with commercial firms .
But when it acted as financial adviser to the new University of Hertfordshire , a £ 60 m building contract for 1,600 student rooms at Hatfield was awarded to a consortium led by one of the accounting firm 's own clients , Carillion .
Carillion paid KPMG a total of £ 1.2 m last year , partly for audit and partly for other consultancy .
KPMG describes its role as assisting the university "" through the process from inception to financial close "" .
This included advice on PFI tender procurement and negotiation .
A university spokeswoman , however , said : "" We were aware that KPMG was Carillion 's auditor . ""
KPMG also acted as financial adviser to the highways agency for the £ 146 m A13 Thames Gateway widening project , to link Tilbury Docks and the City .
Amec headed the winning consortium .
Last year the company gave KPMG £ 2.2 m worth of business , both audit and consultancy .
A highways agency spokeswoman said : "" We are aware of the relationship between KPMG and Amec .
These issues are ring - fenced within these organisations . ""
But Unison , the public service union , said in a report published last month about PFI deals : "" Public alarm is growing at the potential conflicts of interest .
"" A second problem area we have discovered is where KPMG sells advice to Whitehall on tax havens .
Local KPMG offices also sell offshore schemes themselves in a variety of tax havens .
KPMG has offices in 24 of the 32 tax havens the Organisation of
Economic Co - operation and Development is currently trying to tighten up on - a far higher proportion than the three other global accountancy firms .
Tax havens
Last week the Belize office offered to incorporate a Guardian reporter offshore there in a tax - free unaudited , anonymous company , with a Visa card enabling him to draw worldwide from a local bank account .
The KPMG office promised it would not have to disclose the owner 's true identity to the Belize government .
KPMG has also been paid to audit the local tax - exempt Bank of Belize there , which runs the registry of offshore companies .
But KPMG took £ 128,000 from the Department for International Development in July 2000 to investigate claims that the debt - ridden Caribbean country was failing to collect enough tax revenue because of its extravagant tax exemptions .
The consultants failed to complete the inquiry properly and had to be ordered to do it again by the British government .
Official correspondence - obtained by the Guardian - shows that the British government branded KPMG 's performance "" unacceptable "" .
KPMG argued that an impartial investigation had been conducted by a team from its office in Leeds and that there were "" Chinese walls "" to separate this team from its Belize office .
But it did not tell the Department for International Development the facts when it took the contract .
The previous year , in 1999 , KPMG also saw no conflict of interest when the Foreign Office paid it to investigate six tax havens for which Britain was responsible in the Caribbean , despite the fact that it operates lucratively in five of them .
Bermuda , the Cayman Islands , the British Virgin Islands , the Turks and Caicos and Anguilla were under pressure to crack down on money laundering , drug smuggling and tax evasion .
KPMG did disclose in its report , which did not recommend radical reforms , that its "" associated firms "" had local business activities .
The third area of concern we have discovered is that KPMG has placed at least 18 people into government departments in recent years , some in sensitive areas .
Three KPMG staff have been loaned to the inland revenue .
One worked as a policy adviser in the division responsible for collecting taxes from businesses , while another worked as a policy adviser in a division which helps to collect taxes on individuals ' capital and savings .
The inland revenue appears to be unaware of the dangers .
One of its internal reports in 2000 - obtained by the Guardian - suggests that the tax collectors are keen to "" modernise "" by bringing outsiders into the department , but felt "" one of our difficulties is that people often perceive a potential conflict of interest "" .
At the Cabinet Office , KPMG donated three secondees to work in the performance and innovation unit in the past three years .
This carries out "" blue - skies "" thinking on major issues for the prime minister and the rest of Whitehall .
The Department of Trade and Industry has had four secondees from KPMG - one , Mike Metcalf , worked for a year as a member of the team which was conducting a review of company law .
Another , Colin Smyth , is working for three years as a tax adviser in the Department of Trade and Industry 's small business service .
KPMG has also sent secondees to the serious fraud office , the Department of Health , and the Department for the Environment , Transport and the Regions .
The government insists all secondees are only taken on once departments are satisfied that there will be no conflict of interests .
Secondees must also abide by civil service rules and not , for instance , leak sensitive information to their companies .
There is no suggestion these rules are being breached .
But KPMG in Britain boasts to its commercial customers that it can help tax avoiders run rings round Whitehall , thanks to inside knowledge .
Its "" Revenue defence "" service to trans - national firms faced with questions about profit manipulation across borders , boasts of "" former inland revenue tax inspectors with detailed knowledge and experience regarding the approaches taken by fiscal authorities "" .
KPMG 's specialists "" can advise how best to respond to initial information requests in order to close down lines of inquiry "" .
For rich individuals , KPMG offers a special tax avoidance service which it has provided for , among others , executives of the arms firm BAE Systems .
John Battersby runs a 50-strong team advising such "" high net - worth clients "" around London .
He is also a director of KPMG Private , a discreet company in Switzerland .
But his skills appear to have been poached from Whitehall .
Until 1987 , Mr Battersby was a senior inland revenue official , advising ministers on corporate and business taxation .
He helped draft the inheritance tax laws in 1986 which KPMG will now - for a price - advise its clients on how to circumvent .
Prem Sikka says in his book Dirty Business , to be published today : "" Accountancy firms have become multinational enterprises by advising companies on strategies for avoiding taxes .
Inevitably , ordinary people bear the cost of this by paying a higher proportion of their income in taxes and receiving worse public services . ""
Gavin Houlgate , KPMG 's corporate affairs head , said last night : "" All these deals were thoroughly transparent and carried out according to professional principles .
"" There were very strict rules for government contracts , he said .
"" If our clients happen to win construction work , there is no link with advice we give . ""
The firm published details of all political links in its annual report : "" We have very strict risk management procedures and are well aware of the need to be transparent and above - board in all we do . """
2002-07-02,"Equitable Life yesterday provoked fresh fury among battered policyholders when it cut policy payouts again and increased the penalty for investors trying to bail out .
The moves will wipe thousands of pounds off many people 's investments .
The troubled insurer blamed the latest stock market falls for the decision to slash by 10 % maturity values for policyholders choosing to take their benefits and to increase the exit penalty from 14 % to 20 % .
Policyholder action groups reacted angrily .
Liz Kwantes of the Equitable Life Members Help Group called the news "" horrendous "" and said it had come as a major shock , while Paul Braithwaite of Equitable Members Action Group said this latest devaluation meant people 's investments were now worth one third less than a year ago .
He added : "" Equitable is the UK 's Enron - a huge - scale financial scandal . ""
Yesterday 's announcement is the latest in a series of blows suffered by the 1 m with - profits policyholders , and comes weeks after the board attempted to reassure investors that the company was in a "" greatly improved position "" following what it admitted was a "" ghastly "" 2001 .
A spokesman said the action it was taking was "" entirely necessary , yet most regrettable "" .
The 20 % exit penalty - called the financial adjustment - affects those who cash in a policy early or move their money to another insurer .
It means that somebody who received a statement from the insurer last month telling them their policy was worth £ 100,000 will lose £ 20,000 at a stroke if they quit the company .
The 10 % reduction on the maturity value - which until yesterday stood at 4 % - means that somebody retiring now who has stayed loyal to the company but whose £ 100,000 pension policy has just matured will lose £ 10,000 of this if they take their pension benefits .
Some policyholders may escape the full 10 % hit if a cut of this size takes the value below what is guaranteed .
Equitable has to honour the guaranteed element of policies .
An Equitable spokesman blamed "" further falls in equity values , continued market volatility and likely increases in provisions "" .
But some observers expressed surprise at the need for such action when the insurer itself yesterday confirmed that just 15 % of its £ 17bn with - profits fund was invested in equities .
With - profits funds are typically 55%-70 % invested in equities .
It was in July 2001 that Equitable cut the value of pension and investment policies by up to 16 % - in some cases effectively wiping tens of thousands of pounds off them .
Many had hoped the misery was over when a rescue plan aimed at stabilising the 240-year - old company took effect earlier this year .
But in April this year Equitable dismayed policyholders by slicing policy payouts again , raising the exit penalty from 10 % to 14 % and bringing in the 4 % cut in maturity values .
Equitable was brought to its knees after a House of Lords ruling in favour of holders of so - called guaranteed annuity rate policies left it facing a possible multibillion - pound bill ."
2002-07-03,"Lawyer in court for Enron theft
A lawyer appeared in court yesterday charged with stealing more than £ 380,000 from US energy group Enron .
Marcus von Bock und Polach , 37 , of north London , was charged with theft and false accounting in relation to a British - based subsidiary of Enron , and another Enron firm .
He was charged with stealing $ 141,510 ( £ 94,000 ) from Enron Power Operations between March 30 and November 28 last year , and with the theft of £ 287,374.47 from Enron Capital and Trade Resources International between December 31 last year and May 21 this year .
Von Bock also faces three counts of false accounting .
He was remanded on bail and will appear again on July 23 .
British Land faces new fight Rebel investors have hit a new volley in their battle with British Land , saying the firm has the resources to return £ 1bn to shareholders .
Laxey Partners , which owns just under 3 % of British Land , and is spearheading a push to change it , told 12,000 fellow investors it believed British Land should return the money by October next year .
The proposal is part of a series of measures to be put to the vote at British Land 's annual shareholders ' meeting on July 16 .
Other suggestions include hiring professional property managers and other management issues .
Some investors would like British Land chairman John Ritblat to put a succession plan in place .
British Land has urged shareholders to reject Laxey 's proposals , which it describes as ill - conceived and "" designed to make a fast buck "" .
Drug groups join forces Drug delivery firm SkyePharma has agreed to develop an extended - release version of a treatment for hepatitis C with GeneMedix , boosting shares in the drugmaker .
SkyePharma said it had agreed to use its DepoFoam injectable drug delivery technology to develop Interferon alpha-2b , which is the standard treatment for hepatitis C , but patients often require injections every few days .
SkyePharma said it had received an initial payment of $ 5 m ( £ 3.3 m ) from GeneMedix , and that it would also get undisclosed milestone payments as the new drug passes clinical trials .
Jackson and Sony go country Michael Jackson and Sony Music have agreed to buy legendary country music publisher Acuff - Rose , whose library includes works by Hank Williams , Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers , current owner Gaylord Entertainment said yesterday .
Gaylord , based in Nashville , Tennessee , is selling Acuff - Rose for $ 157 m ( £ 103 m ) to Sony - ATV , which owns the copyrights and catalogues for music by the Beatles , Miles Davis and Bob Dylan .
Transport firm makes progress Britain 's largest train and coach company National Express said yesterday that first - half trading was in line with expectations .
The company said its UK bus and coach division continued to make good progress , but that passenger revenues in its train operations remained variable , with its regional train operating companies showing no improvement over the past six months ."
2002-07-05,"Patricia Hewitt , the industry secretary , will today propose significant changes to the auditing profession in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals that have shaken confidence in world stock markets .
If made law , her plans will mean that executive directors and possibly chief executives are debarred from appointing company auditors .
Instead , company audit committees , made up exclusively of non - executive directors , will be given sole responsibility for their appointment .
Ms Hewitt will admit that "" the current checks and balances are just not working "" and that confidence has been lost in auditors ' independence .
She will argue that auditors should be rotated and prevented from doing consultancy work for any company for which they also act as auditors .
The industry secretary will also call for international action against some share option schemes and the treatment of pensions .
Share option schemes , according to Ms Hewitt , are coming under fire because they "" can dilute shareholder value , may incentivise irresponsible behaviour and are not properly being reflected in the balance sheet "" .
Some of these ideas have already been floated within Britain 's accountancy profession , but it is the first time that Ms Hewitt has given them her personal backing .
The comments are much tougher than any others made by cabinet ministers since the extent of fraud in corporate America came to light .
Domestic reforms are now expected to be proposed by the joint Treasury - DTI committee set up to review accountancy standards .
The committee , including ministers and regulators , is due to produce its interim report later this month .
Some of the work may be also be examined by the committee on non - executive directors chaired by Derek Higgs .
In a speech today in Cambridge billed as a primer for the white paper on company law reform this month , Ms Hewitt will blame "" a small number of crooked directors "" , saying "" their action has had immense repercussions on the whole business community "" .
Reflecting fears expressed in the stock market this week , she will warn that "" confidence has been lost in the independence of auditors as a result of Enron - whether or not it was a special case "" .
The relationship between the company and the auditor was blurred , "" to put the point kindly "" . ""
One way to tackle this may be through the rotation of audit firms , or audit partners .
We should also look at the extent to which the audit firm should also be able to supply non - audit services to its audit clients . ""
Adding that directors have a crucial role in restoring confidence , Ms Hewitt will say she supports the idea that "" audit committees be given an enhanced role in the appointment of auditors "" .
But it is not expected she will back a competition commission inquiry into the British auditing profession , despite calls for such a review .
Ms Hewitt will also back plans to revise the controversial FRS17 accounting rule .
The proposed new standard has been blamed for accelerating the closure of final salary pension schemes .
She will say she has "" some sympathy with insurers ' worries about just showing a snapshot of pension liabilities in their accounts "" .
She will promise not to "" meddle for the sake of it "" , acknowledging that "" the last thing British business and society needs is an ill - considered , hastily rushed through knee - jerk reaction .
But our approach must involve a mixture of action on both the international and domestic stage "" ."
2002-07-05,"British industry today warned against over - hasty government reaction to the financial scandals that have battered public confidence in corporate America .
The Confederation of British Industry warned against "" muzzling every labrador in Britain to get at one rottweiler "" .
The CBI was responding to proposals outlined by trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt to tighten auditing practices and corporate governance in Britain after Enron and WorldCom .
Speaking at a law conference in Cambridge , Ms Hewitt suggested that executive directors could lose their powers to appoint auditors to avoid the "" cosy relationship "" between company directors and auditors .
"" The relationship between the company and the auditor was blurred , to put the point kindly , "" Ms Hewitt said .
Ms Hewitt said that one option would be to rotate audit firms or audit partners .
One of the criticisms arising from the Enron case was that its auditor , Arthur Andersen , was not as rigorous as it should have been because of their longstanding and close relationship .
Andersen also stood to benefit from consulting services it provided the US energy giant .
In another proposal , Ms Hewitt said that she found the idea of giving audit committees an enhanced role "" attractive "" .
Ms Hewitt floated the idea that executive directors and possibly chief executives would be barred from appointing company auditors .
Instead , company audit committees , made up exclusively of non - executive directors , will be given sole responsibility for their appointment .
Tories did not exactly warm to Ms Hewitt 's trial balloon either .
Shadow trade and industry secretary John Whittingdale said it was surprising that Ms Hewitt was pre - empting the conclusions of a review group from Treasury and Ms Hewitt 's department on accountancy standards .
The committee , including ministers and regulators , is due to produce its interim report later this month .
"" Of course we need to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place , yet we already have good reason to believe that accounting standards in the UK are as rigorous and of greater control than exist in the US , "" Mr Whittingdale said .
"" It is vital that any legislative changes strike the balance of fine - tuning an existing system of strong controls rather than over - burdening business with yet more unnecessary regulation . ""
Ms Hewitt 's calls for an international approach to overhaul corporate behaviour to prevent future scandals are likely to get a rough reception , particularly on the issue of share options .
In her speech , she said that such packages "" can dilute shareholder value , may incentivise irresponsible behaviour and are not properly being reflected in the balance sheet "" .
American companies are sure to resist proposals obliging them to take on their balance sheets the cost of awarding stock options .
It is estimated that would knock 8 % of the profitability of US companies .
Big business spent £ 50 m lobbying Congress , and winning the surpport of President George Bush , to block this rule change that is central to America 's way of doing business and rewarding executives .
"" The adverse incentives that can be created by share options were clearly a factor in the WorldCom case , "" Ms Hewitt said .
She said that the US can learn from UK corporate controls , which were tightened after a series of scandals , including the looting of pension funds by Robert Maxwell at the Mirror Group in the early 1990s , BCCI and Polly Peck .
Ms Hewitt argued that Britain 's approach to auditing , based on the principle that accounts must give a fair reflection of a business , is preferable to America 's rules - based system .
"" The danger there is that companies and auditors get round rules , "" she said ."

2002-07-06,"The state watchdog that polices the nation 's accounts , the Statistics Commission , is investigating three multi - billion - pound instances of off - balance - sheet accounting .
The inquiry - involving the Treasury and the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) - is partly a response to Opposition accusations of ' Enron - style ' behaviour over the books of Network Rail , the government - backed successor to Railtrack .
The ONS announced on Friday that despite £ 9 billion of government guarantees for loans to the new firm , the lending would be classified as private and kept off the Treasury 's balance sheet .
The Treasury argues that this is a matter for the ONS alone .
But The Observer has learnt that the ONS wrote to the Treasury to say it did not have the commercial acumen to determine whether bor rowing done by Network Rail was a ' contingent liability ' .
The final decision was effectively made by the Department of Transport , whose Secretary of State , Alistair Darling , is considered a close ally of Chancellor Gordon Brown .
The Statistics Commission will meet in two weeks to discuss Friday 's decision as well as an earlier one to classify Network Rail as a private - sector company .
It will also investigate the Treasury 's habit of classing benefit payments as ' negative taxation ' , thus reducing official measurements of the overall tax burden .
Commission officials have prepared a key paper on the national accounts for chairman Sir John Kingman , a leading statistician .
Classifying Network Rail as part of the private sector goes against the wishes of the National Audit Office .
This body has made clear that Network Rail must be accounted for as a subsidiary of the Strategic Rail Authority , placing it in the public sector .
Failure to do this would result in the NAO qualifying the SRA 's accounts .
NAO sources indicate they are confident the SRA accounts will include Network Rail .
However , the ONS says none of the £ 21bn of support Network Rail will receive will register in public borrowing figures .
Yet it argues that the differing ways of showing the money are both acceptable : it uses the European System of Accounts , while the NAO relies on UK commercial accounting standards .
An ONS spokesman said : ' If the SRA lays its accounts before Parliament and they include Network Rail , we will take no notice at all . '
But John Stittle , a fellow of Essex University who advised Labour 's transport team in opposition , says : ' Enronitis has hit Network Rail .
The thing relies on public guarantees , so it is public .
It should be so in the national accounts . '"
2002-07-08,"The former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Wakeham was among Enron directors criticised by a US Senate investigation for allowing "" high - risk "" accounting practices and giving free rein to the executives engaged in them .
Members of the board let bankrupt US energy company Enron move nearly half its assets off the balance sheet to make the company 's financial statements look better , the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations concluded .
Board members looked the other way as accountants pushed the limits of accepted practice and executives profited at Enron 's expense , the panel said in a report .
The report concluded : "" Much that was wrong with Enron was known to the board . ""
By failing to provide sufficient oversight and restraint to stop management excess , the Enron board contributed to the company 's collapse and bears a share of the responsibility for it . ""
The report said the board "" knowingly allowed Enron to engage in high - risk accounting practices "" .
It also "" knowingly allowed Enron to move at least $ 27bn or almost 50 % of its assets off balance sheet "" .
The report summed up a hearing held in May and extensive interviews with 13 past and present Enron board members .
Enron was declared bankrupt in December last year after its stock collapsed amid allegations its accountants hid corporate debt to boost profits .
A lawyer for the board , W Neil Eggleston , told the New York Times the report unfairly criticised the board , which he said had been misled by management and outside auditors .
Lord Wakeham was a member of Enron 's audit committee .
He stood aside and eventually resigned as chairman of the press complaints commission after his role in Enron was questioned ."
2002-07-08,"Supermarket group Sainsbury 's expects to cut its power bills and carbon dioxide emissions from its buildings after signing an energy management contract with the German multi - utility RWE .
The outsourcing deal replaces a similar agreement reached with the disgraced energy trader Enron shortly before its collapse late last year .
Under the four - and - a - half - year deal announced by Sainsbury group energy manager Julius Brinkworth ( pictured ) , RWE will supply gas and electricity to stores , depots and offices , and manage a £ 14.5 m investment in energy efficiency measures across the business .
The programme will include modification of refrigeration systems , a review of existing equipment and monitoring of temperature controls .
Sainsbury 's , which operates 458 stores around the UK , says the move is expected to cut its £ 50 m a year energy bill by 11 % over two years .
It will also contribute to its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions from its buildings by 10 % by March 2005 ."
2002-07-08,"Job : chairman , Pressbof Age : 68 Industry :
publishing Staff : Pressbof has 11 members 2001 ranking : new entry
Although long retired from the Guardian Media Group where he was chairman and chief executive , the veteran newspaper man Sir Harry Roche this year took on a significant role in the future of press regulation .
Sir Harry is leading the hunt to find the next chairman of the press complaints commission following the resignation of Lord Wakeham in the wake of the Enron scandal .
As the chairman of Pressbof , the governing and funding body of the PCC , he will oversee the appointment of a successor to Lord Wakeham , who formally departs in September .
A strong , effective and independent PCC is seen as crucial in the fight against privacy legislation but pressure for fundamental reforms at the watchdog has grown over the last year amid concern it is more interested in protecting the royal family , celebrities and politicians than safeguarding a free press .
The editor of the Daily Telegraph , Charles Moore , called the PCC a "" stitch - up "" after his paper was reprimanded for publishing details about the prime minister 's son 's university plans , while Simon Kelner , the editor of the Independent , said the PCC "" cosies up to the rich and powerful "" .
The remarks set the editors on a collision course with their counterparts at the News of the World and the Mirror who defended the PCC , insisting it had made "" robust "" decisions .
With editors at loggerheads over the future of the watchdog , Sir Harry 's role becomes as much a peacemaker as well as a rallying point for possible action for reform .
His knighthood in 1999 marked 50 years in the newspaper industry , which started in print engraving .
Although long associated with the Guardian , Sir Harry started his career on the Mirror where he worked for 26 years , rising through the ranks to become production director and ultimately managing director .
He was was involved in nearly every major milestone in the modern development of the Guardian including the introduction of new printing technologies in the 80s , and the takeover of the Observer in 1993 ."
2002-07-09,"The Bank for International Settlements , the Swiss - based central bankers ' central bank , yesterday blamed the collapse of energy trader Enron on a catastrophic failure of corporate governance .
In a sweeping condemnation of those involved in the scandal the BIS said : "" The company 's board of directors , the external auditor , stock analysts , credit rating agencies , creditors and investors jointly failed to critically assess how Enron 's management achieved ostensibly superior earnings growth . ""
In particular few asked hard questions about the nature of numerous off - balance sheet transactions , transactions which helped to hide mounting losses . ""
In a sharply worded analysis of the fall - out from the Enron affair , the BIS noted that financial markets reacted far more dramatically to the news that the auditors had shredded documents than to Enron 's initial bankruptcy filing in December last year .
It said the bull market of the late 1990s had created a corporate culture in which "" firms had an incentive to present financial reports that would inflate earnings expectations "" .
It added : "" Auditing firms and stock analysts increasingly found their interests aligned with the companies aggressively managing their earnings . ""
The BIS said the Enron affair had damaged reputations and led to measures seeking to prevent a repetition but warned : "" It remains to be seen whether the efforts thus far will be sufficient to fully reassure investors or to withstand the distortions that the next bull market will no doubt bring . ""
However , the bank remains concerned that share prices are still overvalued .
In its latest report the BIS warned : "" Although financial markets responded more smoothly than many expected to a series of tests vulnerabilities remain . """
2002-07-09,"Lord Wakeham of Maldon , the legendary backstairs fixer of the Tory years in government , was busy in the House of Lords and at business meetings yesterday - much as usual - despite his apparent shortcomings in the Enron affair being blazoned all over the morning papers .
With a US Senate sub - committee report denouncing the failure of Enron 's non - executive directors , including Lord Wakeham , to challenge the collapsed energy firm 's "" high risk "" accounting practices - and with sacked staff threatening to bankrupt him - this looks like a problem Mr Fixit will be unable to fix .
The Senate committee - its report allegedly timed to embarrass President George Bush ahead of today 's big ethics speech - rejects directors ' claims that they were kept in the dark .
They had ignored a dozen "" red flags "" since 1999 , senators concluded .
Yesterday 's Financial Times ran a trenchant editorial criticising Lord Wakeham , himself an accountant , and his colleagues .
One obvious question that went unasked , said the FT , was : why did the company pay out almost $ 750 m ( £ 517 m ) in bonuses in a year when net income was $ 975 m ( £ 672 m ) ?
The Senate committee report says accountants Andersen warned Enron directors in February 1999 that the firm was "" pushing the limits "" of acceptable accounting practice .
"" Much that was wrong with Enron was known to the board , from high - risk accounting practices and inappropriate conflict of interest transactions undisclosed off - the - books activity and excessive executive compensation , "" the report noted .
As recently as May 2000 , the board 's finance committee was told key executives in the scandal had generated $ 1.4bn in "" funds flow "" in just six months .
Nobody asked how they did it .
At least $ 27bn of assets , almost half the total , were moved off the books with the board 's knowledge .
Huge payments to executives were also rubber - stamped .
Lord Wakeham , who still sits on boards like those of Vosper Thorneycroft and Michael Page , the employment firm , reportedly received a regular £ 4,100 a month consultancy fee .
Throughout the drama he has said little or nothing in public , though he let it be known on day one that he did not sell shares before the Enron crash - as Enron insiders did by the million .
Lord Wakeham and fellow non - executive directors have left their defence to the team of American lawyers , who were last night preparing rebuttal of charges made by the Senate committee .
That stance will not change , probably not even when Lord Wakeham faces the Commons Treasury select committee .
Having just turned 70 , he knows most of his lucrative boardroom positions would be ending around now anyway .
Nor is there any question of him returning to chair the press complaints commission , from which he resigned when the Enron scandal broke .
And , mercifully for Tony Blair , the Enron debacle came well after Lord Wakeham chaired the royal commission on stage two reform of the Lords .
The trade secretary , Patricia Hewitt , herself a former Andersen management consultant , is now calling for stiffer fines and jail terms for corporate fraud .
Lord Wakeham has quietly told family and friends that the right questions were asked and paperwork exists that will prove it ."
2002-07-09,"The US president , George Bush , today delivered a speech to Wall Street demanding "" a new era of integrity "" in American corporate life following the Enron collapse and WorldCom fraud .
He lay the blame for the malaise among the once seemingly invincible companies and New York stock exchange on the "" corporate abuses "" of the 1990s - when Bill Clinton was in power - and put forward a series of new measures , including a doubling of the maximum jail term for financial fraud to 10 years . ""
The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet , "" he said .
"" I am calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community - an ethic that will increase investor confidence , make employees proud of their companies and regain the trust of the American people . ""
He announced the creation of a "" financial crimes Swat team "" by executive order and - asking for corporate cooperation - said that independent directors should form the majority on company boards and shareholders should approve all stock option plans .
Other measures include enhancing the ability of the federal government 's securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) to freeze improper payments to corporate executives while a company is under investigation , and persuading publicly traded companies to prevent corporate officers from receiving loans from their own companies .
The attempt to exert some control over the escalating crisis in the US comes as fresh accusations have been levelled at the president over his own business dealings .
Democrats have unearthed an investigation into Mr Bush by financial watchdogs a decade ago while he was a director of the oil company Harken Energy , and are calling for details of the inquiry to be published in full .
But the president also hit back at the Democrat - led Senate , saying it should do more to help his mission to restore the reputation of the corporations . ""
The Senate needs to act quickly and responsibly so I can sign a good bill in the autumn , "" he said .
The campaign for business and accounting reform was sparked by the collapse of Enron , but has found new momentum as investors reacted furiously to the huge amounts earned by executives as their companies were careering toward collapse .
"" More scandals are hiding in corporate America , "" the president said .
"" We must find and expose them now so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets . """

2002-07-11,"The City 's most powerful investors are urging the chancellor to take action to prevent new European rules reducing their ability to police UK boardrooms .
In a letter to Gordon Brown , the leading shareholders who control most of the stock market warn the government about the impact a proposed EU directive will have on corporate governance at a time when the collapse of US energy group Enron is focusing attention on shareholder rights .
The prospectus directive sets the rules about information disclosed by listed companies and threatens shareholder rights to vote on some transactions and directors ' pay packets in certain circumstances .
"" It can not be right to dismantle [ Britain 's tougher rules ] just when developments in the US point to the need for more effective corporate governance , "" said the letter from the Association of British Insurers , the National Association of Pension Funds and the Investment Management Association .
Shareholder rights are essential , their letter points out , and Britain has some of the most respected rules in the world .
The fund management groups make it clear that they are not against unification of Europe 's financial rules and believe the directive could be reworded in such a way as to ease their concerns .
They are making their views known to the government just days after Sir Howard Davies , chairman of the financial services authority , issued a warning about the European directive .
He also expressed concerns about the timing of the proposed new rules . ""
In the aftermath of the Enron affair it is remarkable to think that we may soon lose the basis on which many corporate governance and disclosure provisions rest , "" he said last month .
Sir Howard is thought to be prepared to look for ways in which the directive can be side - stepped through new powers being given to the stock exchange or even through company law .
The FSA has responsibility for the present listing rules with which quoted companies must comply .
A spokesman for the Treasury said : "" The government is committed to maintaining the highest standards of financial disclosure and corporate governance and will continue to keep under review how best to achieve that objective . ""
The Treasury has set up a taskforce , due to report this month , to examine ways in which to improve accounting and corporate governance in the light of Enron 's failure ."
2002-07-12,"A British executive from Enron , the bankrupt US energy trader that fell foul of American regulators , is joining UK energy regulator Ofgem .
Kyran Hanks , who joined Enron in 1998 , will take up a year - long post as director of gas trading arrangements at Ofgem .
He worked for Ofgem 's predecessors , electricity regulator Offer and gas regulator Ofgas , between 1989 and 1998 .
Mr Hanks , who starts on Monday , is taking over from Nick Fincham , who is going on secondment as chief economic adviser to the new postal services regulator , PostComm .
Callum McCarthy , Ofgem chief executive , said : "" Kyran Hanks has an in - depth understanding of gas trading having worked extensively on this issue while head of network operations at Ofgas . ""
Mr Hanks 's post at Enron Europe included work on electricity and gas regulatory issues in mainland Europe , particularly dealing with EC officials .
He also worked on energy pricing for industrial and commercial customers .
Enron , which went bankrupt late last year after a series of accounting scandals , has also clashed with regulators over its alleged manipulation of US energy prices , notably in the Californian power crisis .
Mr Hanks , who will be involved in developing Ofgem 's plans for a new balancing mechanism in gas trading and long - term capacity auctions , won the backing of senior officials , who said : "" Kyran has got the right experience and knowledge we are looking for to fulfil an important job at Ofgem .
He 's just a person who used to work for Enron .
To blacken everybody 's name simply because they worked for Enron would be very unfair . ""
Ofgem also promised lower gas prices through tighter regulator of Transco , the gas pipelines operator planning a merger with National Grid ."
2002-07-12,"The European commission yesterday launched a five - point plan aimed at restoring confidence in financial markets battered by a series of accounting and corporate governance scandals .
Frits Bolkestein , the commissioner , used a speech to financial professionals in Paris to announce a programme covering corporate governance , improved accounting standards , auditors ' independence , quality of financial information and a prudential approach to risk .
The problems and issues thrown up by Enron , WorldCom , Xerox and Merck "" are issues for all of us and which we must address urgently "" , he said .
"" Investors have a right to all the necessary , up to date and accurate information which will allow them to make an informed choice .
Markets will increasingly savage all those companies which fail these tests . ""
Mr Bolkestein said the EC had already been working towards strengthening markets through the financial markets action plan and that efforts would be stepped up in the wake of the crisis of confidence .
He called for greater convergence of accounting standards and said he would be working with the US authorities "" at both a political and technical level "" ."
2002-07-12,"The former editor of the Financial Times , Richard Lambert , recently wrote a penetrating article in the wake of Enron asking : how did the press miss the story ?
It was a reasonable question - and one close to the hearts of anyone currently watching their pension fund dwindle in the wake of a stream of other corporate implosions we should have seen coming .
As newspapers , we should accept our measure of blame and try to do better in future .
But newspaper watchdogs are little use if they have no teeth and no bark .
Similarly , there is little point in expecting journalists to perform a more rigorous job of monitoring the City and corporate world if you simultaneously muzzle them and bind their feet .
That - though surely hardly intended - will be the utterly predictable effect of the twin actions pursued against five media organisations by a curious alliance between Interbrew , the Belgian brewing company , and the financial services authority .
Interbrew have for eight months now been trying to force four newspapers - including the Guardian - as well as Reuters news agency to hand over a leaked document which suggested that the company was preparing a bid for South African Breweries .
The FSA - backed by fearsome powers of search and compulsion - launched a simultaneous action to get hold of the documents with a view to identifying the source .
Both were threatening to turn up in concert today to seize the documents , though by last night the FSA seemed to have reconsidered this course of action .
The coordinated behaviour of both organisations seems odd , especially given that they are already believed to have copies of the leaked document in their possession .
Equally worrying was the refusal of the House of Lords to allow any appeal against the orders of the high court and court of appeal that the editors should hand over the documents .
Lord Woolf bracketed this case with another involving protection of journalistic sources over the publication of the medical records of the Moors murderer , Ian Brady .
This was simply perverse .
There is virtually no public interest in infringing the medical confidentiality of Mr Brady .
There is every public interest in ensuring that sources of information about large publicly listed companies are not "" chilled "" by oppressive legal and criminal sanctions .
It is argued by some that the leaker in Interbrew was acting out of unworthy motives .
That is unproven and unknowable .
But , as Lord Justice Laws said in the Brady case : "" The ' chilling effect ' of court orders ... is not to the least degree lessened ... by the fact that the source is a disloyal and greedy individual , prepared for money to betray his employer 's confidences . ""
The European court of human rights has - as the master of the rolls accepted in the Brady case - a better record of protecting the freedom of the press than the English courts .
It was there that Bill Goodwin found the protection for his sources that the English courts denied him in 1990 .
And it is there that the five media organisations must now take our case .
Sources , as Lord Woolf himself acknowledged , may lack the courage to leak or whistleblow if they fear they will be identified , still less prosecuted or arrested .
It is undeniably irritating - even damaging - for some companies if sensitive information is leaked .
The intention of the leaker may even be malign or criminal .
But only in the most utterly exceptional circumstances must journalists ever be required to prejudice the free exchange of information by shopping their sources .
The Interbrew case is not one of them ."
2002-07-14,"Every day seems to bring another corporate scandal .
Enron 's former leadership face Congressional hearings , civil actions from outraged investors and criminal investigations .
Pantechnicons arrive at dead of night outside WorldCom offices ( allegedly ) as former company bigwigs make off with all the documents before the collapse is announced .
Estimates of WorldCom losses range from a startling $ 4 billion dollars to an astounding $ 40 billion .
Even President Bush , no stranger to the vagaries of business , is moved to make noises about business ethics and the need for higher standards .
Meanwhile stock markets reel .
The FTSE 100 follows Wall Street and plummets to a five year low , pausing only for an occasional "" dead cat bounce "" .
Investors start to realise the full import of the small print which says "" the value of shares can go down as well as up "" .
Millions of people who have been paying into private pension schemes for years begin to wonder if they will ever see any significant returns .
This scene of devastation is not a happy picture .
It suggests rather strongly that something is radically wrong in this era of free markets and ever larger and more powerful global corporations .
Above all , it raises the question of how these great institutions are run , who controls them , and to whom they are accountable .
It is not enough simply to call for higher accounting standards and a crackdown on corporate misrepresentation .
There is also the burning issue of how companies meet responsibilities to their employees , the environment and the local communities around them .
This is all the more important in an era when private companies are gaining ever greater control over essential public goods and services .
Take water , for example .
French company Vivendi is now supplying water , that most essential of all public goods , to 110 million people around the world including more than six million in the UK .
UK companies it controls include Southern Water and Three Valleys Water .
Yet the company has , to put it politely , a troubled past .
Last year a senior Vivendi manager was convicted of bribery in Italy , having paid the president of Milan city council for contracts .
In 1997 , French Minister Jean Michel Boucheron was convicted of taking bribes from Companie Generale de Eaux ( the predecessor of Vivendi ) .
Executives of G¿n¿rale des Eaux were convicted of bribing the mayor of St - Denis
( Ile de R¿union ) to obtain the water concession .
Meanwhile in the developing world , Vivendi has been challenged over its environmental performance .
For example , The Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority 's water supply and sanitation services were privatised to Vivendi 's Compania de Agua in 1995 .
Since then , PRASA has been the subject of two highly critical reports by the Puerto Rico Office of the Comptroller , who said in a press conference that water privatisation "" has been a bad deal for the people of Puerto Rico "" .
The most recent report found 3,181 deficiencies in management , operation and maintenance of the infrastructure and said the leakage rate was around 50 % .
Since privatisation , PRASA has been fined a total of more than $ 6 million for various violations of environmental laws .
Perhaps its not surprising that companies who play fast and loose with investors and the political process are also likely to neglect their responsibilities to the environment and to their staff .
A solution to the problem of corporate governance will need to include new duties on directors and company officers in all these areas .
This is no longer simply the heretical idea of a group of green campaigners .
This week Mervin Pedelty , CEO of the Co - operative Bank spoke out about the need to require companies by law to report on their ethical and social performance .
It should be remembered that Tony Blair 's call on large companies to do this voluntarily was largely ignored .
Speaking to the CBI in October 2000 he called on the UK 's largest companies to produce such reports by the end of 2001 .
But by the deadline only 79 of the top 350 companies had met his request .
Clearly voluntarism is not enough .
Mr Pedelty 's call for legislation should clearly be heeded as soon as possible .
We will need to go further .
Above all , we need to place a legal duty on company directors and officers to consider more than simply returns to shareholders , as set out in the Bill recently presented to the UK Parliament by Linda Perham MP .
The duty on directors to maximise returns should be matched by a duty of "" corporate citizenship "" , which would require them to consider the effects of their actions on the environment , on human rights , on local communities and on employees .
Directors who failed to meet this duty would face civil liability and in extreme cases criminal prosecution .
Large companies will not simply go away .
Indeed private firms will continue to be the main producers of wealth in the world - if not for ever then certainly for as far into the future as even the most optimistic Marxist could predict .
Corporations will continue to make profits because these are the essential driver of economic development .
But in a world where the largest companies become ever more powerful they can not escape the issue of accountability for their actions .
This will be a major issue at the forthcoming Earth Summit in Johannesburg .
Crucially , a recent Harris Poll in the US showed that no less than 95 % of the American public would prefer companies to be run with more than the sole purpose of making money .
Corporate accountability is an idea whose time has come .
If , even after the WorldCom and Enron scandals , President Bush and the US Administration continue to resist binding international agreements in this area , they may pay a political price at home as well as abroad .

2002-07-15,"Student employability is likely to suffer next year as the knock - on effect of the Enron debacle hits the graduate recruitment market .
PriceWaterhouseCoopers , Anderson , Deloitte and KPMG , which feature among the 15 most attractive recruiters by graduates , are set to sell off , or close down their consulting divisions following the collapse of Enron , Xerox and Worldcom after allegations of mis - management .
The financial services , auditing and consultancy sectors dominate the top 25 most attractive graduate recruiters - as judged by graduates .
Ernst and Young are the number one company graduates say they would want to work for - 24 % polled identified it as being a very attractive company .
IBM came second , with its combination of consultancy and technology , attracting 23 % .
Banking and other financial services featured prominently , with 12 out of the top 25 being banks such as Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank .
The BBC and Channel 4 also appear in the top 25 , but are the only non - financial based companies to do so .
The survey was carried out by AIESEC UK , a global organisation representing students , and Topcareers , which carried out the research .
Ben Sowter , president of AIESEC UK , said the research demonstrated the diversity of interests among graduates today .
"" The results are incredibly insightful and useful both for companies seeking graduates and for graduates interested in knowing which are the most sought after employers , "" he said .
Taking part in the survey were 16,000 students from more than 40 universities across the UK ."
2002-07-15,"The chief executive of Vodafone , Sir Christopher Gent , is suing the Daily Telegraph for an alleged libel in the paper 's business pages last month .
Olswang , the law firm advising Vodafone , has filed a claim in the high court in London in response to an opinion piece about the impact on stock market confidence of the accounting scandals at Enron and Worldcom .
The story , which appeared in the Telegraph on June 27 , mentioned Vodafone and the controversial pay package awarded to Sir Christopher .
He has been under pressure since revealing he was to receive a record bonus despite Vodafone last year posting the biggest loss in British corporate history .
Vodafone confirmed a complaint had been lodged but refused to comment further ."
2002-07-15,"The combined effect of September 11 , the collapse of Enron and global recession is taking its toll on MBA graduates , with starting salaries falling back to 1999 levels .
For MBA graduates of American and European universities , salaries in excess of £ 50,000 have been the norm for several years .
This year , however , average MBA salaries have fallen to £ 47,000 , although this figure still represents a 20 % rise since 1992 and a near doubling of average pre - MBA salaries .
Starting salaries in Britain for MBA graduates remain higher than in other countries .
Simon Tankard , from Oxford University , reported an average starting salary of £ 54,000 .
Chris Bristow , director of the career service at London Business School , said : "" The market is more difficult this year .
Many of our MBAs who would previously have entered consulting and banking are , in fact , joining companies in other sectors at lower salaries . ""
MBA salaries in Asia are also catching up with the US , having reached nearly £ 44,000 .
Salaries in Latin America and Eastern Europe remain 30 % less than the US , but , according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , the cost of living in these regions is more than 40 % lower , more than compensating for this salary differential .
But Latin America has shown the strongest salary increase of any region in 2002 .
It is the only region of the world reporting a 10 % increase in MBA salaries this year .
Raffaella D'Angiolino , a partner at the MBA recruiters Accenture , said recruiters were still battling to fill the coveted jobs .
"" The battle for the best talent is a constant .
Even when markets are not as strong , we have constantly to seek out the best and brightest , "" he said .
Starting salaries for graduates entering graduate jobs topped £ 20,000 for the first time this year .
Last month , a survey from the career services unit reported that a university degree could boost earning power by up to £ 15,000 a year .
World MBA Tour and www.topmba.com surveyed more than 4,000 recruiters during the spring and summer of 2002 to establish the salaries and benefits on offer to new MBA graduates around the world ."
2002-07-15,"Imagine if you can a scandal - comparable to those sweeping through commercial America - infecting the economy of a genuine social democratic country .
It is hard to construct a hypothesis which mirrors fraud on the scale which is alleged to characterise the six major companies - Qwest Communications , WorldCom , Enron Corporation , Tyco International , Computer Associates and ImClone Systems - which are now under criminal investigation by the US Justice Department .
But let us pretend that , 10 years ago , the Swedish social fund - by which that country 's trade unions helped to manage tax - financed investment in socially desirable projects - had been accused of publishing bogus balance sheets and lining the pockets of its directors .
There is no doubt what the reaction would have been .
The chorus of excoriation would have been carefully orchestrated by the Adam Smith Institute .
The scandal would have been denounced , not as an aberration but the result of socialism 's inherent weakness .
We would have been told that nothing better was to be expected from a system which disturbed the equilibrium of the free market .
There would have followed confident , if not very carefully argued , explanations of why inefficiency and corruption is the inevitable result of tampering with a system which makes us prosperous .
Now the six great companies - not to mention Arthur Andersen - have all demonstrated how fallible free enterprise is .
And the world 's social democrats have not said a word .
It is , I fear , an indication of social democracy 's crisis of confidence .
The Friedmanites and Hayekians have not won the intellectual argument .
But they have shouted their opponents down .
We have been bombarded with the undoubted truth that technology makes the global market irresistible .
But that honest fact has been embellished with two corrupt and self - serving inventions .
First , there is no way in which the multinational corporations can be even deflected from their chosen course and , second , we should rejoice that unrestrained freedom produces the best of all possible material worlds .
It was , perhaps , pointless to say : "" Tell that to the starving people of sub - Saharan Africa . ""
But we might now expect the weakness in the argument to be appreciated by those Enron employees who were encouraged to invest their life savings in the collapsing corporation while its senior executives methodically transferred their considerable wealth to other companies .
The fundamental flaw in unregulated capitalism ought to be obvious .
Men and women of apparent intelligence and generally recognised probity openly argue that "" greed is good "" .
We applaud the notion that the acquisitive instinct makes the world go round .
So we should not be surprised if one or two men and women with masters ' degrees in business administration try to make it spin a little faster with schemes which are a credit to their ingenuity but not their honesty .
The profit motive breeds corruption .
The best that capitalism can argue in its own defence is incompetence - a plea which makes nonsense of the claim that competition is the guarantee of efficiency .
Perhaps , in the primitive societies , where ( according to Adam Smith ) a fair wage could be calculated by the time it took to catch and skin a badger , the fear of being undercut and driven out of business did keep prices down and performance up .
But the men who ran Xerox and Arthur Andersen had not read The Wealth of Nations .
Either that or , as Adam Smith warned , they combined to insulate and protect each other from the bracing winds of market forces .
The inevitable success of capitalism is one of history 's confidence tricks .
Do not write to tell me that a command economy of commissars and rationing is consistent with neither freedom nor prosperity .
I know that already .
But I also know that if we treat the laissez - faire alternative as President George Bush treats it - near to perfection as any economic system can be but embarrassed by the behaviour of half a dozen unrepresentative rogues - we will never deal with its inherent flaws .
The president 's speech to Wall Street last week aimed "" to restore confidence in the markets "" .
It should have described government action which , by first punishing and then preventing wrongdoing , made renewed confidence justified .
Yet social democrats have remained depressingly silent .
Perhaps it would have all been different if 92-year - old John Galbraith could emerge from his gothic house in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and smite the forces of the ungodly .
But there must be somebody with the time and the talent to write a genuine exploration of modern capitalism 's fundamental shortcomings .
He or she could begin with the story of a real Swedish economic catastrophe - the unique reduction in national income in two consecutive years .
That happened when the free marketers briefly became the Stockholm government .
It passed , at the time , virtually without notice .
Why do we social democrats lack the confidence to smite our undeniably vulnerable foes ?

2002-07-15,"A proven political "" fixer "" has been handed the delicate task of restoring the dented reputation of the press complaints commission .
Sir Christopher Meyer , the British ambassador to Washington and a popular figure with both Labour and Tory administrations , is to take over as PCC chairman following the resignation of Lord Wakeham , the Tory peer who became mired in the Enron scandal .
He takes on the role at a time of rising public concern about press standards and industry disquiet about the role of the PCC .
The commission received more than 3,000 complaints last year , up 36 % on the previous year , and was also accused of being too close to some tabloid editors .
Notably , it was alleged that a deal was done between the News of the World and St James 's Palace over the story of Prince Harry 's experimentation with drugs .
Sir Christopher is said to be adept at walking such tightropes : he was chief press secretary to John Major when tension between the press and the then prime minister was at its height .
Piers Morgan , editor of the Mirror , who has gone into battle with the PCC over issues of privacy and journalistic ethics , said Sir Christopher showed while on the staff of Mr Major that he was fair in his dealings with the media . ""
He 'll be on the press 's case , but he 'll not be anti - tabloid .
If he was , the whole thing would collapse . ""
He said the PCC chairman needed to be even - handed . ""
Every day there will be the prime minister and members of the royal family on one phone , and the editors of newspapers on the other .
He has to be able to find a way of mediating between the two , without succumbing to the blood - lust of the broadsheets . ""
Some editors , including those at the Daily Telegraph , the Independent and the Guardian , have expressed concerns that the PCC is not sufficiently transparent and is too close to the tabloids .
The friendships of the players in the Prince Harry story came under the spotlight :
Guy Black , the PCC director , is the partner of Mark Bolland , outgoing deputy private secretary to Prince Charles .
Both have taken holidays with Rebekah Wade , editor of the News of the World .
But Mr Morgan said : "" I was always in favour of Lord Wakeham doing deals .
That was always better than taking one side . ""
The PCC prefers to resolve disputes by mediation : of the 3,000 complaints last year , only 41 went to a full adjudication and 19 were upheld .
Sir Christopher , 58 , is expected to take up the position in the spring of 2003 , subject to the approval of the foreign secretary under the rules covering business appointments .
Controversial business links brought down the last chairman .
Lord Wakeham resigned after he was called to appear before US congressional inquiries into the collapse of Enron , of which he was a non - executive director .
Sir Christopher has restricted his comments to a prepared statement : "" I am a strong believer in the self - regulation of the newspaper and magazine publishing industry .
I look forward to taking on this challenging and exciting task next year .
I do not intend to comment further until then . ""
Robert Pinker , the acting chairman since Lord Wakeham resigned , will stay in place in the meantime .
The appointment was welcomed across the political spectrum .
The Tory frontbench spokesman Tim Collins MP said : "" Christopher Meyer has been a model public servant to both Conservative and Labour governments and will bring a waspish wit , enormous skill and great dedication to his new role . ""
Speculation that Peter Mandelson , the former Northern Ireland secretary , would replace Sir Christopher in Washington was dismissed by Downing Street last night as "" totally without foundation "" .
A leading contender is thought to be Sir David Manning , a foreign policy adviser to the prime minister and former ambassador to Nato .
Sir Stephen Wall , Mr Blair 's European Union policy adviser and a former ambassador to the EU , is also likely to be considered ."
2002-07-17,"Company directors and employees could face up to two years in prison and unlimited fines for giving dishonest or misleading information to auditors , under a review of company law announced by ministers yesterday .
The proposed legislation , hailed by competition minister Melanie Johnson as promoting a new era in British corporate life , gives auditors a statutory right for the first time to ask for information from employees and contractors .
The proposal is the government 's first response to the widespread anxiety caused by the accounting scandal at bankrupt US energy trader Enron and subsequent debacles at groups such as WorldCom .
It is due to be followed by a further set of proposals next week when the government 's so - called "" post - Enron group "" gives its interim report to ministers .
Ms Johnson , pointing to the recent loss of investor confidence , said : "" We need an improved quality of information available to create market confidence . ""
Under draft clauses for a putative bill , an employee refusing to answer an auditor 's questions would be liable to a fine of £ 5,000 .
If the information given is "" knowingly or recklessly misleading , materially deceptive or incorrect "" , the maximum penalty would be an unlimited fine and/or two years in prison .
Directors would face the same range of penalties .
Ms Johnson said two years ' imprisonment was "" a substantial deterrent "" against concealing the true state of company accounts .
Promising legislation to modernise company law in the course of this parliament , she said current law was "" creaking with age "" and had become a competitive disadvantage .
Existing legislation , stretching back to 1852 , is enshrined in more than 700 pages but the new law , Ms Johnson said , would be the biggest single piece of legislation in British history and could emerge as even more than 700 pages .
Under the proposals , welcomed by business groups and said to save small business £ 168 m a year , companies will no longer have to hold annual meetings or appoint company secretaries .
Small companies will need to file short , simple accounts while the 1,000 largest companies will have to provide an operating and financial review .
Quoted companies must publish accounts on websites four months from year - end while private companies must file accounts within seven months - compared with 10 now - and public ones within six months ( seven months now ) ."
2002-07-20,"In the market 's usual unsentimental way , Abbey National 's shares outperformed yesterday as chief executive Ian Harley went overboard .
At one level , the reaction is understandable : after the losses from loans to Enron and the ridiculous adventure into US junk bonds , Harley 's credibility was at zero in the City , particularly as he was also seen as an opponent of any takeover bid .
The City , however , clearly spent less time considering how many questions are left unanswered by Harley 's early exit .
For a start , do we really know if there are more nasties within the wholesale division ?
Abbey is a regulated business and so we must assume , from their silence , that the authorities are happy with the level of disclosure .
But if there is any lesson from the two - year bear market , it is that last month 's BBB - rated debt can be this month 's junk and next month 's non - performing asset , as the bankers like to phrase it .
Nor can life be much fun in the rest of Abbey 's operation .
In the life business , it had to pump £ 150 m into its Scottish Mutual subsidiary - and that was before the latest downward lurch in the market .
Over in the core business of mortgages , it declined to enter a price war with the Halifax .
Judgment will soon be passed on whether that call was a case of declining unprofitable business for sound reasons or one of being behind the times .
Wobbly markets also mean a bid is unlikely in the short - term .
Abbey is still worth the thick end of £ 10bn and it would be a brave chief executive who put that sum on the line at a time when the market has failed to find a floor .
Even National Australia Bank , owner of Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale and which likes to be linked with every rumour , would hesitate if it is sensible .
A replacement for Harley must be found .
Internally , there is nobody : Stephen Hester , the finance director , is untainted by the mess because he has been there only two months , but he is an investment banker , which is what Abbey does n't need at the top .
Gordon Pell , once of Lloyds TSB and now of Royal Bank of Scotland , and John Stewart , who went with the Woolwich to Barclays , will be on the wish - list .
Would they want it ?
Top jobs in British banking do not come around often , but when they do the patient 's diagnosis is usually clearer than it is at Abbey .
Forget thrift ; spend For years , the mantra of US treasury secretaries has been that a strong dollar is good for the economy .
That a weaker one is better seems to be the motto of Paul O'Neill , the latest holder of the office .
Neither the Fed nor the Treasury has shown any appetite for stemming the greenback 's 15 % slide this year against other world currencies .
The reason for their reluctance was highlighted yesterday by the release of another dire set of US trade figures .
So far the chief beneficiaries of the US economic recovery have been foreign companies .
Imports grew twice as fast as exports last month , helping send the US trade deficit ballooning to a record $ 37.64bn .
The weakening dollar has so far only served to make imports more expensive and the trade figures look worse .
If there has been a real shift in US policy over the dollar , America 's trading partners should be worried .
The US economy has been acting as the importer of last resort for the world economy ever since the Asian crisis .
But if America has decided it too needs to export its way out of trouble , other countries will have to start generating some home grown demand .
The euro 's new strength is delighting policymakers at the European Central Bank , but it should not distract them from the bigger issue : how to persuade European consumers to spend .
High 5 Media joint ventures rarely work , but there 's always an exception .
Channel 5 is odder than most joint ventures - it is 35%-owned by Lord Hollick 's United Business Media and 65 % is owned by RTL , which in turn is 90 % owned by Bertlesmann of Germany - but it is now a different beast from the one that dared to show Keith Chegwin in the buff in the jungle .
Its audience share is 6.4 % , enough to make it more than just an irritant to ITV .
At 7.3 % , its share of advertising is improving , which reflects the weightier tone of the programming .
Tonight , for example , prime time slots are taken by a piece on the Matisse Picasso exhibition at the Tate Modern , a look at the life of Julius Caesar and an exploration of the Marie Celeste .
For an erotic thriller with a bored housewife , you have to wait until 10.55pm .
Joint ventures , though , are rarely stable and Hollick , for one , is a willing seller .
Bertlesmann has consistently declined to reveal its intentions but it is hard to see how Channel 5 serves its ambition of 10 % of the UK advertising market .
Even at the current rate of progress , it will a long wait .
Logically , the obvious buyer is BSkyB , and the forthcoming communications bill allows such a move .
It would create a storm of protest , of course , but all the ingredients are there : a weak ITV , Bertlesmann 's need for cash , and a BBC that has become so commercial that its squeals of unfair competition would sound self - serving .
Murdoch has pulled off more daring stunts in the past ."
2002-07-22,"How big is this bankruptcy ?
The bankruptcy would be twice as large as that of energy trader Enron in December , which set a record at the time , and four times as large as that of telecommunications firm Global Crossing in January .
In its bankruptcy filing , WorldCom reported more than $ 107bn ( £ 67.9bn ) in assets and debts of $ 32bn .
Among the creditors listed in the filing are J P Morgan Trust , which is owed $ 17.2bn ; Mellon Bank , with a claim of $ 6.6bn ; and CitiBank , with a claim of nearly $ 3.3bn .
Does this mean the end of WorldCom ?
Not necessarily .
In filing for bankruptcy protection , WorldCom is buying time to reorganise itself ; to negotiate new loans while creditors are prevented from seizing its assets .
The company hopes to emerge from bankruptcy in 12 months and chief executive John Sidgmore said the bankruptcy should have no effect on the company 's customers - from long - distance users to corporate data users .
WorldCom is negotiating to raise $ 2bn in new financing and plans to sell its peripheral businesses , but not key ones such as MCI , its long - distance company , or UUNet , its internet arm .
How did WorldCom get into this state ?
The group last month admitted to having inflated profits by nearly $ 4bn through deceptive accounting .
WorldCom said its chief financial officer , Scott Sullivan , improperly reported expenses as investment so that the company 's financial situation looked much better than it was .
Was WorldCom already in trouble ?
WorldCom was struggling because of the vast overcapacity of bandwidth , combined with a consumer price war and the rise of mobile telephones .
The internet infrastructure lost much of its allure once it became apparent there was insufficient consumer demand for the services being offered over so - called broadband networks .
The long - distance sector , meanwhile , was hit by falling rates and growing competition from local phone companies getting into the long - distance market .
Meanwhile , customers were gravitating toward email and mobile phones .
Big as it was , WorldCom had neglected to get into mobiles .
What exactly is WorldCom ?
It is America 's second - biggest long - distance phone company and the largest mover of internet traffic .
WorldCom grew from a small long - distance company in Mississippi into a telecommunications behemoth through more than 60 acquisitions over 15 years , engineered by its founder , the flamboyant Bernard Ebbers .
In the process WorldCom snatched long - distance operator MCI for $ 37bn , when BT also had merger designs on the company .
When did it stop growing ?
The expansion ground to halt in 2000 , when US and European regulators blocked WorldCom 's proposed $ 129bn merger with Sprint .
Regulators contended the merger would have left millions of Americans paying more for internet and long - distance services .
At its height WorldCom was valued at $ 180bn , employing 80,000 people .
Mr Ebbers had a personal fortune of $ 1.4bn .
Now , weighed down with debt , its worth has dwindled to $ 280 m following the plunge in its share price .
It recently announced 17,000 job cuts .
What did Wall Street think of Mr Ebbers ?
Wall Street loves dealmakers and Mr Ebbers was feted as an amazing wheeler - dealer .
Not your usual pinstriped corporate type , Mr Ebbers was a former milkman and junior high school basketball coach from Alberta , Canada .
He ran a chain of Mississippi motels until he got into the phone business .
Regulators are already circling Mr Ebbers like vultures and he is now a disgraced figure .
Is WorldCom under investigation ?
In March , the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) launched a wide - ranging investigation of WorldCom that included a review of $ 408 m in company loans Mr Ebbers received .
WorldCom shareholders sued the company 's board over those loans .
A month later , Mr Ebbers resigned amid mounting questions about the loans and the financial health of the company and was replaced by Mr Sidgmore .
SEC investigators also focused on disputed customer bills , sales commissions and the value of contracts between WorldCom and customers no longer deemed financially viable .
In June the SEC filed fraud charges .
Why did the accounts fiddling go unnoticed ?
Arthur Andersen , which also audited Enron , said that Mr Sullivan withheld information during the audit .
When Andersen discovered that the expenses had been reported as investment , it advised WorldCom 's audit committee and its new management that WorldCom 's financial statements for 2001 should not be relied upon .
WorldCom replaced Andersen with KPMG last month .
Why should WorldCom rock the markets ?
This is the latest in a series of scandals from corporate America .
It all started with Enron , which filed for bankruptcy last December .
That led to the disintegration of Andersen , one of the world 's five biggest accountancy firms .
Since then conglomerate Tyco , Global Crossing and Xerox , the photocopy giant , and others have also been hit by questions of financial probity .
As one investor put it : "" We 've got to have something to base our bets on , and if we ca n't use the accounts all bets are off .
"" Is there a wider problem then ?
Excess seems to be part and parcel of a long bull market - this one has been going on for a record - breaking 10 years .
In a recent high - profile speech , Goldman Sachs ' chairman , Hank Paulson , issued in effect an apology to mainstream America for Wall Street 's excesses , saying : "" Long bull markets always seem to result in laxity and complacency . ""
Apart from the accounting scandals , Wall Street analysts have been accused of hyping up shares while privately rubbishing them .
Merrill Lynch recently made a $ 100 m out of court settlement over such charges ."
2002-07-22,"WorldCom , the scandal - hit telecoms company , was filing for bankruptcy protection early this morning , taking over from Enron as America 's largest corporate casualty .
The directors of the one - time stock market star agreed a 1,000-page submission for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings at a lengthy board meeting yesterday .
The move follows its disclosure last month of a $ 4bn ( £ 2.5bn ) accounting fraud and now means the cash - strapped group has protection from creditors .
John Sidgmore , the embattled chief executive , told Reuters that WorldCom would clinch $ 2bn in funding to allow it to continue operating while in Chapter 11 .
His long - term position is unclear , however , as expectations are mounting that new senior executives will be brought in to tackle the inevitable restructuring that will now take place of the world 's largest mover of internet traffic .
He said : "" Because we 're going to restructure our balance sheet and reduce our debt , we think we can emerge from the Chapter 11 process a stronger and healthier company . ""
The Mississippi - based business , founded by the flamboyant Bernie Ebbers , has been locked in talks with its banks about securing enough financing to continue operations while the bankruptcy process proceeds .
It has $ 30bn of debt and owes the banks $ 2.5bn in recently granted loans .
Its crisis has already had far reaching repercussions on Wall Street and shocked Capitol Hill by increasing fears about the accuracy of corporate accounts during the dotcom boom .
The Dow Jones industrial average sank to a four - year low in volatile trading on Friday , leaving investors on both sides of the Atlantic facing a week that may be one of the most testing of recent times .
Dealers in the City are bracing themselves for another turbulent day today .
The rout on the US markets has prompted American authorities to step up their efforts to bolster investor sentiment .
Over the weekend President Bush , still trying to fend off accusations about his own business dealings , asked Congress to work quickly to endorse new measures to crack down on corporate crime .
"" It is time to act decisively to bring a new era of integrity to American business , "" he said .
Mr Bush wants new legisla tion , currently in the delicate negotiation stage between the House and Senate , to be sorted out before the August recess .
In his effort to try to reassure Americans annoyed about the losses in their individual share holdings and pensions , he insisted that he was taking swift and tough action .
"" We will defend the rights and interests of every American worker and shareholder , and we will not accept anything less than complete honesty . ""
The chief executives of America 's biggest companies have been ordered to endorse their own accounting policies by the middle of next month .
Mr Bush has been under fire for his dealings at Harken Energy , while his vice - president , Dick Cheney , is facing questions about his period at Halliburton , another company under investigation .
Even before WorldCom 's accounting scandal , the collapse of Enron was a devastating blow for the White House , because the energy company was a big Republican party donor .
A move into Chapter 11 by WorldCom means it was able to continue operations without concern that its creditors will demand payment .
The company had said that it would not try to sell off any of its subsidiaries , a move that would unsettle creditors , but a Chapter 11 filing could negate that pledge .
It is also facing court action from banks about the timing of its decision to draw down on a $ 2.5bn loan and lawsuits from shareholders ."
2002-07-23,"Jack Grubman , the Wall Street analyst who championed WorldCom to investors , is facing regulatory action by the National Association of Securities Dealers , the body that regulates securities firms .
The move is a further embarrassment for Mr Grubman , 49 , who has already been subjected to tough questioning before a Congress investigation into WorldCom .
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Grubman 's ultimate employer , Citigroup , has come under fire for its role in the Enron scandal .
Citigroup , along with JP Morgan Chase , was reported to have arranged unusual finance for the collapsed energy trader .
The banks were said to have transferred more than $ 5bn to Enron using complex transactions which were labelled as energy trades , and helped to hide the company 's debt in the months before its bankruptcy in December .
Citigroup insisted the arrangement was consistent with accounting practices .
The new allegation against Mr Grubman relates to another fallen star , telecoms company Winstar .
The regulatory arm of the NASD said Mr Grubman misled investors by being overly optimistic about the prospects for Winstar , a client of Citigroup 's Salomon business , which filed for bankruptcy protection last year .
NASD 's decision is seen as a sign that it is determined to take tough action in its investigation into the activities of investment banks during the dotcom boom .
There have been claims that analysts touted shares in firms so that bankers could win business from them .
The NASD inquiries follow similar moves by the securities and exchange commission and New York attorney - general Eliot Spitzer .
Several Wall Street firms are due to explain themselves on Capitol Hill today .
The NASD is able to bar peo ple from working on Wall Street and levy huge fines .
The NASD is reportedly looking at positive recommendations made by Mr Grubman on Winstar last year at a time when other analysts were alerting investors that the company was facing financial stress .
In one of his research notes , in March 2001 , the Wall Street Journal said he described the "" noise "" surrounding the company 's ability to make interest payments on its debt "" as just that "" and maintained his price target of $ 50 .
A month later , the shares closed at 14 cents after it failed to make payments on its debt .
Salomon said yesterday : "" As always , we cooperate fully with any inquiry .
Mr. Grubman 's calls on Winstar were part of a consistent and reasonable investment thesis developed and held in good faith for many years .
There was certainly no intent to mislead investors .
Mr Grubman continues to be an active member of the firm 's research team . ""
In a public disclosure , the NASD revealed that Mr Grubman had been told he was the subject of an investigation relating to Winstar and that the preliminary finding was that "" violations have occurred "" .
In the disclosure , Mr Grubman is said to deny any violation ."
2002-07-23,"If you were interested in finding a culprit for the deluge of bad news that has engulfed American business and brought the stock market crashing down , the name of Lee Iacocca would probably not be high on your list of suspects .
But if it were n't for Iacocca , it is unlikely that we would be talking about Enron and WorldCom today .
In the early 1980s , as chief executive officer ( CEO ) of Chrysler , Iacocca helped rescue that company from bankruptcy .
He starred in a series of legendary ( as these things go ) television ads , each of which ended with him gazing earnestly into the camera and saying : "" If you can find a better car , buy it . ""
His marketing pizzazz , coupled with a not - so - subtle appeal to nationalist sentiment ( who wanted to let the Japanese kill off one of the Big Three ? ) revitalised Chrysler 's image and got the company off its deathbed .
The resurrection of Chrysler turned Iacocca into the symbol of a resurgent US capitalism .
This was rather ironic - Chrysler only survived , after all , because of a government bail - out and some well - timed intervention against Japanese imports , and was hardly evidence of the virtues of the free market .
But Iacocca 's combination of tough - guy individualism and earnest Americanism fit the country 's mood in the heyday of the Reagan years .
He appeared on the cover of Time magazine , above the tagline "" America loves listening to Lee "" , he bandied about the idea of running for president , and his autobiography - the cleverly titled Iacocca - became one of the best - selling books of the decade .
Iacocca 's ascent signaled a dramatic change in American culture .
Prior to him , the popular image of the American CEO had been of a buttoned - down organisation man , pampered and well paid , but essentially bland and characterless .
The idea of the businessman as an outsized , even heroic , figure seemed like the legacy of a long - forgotten past when men like JP Morgan and William Randolph Hearst were still around .
In fact , in 1982 , Forbes magazine wrote , "" Tycoons are fairly rare birds in today 's business world .
We seldom hear of moguls . ""
Within just a few years , that had all changed , with business journalists turning every clever executive with a good idea into the next Henry Ford , and with the Rupert Murdochs , Sumner Redstones , and Donald Trumps of the world actively cultivating the "" mogul "" label .
By the time the boom of the 1990s rolled around , CEOs had become America 's superheroes , accorded celebrity treatment and followed with a kind of slavish scrutiny that Alfred P Sloan could never have imagined .
Dennis Kozlowski and Bernie Ebbers reaped what Iacocca had sown .
"" In the 1980s , there was a sea change in the way the media and the culture at large responded to CEOs , "" says Jim Collins , author of the seminal studies of business history Built to Last and Good to Great .
"" And you can pinpoint that change to one single event : the publication of the Iacocca book .
That was the moment when it became clear that everything was different . ""
The shift in Main Street 's perception of CEOs would not have mattered so much had the people in the boardrooms not also bought into the myth of the CEO as superhero .
But they did .
Companies everywhere wanted their own Iacocca .
They did n't just want someone who knew his industry and was good at nuts - and - bolts execution .
They wanted someone who was good on television , who had a touch of glamour , who could sell the company 's story on Wall Street , who had a handle on the vision thing ( and who was good at nuts - and - bolts execution , too ) .
As Harvard Business School Rakesh Khurana , author of a forthcoming book on the CEO job market , puts it : "" Companies were looking for a corporate saviour . ""
Now , as it happens , this was a futile quest .
Although it may be hard to believe after a decade and a half of CEO worship , all the available evidence suggests that most chief executives have only a negligible impact on the performance of the companies they run .
There are , of course , exceptions .
But corporate performance depends far more on what industry a company is in , what proprietary advantages it has , and the general quality of its workforce , than it does on who 's at the very top .
And in those cases where leadership does make a difference , the successful leaders do n't fit the corporate - saviour model .
In Collins ' book Good to Great , for instance , all the "" great "" companies he studied were led by CEOs whose attitude toward fame and attention was more like that of Thomas Pynchon than Tom Cruise .
"" They were , by design , not celebrities , "" Collins said .
"" They did not attribute the company 's success to their own genius .
And they shunned the spotlight .
"" By contrast , the executives who were constantly making star turns - who included men such as "" Chainsaw "" Al Dunlap and , yes , Iacocca - did a bad job of making their companies stronger .
No matter , though .
Boards of directors were convinced that the CEO was the key to greatness ( perhaps in part because so many directors were themselves CEOs ) , and they were willing to pay accordingly - after all , you do n't treat a new messiah the way you would an ordinary mortal .
So CEO pay packages skyrocketed , rising from 42 times the average worker 's salary in 1980 to 531 times the average worker 's salary in 2000 .
And it was n't just the very best CEOs who were rolling in filthy lucre , either .
Since what one executive makes tends to depend on what other executives make - a typical corporate proxy statement will include a line such as "" we want our compensation package to be competitive with the industry as a whole "" - there was an irresistible ratcheting - upward effect .
Then , too , in the 1980s and early 1990s , compensation committees were often made up of other CEOs .
Who , really , was going to vote for what would have been an indirect pay cut for himself ?
Executive pay was , on its own terms , scandalous .
But what made it the engine of the kind of shenanigans we 've seen at Enron and WorldCom was , of course , the fact that most CEO pay packages relied heavily on stock options .
Options were not new - read any business history dating back to the 1950s , and it is clear that option packages were an important part of any CEO 's compensation .
But the nature of the options grants in the 1990s was qualitatively different .
In 1995 , Congress passed a law limiting the tax - deductibility of corporate salaries of more than $ 1 m .
But it allowed an exemption for any pay that was incentive - related .
So options were a way of paying executives without forgoing tax benefits .
The bull market made options seem relatively costless ( If everyone was winning , did we really need to worry if the CEO was clearing an extra $ 30-$40 m a year ? ) .
And there was the one intellectually sound argument for options - they aligned the interests of the CEO with the people he was supposedly representing , the shareholders .
Put all these things together , and you had stock - option grants on an unprecedented - and indeed practically unimaginable - scale .
In 2000 , Steve Jobs of Apple was given a package that would be worth $ 550 m if Apple 's stock rose just 5 % a year over the next decade .
In the same year , Larry Ellison of Oracle was given 20 m options worth around $ 400 m , even though he already owned 700 m shares in the company .
( Were the extra 20 m options really going to make him work harder ? )
The idea of the CEO as superhero was radically misconceived , and the idea that stock options were free money was senseless .
Together , they created an environment in which one of corporate capitalism 's perennial problems - self - dealing - could flourish .
Self - dealing , essentially , occurs when managers run companies to line their own pockets instead of those of the companies ' owners .
Most of the great scandals of the gilded age in America during the 19th century involved American managers who set up corporations ( generally railroads ) and then siphoned off the money of outside investors - who more often than not were British .
When a British emissary was sent to America in the 1890s to find out what had happened to the money his bosses had put into an American firm , he wrote to them that he had asked one of the company 's directors where all the invested capital was , and had received this less - than - reassuring reply : "" Well , really , sir , that is what I am always asking , but which I can never get to know . ""
As American capitalism moved toward a model in which corporations would be run by professional managers who had only small ownership stakes , the threat of self - dealing increased .
In their seminal book The Modern Corporation and Private Property in 1932 , Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means identified the separation of ownership from control - the people running the company are not the people who own it - as the system 's central dilemma .
One of the answers to that dilemma , ironically , was stock options .
But in practice , option packages actually turned out to facilitate - rather than curb - self - dealing .
As economist David Yermack of New York University has shown , stock option grants tended to be issued just before good news was released ( thereby locking in a lower price for the option ) .
Issuing more options did n't increase executives ' stake in companies .
They just cashed in existing options .
And the way options were awarded encouraged executives to adopt risky strategies .
If stock prices skyrocketed , they got massive options grants as a reward ; if stock prices plummeted , they got massive options grants as an incentive , or they had their options repriced .
Either way , executives could n't really lose .
Finally , the sheer size of the grants exacerbated the problem .
In the past , one check on managers ' greed was that they stood to gain more from staying with a company for a long time than they did by playing fast and loose and cashing out early .
But when you give CEOs the chance to make $ 300 m in a year by stretching the rules a little bit , it 's not too surprising that some of them will take you up on it .
So if in the old days investors worried about executives paying themselves high salaries , lavishing perks on themselves , and spending money to redecorate the executive dining room , now they have to worry about executives using deceptive numbers to jack up the stock price in order to dump their stakes and put hundreds of millions in the bank before anyone can figure out what 's wrong .
( It is true , of course , that if you 're a visionary investor , you could dump your stock too , and piggyback on the executives ' malfeasance .
But that 's not exactly easy to do . )
In the past couple of months , it has become fashionable to say that what led to the scandals was that favourite mantra of every 1990s CEO : "" shareholder value "" .
But this is a red herring .
Of course , investors brought much of this on themselves by blissfully ignoring the real cost of options and buying wholeheartedly into the myth that superhuman CEOs deserved superhuman pay packages ( One stunning Burson Marsteller survey from the late 1990s said that 95 % of investors would buy a stock based on what they thought of the company 's CEO ) .
And there were few investor complaints when the Nasdaq rose 273 % in three years .
Only after the crash did everyone get religion .
But it 's none the less true that shareholders paid the price , rather than reaped the benefits , of corporate corruption .
And although CEOs were obsessively concerned with their companies ' stock price , at companies such as Enron and Tyco , top executives were less concerned with the performance of the company 's stock over time than they were in getting out of the stock as quickly as possible .
That 's not exactly what the emphasis on shareholder value was supposed to mean .
In fact , if you look at the hundreds of billions of debt that corporations took on in the 1990s in order to pay for the cost of issuing options , and you look at how little stock prices ended up rising over that same period , it now appears as if the past decade wit nessed the greatest transfer of wealth from shareholders to workers in the history of the US economy .
Unfortunately , the workers were almost all ensconced in the executive suite .
The systemic questions raised by the bursting of the stock - market bubble and the revelations of corporate corruption do n't , in the end , have much to do with the virtues or vices of markets per se , so much as they have to do with the vigilance and regulation that markets need in order to work .
The delusion that everyone abided by in the 90s was that self - interest alone would point everyone in the same direction .
What 's only now becoming clear is that without the right kind of harnesses for self - interest , the system is given to fragmentation .
The independent arbiters - accountants and Wall Street firms - whose businesses supposedly depended on the quality of the advice they gave sacrificed those reputations for higher fees , and were given a free pass .
And shareholders who were supposed to aggressively monitor the companies they owned and toss out executives at the first sign that something was wrong succumbed instead to greed and inertia .
Obviously , much of this is already changing .
The market is taking to the woodshed any company with even a hint of scandal about it .
The New York stock exchange will now require its companies to follow a set of substantive , rather than cosmetic , rules about the independence of boards and the strengthening of shareholder rights .
Congress looks set to make meaningful changes in the way corporate accounting works .
And some of the country 's most prominent mutual - fund managers , including John Bogle , the guru of indexing , and Bill Miller , the only fund manager to outperform the S&amp;P index 11 years in a row , are adopting a far more aggressive and activist stance on the need for greater transparency and for limits on the use of options .
But the stock market will be suffering the consequences of these scandals - in the form of lower stock prices and lowered expectations - for years to come .
The US , on the other hand , may escape from all this without any sustained damage to its real economy .
Even as the stock market has continued to plummet , the economy has continued to recover from last year 's recession .
In June , consumer spending was up a remarkable 1.1 % , and industrial production rose 0.8 % , its sixth straight gain .
And although consumer - confidence surveys show that all the bad news on Wall Street is affecting the way people feel , it 's not having much impact on the way they 're acting .
This may seem surprising , but it fits well with economic reality .
Although we heard much during the 1990s about America as a shareholder nation and the advent of "" people 's capitalism "" , no more than 50 % of Americans own any stock and , as of 1998 , the median stockholder 's portfolio was worth just $ 25,000 .
What happens on Wall Street , then , has only an indirect effect on the day - to - day lives of most Americans , for whom jobs and prices remain the key determinants of how much they feel like spending .
The amount of wealth wiped out in the stock market in just the past six months has been , of course , remarkable .
But the "" victims "" of that decline are disproportionately the wealthy .
In the long run , of course , a bear market is not good for anyone 's mood .
But in concrete terms , the most important things about the US economy right now are the unemployment rate - which , at 5.9 % , is still low by the standards of the past two decades - and inflation , which is nonexistent .
That helps explain the most curious thing about what 's happening on Wall Street , which is that it feels simultaneously like a huge story - front - page news every day - and yet a contained one .
Of course , consumers are not the only players in the economy , and there 's no doubt that the stock market 's decline , the rise in investor distrust , and the skittishness of corporate executives has slowed the recovery substantially .
Here too , though , the major impact is psychological .
The stock market is not the chief way that companies raise money for future investment , and in any case it 's not exactly clear how cutting back on spending - which is what businesses are doing - is a rational response to fears about corporate corruption .
It 's more likely that what we 're seeing are executives who have been so burned , personally , by the steep drop in stock prices that they feel the need to hunker down until the storm has passed .
The biggest question , of course , is whether the genuine anger and revulsion that many Americans feel toward people such as Jeff Skilling and Bernie Ebbers will translate into anything bigger than accounting reform and a new attitude toward stock options .
In other words , will connections between corruption in the executive suite and corruption in the executive branch be made , and the place of corporations in the polity as a whole be rethought ?
That , after all , is very much what happened in the wake of the scandals of the gilded age , which prompted an era of reform that transformed the role of the American state , leading to everything from the Sherman Antitrust Act to the Pure Food Act to the first serious regulation of Wall Street .
It may be too early to answer that question , but at the moment the rebirth of Progressivism does not appear to be upon us .
In part , that may be because most Americans have yet to feel too much pain as a result of the scandals , while the legacy of the boom years in the form of higher wages and low prices is still with us .
But in part it 's also because these scandals ultimately seem to have more to do with the internal workings of corporations - that is , the division of power between shareholders and managers - than with the effect of corporations on the outside world .
The historian Richard McCormick famously argued that Progressivism was the product of "" the discovery that business corrupts politics "" .
But what we seem to have discovered in the past year is simply that business corrupts business .
It may be an obvious lesson , but apparently it has to be learned over and over again . ·

2002-07-24,"Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase constructed $ 8bn ( £ 5bn ) of "" complex , phoney "" transactions for Enron which helped hide the debt that led to the energy firm 's collapse , a senate committee said yesterday .
The accusations knocked more than 10 % off the stock market value of the two financial firms .
The committee added that Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase - which are expected to tell investigators they did nothing wrong - had pitched the financing method to other companies under the marketing names of Yosemite and Mohania respectively .
After a seven - month investigation and more than 1 m pages of documents , Robert Roach , chief investigator for the committee on investigations , said : "" The evidence we reviewed showed that , in some cases , the financial institutions were aware that Enron was using questionable accounting . ""
Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland were among five other banks to participate in more than $ 1bn of trades that the committee described as questionable .
Senators learned that internal emails appeared to prove that Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase knew the transactions - known as pre - pays - were used by Enron to manipulate its financial statements rather than meet business objectives .
Pre - pays are arrangements in which one party pays in advance for a service or product .
Carl Levin , who chairs the committee , said : "" I think most will conclude that Enron 's use of these pre - pays to disguise debt was an accounting sham , and to carry out the deceptions Enron had the help and knowing assistance of some of the biggest financial institutions in our country - including JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup .

Had the transactions been accounted for properly , the committee said , Enron 's debt would have increased by a "" dramatic "" 40 % to $ 14bn in 2000 ."

2002-07-25,"Trade secretary Patricia Hewitt yesterday outlined plans to toughen up audit procedures and ensure that there will never be an Enron - style accounting fraud in the UK .
She spelled out plans to make audit committees more independent and to give them a bigger role in policing companies ' financial dealings .
And she backed proposals to force accountants to publish their own financial accounts .
The government is also considering whether there should be a competition enquiry into the "" Big Four "" accountancy firms .
Ms Hewitt was launching the review of audit and accounting procedures ordered jointly by the department of trade and industry and the Treasury in the wake of the collapse of Enron last year .
She said the world had been "" shocked "" by the corporate failures of Worldcom and Enron and that it was "" incumbent on government to be vigilant and take the necessary action where required "" .
The trade secretary said it was widely acknowledged that accounting standards in the UK were "" in some respects better "" than those in the US , but said there was no room for complacency .
She said she did not want to pile unnecessary regulation on the vast majority of companies which were honestly run , but added : "" the actions of a few are damaging the reputation of all "" and that the regulations and procedures needed strengthening to restore investors ' confidence .
The review 's main points are : · To strengthen audit committees , making it clear they work for shareholders , particularly in relation to the payment of auditors , their appointment , independence and the quality of their work · To give audit committees the power to ban the purchase of non - audit service from the auditor · To work on a list of non - audit services which auditors should be banned from providing · To examine the case for mandatory rotation of auditors · To force rotation of all senior staff who work on an audit , not just the lead partner , every five rather than seven years . ·
To beef up the regulation of accountants · To force accountants to provide better information of their procedures and publish their own accounts and to ban those that wo n't from auditing public interest companies · To consider the competition implications of the "" Big Four "" accountants which dominate audit work .
The review was largely welcomed by all side of business and industry .
John Monks , general secretary of the TUC , praised the report and said "" it is essential that the government acts on these recommendations to restore both public and investor confidence . ""
The CBI 's director general Digby Jones praised the government for not overreacting and welcomed the moves to strengthen audit committees .
However , he also warned that the CBI would oppose plans to force mandatory rotation of auditors and the proposed clampdown on non - audit services ."

Republican or Democrat , New Labour or Conservative , if a party supported the deregulation of the energy and financial markets , Enron filled its pockets .
The corporation 's name is now shorthand for the collapse in faith in Anglo - Saxon capitalism - a collapse which is shrinking pensions and wiping out private share portfolios .
In Banking on Death or Investing in Life ( Verso , £ 20 ) , a new account of how the blessing of longer life expectancy has been poisoned by governments ' willingness to allow employees ' savings to be sequestered and gambled , Robin Blackburn says that a hard question has not received the attention it deserves .
Why , he asks , was Enron allowed to collapse ?
It appeared to be better protected than a Mafia don .
Bill Clinton begged Ken Lay , Enron 's chairman , for cash - then ordered the American state to act as Enron 's agent and harry governments in Britain , India and Africa .
George W. Bush was elected President in 2000 with the help of $ 500,000 from Enron .
If a politician legislated for privatisation , there was a fair chance that he would receive an Enron retainer on retirement .
Lord Wakeham - who went from Conservative Energy Secretary to Enron board member , while still finding the time to uphold the high standards of the press and rule that the British did n't deserve an elected second chamber - was one among many who twirled through the revolving door .
After the company fell apart , Americans discovered that 212 of the 248 members of the US Congress investigating Enron had taken the corporation 's shilling .
Arthur Andersen , Enron 's crooked auditors , supplied a further protective layer .
Andersen , and the remaining members of the ' Big Five ' accountancy cartel , became players in Washington 's campaign contributions market of the 1990s .
They used their hired political muscle to slap down proposals to ban auditors from selling financial services to clients .
Andersen also became New Labour 's favourite accountant and provided justifications for the privatisation of public services - privatisations from which its clients could expect to benefit .
Many parts of the supposedly free market with far less clout than Enron can count on official protection .
No government can allow a major bank to go bust if it threatens to take other parts of the financial system with it .
Thus in 1998 Long Term Capital Management - a remarkably short - term , not to say useless , American finance house - was bailed out in a rescue organised by the US Federal Reserve .
Yet Enron was allowed to die .
Part of the explanation for the betrayal by all the political escort girls Enron picked up lies in the scale of its $ 60 billion losses .
As important was the realisation that Enron would n't destroy banks when it fell .
J.P. Morgan and Citibank had organised deals worth billions of dollars .
In the past , they would n't have relied on the likes of Arthur Andersen to blow the whistle .
They would have had their own investigators checking that the loans were secure .
Morgan and Citibank did n't need to worry , however , because they had laid off the risk by passing Enron 's debt to pension funds as asset - backed securities .
The securities promised a fair rate of return , but left employees ' savings dangerously exposed .
At Congressional hearings in Washington last week , Senators heard that far from being a stern bank manager , Citibank had collaborated with Enron 's dodging of accounting regulations .
James F. Reilly , a senior Citigroup loan executive , warned his colleagues in a 1999 email that the paperwork could not reflect the bank 's true dealings with Enron as honesty would ' unfavourably alter the accounting ' .
If you are concerned about your pension - and you 're either lucky or foolish if you 're not - what the financial crisis should have taught you is that all the market safeguards have failed .
The share options , which directors have used to take fortunes from their stakeholders , were an incentive to fraudulently ramp up share prices .
( Lay grabbed $ 67 million from Enron in its last 12 months . )
Auditors were n't to be trusted because they had an interest in keeping clients sweet .
Bankers did n't need to fret about their loans if they had passed the risk to pension fund managers .
Enron was n't saved because only employees in pension funds were hit .
Contrary to received opinion , their only possible protector is the state .
At least the corrupted US state is trying .
Last week gave us the gorgeous spectacle of a Presidency and a Congress which appeared to have been been bought and sold with Enron gold turning on its paymasters .
( As the Italians say , you ca n't buy politicians , only rent them . )
Statutory regulation of the accounting industry was strengthened .
Auditors were banned from compromising their independence by selling extras to the clients .
Researchers for Wall Street firms were offered protection from dismissal if they told the truth about shares their employers were hyping .
Senator Phil Gramm , whose wife Wendy went Wakeham - style from deregulating the energy industry in government to a well - padded seat on the Enron board , tried to fight , but there was nothing he could do .
I do n't want to over - emphasise the bravery of the American political class .
Every public statement from the Bush administration betrays a yearning to return to the gilded age before the bubble inflated - the status quo ante bubblum , perhaps .
Nevertheless , the Americans have been forced to learn from , and react to , chastening experience .
And back in dear , old incorruptible Blighty ?
Nothing apart from self - serving cries from the accounting industry that Enron could n't happen here .
These would carry more force if Enron Europe 's headquarters had n't been in London .
The donations to New Labour and the Tories came from Enron Europe , not the head office in Texas .
When Blair thanked Enron , he turned to Enron Europe and gave its chairman , Ralph Hodge , a CBE .
Enron Europe certainly looks like a fitting object for investigation by suspicious eyes .
It obeyed the orders from Houston and , like its parent , its finances were hidden in a bewildering web of subsidiaries - 179 of them , to be precise .
But when I asked the Serious Fraud Office if its officers were on the case , it said they were n't interested .
The Department of Trade and Industry refused to say if it was conducting an inquiry .
It would be a minor miracle if it were .
What Private Eye calls the Department of Timidity and Inaction , did n't order independent inquiries into the collapse of Polly Peck and the global criminal conspiracy at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International .
Corruption does n't exist in Britain because the authorities do n't look for it .
To date the British response consists of a statement to the Commons last week by the bovine Patricia Hewitt , a former Andersen employee , no less .
There would be no immediate action , she said . '
Unnecessary regulation ' must be avoided .
Auditors may be forced to stop selling consultancy services to clients , but maybe not .
Independent regulation of accountancy did n't get a mention .
How happy potential criminals must be to have her as Trade and Industry Secretary in a Labour government which is way to the Right of the Bush administration .

2002-07-28,"Open warfare has broken out between the White House and Capitol Hill over President George Bush 's most controversial nomination to date to the bench of American high courts .
The nomination of a politically loyal judiciary is the singular way in which US Presidents outlive their terms , leaving an imprint on the nation in the form of judges who can sit on the bench making law for life - and the Bush White House intends Judge Priscilla Owen from Texas to be one such judge .
Bush has intervened to back Owen , and her campaign is being managed - as they all have since her Texas days - by Karl Rove , long - time political organiser for the Bush family and now White House chief adviser .
The Democrat - controlled Senate , however , is fighting her nomination to the powerful fifth circuit Appeals Court , the tier beneath the US Supreme Court .
Senators and a host of organisations petitioning their judiciary committee say Owen has used the bench to advance a a zealous right - wing ideology , contesting the right to abortion and favouring big oil and energy companies , including the disgraced Enron , which has been one of her - and the President 's - biggest financial backers .
They are in turn accused by the White House of detonating a ' judicial crisis ' .
The committee 's chairman , Senator Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont , particularly demanded that the White House ' look into ' Owen 's Enron connection , after being passed a report by a research group , Texans for Public Justice , detailing the firm 's contributions , after which she ruled in their and other donors ' interests many times .
In one instance she wrote an opinion overturning another court , exempting Enron from paying school taxes .
The director of another group , Nan Aron of the Alliance for Justice , said : ' Mention her name and people say "" Oh , Judge Enron "" . ' '
I would just say , ' said Texans for Public Justice 's Craig McDonald , ' that as far as those of us who have watched Priscilla Owen , Karl Rove and George W. Bush for a lot of years are concerned , this is the one that deserves to be controversial .
This is not a Texas fight or a fifth circuit fight ; this is a struggle to determine whether a political operative , Karl Rove , and his crew are going to determine the make - up of the federal courts ' .
So far as some senators are concerned , the most controversial rulings Owen made in Texas were in about a dozen cases concerning abortion , and a legal obligation that minors receive parental consent before terminating a pregnancy .
Those rulings have made abortion an issue for the first time in the selection of a high court judge .
Although the right to abortion is enshrined in US law , its eventual abolition is one of Rove 's dearest causes .
He recently addressed the Christian Conservative Family Research Council , saying : ' We need to find ways to win this war . '
In the Texas courts , a girl can appeal against the obligation if she can show that telling her parents might harm her , as happened in most Texas cases .
But Owen , dissenting , ruled throughout that the question was not whether telling parents would harm the child , but having the abortion at all .
Minors , she said , should have to demonstrate to the court ' that philosophic , social , moral and religious arguments can be brought to bear ' on abortions , in addition to those enshrined into law , which concern mainly health risks . '
It was nothing to do with telling parents , ' said McDonald , ' she was trying to stop these minors from having an abortion , which is something very different . '
Herein lies a twist to Owen 's nomination .
One of her cheerleaders on Capitol Hill last week was White House counsel Alberto Gonzales .
He joined the Texas Supreme Court when Bush was state Governor , then was elevated to Washington and tipped to be the next judge to take a seat on the bench of the highest court in the land , the Supreme Court .
And yet , when Owen was overruled in trying to stop an abortion in 2000 , even her colleague on the bench , Gonzales , protested that to follow her lead ' would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism ' .
A legal watchdog , People for the American Way , argues that Owen indulges in ' activist ' lawmaking which establishes law rather than interpret it . '
President Bush has said he wants judges who will interpret the law , not make it , ' said the group 's director , Ralph Neas . '
In Priscilla Owen , he has found the exact opposite . '"
2002-07-28,"The Office for National Statistics could yet face censure over its decision to classify Network Rail as a private enterprise and thereby remove £ 9 billion of debt guarantees from the Government 's balance sheet .
Members of the Statistics Commission are seeking urgent clarification over whether the ONS or the Department for Transport ( DfT ) made a crucial decision over the classification of loan guarantees .
The controversial choice , made last month against the National Audit Office 's views , has been condemned by politicians and private - sector accountants as ' Enron - style ' accounting by the Government . '
We need to be satisfied that it was an objective decision , ' said Gill Eastabrook , chief executive of the Statistics Commission .
Although the commission accepted the transparent process that led to the ONS decision , Easta brook said the classification was conditional on assumptions that are not final .
One commission insider pointed out that the DfT would have known that under current arrangements it would always have the last word on Network Rail 's independence . '
I imagine they were aware of this from the start , ' said the insider .
It is ' custom and practice ' that the ONS defer to the accounting professionals of the relevant government department .
Classification depended on the likelihood of the loan guarantees being exercised .
If this is ' not likely ' , the guarantees are classified as ' contingent liabilities ' under European accounting rules and do not score on the public - sector balance sheet .
On the ' likelihood ' issue , the ONS would allow the DfT to make a decision .
The commissioners are looking for formal definitions of ' not likely ' , particularly in light of the huge taxpayer bailouts of its predecessor , Railtrack .
This month ONS chief statistician Len Cook said the commission ' was not competent ' to make a decision on Network Rail .
The commission , chaired by Sir John Kingman , Britain 's leading statistician , includes top economist Martin Weale and banker Derek Wanless .
Parliament 's Treasury Select Committee is also set to investigate this and other off - balance - sheet accounting treatments ."
2002-07-29,"A set of overstated accounts has joined a peptic ulcer and bag of Titleist golf clubs as a "" must - have "" accessory for US executives .
Last week , the world 's largest media company , AOL Time Warner , joined Enron and Worldcom in apparently slipping up in its accounting practices .
The SEC is poking around in AOL Time Warner 's back office on the suspicion that it has shuffled money around the business and attributed revenues to divisions - largely online - that were not quite so prosperous .
For AOL Time Warner , this bad news comes only a couple of weeks after the departure of key executive Bob Pittman .
In terms of cyclical fortunes , AOL Time Warner is very much on the downward sweep of the arc .
It has been a Frankenstein business since the film , music and entertainment portfolio of Warner Brothers made a strange marriage with Time Inc magazines in 1989 .
The ensuing decade saw the conglomerate grow , as all advertising - based business did , beyond expectations , though the constant lament was that the company struggled to create any synergy between its ragbag of media assets .
When it then merged with the ludicrously overvalued AOL in January 2000 in what at the time was the biggest corporate deal in history , more nonsense was spouted about how the dubious commercial framework of the internet would unite all these disparate assets .
As media writer Douglas Rushkoff noted in the Guardian last week , this was a blindingly good piece of business for AOL executives who were about to be the biggest bang in the dotcom bubble - bursting contest , but a groundless piece of strategy on which to base future business .
Now two of the three architects of the deal , Pittman and Time Warner chief Jerry Levin , have left the company , it is in trouble with the authorities , and the question that follows the company around is : how long before it is broken up ?
In an ironic subnote , AOL Time Warner 's official website had plenty of "" recent news "" concerning the company , but much of it involved Austin Powers memorabilia being sold in an online auction ( a too - little - too - late piece of synergy ) ; there was nothing at all about Plod opening the books .
It is the law of the financial jungle that a company 's life cycle is like that of an ugly insect : it starts as an entrepreneurial pupa , becomes vast in a short space of time , and then either turns into a beautiful butterfly or disintegrates into earthy sludge where it is devoured by smaller parasites .
There are not many butterflies left in the media sector .
AOL Time Warner is following this trend in media disintegration .
Likewise , the mess at Vivendi Universal looks like being resolved through disintegration .
New chief executive Jean - René Fourtou last week announced plans to break up its pay - TV business Canal Plus by putting part of it into a public company and selling the leftovers .
To survive with your company intact in the media , it seems you either have to have a substantial private holding in the firm - such as Rupert Murdoch 's family trust has in News Corp , and Bill Gates maintains in Microsoft - or you have to progress in a cautious way which attracts as little attention as possible to your shortcomings .
A combination of the two has kept Bertelsmann spreading like a Russian vine across Europe .
It was the necessity of feeding the maw of "" shareholder value "" that dictated the deals that undid these companies .
Again , the financial pages are full of damning indictments of greedy executives and corrupt accountants bankrupting pensioners .
But gormless directors and crafty accountants are n't the only villains operating this ride .
The investment banks spotted the opportunity for M&amp;A activity in the media at the beginning of the 90s and rapidly threw up divisions dedicated to media , populated largely , with one or two exceptions , by MBAs who had wandered in off the streets .
Fees were made by thrusting together any old crap on a rising market and dressing it up with such post - hoc rationalisations as "" great synergy "" .
The web and pay TV were perfect for this because they were businesses about which you could make any claim , safe in the knowledge that you were unlikely to be called on it before your Christmas bonus arrived .
It must be a source of eternal regret that exactly the same people will be benefiting from the break - ups of these poorly conceived pipe dreams .
Because bankers and analysts earn so much , there is a tendency , as prevalent in the press as anywhere , to think that they have some form of higher knowledge .
At least this is one fiction that should finally be laid to rest along with the notion of the synergistic media conglomerate .

2002-07-31,"Merrill Lynch yesterday defended its dealings with Enron , the energy firm that fell into bankruptcy amid scandal at the end of last year .
The investment bank faced questions in a Congress hearing as , elsewhere in Washington , President Bush signed the corporate reform bill aimed at stamping out the glut of financial scandals that have shaken Wall Street .
In a pre - hearing statement , Merrill Lynch maintained it had only "" limited dealings "" with Enron .
"" Our firm dealt with Enron at arm 's length , and made business decisions based on the information that was then available , "" it said .
Congress members focused on a deal for the sale of three barges in Nigeria used to generate electricity .
Enron allegedly asked Merrill Lynch in December 1999 to invest $ 7 m in the barges giving the company 's African division a gain on the transaction and allowing it to meet financial targets .
Investigators claim that Enron gave Merrill Lynch the guarantee that it would arrange the resale of the barges within six months .
"" It appears that Merrill Lynch , like other financial institutions , knowingly participated in deals that were used to make Enron 's financial position appear more robust than it actually was , "" said senator Carl Levin .
Congressional investigators also presented evidence that Merrill Lynch replaced a research analyst in 1998 , John Olson , who had angered Enron by placing its shares on a "" neutral "" rating .
JP Morgan Chase and Citi group were grilled by Congress last week .
With mid - term elections approaching in November , President Bush 's language has become increasingly hard - bitten .
He yesterday promised "" no more easy money for corporate criminals .
Just hard time "" .
He added : "" Free markets are not a jungle in which only the unscrupulous survive , or a financial free - for - all guided only by greed .
The law says to every dishonest corporate leader , you 'll be exposed and punished .
The era of low standards and false profits are over . ""
The reform bill , which had originally been largely opposed by Republicans , increases the maximum prison term for executives who commit mail or wire fraud from five to 20 years .
The bill establishes a new crime of securities fraud with a maximum sentence of 25 years .
It also restricts the consulting work that accounting firms can do , requires top executives to take personal responsibility for the accuracy of the balance sheet and creates new rules to restrict conflicts of interest in banks ."
2002-07-31,"The UK 's top financial watchdog , the financial services authority , yesterday launched a wide - ranging review of Britain 's corporate governance as financial markets across the globe seek to rebuild investor confidence in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals in the US .
The FSA is concerned that new European rules could undermine the UK regime and the debate may also focus on whether Britain 's accountancy profession might be brought within the FSA 's remit .
"" There are 23 bodies involved in [ overseeing ] the accountancy and auditing profession in the UK .
It is very important to UK Inc that its accounting standards are internationally acceptable .
Obviously this is a matter for government , but the FSA would be prepared to take it on if that is what the government wanted , "" said one source close to the City watchdog .
The FSA review is expected to focus on issues affecting stock market - quoted companies , ranging from the disclo sure of directors ' share deals to shareholder rights and non - executive directors ' roles .
"" In a regulatory environment where the standards of corporate governance of certain entities are having a damaging effect on market confidence , it is appropriate for the [ FSA ] to review the ability of the listing rules to continue to provide sufficient protection to investors , "" it said .
One area of concern is the EU 's planned prospectus directive , which UK critics believe may weaken corporate governance standards .
The key concern is that the directive will not focus on minimum standards - allowing different authorities to add their own measures - but would be a maximum harmonisation directive which would allow individual countries no room for manoeuvre .
The FSA is suggesting that it or another body , such as the stock exchange , might be empowered to set the rules governing listed companies , or these might be woven into company law in order to prevent them being ditched under EU proposals ."
2002-08-02,"The European commission was embroiled in a furious row yesterday with its suspended chief accountant , Marta Andreasen , who claimed that its £ 63bn budget was "" massively open to fraud "" because it lacked even Enron 's accountancy safeguards .
Ms Andreasen , who accused the commission of a cover - up , said in London : "" Unlike the issues surrounding Enron and WorldCom , where you can at least trace transactions and accounts , you can not do so within the EU accounts as there is no system in place for tracing adjustments and changes to figures presented . ""
She added : "" Fraud can therefore lie hidden within the system , undetected and untraced . ""
The commission , which suspended her in May , launched a ferocious counter - attack , saying it had been mistaken to employ her in the first place .
Ms Andreasen was speaking at a Westminster press conference organised by Conservative MEPs eager to condemn the commission in general and the commissioner in charge of reform , Neil Kinnock , in particular .
The Tories want the former Labour leader 's scalp .
Despite the persistent invitations of the London tabloids , she refused to blame Mr Kinnock personally .
"" I believe Neil Kinnock is playing an important role in reform , but I believe reform should have started by implementing a computer system , processing transactions , which is reliable , "" she said .
But her main thrust was withering .
After ignoring the complaints of the EU 's court of auditors for years , up to and since the sacking of the Santer commission in 1999 , the EU still did not have a global - standard double - entry book - keeping system , its computers were inadequate and lacked proper security , and there were no qualified accountants supervising it , she claimed .
Mr Kinnock was unavailable for comment , but Michaele Schreyer , the German budget commissioner , whom Ms Andreasen accuses of "" discouraging me from alerting others "" , said it had been "" a mistake "" to employ an accountant whose "" unsubstantiated "" allegations had generated "" extreme ill - feeling "" in the staff .
Ms Andreasen , 48 , was suspended four months after starting work , and faces disciplinary proceedings liable to result in her dismissal , after complaining about commission working methods , first to her superiors , including the commission president , Romano Prodi , and later in public .
She says the EU knew that she had been involved in similar controversy in her previous job as chief accountant of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris , and was suspended pending a review of her complaints by the accountants Arthur Andersen .
Andersen initially backed her but its report was subsequently "" watered down , "" she said yesterday .
Commission officials said they did not know her record .
In London the new Tory chairwoman , Theresa May , praised Ms Andreasen for speaking out .
Ms May 's predecessor , David Davis , urged Tony Blair to recall Mr Kinnock for urgent consultations on the scale of the crisis .
Ms May said : "" The government needs to insist on an urgent review of EU accounting systems .
The British people deserve better than to see their money disappear into a black hole . ""
Mr Davis said that if it was proved that Mr Kinnock failed to put the commission 's financial house in order , "" he should go "" .
Brussels said the claim of a cover - up "" can only be intended to mislead the public "" .
Weaknesses in accounting systems had been reported since 1999 and examined by the court of auditors , governments and the European parliament .
Ms Andreasen agrees , but says the auditors ' complaints have been ignored ."
2002-08-03,"The sight of WorldCom executives led away in handcuffs by the Feds must have sent a shiver up the spine of corporate America .
It was a clever PR manoeuvre by the administration , designed to show that George W Bush was on the case and ready to take serious action against the perpetrators .
But America and the world are still waiting for similar punitive action against Enron , the energy trader that set the whole thing off .
This is puzzling .
On the face of it , Enron , with its intricate structure of off - shore partnerships deliberately designed to get liabilities off the books , is a far more obvious case of fraud ; if you were being very charitable , you could just argue that WorldCom was an accident by accountants misinterpreting an arcane piece of audit regulation .
Cynics will suggest that there is another crucial difference between Enron and WorldCom : WorldCom was East Coast and gave money to the Democrats ; Enron was from Bush 's home state of Texas and gave lots of money directly to the President .
But that 's probably just a coincidence .

Neither side comes out of the ITV Digital debacle with any credit , but there is a difference between looking incompetent ( like the Football League ) and looking shady ( like Carlton and Granada ) .
Despite the fact they were not around when the OnDigital deal was signed , Keith Harris and David Burns of the League should have checked the documents before they went into court , and they should have had better legal advice .
They look like chumps and may yet pay for the whole sad affair with their jobs and their reputations .
But what about Charles Allen and Michael Green of Granada and Carlton ?
They look nothing better than modern Arthur Daleys : ' Course it 's got a guarantee , sir - money back if it breaks down , my word on it !
Just give it a spin - you 'll love it ! '

Who was it who likened Woolworths shares to toilet paper ?
Whoever it was , he 'd have to part with a lot less
Andrex these days to buy some Woolies shares .
Last week was a horrible one for Gerald Corbett 's company .
Two brokers slashed their forecasts , while the house broker CSFB - which has always had the shares a hold , never a buy , since demerger from Kingfisher - went its own way .
One broker , Investec , hit the nail on the head with the verdict : ' Merchandising looks awful . '
Woolworths is virtually the only retailer to have missed out on the high street boom , so the gloom looks set to continue until interims in October .
Of the shares , deservedly nudging their 25p float price , it can only be said : ' Now wash your hands , please . '
Sung out to dry Adam Singer hung a sign above his office which said ' unexploded bomb ' .
That bomb has now gone off and he has been blown away as chief executive of Telewest , the cable television company - the ninth boss of the firm to bite the dust in six years .
The truth is that Telewest has been plagued by management infighting , shareholder discontent and strategic shortsightedness .
Cable television has yet to take off in this country because most of the programming is second- rate or plain boring .
Telewest has never made money and is creaking under debts of more than £ 5bn .
Now it must go through a painful financial restructuring , as did its larger rival NTL .
No doubt they will eventually be combined , allowing a much larger group to flourish .
But one can not help thinking that ' broadband Britain ' could have been achieved more speedily and more effectively if previous Tory governments had encouraged BT to do the job , rather than by offering various inducements to US cable operators .
The deliberate emasculation of BT in this respect has been scandalous .
Singer is a relatively minor casualty .

True , the shares are a long way from the flotation price of 380p , but they trade comfortably above the all - time low of 18p last November .
Lastminute might be just one of Leighton 's half - a - dozen non - executive directorships - the most important is his chairmanship of Consignia - but the former Asda chairman has made a difference .
He weaned the firm off its obsession with customer numbers , focusing on persuading them to spend more cash .
In short , he has brought much - needed retailing nous .
Whether he will stay at the helm is questionable , as his Consignia duties have grown dramatically .

2002-08-03,"The recent collapse of Enron sent shockwaves through our industry - fortunately , it was only dealing in energy rather than producing it .
If it had owned power stations it would have been much more serious from our point of view .
I say that as someone who spends all day looking for anything that will affect the price of electricity .
Although we work in a similar way to other commodity dealers , underlying all our decisions is the need to match our buying to the demand created by London Electricity customers .
Sitting behind me is a large team whose job it is to predict exactly how much electricity we will need to satisfy that demand .
They come up with a figure every half an hour
and it is then up to the trading department to make sure we buy in enough electricity to cover that position , at the cheapest possible price to the company .
LE generates around half the electricity we need but , depending on the market , may sell that power to another company on the basis that we will be able to buy it in more cheaply from another source .
I can be buying for the long term - up to five years ahead - or a few minutes ahead of a half - hourly deadline .
The closer it is to that deadline , the more expensive it is .
In the same way as a stockbroker , I have three computer screens in front of me showing prices , as well as several live news and information feeds .
Half the trading is done by computer and the rest involves talking to a broker , or directly to one of the actual power producers .
All the time I 'm looking for anything that will affect prices - oil and gas prices have an influence , but something like a power station shutting down has the biggest impact as suppliers have to make up the shortfall in energy being produced .
All the time I 'm taking instructions from analysts trying to predict where prices are going , or risk assessors making sure we are not spending too much with one company and therefore overexposed to another company 's failure .
I came to this by joining LE 's 18-month graduate training scheme straight after a degree in business studies at Sheffield .
I was taken on and trained specifically for this role .
Although this is a 24-hour operation , I mostly work office hours and it 's a fun , if sometimes stressful job .
I suppose if you want to be successful in this kind of work you need an analytical mind , and to be calm under pressure .

2002-08-04,"Jersey has launched a probe into Mahonia , the offshore company which Congressional investigators in America say was used by JP Morgan Chase to help Enron hide its debts .
Investigators from the island 's Financial Services Commission have questioned employees and demanded documents from Mourant , the Jersey financial services firm that runs Mahonia .
The firm denies wrongdoing .
Richard Pratt , the FSC 's director - general , confirmed that the purpose of the inquiry was to find out if any one on Jersey had ' done anything improper ' and to help US law enforcement agencies and regulators .
William Bailhache , Jersey 's attorney - general and the island 's chief prosecutor , is understood to be monitoring the case .
According to US senators investigating the collapse of Enron , JP Morgan Chase knowingly used Mahonia to forward secretive multimillion - dollar loans to the Texan energy trader .
These were allegedly disguised as trades so they did not appear as debt on Enron 's books .
JP Morgan Chase says these were legitimate ' pre - pay ' deals and denies wrongdoing .
The bank also denies controlling Mahonia , but it admits the company has performed regular structured finance transactions on its behalf .
Mahonia is owned by the Eastmoss Trust , which is controlled by executives at Mourant , one of Jersey 's main offshore finance firms .
Mourant confirmed that staff members had been helping US investigations into Mahonia but said : ' We are not aware of any investigation into Mourant itself by the Jersey FSC . '"
2002-08-06,"Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Enron , the bankrupt energy firm , may have bribed foreign government officials to win contracts for its international oil , gas and water businesses .
The disclosure underlined the breadth of the investigation into the company 's labyrinthine operations .
Investors , politicians and the US media have begun to question why no moves have yet been made on former Enron executives after the arrests of senior figures implicated in more recent scandals at WorldCom , ImClone and Adelphia Communications .
The US justice department 's Enron taskforce is examining the company 's overseas operations for possible criminal actions .
Claims of corruption have been made against Enron since the mid-1990s over contracts in countries including Ghana , Colombia , Bolivia , Panama , Nigeria and the Dominican Republic .
In some cases , it was alleged in the Wall Street Journal , Enron won contracts without competitive bidding and assets were acquired at below - market values .
Enron has , in the past , denied any suggestion of improper behaviour in securing contracts .
John Ambler , a spokesman for the energy firm , said : "" We are co - operating with federal authorities on a range of investigations and certainly would do so in this case . ""
Government sources confirmed that the company 's international contracts were being investigated .
Rebecca Mark ran Enron 's international business before taking charge of the water division Azurix , where she hatched the deal to acquire Wessex Water in Britain .
A spokeswoman said she had strictly adhered to the rules of the US practices act against foreign corruption .
She left Enron in 2000 , cashing in shares worth $ 80 m .
In Ghana , the World Bank suspended its support for a $ 100 m water project after it was awarded to Enron - owned Azurix without competition .
At the time , the bank 's Ghana director , Peter Harrold , sent a letter to the local government cancelling a loan and alleging corruption .
The World Bank pointed to a $ 5 m payment up front by Enron , which Ghana newspapers claimed to have been for government officials .
An Enron spokeswoman at the time denied the bribery claim but a new Ghanian government has since cancelled the contract and put it back out to tender .
Damian Milverton , communications director at the World Bank , confirmed that the organisation had been concerned about the contract in Ghana .
The World Bank has formerly questioned other Enron projects in Nigeria , India and Mozambique .
A number of other international projects have come under scrutiny since Enron spiraled into bankruptcy last year after admitting that it had been hiding debts off - shore .
A $ 2.9bn power plant in India , which received US government backing , was mothballed last June after its single customer , the Maharashtra state electricity board said the prices were too high .
Last week , congressional investigators focused on a deal in Nigeria where Enron owns barge - mounted power plants .
It was claimed that an investment in the barges by Merrill Lynch enabled Enron to disguise loans and inflate earnings ."
2002-08-06,"Shares in Interpublic , one of the world 's largest advertising groups , lost almost a quarter of their value today when the company said it was postponing the release of its accounts .
There was an immediate knock - on effect on stock in other advertising groups as caution continues to be the watchword among investors in the wake of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom .
Interpublic 's shares dropped 24 % to 9.57p after the group announced it was delaying its second - quarter earnings report until next week to complete a review of its financial statements .
Although there was no suggestion of impropriety , the New York stock exchange has been plagued by accounting scandals in recent months and investors reacted nervously to the news .
Strict new rules drawn up to avoid a repeat of the WorldCom and Enron disasters mean chief executives and chief financial officers must personally sign off their companies ' accounts and could face stiff fines or even jail sentences for issuing inaccurate information .
Interpublic , which handles advertising for clients such as Coca - Cola , General Motors and Nestlé , refused to reveal why it was delaying the report , although analysts said the company may just be exercising caution .
Investors have been particularly nervous about advertising stocks since Omnicom , the world 's biggest advertising group , was hit by an accounting scandal .
Omnicom , which is due to release its results later today , is facing at least two multimillion dollar lawsuits after it was accused of misleading shareholders in its accounts .
Shares in WPP fell 43.5p to 386.5p this morning as investors reacted to the news from the US .
Aegis shares fell 6.5p to 60p . ""
If Interpublic said last year it was delaying its numbers by a week , nobody would have given it a moment 's thought .
But in these McCarthyite times , people are getting very nervous , "" said Paul Richards , analyst at Numis Securities ."
2002-08-08,"Federal investigators are examining whether Enron executives may have committed fraud by borrowing $ 1bn in an eleventh - hour attempt to stave off bankruptcy last year .
According to reports in the US , the justice department and the securities and exchange commission are focusing on loans to two of Enron 's pipeline subsidiaries , which were then transferred to the parent company .
The inquiries will put further pressure on the investment banks JP Morgan Chase , which lent $ 450 m in the transactions , and Citigroup , which lent $ 550 m .
Both banks were recently grilled at a congressional hearing where they were accused of disguising loans as complicated commodity trades .
A report in the Wall Street Journal also places the focus back firmly on former Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay , who was running the company at the time the loans were agreed .
He has argued that he knew little of the offshore special purpose entities that appeared to have benefited former finance chief Andrew Fastow more than anyone else .
The federal energy regulatory commission issued an order last week that the two pipeline companies - Transwestern Pipeline and Northern Natural Gas - explain their dealings with Enron .
The regulated businesses are subject to tougher accounting rules .
During an audit , the commission was reportedly told that Enron had demanded that the pipeline businesses take out the loans and not to expect them to be paid back .
An Enron spokesman defended the transactions as "" commonplace "" and "" acceptable practice "" and said they were fully disclosed at the time .
The investigators are also said to have uncovered a series of subsidiaries set up to do business with the pipeline companies which could have been used to further redistribute cash .
The subsidiaries did not maintain proper records of their dealings with the pipeline firms , it is alleged .
The Enron spokesman said it was "" fairly common for a parent to draw funds from a subsidiary "" ."
2002-08-09,"Enron might be the largest corporate collapse , but the billions of dollars that went astray in the Worldcom accounts dwarfs all other cases of improper accounting .
First it was $ 3.6bn , then $ 6bn and yesterday the fictitious profits looked to be exceeding $ 7bn .
But how can such large sums of money "" hide "" in a company 's accounts only to be "" uncovered "" at a later date , especially when the hidden money boosted profits to spectacular heights .
The problems arise with aggressive takeover bids and the aggressive accounting practices that sometimes are needed to make the deal look worthwhile to investors .
One key tactic used by companies on the acquisition trail is called roll - up .
Commonly finance directors would estimate the costs associated with a merger , add them together and stick them under the heading "" provisions "" .
When the costs failed to materialise , they could be considered a gain and added to the companies profits .
A company that spent significantly on acquiring assets each year could successfully roll up the unspent expenses from each merger and put them into the profits the following year .
Sometimes sales accounted for a fraction of a company 's profits .
Most of these antics went undetected because it was difficult to compare each set of annual accounts with the previous ones .
Many investors will only look at the earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation , or Ebitda , to determine the financial health of a company .
In doing so , they pay little regard for the balance sheet , where all the changes in reserves and provisions originate .
In recent months , the increasingly common method of accounting has been called "" earnings before I tricked the damned auditor "" .
Large sums allocated to the wrong part of the accounts are less likely to be found in a company the size of Worldcom , with reported assets of more than $ 100bn and revenue of more than $ 35bn before it filed for Chapter 11 protection .
A succession of financial reporting rule changes in the UK during the 1990s severely limited the ability of acquisitive companies to act in this way .
Sir David Tweedie , the former head of the Accounting Standards Board and now in charge of the International accounting regulator , waged a war against the manipulation of the balance sheet to boost profits .
Strict rules on provisions force companies to take the guesswork out of calculating future costs .
In effect , the liabilities the firm forecasts must be based on material evidence .
And when the costs fail to materialise , the accounts must carry a note telling investors what happened .
British auditors say the situation in the US remains , if not lax , then more open to manipulation .
In the case of WorldCom , it is believed that reserves created to cope with expected bad debts , legal costs and taxes were improperly translated into gains to maintain profits during 2000 .
It was a period of steep decline for the telecommunications sector and following a sustained buying spree .
To maintain profit levels the company felt able to reduce its liabilities and use the cash to boost profits .
In this way , it became a case study in how to invent massive profits in your accounts ."
2002-08-12,"The myriad scandals currently rocking corporate America would have come as little surprise to Karl Marx .
The unchecked expansion and corrupt practices of Enron , Xerox and WorldCom were , for Marx , part and parcel of the capitalist mode of production .
Indeed , the modern world economy looks more like the capitalism he described in the Communist Manifesto in 1848 than at any time since .
Marx was the first to capture capitalism 's incessantly restless , compulsively innovatory character ; its iconoclastic subversion of all cultures , practices and beliefs .
In more respectful terms , the financial press of 2002 perfectly echoes his account .
The picture of contemporary capitalism that emerges from the Economist is of a deregulated world economy dominated by multinational companies and continually reshaped by the pressures of international finance .
Nor would Marx have been surprised by the political reaction to this current "" crisis of capitalism "" .
The free - market right blithely regards the corruption as the work of a few rotten corporate apples - declaring that , besides , there is no alternative .
The anti - globalisation left is equally sceptical about the serious reform of capitalism and so advocates its abolition .
But whether Marx - theorist of a post - capitalist order of communism , rather than sustainable development - would have joined the protesters of Genoa and Seattle is more questionable .
Coherent anti - capitalism certainly begins with Marx .
Before him , opposition was largely limited to machine - breaking and incendiarism .
It was only with the manifesto , which so clearly outlined the self - destructive progress of capitalism , that organised antagonism emerged .
Capitalist development , Marx maintained , would end in a world revolution driven by the exploited masses of the new economic order and spearheaded by the factory proletariat of the industrial cities .
Although this world revolution never occurred , the growth of a labour movement and spread of socialist ideas did pose real obstacles to capitalist advance .
Until the seismic events of 1989 , socialism and communism hampered capitalist development both politically and geographically .
Now many of Marx 's erstwhile followers , who have switched their attention to the anti - globalisation movement , appear to share the same world view as the Economist .
Both assume that the optimal functioning of a capitalist economy requires an amicable partnership between a minimal state and deregulated economy .
As the Communist Manifesto put it , the "" executive of the modern state "" is "" but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie "" .
And while , for the moment , socialism may have been defeated , Marx correctly predicted a global polarisation between wealth and poverty .
Hence the position Terry Eagleton , who recently argued in these pages that the only thing that has changed is that while once the uprising of the dispossessed was expected in Bradford or the Bronx , now it is coming from "" the souks of Tripoli and Damascus "" .
In the present climate , it is not difficult to understand why there should be such widespread despair of meaningful reform .
Marxian assumptions do not seem unreasonable in a world in which the Italian state is in the pocket of its largest entrepreneur , and in which the election of the American president was bankrolled by Enron .
But there is no need to accept either the right 's vision of a capitalism triumphant or the anti - globalisation left 's assumption that Marx has been proved correct .
Their contrary yet righteous certainty is the product of an ideological hostility to a mixed economy that the previous social democratic movement did not share .
Capitalism more usually refers to a question of degree than of kind .
The unrestricted exchange of commodities together with a free labour market is compatible with a broad range of political regimes .
Yet what Marx initially promised was a post - capitalist society .
It would be as dynamic as capitalism itself , but no longer subject to an arbitrary market , freed from scarcity and its class - bound polarities of wealth and poverty .
Marx 's manifesto vision was driven by a conviction that the capitalist "" cash - nexus "" distorted the expression of human need .
Drawing upon German legal historians , he concluded that the modern form of private property and the exchange economy based upon it was only one in a historical succession of different property forms .
Capitalist private property had produced the unparalleled productivity gains of the 19th - century industrial revolution .
But this prospect of the end of scarcity also suggested that capitalism had completed its historical task .
After the failed 1848 revolution Marx searched in vain for a non - market model capable of rivalling the dynamism of capitalism .
He had originally distinguished human beings from animals by their capacity to create new needs .
This innovatory potential was to be a feature of the rational mode of production that would replace regulation by the market .
But without the market , he found no way to replicate the innovatory energy of capitalism .
Only the freedom and dynamism of market - based capitalism had a built - in interest in the expansion of new needs .
In effect , he had only constructed a regulated non - capitalist society , not the post - capitalist society of which he dreamed .
Eagleton and other anti - capitalists searching for an answer from Marx might therefore ask whether he ever succeeded in constructing a coherent theory in the first place .
The practical failure of 20th - century communism was preceded by Marx 's theoretical failure to create a viable conception of modern communism .
The 20th century showed that in periods of war and political upheaval , it was certainly possible to create non - capitalist societies , though usually with authoritarian consequences .
But the notion of a post - capitalist society was a hollow promise .
The point was ruefully expressed by the socialist economist , Michal Kalecki , after his return to postwar communist Poland .
Asked about Poland 's transition from capitalism to socialism , he replied : "" Yes , we have successfully abolished capitalism ; all we have to do now is to abolish feudalism . ""
What has stultified the thinking of the left has been its continued belief that capitalism is to be wholly accepted or rejected as a single system .
It retains a lingering conviction that capitalism is all of one piece and can be rejected in the name of a non - existent communist system destined some time to form the basis of an alternative world order .
But if there is no post - capitalist society in the name of which we can despise all attempts to reform the existing political and economic system , we should embrace the only alternative .
That is the progressive relationship between pressure from without and reforming activity within the political system .
For it was this interaction between protesters and reformers that transformed the lives of those working in advanced capitalist societies .
Inside and outside parliament , the forces of progressive social reform improved working conditions , secured education and achieved decent pay levels .
Cynicism or silence about the possibility of reform merely reinforces the rightwing fantasy of a global capitalism without politics : a world made ever safer for Enron and Berlusconi .

2002-08-12,"The chief executives and finance directors of about 1,200 top US and European companies have days left to file sworn statements verifying the veracity of their accounts to American authorities .
US executives have until 4 pm New York time on Wednesday to provide the guarantees of integrity , which have been demanded by the securities and exchange commission following the WorldCom and Enron collapses .
Two weeks ago President Bush signed a new law , the Sarbanes - Oxley act , which extended that requirement to the top two executives of all foreign companies with a US stock listing , trading in American depository receipts or US debt .
They have until August 29 to provide the guarantees .
The penalty for executives signing off accounts they know to be false or inaccurate is up to 20 years in jail or a $ 5 m fine .
In all , 947 blue chip American companies must deliver sworn certificates to the SEC by this week 's deadline and there will be a last minute rush to meet it .
By Friday night only six of the 30 companies which make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 126 companies overall had filed their documents .
The six Dow Jones companies to have filed so far are : Exxon - Mobil , GE , Alcoa , 3 M and United Technologies and Citigroup .
More than 250 European companies trade ADRs in the US and it is understood that only two - Dutch bank ABN Amro and Swiss food group Nestlé - have so far submitted their letters .
Among British companies affected will be well - known names such as Vodafone , British Airways , BP , GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever .
There is some confusion about what is required , with some companies believing that their annual report is a sufficient guarantee .
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has outlined worries that UK directors could be subject to US criminal action , and the Department of Trade and Industry has admitted to concerns .
US rules used to accept that foreign companies were regulated in their own countries , but the new requirements overturn that assumption .
The certificates of integrity are one of a number of measures hurried through by US authorities as they try to repair the battered reputation of corporate America and restore investor confidence following a series of accounting scandals and high - profile corporate collapses .
They include new rules about auditors and loans to company directors - and they will apply equally to non - US companies which trade securities in America .
There have also been several new listing rules drawn up by the New York stock exchange designed to improve corporate governance and investor trust ."
2002-08-21,"Federal prosecutors in the US have secured their first conviction in the case against bankrupt oil giant Enron , as one of the company 's former executives pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud .
Michael Kopper , 37 , has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors , and lawyers believe his information could lead to further convictions of Enron executives allegedly involved in the company 's downfall .
Kopper served as managing director of Enron Global Finance under former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow .
He quit the company months before its collapse to run one of several partnerships created by Mr Fastow .
Those partnerships have been credited with leading to the company 's failure , costing thousands of workers their jobs and retirement funds and leaving millions of investors with nearly worthless stock .
As part of his agreement to cooperate with the government , Kopper agreed to surrender $ 12 m ( £ 7.8 m ) in illegally obtained assets .
In his pleading , Kopper said his activities were conducted under the direction of Mr Fastow and in some cases in concert with him .
He said that in at least two of the transactions he kicked back money to Mr Fastow .
US district court judge Ewing Werlein Jr set bail for Kopper at $ 5 m .
Investigators are looking into whether Enron managers , including former chairman Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeff Skilling , knew the network of partnerships - largely backed by Enron stock - was being used to hide debt and inflate profits . ""
He embodies the perfect cooperating witness because he is not viewed by the public as being one of the most culpable defendants .
But at the same time , he has a vast array of knowledge and can point the government in the right direction , "" said Robert Mintz , a former justice department prosecutor .
Mr Fastow was ousted in October , days after Enron admitted to years of inflated profits and hidden debt .
When Enron filed for bankruptcy last December , it was the largest such filing in US history .
Millions of investors lost money and thousands of current and former Enron workers lost the great bulk of their retirement savings .
It also led to the unravelling of Arthur Andersen LLP , the auditing firm convicted of shredding documents to obstruct a securities and exchange commission investigation into Enron 's accounting practices .
Since then , executives from Andersen and other major companies , including WorldCom and Adelphia , have been accused of improper accounting .
Mr Fastow ran partnerships that allowed Enron to shift debt from its books .
He also negotiated deals with Enron on the partnerships ' behalf .
That makes Kopper a critical connection to Mr Fastow and Enron 's accounting practices , said Thomas Ajamie , a former federal prosecutor and securities lawyer .
"" He could give them a colour - enhanced map of Fastow 's movements and thoughts , "" Mr Ajamie said .
Kopper ran a partnership called Chewco , named for the Star Wars character of Chewbacca , until he left Enron in 2001 to run another Fastow - created entity called LJM2 .
Ken Johnson , spokesman for the house of representative 's energy and commerce committee , said Kopper is likely to be the first of many executives who will be charged .
"" Clearly this is just the first shoe to drop , based on the information our committee has in its possession , "" Mr Johnson said .
"" We have a wealth of information in our possession suggesting a number of people at Enron took part in fraudulent activities . ""
Following his guilty plea to the criminal charges , the SEC filed civil charges against Kopper .
Under a settlement agreement , the SEC said it charge Kopper with violating securities anti - fraud laws .
Kopper neither admitted nor denied the allegations ."
2002-08-21,"Federal prosecutors in the US will today make their first significant breakthrough in the case against Enron when former executive Michael Kopper will plead guilty to criminal charges .
Mr Kopper , who worked for ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , is said to be cooperating with prosecutors and could provide vital information for further convictions .
He will be the first Enron executive to be indicted .
The plea will also remove some of the growing pressure on the US justice department and the securities and exchange commission to make some progress on the Enron investigation .
The energy company fell into bankruptcy at the end of last year after it emerged that massive debts were being hidden off the balance sheet .
Prosecutors have by contrast made a series of arrests in more recent financial scandals including WorldCom , ImClone and Adelphia .
Mr Kopper will plead guilty in a Houston court to criminal charges of money laundering and wire fraud , according to reports .
He is also giving up $ 12 m ( £ 7.8 m ) in cash and assets that he made from investing in one of Mr Fastow 's offshore partnerships .
The partnerships were used to mask Enron 's true levels of debt and Mr Fastow has been a focus of the investigation .
Spokesmen for the SEC and the justice department declined to comment .
The SEC is expected to file a related civil complaint against Mr Kopper alleging securities fraud .
In June , Mr Kopper and Mr Fastow were mentioned in criminal charges filed against three British bankers who had worked for Greenwich NatWest .
The complaint alleged that the trio profited from a secret transaction with Mr Fastow and Mr Kopper in 2000 but the two Enron executives were not charged at the time .
The complaint detailed a series of meetings between Mr Kopper and the three men as well as emails exchanged between them .
Mr Kopper was called before the energy and commerce committee to answer questions about the Enron collapse but exercised his right not to incriminate himself .
The only successful prosecution related to Enron has so far been against the auditor Arthur Andersen - not on charges directly related to the energy firm 's collapse but on charges of obstruction of justice ."
2002-08-22,"The net was closing in on former Enron executives last night after Michael Kopper , who worked in the energy firm 's finance department , pleaded guilty to money laundering and fraud and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors .
The plea is the first big breakthrough for the US justice department , which has been under increasing pressure to make arrests .
Federal investigators seized $ 23 m of assets from Mr Kopper 's former boss and finance chief , Andrew Fastow .
The men allegedly ran a series of shadowy off - balance sheet ventures to hide huge debts and pocket millions of dollars .
Enron , once the seventh largest company in the US , fell into bankruptcy after investors learned of the debts and the company was forced to restate earnings , the first in a wave of scandals that have bruised corporate America .
Enron 's bankruptcy cost investors and employees billions of dollars .
Larry Thompson , the deputy attorney general , said : "" This plea marks a significant milestone in the Enron investigation .
We have secured the cooperation of an important witness .
He has wisely acknowledged his liability for his conduct and is now cooperating with the investigation .
"" The indictment claimed that Mr Kopper , 37 , alongside oth ers including Mr Fastow , had been involved in a conspiracy which began in 1997 .
It alleges they "" created an array of companies designed to disguise Enron 's vulnerability to risk and losses and to benefit the conspirators at the expense of shareholders "" .
Under the plea deal struck with prosecutors , Mr Kopper faces a maximum prison term of 15 years .
He is surrendering $ 12 m made through an investment in the off - balance sheet venture Chewco , much of which will be placed in a kitty for victims of the Enron collapse .
Mr Kopper , who entered the plea in a Houston court , was released on $ 5 m bail .
Defence attorney David Howard said Mr Kopper had "" accepted personal responsibility for his role in the Enron tragedy "" and expressed "" deep regret "" .
Michael Ramsey , a lawyer for former Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay , said his client had not known Mr Kopper . ""
The crimes that went on at Enron were kept secret on purpose .
They were kept secret from the board , they were kept secret from everyone - 99 % of the people at Enron are honest people , "" he said .
The SEC also filed a civil suit charging fraud against Mr Kopper .
Stephen Cutler , the SEC enforcement chief , said : "" The action against Mr Kopper is an important chapter in the story of Enron 's collapse but much of the story remains untold .
This case is but a first step , albeit a vital one , in our effort to hold responsible and to bring to justice those who participated in this massive betrayal of the investing public 's trust . ""
The complaint names three off - balance sheet entities : Chewco , Southampton and RADR that Mr Kopper was involved in and allegedly profited from .
Three British bankers have been charged for allegedly profiting from a secret transaction with one of the partnerships .
David Duncan , a former partner with Arthur Andersen , pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice earlier this year , helping prosecutors to gain a conviction against the firm which acted as Enron 's auditor .
In his plea , Mr Kopper said he acted under the direction and sometimes in concert with Mr Fastow .
In at least two cases , he alleged that Mr Fastow took financial kickbacks .
In one instance involving Southampton , he described a series of complex transactions that ultimately defrauded Enron .
Outside investors "" did funnel that money back to me
and I then proceeded to give some of that money to the Enron chief financial officer , "" Mr Kopper said .
"" We never informed Enron of the loans I made or the distributions we got . """
2002-08-22,"Police today arrested the chairman and chief executive of Wessex Water , formerly owned by bankrupt US energy trader Enron , over allegations of corruption .
Colin Skellett is being investigated under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 for allegedly receiving a £ 1 m bribe during the company 's takeover by a Malaysian energy firm , YTL Power , earlier this year for about $ 794 m ( £ 521 m ) .
"" The investigation is focused only on the suspected payment to the official and there is no suspicion of general mismanagement within Wessex Water Ltd , "" a City of London police spokesman said .
City of London police said they had also arrested another person , not an official of the company , in connection with the case .
Mr Skellett is being held at an Avon and Somerset police station .
Police have been issued search warrants in the west country area .
Mr Skellett is also the non - executive chairman of Jarvis , whose subsidiary company Jarvis Rail is at the centre of the investigation into May 's Potters Bar train crash .
Lord Wakeham , who resigned as chairman of the press complaints commission because he was on the board of Enron , was also on the board of Wessex Water .
Andersen in the UK was until recently the auditor for Wessex Water .
But investigators said there was no connection between this investigation and Lord Wakeham , Andersen or Enron .
YTL made a winning bid for Wessex after beating a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland , previously named as the preferred bidder .
YTL , Malaysia 's largest construction group , is 46 % owned by the Yeoh family and is run by Francis Yeoh , one of the sons of Tiong Lay Yeoh , the Malaysian billionaire .
Based in Bath , Wessex Water supplies drinking water to about 1.2 m people and sewerage services to 2.5 m people in the south - west of England .
It made a pre - tax profit of £ 84.3 m in the 12 months to 31 March , 6 % down on the previous year .
Enron went bankrupt in December after admitting using special partnerships to conceal millions of dollars in debt .
Its collapse was the first in a string of scandals , including telecoms giant WorldCom , that has severely undermined investor confidence in the integrity of corporate America and Wall Street .
There were two other bids for Wessex Water , one from Asian billionaire Li Ka - shing , through his Cheung Kong Infrastructure company ; itself a part of Hutchison Whampoa , the Hong Kong - based telecoms and ports conglomerate .
The Italian utility , Enel , was the fourth bidder ."
2002-08-22,"Is the bell tolling for non - executive directors ?
In industry their role has been indelibly besmirched by Enron , where the kindest interpretation suggests they proved ineffectual .
In the NHS , confusion about their purpose , and misgivings about their calibre , persist even after sweeping changes to the way they are recruited .
Popular prejudice about the average private sector non - executive has it that they are on to a nice little earner for none too onerous responsibilities and owe their enviable position to having been to the right school or belonging to the right golf club .
In return they willingly vote through "" fat cat "" salary increases for their cronies , regardless of company performance or shareholders ' wishes .
This caricatured view of boardroom culture may appear to have some basis in fact as each new scandal breaks .
Recent reports that MPs and peers hold 819 directorships among them will confirm suspicions that becoming a non - executive is a highly lucrative sideline demanding minimal effort for a privileged few .
The trade secretary , Patricia Hewitt , tacitly acknowledged this when launching her inquiry into the non - executive 's role in April .
"" We need stronger , more independent , more active non - executives drawn from a wider pool of talent , "" she said .
The NHS tried strong , independent , active non - executives when it adopted the private sector boardroom model a decade ago to help it to be more "" business - like "" in the internal market .
Though the appointees mostly shared their then political masters ' true blue convictions , ministers rapidly grew irritated with their determination to show they had minds of their own and managers became fed up with encroachments into their territory .
Are health service non - executives there to carry out the government 's orders or exercise leadership ?
Do they really represent their communities ?
These tensions have never been resolved by ministers of either party , who would always like the best of both worlds , end up with neither and lose interest .
As a result , the NHS non - executive 's lot is far from their private sector counterparts ' cushy number .
Most with any sense of dedication find the workload heavy , and at £ 5,000 a year for a theoretical five days a month , this particular preferment may bring entry into the ranks of the great and the good but is n't a route to getting rich quick .
None of which deters managers from grumbling about the quality of many non - executives .
They have only to pass the BSW test - to prove that they can breathe , stand and walk - in the opinion of one bitter former chief executive .
That may change since the NHS appointments commission took over responsibility for patronage from ministers last year , after the public appointments commissioner condemned how they had politicised the process "" in a systemic way "" .
It is trying to recruit more widely , define the role more precisely and regularly appraise individuals ' performance .
But the public will take some convincing that positions of prestige are really to be opened to those not predestined to be of that stratum of appropriate people hitherto favoured - pushy middle - class professionals or dabblers in local politics .
The very term "" non - executive "" will carry deeply negative connotations in the wake of Enron .
So is n't it time to try something else ?
The health secretary , Alan Milburn , seems to have flirted with the idea .
He told the Guardian in February that the name "" non - executive director "" was "" a turn - off for many members of the local community "" , and that he wanted to explore a more representative governance structure for foundation hospitals .
Yet last month 's guidance on them was vague on this point .
Mr Milburn should pursue the idea - and incorporate lessons from Ms Hewitt 's report , due at the end of the year .

2002-08-23,"Until the arrest yesterday of Colin Skellett , the sale in May of Wessex Water , of which he is chairman and chief executive , looked a straightforward transaction .
The deal was regarded as a footnote to the long and painful collapse of Enron , Wessex 's ultimate parent .
It was seen as nothing more than part of the attempt to salvage cash from the far - flung parts of the bankrupt US energy group 's empire .
Now every detail will be examined and the activities of the eventual buyer - YTL Power , 60 % owned by YTL , a huge Malaysian company with almost no European presence - will come under close scrutiny .
The City of London Fraud Squad said its investigation centres on "" one particular individual at Wessex Water and this person 's relationship with the Malaysian company "" .
YTL and the Yeoh Tiong Lay family which controls it are legends in Malaysia .
The company began life as a small business in the cement and construction industries but , helped by prime mininster Mahathir Mohamad 's building programmes , it is now one of the 10 largest corporations in the country and has diversified to such an extent that it owns a luxury resort off the west coast of Malaysia .
It has been involved in the some of Malaysia 's most high - profile construction work .
As well as hotel and airport work , it has built Malaysia 's national art gallery and is constructing the rail link from Kuala Lumpur to the new international airport .
Inevitably , the family 's relationship with the eccentric prime minister has been questioned .
Francis Yeoh , the eldest son of the founder who was educated at Kingston University , outside London , accompanied Dr Mahathir on a recent trip to Germany .
The fact that YTL was interested in Wessex stunned rival bidders , particularly Royal Bank of Scotland , whose consortium had been awarded preferred bidder status .
YTL 's only notable expansion in energy outside Malaysia had been into Australia , where it co - owns the electricity transmission grid .
The purchase of Wessex was meant to be a springboard for possible further acquisitions in Britain and Europe .
The idea was that they would learn the art of operating in a regulated European environment from Mr Skellett and his colleagues .
Last night , YTL was said to be "" deeply concerned "" about the police investigation and denied knowledge of any illegal payment .
Royal Bank and its fellow consortium members will also be watching the investigation closely .
Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong , one member , is thought to have considered legal action after raising objections to the way the bid was conducted .
It thought it should have been allowed to rebid after YTL was invited to make a counter - bid to the consortium 's offer .
Mr Skellett 's arrest also has implications for the rail contractor caught up in the row following the Potter 's Bar train crash , Jarvis , where he is non - executive chairman .
His position there is regarded in the City as untenable and he is expected to be asked to resign while the police investigation continues .
Former Tory transport minister Steven Norris , who is on the board of Jarvis and helped fuel some of the controversy over the company 's claims that sabotage caused the Potter 's Bar crash , is the leading candidate to act as temporary chairman .
Former banker Lord McGowan , who is a former member of the board of Wessex Water , is also a leading member of the Jarvis board and a possible candidate for the chairman 's seat ."
2002-08-24,"Could it be that certain members of the City of London fraud squad are dead from the neck up ?
It 's a serious charge , but nevertheless it was effectively levelled yesterday by Colin Skellett , the Wessex Water chairman and chief executive , who was arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of trousering a £ 1 m bung .
The implication on the day was that he had taken the money for smoothing the takeover of Wessex - which until May was part of Enron - by YTL , a Malaysian firm keen to break into the western energy sector .
But yesterday Mr Skellett was out of police cells and back at his desk , insisting - in a persuasive sort of way - that all this talk of bungs was a dreadful mistake .
Sure , he received the thick end of £ 1 m from YTL .
It was an above - board incentive payment which the Malaysians insisted he took up front .
And , in any case , Mr Skellett declared , he had nothing to do with the sale decision .
Until the last moment he , like everyone else , thought the buyer of Wessex would be either Royal Bank of Scotland or Hutchison Whampoa .
The first the executive knew of the bribery allegations was when a vanload of police officers turned up at his house first thing in the morning .
A bout of shyness had come over the City of London police yesterday afternoon , with a spokeswoman only able to say that the force did "" not want to get involved in what he said "" .
So we 'll have speculate as best we can here .
In the regular world it is common for companies involved in takeovers to make incentive payments .
They tend to take two forms : "" focus "" payments , designed to buy compliance from management at the company being taken over , so that value is not destroyed ; or golden handcuffs , designed to retain staff who would otherwise leave .
Both these types of payment are well - known and entirely legitimate .
Any British public company involved in such payments would be required to disclose the detail to shareholders .
Wessex was a British subsidiary of an American company being sold to a Malaysian enterprise ; there was no immediate need to disclose any executive rewards being made .
But there is no reason why Mr Skellett , or YTL or Wessex would not be open about the matter to the British police - who , perhaps as part of post - September 11 financial checks , may have come across an unexplained £ 1 m cash transfer from a Malaysian bank to a British individual .
Which is where this whole affair becomes unexplainable .
Did the police ask ?
Did Wessex and/or Mr Skellett offer an explanation ?
Was there a thorough consideration of the possible repercussions of accusing a senior corporate executive of such an extreme crime ?
It is unimaginable that one of the country 's premier fraud investigation units would make such an elementary error as to mistake a regular business payment for a bribe .
If they have , senior heads should roll .
Forgotten sector
Some people seem to believe that manufacturing does not matter any more .
The sector is now in its longest recession since the war , but its plight has provoked remarkably little public discussion .
Hi - tech manufacturing , which was the great shining hope for revival in the sector , has largely evaporated with the bursting of the dot.com bubble .
Bob Rowthorne at Cambridge University says that , as employment in Britain 's factories has fallen over the past two decades from around a third of the workforce to just one seventh , it has lost its hold on the public imagination .
Many people now apparently believe that manufacturing is of only historical interest now .
Like agriculture , it is regarded as an activity which advanced economies gradually grow out of .
It is certainly true that the services sector has done a better job than expected in contributing towards paying Britain 's way in the world .
Mr Rowthorn admits that forecasts he made 10 years ago about the ability of service sector firms to earn foreign exchange have proved too pessimistic .
He and his Cambridge colleagues failed to anticipate the increasing weightlessness of Britain 's trade .
The returns on knowledge - inventions , patents , and the creative component in the design of products and services - turned out to be a nice little earner , while British investors have proved better at making a buck out of foreign investments than vice versa .
But Mr Rowthorn questions how long this happy situation can continue .
Unless foreigners agree to fund our balance of payments indefinitely , the gap between what Britain spends abroad and what it earns must eventually close .
While the UK 's situation is nowhere near as grave as America 's - our current account is around 2 % of GDP while in the US it is above 4 % - the danger is that it could continue to deteriorate .
If foreign investors lose faith in Britain 's ability to repay its growing foreign debt , it could lead to a sudden and damaging collapse in the currency .
With manufacturing still accounting for 60 % of British exports , the health of the current deficit depends on the strength of industry ."
2002-08-24,"It may seem too early in the great corporate witch - hunt to pose the question , but I wonder whether there is now too great a risk that entrepreneurship will be crushed .
Whatever the needs of the financial system and the wider economy , they can ill afford the extinguishing of the flames of innovation and ambition .
In a week marked by the first guilty plea from an Enron executive and the arrest of the chairman of one of its former UK subsidiaries on suspicion of trousering a £ 1 m bung ( an accusation strongly denied by the executive yesterday ) , the integrity of the world 's corporate infrastructure remains squarely centre stage .
There is no suggestion that the allegations made against Wessex Water 's Colin Skellett are in any way related to the scandal at his company 's erstwhile parent , but they are a wake - up call for those claiming Britain to be immune to the problems suffusing America .
Duffing up We will never know the full extent of the criminality lurking in the boardroom , but only for the same mundane reason that we ca n't gauge it for society as a whole - there will never be the requisite resource and luck sufficient to unearth it .
The current inquisitorial climate should broadly scope the problem .
The authorities ' hope is that , once scoped , its scale will prove reassuringly small .
Few , however innocent , enjoy being on the receiving end of the inquisition .
Few , also , will have the resilience to come through the climate of suspicion with their management and business ideals unaltered .
Challenge is a good thing ; a gratuitous duffing up something different entirely .
If any chief executive has been slow to pay attention to his regulatory and fiduciary obligations , he will now be quick to wheel in the consultants to help him do so pretty damn quick .
They are likely to shift him in only one direction on his personal riskometer .
Process and controls , their implementation and operation , will loom larger in his day - to - day working life , crowding out his precious minutes for creative thinking .
It may be that I 'm getting older and duller , but it seems to me that plc chief executives as a breed have become a duller bunch .
I 'm not sure whether the same sort of people are rising to the top as always have done - and are then constrained by today 's stifling bureaucracies - or whether a different breed is now inheriting the keys to the executive washroom .
There will always be a coterie of chief executives deemed ever so slightly racy by the investment establishment - men whose hair is either too long or too short , whose lapels are too wide or too thin , whose tie collection stretches only to weddings and funerals .
Often they do no more than provide journalists with welcome splashes of colour .
Certainly , their existence has done little to shape the behaviour of the majority of corporations .
The best businesses do n't need a T - shirt and ponytail culture to foster flair .
What many have n't realised is that neither do they need a starched , box - ticking culture to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance .
The risk is that over - engineered compliance will stifle innovation in whatever guise it chooses to rock up for work every morning .
The risks associated with life at the very top are asymmetrical .
Succeed and you will be well rewarded .
Fail and you may well find your fall cushioned by a mattress stuffed with tenners .
While this environment often raises hackles , it should in theory ensure that CEOs are prepared to take chances on behalf of their shareholders .
Fear of failure must n't be the primary driving force .
Energy sapped The average tenure of chief executives is short and getting shorter .
Bear markets and anaemic economies raise failure rates .
The increasing strictures of corporate life sap the energies of executives at an increasing pace .
Do not be surprised , then , if risk avoidance replaces calculated risk taking as the primary characteristic of CEOs .
As corporate bureaucracies expand and CEO tenancies shorten , so business leaders become merely temporary stewards .
They are like captains of supertankers forever circling the globe , helicoptered onto the bridge for their brief periods at the helm .
Small changes in their charges ' courses are all they can hope to achieve .
Intended , of course , to avoid the rocks and icebergs of corporate disaster .
All of those stakeholders pressing down on executives ' shoulders would do well to remember the generative role these individuals and the businesses at their command fulfil within the economy .
Trust needs to be re - established on both sides .
Too many constraints and it will be at a cost to capacity .
One solution may lie in a radical re - examination of the respective roles of chairmen and chief executives .
The concept of the part - time , non - executive chairman is flawed .
Far better for a full time chairman to assume all governance responsibilities and associated bureaucracies , freeing his chief executive to focus on all those decisions within a company that create value .
In short , let one close down risk and the other embrace it .

2002-08-28,"Enron , the once mighty US energy trader , was today moving towards break - up as it put its most valuable assets on sale .
The sale could mean that Enron , formed in 1985 , will cease to exist following its meteoric fall into bankruptcy last year .
The company wants to sell its 12 most valuable assets to raise as much money for creditors as possible .
"" One of the possibilities is if the bids are sufficient , "" an Enron official said .
"" You do end up selling off the company .
There would n't be a lot left .
"" The company will seek a first round of bids in October , a final round in November and may accept some or all of them in December - a year after filing what was at the time the largest bankruptcy in US history .
Telecommunications giant WorldCom has since taken that dubious honour .
The collapse of Enron and WorldCom , caused by questionable accounting practices , undermined investor confidence around the world and contributed to a sharp fall in share prices .
The decision to sell off most of Enron marks a change of tack for Stephen Cooper , the bankrupt company 's interim chief executive .
In May , Mr Cooper unveiled a strategy for emerging from bankruptcy that included ditching the Enron name and focusing on moving electricity and natural gas .
At the time Mr Cooper said that Enron would revert to its origins in 1985 , when it was formed through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth .
The once - lauded company was sold in February to UBS Warburg , the Swiss banking group .
The latest announcement indicates a willingness to dispose of most of what is left of Enron if bidders stump up the money ; a big if , as other energy companies are also trying to sell assets in a competitive market .
Enron 's old competitors , Dynegy and the Williams group , are fighting off bankruptcy by selling natural gas pipelines and power plants too .
But pipelines have gone quickly , most notably Dynegy 's recent sale of Northern Natural Gas to MidAmerican Energy Holdings , a unit Berkshire Hathaway , the investment vehicle run by Warren Buffett , the investment guru .
The assets Enron is putting up for sale include Portland General Electric ; the Portland , Oregon , utility acquired in 1997 that serves 740,000 customers in the north - west , and Enron 's whole or part ownership in its three remaining pipelines ."
2002-08-28,"Andersen , the embattled accountant , agreed to pay $ 60 m ( £ 39 m ) yesterday to settle legal claims relating to its role in the collapsed oil company Enron as it attempted to draw a line under the scandal .
The payment is expected to be the first of many by the group , which has all but disintegrated since its US arm was convicted in June of obstructing justice by shredding documents relating to its audit of Enron .
It was once America 's eighth - biggest company .
The first tranche of the settlement is thought likely to go to investors and employees of Enron as well as some of its long line of creditors .
However , the total bill to settle all the legal claims from employees , investors and other bodies is likely to run to hundreds of millions of dollars .
Under the complicated structure of what was once a global accounting group , the payment is being made by Andersen Worldwide , which had been the unifying body for the partnership .
The US arm of the group , Arthur Andersen LLP , which was convicted of obstructing investigations into the matter , is being closed down , while many other parts of the Andersen empire have sold themselves to former rivals .
In the UK , the bulk of the partnership joined KPMG .
Even though the auditing work was carried out by its Houston operation , other parts of the group have been hit by legal claims .
The settlement is expected to be complex and costly as a result .
An announcement of the terms of the settlement is thought to be imminent , although the Chicago - based operation was unable to comment on reports yesterday of the scale of the deals being struck .
The collapse of Enron last year prompted changes to the rules that companies must follow when filing financial records .
It has also started a worldwide debate about the relationship between auditors and clients , including a review of practices in the UK .
Yesterday , regulators in the US required chief executives of foreign companies to certify their financial reports , despite widespread opposition to such a move .
They also took an other step towards tightening rules for companies and executives by requiring annual statements to be filed 60 days after the financial year - end , rather than 90 days later as is the practice at present .
Reports on quarterly performance will have to be filed within 35 days of the three - month period ending , rather than the current 45 days , under rules passed yesterday by the securities and exchange commission ."
2002-08-28,"Stephen Cooper , the new chief executive at Enron , has thrown in the towel in his bid to keep the US energy company alive .
By announcing the sale of most of its assets , Enron is in effect selling itself out of existence .
Up for grabs will be pipelines and power plants that once formed the underpinning of a top Fortune 500 company .
But the heart had already been ripped out of Enron , when it sold its vaunted trading arm - the part that made Enron more than just an ordinary energy company - to UBS Warburg , a Swiss investment bank , as part of its restructuring .
It was Enron 's trading arm that captured the imagination of Wall Street , winning accolades for its innovative approach that spiced up the dull world of supplying energy .
Under its former chairman , Kenneth Lay , Enron carved out a niche for itself by specialising in contracts to deliver natural gas , electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities at a future date .
It also sold financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices and cashed in on dot.com mania with Enrononline , a web - based trading service .
But the Enron edifice crumbled last year .
The rot started in earnest in October when it announced a $ 1bn special charge and wrote down shareholders ' funds by a further $ 1.2bn .
Within a week the securities and exchange commission , the US financial regulator , had started a fraud investigation and Enron 's share price went into freefall .
It soon emerged that Enron had created special entities with names derived from characters in the Star Wars films , to conceal huge debt .
In December , Enron filed for bankruptcy protection , the first of several high - profile scandals culminating with the collapse of WorldCom , that helped undermine investor confidence in the integrity of corporate America and Wall Street .
At first Mr Cooper wanted to take Enron back to its roots by concentrating on energy infrastructure , such as pipelines and power plants , along with the transportation , distribution , generation and production of natural gas and electricity , primarily in North and South America .
The aim , as outlined to a bankruptcy court , was to create a slimmed down Enron employing 12,000 people that would make profits of $ 1.3bn next year .
But the intense pressure to meet some $ 50bn in claims from creditors has forced Mr Cooper 's hand and the great Enron sale is about to begin .
Final bids are due in November and Enron will decide in December which ones to accept , pending approval by the bankruptcy court .
Enron is not the only one selling off assets .
Its rivals , such as Dynegy and Williams , are also selling off businesses to try and stay afloat .
Enron 's pipelines could draw a lot of interest , even in such a desperate climate for energy companies .
If Enron successfully sheds subsidiaries at favourable prices , it is highly unlikely that any businesses will remain to form a mini - Enron .
It will mean the end of a corporate titan . ·

2002-08-28,"Richard Grasso , chairman of the New York stock exchange , failed to disclose details of a stock - based compensation package he was awarded for sitting on the board of a troubled US computer company .
Computer Associates said yesterday that Mr Grasso and four other directors had not filed reports with the securities and exchange commission over the past five years , noting that they had been awarded stock .
One of dozens of companies to have faced an inquiry into its accounting practices after the Enron and WorldCom scandals , Computer Associates blamed Mr Grasso 's failure to file on a misinterpretation by lawyers acting for the company .
He has since complied with the rules .
Supporters of deregulation said the mix - up underlined how even the highest ranking market official could be confused by the myriad of regulations .
Mr Grasso has spent the summer at the forefront of efforts to bring greater transparency and tougher requirements for corporate governance to Wall Street .
A spokesman at the NYSE declined to comment , saying it was a matter for the company .
The firm thought that because the compensation was deferred until directors retired it was not obliged to disclose terms , but changed its position after taking legal advice ."
2002-08-30,"The so - called big four accountancy firms pocketed three times as much from lucrative consultancy contracts last year as from auditing , research published yesterday reveals .
Accountancy magazine found that FTSE 100 firms paid accountants a record £ 848 m in 2001 - only £ 212 m of which was for preparing their annual , statutory audit .
Since accounting irregularities at US energy trader Enron came to light last year , the big four have insisted a similar situation could not arise in Britain because of stricter regulatory controls .
But the report will raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest when the same firm is both auditor and consultant .
Yesterday 's survey suggests there could be a temptation to bend the accounting rules to keep hold of big money consultancy contracts . ""
The figures speak for themselves , "" said Accounting 's editor , Chris Quick .
"" Auditors need independence and integrity , and they need to be able to stand up to their clients if they have to
but there is an inherent risk with the set - up at the moment .
You ca n't get away from that fundamental conflict of interest . ""
Peter Wyman , the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants , offered a staunch defence of the profession yesterday , insisting that the statutory code of conduct under which auditors have to operate means there are greater safeguards against conflicts of interest here than in the US .
"" We have clear rules for auditors , and we have tightened them up recently , "" he said .
"" Auditors are simply not allowed to take on a quasi - managerial function while auditing a firm 's accounts . ""
He said the market has helped resolve some potential conflicts by forcing the largest firms to separate their consultancy functions .
Mr Wyman also pointed out that the definition of audit fees disclosed in company accounts is narrow , so some of the consultancy fees cited in the survey could be for other , tax - related services .
Mr Quick insisted , however , that "" even if the ratio of consultancy to audit fees is only two to one , instead of three to one , the same conflict of interest arises "" .
For some firms , the ratio of consultancy to auditing fees was even higher than three to one .
The biggest , PricewaterhouseCoopers , which netted 51 % of all fees paid to auditors last year , earned only a fifth of that total by preparing firms ' statutory audits .
In some instances , auditing is only a tiny proportion of the work done by a firm 's accountant .
BT paid PwC 14 times as much in non - audit fees as in audit fees last year .
Andersen - which collapsed into Deloitte and Touche after the Enron debacle - earned 23 times as much in non - audit fees from media firm
BSkyB as in audit fees .
Consultancy has been steadily growing as a proportion of the total income for auditing firms , according to the survey - which shows that as recently as 1997 , it was worth just £ 266 m , against £ 186 m for audit work ."
2002-09-04,"Citigroup came under further pressure yesterday as investors bailed out over growing concerns over the banking group 's links to unfolding scandals at Enron and WorldCom .
The decline was triggered by Prudential Securities , which issued a "" sell "" recommendation expressing concerns about the potential liabilities faced by Citigroup .
The research note estimates that Citigroup could face a potential bill of $ 10bn ( £ 6.4bn ) from lawsuits filed by aggrieved Enron shareholders , creditors and workers .
The troubles at the bank mounted as reports in the US said an investigation led by the New York state attorney - general , Eliot Spitzer , into former star telecoms analyst Jack Grubman had been widened to include a number of other staff .
Shares in the company fell another 8 % in midday trade to $ 30.13 - they were worth $ 52 at the start of the year .
Citigroup , the largest financial services group in the US , generated record quarterly profits of $ 4bn at the end of July , but its association with high profile corporate scandals has hurt its reputation .
As well as lawsuits from Enron shareholders , Citigroup has been grilled by Congress over its ties to the bankrupt energy firm and faces further inquiries from the Federal Reserve , the securities and exchange commission and US justice department .
A decision on whether to allow the Enron lawsuits to proceed against Citigroup and other banks will be taken by Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston later this month .
Mike Mayo , an analyst at Prudential , also highlighted concerns about poor corporate governance at Citigroup and the bank 's $ 11bn of exposure to Brazil .
Many banks have exposure to one or another of the issues , he said , but "" Citigroup stands - out relatively more for having all of these issues under one roof "" .
Mr Grubman has been the focus of inquiries into the allocation of once highly prized shares in hi - tech flotations to favoured clients as part of Mr Spitzer 's wide ranging investigation into conflicts of interest on Wall Street ."
2002-09-05,"Citigroup is being hit hard by the crisis in capitalism .
With 200 m customers in six continents and 270,000 employees , the United States ' largest financial group - embracing Citibank and Diners Club - is fast becoming the symbol of everything that has gone wrong in Wall Street .
Created in a blockbuster merger four years ago , the company is at the heart of the investigations into the collapse of Enron and WorldCom .
Its reputation is on the line , demonstrated by the enormous loss of value in its share price , which has fallen 40 % this year alone amid fears about the group 's role in the scandals that are gripping corporate America .
On top of everything else , it has now suffered the unthinkable : an analyst has broken an unwritten rule on Wall Street and dared to recommend to investors that they sell the shares .
The heyday of the 1990s boom has finally caught up with the firm that is at the heart of American capitalism .
Every day seems to bring a new allegation about its conduct in the dotcom craze .
The alleged relationship between Jack Grubman - its star telecommunications analyst - and WorldCom , America 's biggest bankruptcy after the discovery of a $ 7bn accounting fraud , is mesmerising the financial community .
Even Sandy Weill , the Wall Street veteran who created Citigroup to much applause , is being drawn into the ever - widening investigations by American financial regulators looking for scalps as part of their clean - up campaign .
Mr Weill has found himself in the spotlight over suggestions that he exerted pressure on Mr Grubman to make positive recommendations on stocks in order that Citigroup could win lucrative business from clients .
Mr Weill , a member of the Wall Street establishment , has also seen attention focused on his position on the board of huge telecoms group AT&amp;T , a company which gave Citigroup business during the dotcom boom .
There are also revelations about the money made by company executives such as Bernie Ebbers , the disgraced chief of WorldCom , from shares awarded to them in stock market flotations that were conducted by Citigroup .
The allegations - which are still emerging - are strongly refuted by the firm that has tried to beat the best of America 's financial players at their own game .
The merger was the biggest of its time when it was announced in 1998 , a $ 140bn tie - up between Citicorp - already a huge banking group - and Travelers , an insurance company that had been hammered together by the deal - making Mr Weill over the previous decade .
The transaction changed the model of financial firms , uniting banking with insurance on a hitherto unseen scale .
No financial firm could surpass its ambition and , four years on , only Mizuho of Japan is larger in assets terms .
One of the crucial components of the legendary transaction was Salomon Brothers , the high octane trading outfit where the "" big swinging dick "" - a title given to glorify the most successful of the wheeler dealers - could be found .
The culture of Salomon Brothers , which had been swallowed whole by Travelers the year before its marriage with Citicorp , is forever immortalised in an unflattering book by Michael Lewis , Liar 's Poker .
This is the firm where "" one hand , one million dollars , no tears "" summed up the greed and avarice that ruled Wall Street in the 1980s .
These were the words reputedly used by the then chairman of Salomon , John Gutfreund , to goad the biggest wheeler dealer , John Meriwether , in their version of liars poker - which to ordinary Americans was a daredevil game in which players guess the serial numbers on dollar bills in return for the note .
Both men are long gone from the firm :
Mr Meriwether quit to set up the Long - Term Capital Management hedge fund that caused near chaos during the 1998 emerging markets crash and had to bailed out by Wall Street ; Mr Gutfreund became one of the casualties of the treasury bond scandal that gripped Salomon Brothers 10 years ago and again raised questions about the financial sector 's culture .
An arcane business to some , the treasury bond market is crucial to the functioning of the US economy , setting the rate at which the country borrows money to keep capitalism rolling .
A decade ago the tacit acknowledgement by Salomon that it had in effect rigged the bond market was the equivalent of the scandal that is now emerging .
It rocked the credibility of the financial markets just as the corporate accounting scandalis doing now .
That Salomon is again at the heart of the controversy - and any wrongdoing is yet to be proven - is perhaps not surprising , given its size and scale of activities .
But the reasons are very different .
Under the ownership of Citigroup , Salomon has pulled out of the more risky , controversial trading areas .
This time it is not about trading but about how Salomon behaved during the dotcom boom , notably the relationship between its analysts , such as Mr Grubman , and the clients of the investment bank , including WorldCom .
Some sector watchers believe the tight focus on the firm is unwaranted .
Ray Soifer , who runs his own consultancy firm , suspects it may also prove to be unfair . ""
The practice of analysts being involved in investment banking does not appear to have been confined to Salomon , "" Mr Soifer said .
"" I have a feeling that whatever happened at Citigroup was not unique , "" he said .
None of the big firms on Wall Street are immune from the investigations set in motion by Eliot Spitzer - the high - profile New York attorney general - and other regulators such as the powerful securities and exchange commission , which oversees financial markets ; not to mention the politicians on Capitol Hill .
Merrill Lynch , for instance , has been embarrassed by internal emails sent by its star dotcom analyst , Henry Blodget , who accepted redundancy last year .
He famously described as "" crap "" in private the stocks he was publically recommending as "" buys "" .
But it is Citigroup that is now at the centre of the Wall Street witch hunt .
Mike Mayo , the analyst at Prudential Financial who has broken ranks to recommending selling the shares , also acknowledges that Citigroup is not alone in facing up to the investigations into Enron and general corporate governance issues in the financial sector .
But in his view , "" Citigroup stands out relatively more for having all of these issues under one roof . ""
According to Mr Mayo , any successes achieved through lawsuits mounted for damages against Enron could cost Citigroup alone as much as $ 10bn .
On top of that could come any fines that might be levied by the regulators .
The financial muscle and size that Citigroup has used so effectively to its advantage in the past may prove to be its biggest handicap in the months to come - after all , the bigger the company , the greater its ability to pay ."
2002-09-10,"The long term future of British Energy and that of its 5,200 workers remained in doubt yesterday after the government handed the company a £ 410 m lifeline to keep the business going until later this month .
Shares in the UK 's largest nuclear generator , which provides one - fifth of the country 's electricity , plunged by 65 % and analysts said the whole nuclear industry might have to be restructured .
The BE crisis was given a further twist last night with reports that the administrators of Enron , the collapsed US energy trader , were creditors of the company .
Power purchase agreements from Enron 's Teesside plant , which committed BE to buying electricity at 80 % above the prevailing price , are said to have left BE with a £ 349 m liability in its accounts .
BE cited legal reasons for refusing to confirm or deny this .
Environmentalists claimed it was outrageous that taxpayers had to take on the risk of BE and its massive debts .
But trade union leaders supported the government 's decision to provide a short term loan to cover working capital requirements and cash collateral for trading in Britain and the US .
The loan is meant to keep BE afloat till September 27 , pending clarification of the group 's full financial position . ""
No decisions have been taken , and no commitments have been given , about support beyond this period , "" the Department of Trade and Industry said .
BE promised that talks on long term restructuring of the group would start soon , and confirmed that there had been no concessions yet on a reduction of business rates or other reliefs it had sought .
It warned again of a continuing threat of insolvency , saying "" the board anticipates that if these discussions are not successful the company may be unable to meet its financial obligations "" .
Faith in the company was further undermined by news that three more reactors - Heysham , Torness and Hinkley Point B , had gone off - line over the weekend , taking nearly 40 % of its generating capacity out of action .
BE insisted this was just routine maintenance , saying only the problems at Torness had been unexpected .
The government was forced to step in to ensure that BE 's 16 reactors were kept safe .
Analysts believe that concessions , such as making BE exempt from the climate change levy , will have to be made by the government if it is to save itself from having to shoulder a "" nuclear Railtrack "" .
Bryony Worthington , a nuclear campaigner at Friends of the Earth , said the bailout could not be justified .
"" It 's outrageous ; the government should have allowed BE to go into administration . ""
By contrast , John Edmonds , the general secretary of the GMB union , said : "" This is a welcome announcement to provide a short term lifeline . ""
BE shares were suspended last week ; when trading opened yesterday they plunged 84 % to 13p before ending the day down 52.75p - 65 % - at 28p ."
2002-09-10,"Patricia Hewitt warned accountants yesterday that they could face tougher regulation , as she set out the terms of reference for a review of the profession .
As the next stage of the government 's response to last year 's Enron scandal , the trade and industry secretary said she would ask for recommendations by January on whether the system for keeping accountants and auditors in check was adequate .
The DTI said that it would look at ways of simplifying regulatory arrangements , ask whether the balance between self - regulation and statutory regulation was the right one , and examine the case for an alternative approach , particularly to the regulation of auditors .
Under present arrangements - largely devised by the DTI itself - the independent Accountancy Foundation , peopled by non - accountants nominated by organisations such as the Bank of England and the TUC , sits above four separate regulatory committees , with the Institute of Chartered Accountants also playing a monitoring role .
Peter Wyman , the ICA 's president , promised yesterday that the profession would cooperate with the review , but warned the government against radical change while the present system - which has only been in place for about a year - beds down ."
2002-09-11,"In the future , historical sweeps of recent extraordinary times will probably lump the September 11 terror attacks and the bursting of the millennium bubble together - two epic , albeit unrelated events defining the early years of the new century .
They are in fact quite directly related .
The skids may have been under share prices before the twin towers collapsed ; Enron was certainly under investigation by the securities and exchange commission as early as August last year .
But without the attack on Wall Street , economists would not be talking today about the odds on the major western economies tripping into deflation , and we would not be watching insurance companies trying to repair their broken balance sheets .
As well as destroying so many lives and so much real estate , the attacks smashed confidence within the financial community .
In the days after September 11 , the whole focus was on spotting those sectors and individual companies most vulnerable .
Magnifying glasses were held up to balance sheets , looking for hidden liabilities , disguised debts or anything else that signalled a company might have trouble weathering the coming storm .
It was this attention to detail which led the market 's financial sleuths to pick Enron apart .
Thereafter it was all downhill as far as the rest of corporate America was concerned .
Sadly , one year on , there are few signs that we have stopped descending .

With the governing party trailing in the polls , Mr Malan 's brief was to reassure the markets that an opposition victory will not threaten Brazil 's IMF programme .
As Mr Malan pointed out , the leading candidate , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and the second placed Ciro Gomes have agreed to abide by the tough budget surplus requirement imposed by the IMF as a condition of its $ 30bn bailout for Brazil last month .
Lula , whose 40 % of the vote puts him in a commanding position for the first polling round , has toned down most of his fiery rhetoric and sounds positively New Labour these days .
Mr Malan 's public show of support for his opponent 's macro - economic policies underlines the fact that the market 's judgment on the election is becoming potentially more destabilising for Brazil than anything the candidates could come up with .
It also shows how circumscribed any politician is once the IMF becomes involved .
Not all the jitters over Brazil are because analysts have mistaken Lula as a reincarnation of Che Guevara .
Some at least find the sight of the IMF trying the same old failed remedies on a vulnerable economy more unnerving than the prospect of a left - wing victory .
Woolies ' thinking Retailing , the professionals insist , is just about getting the right goods on the shelves and knowing your customer .
If that is true , then Woolworths has plainly been run by rank amateurs in the past few years .
Yesterday , New chief executive Trevor Bish - Jones painted a picture of shocking incompetence - a company with 92 % full stockrooms , but gaping holes on the shelves .
All the clothing was bought before the season started , leaving no chance to react as required .
What about the Big W and Woolies buyers who acted independently , buying the same goods at different prices ?
Let 's not mention the 11 unintegrated IT systems , which made forecasting and stock control impossible .
Worst of all , surely , is that Woolies had "" no defined target customer "" and no data on the value of different customers .
Mr Bish - Jones spent just £ 100,000 to discover 29 % of customers generated 78 % of sales , while 53 % of shoppers accounted for just 9 % of sales - spending just £ 1.78 a month each .
If Mr Bish - Jones is only half right he has a big chance to make improvements .
Order of the Boots Boots yesterday announced that Ken Piggott , managing director of the group 's core retail operations and a main board member , had taken a "" lifestyle "" decision to step down from the board and would instead work two days a week on the company 's corporate social responsibility agenda .
There is nothing suspicious about his decision to go , Boots insisted .
Everything was tickety boo , it was "" Ken 's choice "" .
There is just one thing wrong with this explanation - chief executive Steve Russell 's comments on the resulting management reshuffle did not thank Mr Piggott for his services .
Indeed there was no mention of him at all .
Which is all rather odd , especially considering that Mr Piggott has been with Boots for 32 years and has held senior positions for the last 16 .
In the normal course of events even the most incompetent , fired executives get a few polite words .
We must therefore assume that either Mr Russell is a very rude man - which he is not - or there is rather more to Mr Piggott 's departure than Boots would have us believe .
We opt for the latter ."
2002-09-14,"Three face extradition Three British bankers face extradition to the United States after being indicted on £ 5 m fraud charges related to the collapse of energy trader Enron .
Gary Mulgrew , David Bermingham and Giles Darby are former employees of Greenwich NatWest , an American banking group now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland .
The three are alleged to have siphoned off cash from deals with Andrew Fastow , the former finance director of Enron , and one of the off - balance sheet vehicles he set up .
Anthrax hunter bags patent
A former laboratory equipment manufacturer in Hampshire has excited the attention of military and civil defence organisations in several countries after patenting technology that is said to kill anthrax spores .
Bioquell , which is nearing the end of a three - year exercise to transform itself into a specialist bio - decontamination business , said independent testing had demonstrated the efficacy of its technology against anthrax spores .
Bioquell chief executive Nick Adams said that on the basis of trials , the patent - protected technology could prove far cheaper and faster than toxic methods used to clean up US offices during anthrax scares last year .
In addition , the environmentally friendly process would not destroy expensive office equipment .
But Mr Adams saw greater opportunities in areas such as pharmaceuticals , biotechnology and health care .
Bioquell 's work includes trials to address antibiotic - resistant superbugs in hospitals .
The company saw pre - tax losses widen from £ 400,000 to £ 1.5 m during the six months to the end of June , reflecting increased spending on research and development .
Kirch Media bids hit target
Insolvent German group Kirch Media said yesterday the bids received in an auction of its assets had satisfied expectations and that it expected further discussions with bidders over the next two weeks . ""
The bids that have come in met our expectations fully , "" a spokesman said , but he declined to provide any details .
A final decision was likely in the first half of October .
The last round of non - binding offers indicated that KirchMedia could fetch up to € 2.6bn ( £ 1.6bn ) .

2002-09-15,"After the Enron scandal , it looked as if Clare Spottiswoode might have the Teflon coating of many modern businessmen .
Now , following the debacle at near - bankrupt British Energy , I hope she discovers what it is to be an old iron skillet .
It seemed strange that Lord Wakeham was ( rightly ) thrust into the limelight for his role as non - executive director at Enron earlier this year , while Spottiswoode , who had been senior vice - president of regulatory affairs ( ! ) in Europe for Azurix , Enron 's global water business , managed to avoid the scandal .
The point of non - execs , I thought , was to cast an experienced and dispassionate eye over the doings of directors with day - to - day control of companies , protecting shareholders , customers , employees and suppliers against wickedness and incompetence .
But not in Spottiswoode 's case .
Some might argue that she , above all , should have alerted the authorities to the problems at Enron 's subsidiary , having risen to fame in the first place as the much - praised gas industry regulator .
Instead , according to her own account , her ' serious concerns ' and subsequent resignation happened only after everyone had been scammed .
Later , Spottiswoode said she felt investors in Azurix had been ripped off at the initial public offering . '
I had serious concerns about the way it was being run , ' she said , rather grandly , last December .
The IPO was a way of offloading the Azurix investment on to other banks .
The price of the IPO was very high , and I could not see how , even if the investments were good , it could work . '
It did n't .
The shares floated at $ 19 in June 1999 and were bought back by the company in October 2000 for only $ 7 .
Well , thanks a bunch , Clare .
And so to her other incarnations .
For a while she worked at PA Consulting , from where she was drafted on to a Gordon Brown initiative called the Public Services Productivity Panel .
This panel , now chaired by Paul Boateng ( Writedown 12/07/02 ) has been very productive indeed - more than doubling in size since its inception three years ago .
She also has been advising the Government on telecoms ( over the head of the regulator ) for the past two years - perhaps the worst two years in the history of telecoms in this country .
Last year she joined the board of British Energy and was promoted to deputy chairman a few months later .
Gas and electricity are now regulated by the same organisation , Ofgem , so it was no doubt hoped that newly turned poacher
Spottiswoode would add some useful insights into dealing with the troublesome regulators .
She said after joining : ' I accepted because I think this is a company which has really serious questions about where it goes . '
Amazingly , she is still there , despite British Energy being now on the brink of bankruptcy and begging for a handout from the Chancellor ( perhaps Spotty could help out with that ) .
I ca n't help suspecting that in a few months she 'll resign because of ' suspicions ' that there was something not quite right with the company .
Sorry again , shareholders .
Last but not least , cast your mind back two years to the launch of H2go , a business initiative devised by Chris Mellor ( Writedown 28/07/02 ) of Anglian Water .
The plan was that H2go , a water and waste management operation , would capture large industrial users by undercutting its rivals .
Mellor said at the time that it could be as fundamental a development in the water industry as privatisation had been .
Spottiswoode was named chairman .
Anglian shares fell immediately and have been in decline ever since .
Unusually , given the fanfare with which H2go was launched , it is not even mentioned in this year 's annual report ( despite prestige clients such as British Energy ) , but reading between the lines it seems not to have lived up to its promise : ' We have made good progress in developing proposals for the efficient restructuring of our UK - regulated water and wastewater business .
Our intention is to proceed with these plans provided we are satisfied they are in the interests of all our stakeholders and that value for shareholders is secured .
Turnover in the UK regulated water and wastewater businesses fell to £ 696.6 m [ £ 735.5 m in 2000 ] .
Operating profits for the year were £ 283.4 m , down from last year 's £ 341.2 m . '
A leading analyst says : ' Anglian appears to have de - emphasised H2go .
Spottiswoode has gone uncharacteristically quiet on the subject . '
But go back to the annual report .
The words : ' We have made good progress in developing proposals ... ' stick in the mind .
Perhaps because it sort of sums up her last few years ."
2002-09-17,"Sir Howard Davies , chairman of the financial services authority , last night called on Brussels to adopt a lighter touch to City regulation .
Speaking at the lord mayor 's City banquet , Sir Howard said European regulators had reached a "" delicate moment "" between the "" easy win territory "" of dismantling barriers to competition and more controversial areas , such as proposed new listing rules .
Warning that he believed there were "" powerful regulatory , rather than de - regultory pressures abroad "" in the wake of the boardroom scandals at Enron and WorldCom , Sir Howard said : "" There is a serious risk of ratcheting up regulation in a way that , in my view , could have damaging consequences in the longer term . ""
Sir Howard 's line contrasted with markedly warmer comments on Europe earlier in the day from his fellow contender for the governorship of the Bank of England , Andrew Crockett , the outgoing general manager of the Bank for International Settlements .
Speaking at a London School of Economics discussion to mark the tenth anniversary of Britain 's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism , Mr Crockett insisted that joining the European single currency need not be so damaging . ""
The bad experience with exchange rate mechanism show us the weakness of a fixed exchange rate system with narrow margins .
It tells us much less about the tension that could arise in a single currency zone . ""
He said the divergences between the German and British economies which helped force the mark and the pound out of line no longer existed , and that an "" asymmetric shock "" on the scale caused by the unification of east and west Germany was unlikely to happen again .
Mr Crockett said monetary union would still be hard to achieve if sterling was overvalued .
"" The exchange rate is crucial , "" he said .
"" The dangers of too high a rate are greater than the dangers of too low a rate . ""
Sir Eddie George 's post as Bank governor becomes free next summer , and analysts said the prime minister , who will appoint his successor , would pay close attention to the candidates ' views on the single currency , with the Treasury 's five tests on euro membership also due for completion next summer .
Former monetary policy committee member Sushil Wadhwani , also participating in yesterday 's discussions at the LSE , said the Black Wednesday debacle had left the Bank unneccesarily cautious about wading into the foreign exchange markets .
"" It has left deep scars , and what that has meant is that there is a reluctance to use foreign exchange intervention as even a subsidiary policy tool . ""
He picked May 2000 , when sterling was soaring against the infant euro , as a time when he would have liked to see the MPC to use its powers to step into the markets ."
2002-09-24,"Barclays Bank could face claims for redress from Enron creditors because of its alleged role in the bankrupt energy firm 's efforts to disguise billions of dollars in debt .
A report prepared by a court - appointed examiner said a $ 168 m ( £ 100 m ) transaction that Barclays helped to arrange for Enron in the weeks before the energy group went under was , in effect , a loan so creditors who were still owed cash when Enron imploded in December might be able to make a claim for recovery of the sum .
The court appointee , US lawyer Neal Batson , said Enron sold sulphur dioxide credits to a Guernsey - registered entity , Colonnade , in September and October 2001 - the credits are tradeable permits to emit pollutants in the US .
Mr Batson describes Colonnade as a Barclays affiliate .
The credits were sold on to Barclays ' metals trading operation .
The deal was one of six outlined in an interim report on Enron 's web of special - purpose entities said to have been used to mask the true state of its balance sheet .
Mr Batson said that between 1997 and 2001 Enron raised $ 1.4bn through loans disguised as asset sales to the entities .
The transactions allegedly inflated Enron 's reported revenues , profits and cash flow .
Many of the world 's biggest financial institutions have been severely criticised by investigators for their involvement with Enron including Citigroup , JP Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch .
Mr Batson stressed that he had arrived at no conclusions .
If he determines that former Enron executives , accountants , law firms and banks were responsible for the fraud , they could also be liable for billions of dollars in lawsuits .
Barclays yesterday said the bank remained confident that any deals with Enron were carried out properly and that due diligence had been done ."
2002-10-01,"I now understand the PFI ( Trust me on funding , says Brown , September 30 ) .
If the government gets a company to build a hospital and the government borrows the money to pay for it , it goes down as capital expenditure and government borrowing and makes the bottom line look bad .
If the building company borrows the money and builds exactly the same hospital and the government rents it back at greater cost over 30 years , the cost can be hidden in the revenue account and it 's no problem .
This puts me in mind of the accounting policies of WorldCom and Enron and if continued will surely have the same effect in 15 years ' time , when a substantial portion of NHS funding goes on paying the expensive rent .
It is surely very simple .
If the country can afford to service the debt to the private sector , it can afford to service the debt in the public sector where the interest rate will be less .
David Lynch Wantage , Oxon
The prime minister and the chancellor are right to be wary of borrowing , but they ignore the long - standing arguments that PFI will actually cost the taxpayer far more than public investment from taxation or bonds .
They consequently fail to deal with the need for properly progressive taxation for the well - off .
They miss the point that while parts of the public sector could be better managed , this could be dealt with by bringing in fixed term and sackable senior managers if needed and does not require that the whole project be done in private hands .
Considering the outcomes of previous PFI schemes ( remember the passport agency , the national air traffic control , the Channel tunnel rail link fiascos ? )
perhaps it is a little foolish of Gordon Brown to ask us to trust him on this issue .
Dr Molly Scott Cato Green party economy spokesperson Digby Jones promotes the need of CBI members to maximise profits from PFI schemes ( Union Canutes can not halt PFI tide , September 30 ) .
He would , would n't he ?
But in comparing unions to Canute , he perpetuates the widely held mistake that the king tried to turn back the tide .
I was taught that Canute demonstrated to his courtiers that he was n't all powerful - and could n't turn back the tide .
So if anyone deserves to be called a latter day Canute , perhaps it should be Gordon Brown ?
Peter Stevens Bristol Roy Hattersley attacks the Fabian Society , and me personally , for publishing Tony Blair 's pamphlet on public services ( Private obsession , public grief , September 30 ) .
As a long - standing Fabian member he ought to be aware that the role of the society is to stimulate debate on the key issues facing Labour and the left .
As many of our other recent pamphlets demonstrate , we publish arguments from all shades of progressive opinion , including trenchant criticisms of the government .
Is the former deputy leader of the Labour party really arguing that the views of the current leader and prime minister are neither relevant nor of interest to the Labour movement ?
In disagreeing with the arguments of the pamphlet , Roy 's article furthers the debate .
That 's our purpose .

2002-10-03,"Federal prosecutors in the US yesterday made significant breakthroughs in attempts to clean up corporate America , filing charges against the highest ranking Enron executive yet and gaining a key witness in the case against Martha Stewart .
Andrew Fastow , the former chief financial officer of Enron , surrendered to authorities early yesterday morning before being taken in handcuffs to a Houston court .
He was charged with three counts of fraud , money laundering and conspiracy at the energy firm , which went bankrupt last year costing investors billions of dollars .
He could face 45 years in prison .
Enron was the first in a wave of corporate scandals that has shocked the US .
But the complex nature of the alleged fraud , using offshore entities to make Enron appear profitable and line the pockets of senior executives , has slowed the progress of investigators .
Michael Kopper , Mr Fastow 's former right hand man , struck a deal with prosecutors in August .
Prosecutors said Mr Fastow is not cooperating .
Fastow and co - conspirators are charged with creating a scheme to defraud Enron and its shareholders by hiding $ 1bn ( £ 638 m ) of debt .
The charges do not give any other names - former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay , a friend of President Bush , was notably absent .
US officials are seeking the forfeiture of $ 37 m that Mr Fastow is claimed to have pocketed from illegal activities .
Larry Thompson , the deputy attorney - general said : "" Our strategy is simple .
We aim to put the bad guys in prison and take away their money . ""
The securities and exchange commission also filed charges against Mr Fastow , 40 , seeking to permanently bar him from acting as a director of a public company .
There was further bad news for Enron 's former top executives when a bankruptcy court yesterday gave the go - ahead for creditors to launch lawsuits against them .
The justice department is also seeking the extradition from Britain of three bankers formerly of Greenwich NatWest who were indicted last month charging them with wire fraud in relation to Enron .
The insider dealing case against Ms Stewart , the celebrity businesswoman who runs a media and homewares company , appeared to have reached a turning point .
Douglas Faneuil , the assistant to her Merrill Lynch broker , pleaded guilty in a Manhattan courthouse and is expected to testify against Ms Stewart .
The businesswoman , who hosts cooking and DIY shows , sold nearly 4,000 shares in the drugs company ImClone last December ahead of a key product being rejected by regulators .
Mr Faneuil , 26 , was allegedly offered an extra week holiday and a plane ticket to wherever he wanted to stay quiet .
The assistant was charged with a misdemeanor for not coming forward with his evidence earlier .
He claims that his boss , Peter Bacanovic , ordered him to tell Ms Stewart that family members of ImClone chief executive Sam Waksal were selling shares .
A lawyer for Mr Faneuil said : "" Nine months ago Doug Faneuil found himself in a very difficult situation .
It was thrust upon him .
He is a young man who had the guts and courage to come forward . """
2002-10-03,"Dame Marjorie Scardino , the high - flying chief executive of media giant Pearson , has accused journalists of failing to work hard enough to "" ferret out "" stories .
In the wake of global business scandals such as Enron , Dame Marjorie said business journalists , including those on the Pearson - owned Financial Times , often missed important stories .
"" I do think the business press - and I include the FT in this - has not worked hard enough to ferret out these stories , "" she said .
"" If journalists were better at reading balance sheets , some of these things would be discovered sooner .
We could have done a lot more digging .
But business journalists often do n't know a lot about business .
It 's a shame , but that 's the case , "" she told the Royal Society of Arts Journal .
Her remarks echoed the words of former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert , who , following the WorldCom and Enron fiascos , asked a seminar at London 's City University : "" Where were the media while all these scandals were brewing "" .
Dame Marjorie also questioned the tendency of business journalists to focus on the personality of chief executives .
"" I think it 's unfortunate
but it 's probably inevitable .
But you know , Pearson is n't me ; it 's all these 30,000 people who do have a particular kind of character , particular values . ""
However , she admitted : "" You could , I suppose , if you were a hardworking journalist , write a piece about the top 15 people at Pearson , but it would n't have that kind of prurient quality .
I guess that 's the reason you get paid more , because you have the personal risk all the time . ""
The business press has often highlighted Ms Scardino 's gender , a focus she found "" irritating "" when Pearson recently appointed a woman , Rona Fairhead , as chief financial officer .
"" There was a piece in the Telegraph that said ' the only good figures today at the Pearson results were the CEO 's and the CFO 's . '
Stuff like that , but you know that 's just poor taste .
"" My mother said you should feel glad they did n't say ' there were no good figures at the Pearson results ' .
But it 's irritating -
it 's not about Pearson "" .
Dame Marjorie also admitted the company 's accounting has been "" complicated "" , contributing to a drop in share price from nearly £ 20 to around £ 5 .
"" We 've had complicated accounts because we had a lot of disposals and acquisitions , a lot of ins and outs , and I think we 've confused investors with our accounts .
"" I think they 're frightened , and anything that worries them can cause them a flurry of concern . ""
Her comments came in an interview with Stefan Stern for the 150th anniversary issue of the RSA Journal , the magazine of the Royal Society of Arts , which is being produced for the first time by contract publisher Redwood ."
2002-10-04,""" Non - executive directors ca n't be policemen , "" the CBI insisted recently , brushing off anxiety about their effectiveness in the wake of the Enron scandal .
But the Guardian survey reveals that the best - paid non - executives take home fees that the average policeman can only dream of .
The average pay for a non - executive director is around £ 30,000 a year ; for that they will be expected to turn up for monthly board meetings .
Those who take on extra responsibilities might be paid an additional £ 15,000 a year .
They monitor the executives on behalf of the shareholders and in an ideal world should be independent .
But many former executives appear to be awarded non - executive positions as a reward for long service .
At the top of the non - executive pile is Dr Francesco Bellini , of Shire Pharmaceuticals , who was awarded almost £ 3 m for "" loss of office "" when Shire gobbled up BioChem , of which he was chief executive , last year .
Now a non - executive director , Mr Bellini 's base salary of £ 219,420 for the year was topped up by more than £ 16 m in exercised share options , from his days as an executive .
Financial services firms , especially those going through a tricky merger , are a particularly good bet for those hoping to earn a hefty fee .
Take George Paul , chairman of Norwich Union from 1994 until its merger with Commercial Union and General Accident to create CGNU - now renamed Aviva .
Mr Paul is now non - executive deputy chairman of the post - merger firm , where he is paid £ 160,000 a year .
The fee , an Aviva spokesman explained , reflects his chairmanship of the remuneration committee , and membership of the audit committee .
Holding a handful of non - executive directorships also helps .
Sir Bob Reid , 67 , former chairman of British Rail , took home £ 128,000 last year for his non - executive directorship of HBOS - the bank formed out of the marriage of Halifax and Bank of Scotland .
He also holds four other non - executive directorships , along with chairmanships at the engineering firm Sondex Ltd , and the International Petroleum Exchange of London .
Persuading directors to stick around through corporate upheaval is another common justification for a generous fee package .
A clutch of non - executives were kept on board when Glaxo merged with Smithkline Beecham two years ago .
Non - executive chairman Sir Roger Hurn , 64 , who was forced to resign from drowning telecoms company Marconi last September , was singled out for criticism at GlaxoSmithkline 's annual meeting this year .
One shareholder bemoaned the large number of non - executives , and added that "" one or two of them have proved not to be dreadfully good at running their own businesses . ""
Sir Roger , who is the deputy chairman of GSK 's unusually large board - now slimmed down to 12 , of whom eight are non - executives - netted £ 135,000 for his trouble last year .
His colleague on the board and fellow deputy chairman , Sir Peter Walters , who has since resigned , also pocketed £ 135,000 ."
2002-10-08,"Trade secretary Patricia Hewitt will today make a stinging attack on new US legislation designed to ensure there is never another financial scandal like Enron or WorldCom .
Ms Hewitt is expected to tell a meeting of the 100 Group of financial directors from FTSE companies that the US Sarbanes - Oxley Act was a knee - jerk reaction and its impact on non - US firms had not been properly thought through .
"" It is an example of legislating in haste and repenting at leisure , "" said a source close to Ms Hewitt .
The Sarbanes - Oxley Act , masterminded by Maryland senator Paul Sarbanes and congressman Michael Oxley , was rushed through the legislative process and signed off by George Bush on July 30 .
The president described it as "" the most far - reaching reform of American business practice since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt "" .
It applies not just to American business but to non - US companies which have securities traded on the New York stock exchange or Nasdaq , or have corporate bonds that could be held by the US public .
The securities and exchange commission has "" exemptive powers "" that could reduce the burden on non - US firms , but so far , despite pressure from Whitehall and the European Union , no exemptions have been agreed .
There is political pressure on the SEC to maintain its tough approach .
In addition to today 's "" tough words "" , Ms Hewitt will make a direct plea to US commerce secretary Don Evans later this week and another UK minister , economic secretary Melanie Johnson , meets SEC chairman Harvey Pitt next week to press the case for exemptions .
Ms Hewitt will also announce a consultative document to review the future of the Accountancy Foundation , which was set up by the accountancy profession to fight fraud .
Ms Hewitt will say that she accepts the reasoning behind Sarbanes - Oxley and that it was necessary to push through a strong message to shore up investor confidence .
But she believes it was done with little thought to the international repercussions and that a number of general and partial exemptions are justified because of the stricter regulatory environment in Britain .
She is going into battle on behalf of groups such as the CBI and the UK Institute of Chartered Accountants , which fear a takeover by American regulators .
A survey by Parson Consulting found that 58 of the FTSE 100 firms fail to comply with Sarbanes - Oxley requirements .
The act calls for chief executives and finance directors to provide sworn statements that their accounts are fair and honest and includes rules on financial reporting and disclosure , corporate governance , and defines the role of the accounting profession .
Anyone shredding documents that could aid an investigation faces a 20-year jail term ."
2002-10-08,"The US securities and exchange commission chief last night hit back at senate claims that it had gone to sleep on the job of regulating the failed energy trader Enron .
Sensitised by impending congressional elections , Harvey Pitt , chairman of the market regulator , cancelled a speaking engagement in London and hit back at a critical senate report on the agency 's handling of the Enron scandal .
Arguing that alleged accounting scams at the company predated his tenure at the SEC by at least nine years , Mr Pitt said : "" Since I have taken on the leadership of the commission , we have been working hard to fix the problems that have created the current crisis of confidence , and we have been making enormous strides to correct mistakes and abuses of the past . ""
A crucial part of the SEC 's effort , the creation of an accounting oversight board , has been hampered by lobbying against the appointment of pension fund chief John Biggs to head the new body .
A senate committee yesterday accused the SEC of "" systemic and catastrophic failure "" in regulation of Enron .
The 127-page report claimed that the watchdog failed to detect dubious practices at the energy trader and had not in spected any of its annual reports since 1997 .
The report said the SEC did not notice other corporate scandals because it was not looking for them . ""
Investors [ in Enron ] were left defenceless , "" committee chairman Joseph Lieberman and senior Republican Fred Thompson said in the letter to Mr Pitt .
The SEC chief said the alleged warning signs appeared before he took over in 2000 ."
2002-10-10,"President George Bush was yesterday laid open to further allegations of hypocrisy in his condemnation of the aggressive business practices of the 1990s when more details of his own dealings were published .
Harken Energy , the oil and gas company behind the US president 's wealth , used an off balance sheet entity to move poorly performing assets and debts off its books , according to a report which draws comparisons with Enron .
The off balance sheet entity , a partnership with the investment arm of Harvard University , was formed in 1990 at a critical time for the company 's finances .
HarvardWatch , an alumni and student group which monitors the university 's investments , likened the venture to those used at the disgraced energy firm Enron to disguise debts before it collapsed .
Mr Bush was a director at Harken from 1986 to 1993 and at the time in question was a $ 100,000 a year consultant .
Minutes show that he personally approved the deal . ""
The partnership bears strong resemblance to the widely - condemned Enron partnerships , controlled by insiders and disguising the dismal prospects of the company , "" the watchdog said .
The venture enabled Harken to shift $ 20 m ( £ 13.1 m ) in debt and liabilities off the balance sheet .
Harvard 's venture capital division , Aeneas , contributed $ 64.5 m of drilling assets to the partnership .
In return Harken received a much - needed injection of cash - $ 100,000 a month in management fees , and drilling and services fees of more than $ 3 m in the first year .
The deals were disclosed at the time to the US regulator , the securities and exchange commission and complied with accounting rules .
It is the kind of aggressive financial engineering that the president has strongly criticised .
Over the summer political rivals made capital of a 1991 insider dealing investigation into the future president by the SEC .
Mr Bush sold 212,140 shares for $ 849,000 two months before the company reported a $ 23.2 m quarterly loss but the SEC closed the case without taking action .
The White House dismissed any hint of wrongdoing .
A spokesman said : "" Independent reports note that [ the partnership ] complied with accounting rules , so there is no comparison with Enron . ""
There were also reports yesterday that New York prosecutors are considering criminal charges against auditors at PricewaterhouseCoopers who failed to report the alleged looting of Tyco by its former chief executive officer , Dennis Kozlowski ."
2002-10-11,"It begins to become interesting to see where the investigators and prosecutors will draw the line in their interrogations of corporate America .
The temptation is to use certain figures as examples to the rest .
Take the case of Arthur Andersen , the hapless accounting firm that had the misfortune to be the auditor for Enron , the disgraced Houston - based energy business .
The government rushed to indict the entire firm for obstruction of justice , accusing it of shredding "" literally tons "" of documents to keep them from the hands of investigators .
The result ?
A dubious conviction , the firm loses its licence and the big five becomes the big four .
Yet Andersen is not the only one of the accounting firms to have been involved in audits of scandal - struck companies .
PricewaterhouseCoopers was responsible for auditing Tyco , where senior executives have been accused of "" looting "" the conglomerate for their own gain .
But the mood among prosecutors here is very different .
The offices of the Manhattan district attorney are considering criminal charges against a number of the auditors but not against the firm itself .
There is clearly no political appetite to reduce the big four to the big three , with the accompanying outcries from people losing jobs and from investors losing confidence in the system altogether .
But it may be difficult to close this Pandora 's box .
The more that is uncovered of corporate America and particularly Wall Street 's ways of doing business during the 1990s , the more rife the corruption and sheer recklessness becomes apparent .
When everyone was getting rich , clearly no one cared .
Now that Wall Street is moving toward its third consecutive year of losses and the Dow Jones index is hitting five - year lows things are different .
At Citigroup , the focus has been on a single analyst , Jack Grubman , who has been vilified for helping to build the stock market bubble with his over - enthusiastic backing of telecoms companies .
As an analyst , his advice to investors was supposed to be independent .
But he stands accused of ramping stocks that were in reality in a precarious position in order to persuade those companies to give the group their investment banking business .
Mr Grubman , who had earned $ 20 m ( £ 12.8 m ) a year , left the bank in August with a $ 32 m payoff .
Citigroup would clearly like that to be the end of the matter .
But it is n't .
Mr Grubman , despite his handsome payoff does n't like the idea that he is the focus of attention .
His lawyer this week promised that would be happy to show how "" Jack was part of a bigger problem "" .
He hardly needs to .
Some of the internal emails that have been published by the New York state attorney - general , Eliot Spitzer , in a separate lawsuit make it clear that Mr Grubman did not act alone .
Rather that , as he maintains , he was operating within the rules of the prevailing culture .
The culture of ramping that has emerged from the fabric of Wall Street is now acknowledged to have played a significant role in the destructive boom and bust that is now coming back to haunt the banks .
In the telecoms sector for instance , the banks used loans to companies as "" loss leaders "" - a means of securing other investment banking business and fees .
That helped to increase the capital investment in networks way beyond the actual levels of demand - according to estimates , more than 95 % of the broadband capacity in the ground is unused .
This is not the fault of one man , or even one company , but the result of the extraordinary times that encouraged so many to overstep the line .
Many of the current conflicts are put down to the deregulation of the banking sector , which allowed US financial institutions to forge huge conglomerates during the 1990s offering everything from credit to fund management , analysis and investment banking .
The result of current events may be a sharp reversal .
Citigroup has offered to split research from investment banking entirely .
To adopt a phrase commonly used in the US , investigators and regulators also clearly feel the need to move towards "" closure "" in the scandals with enough of the system still standing to allow the economy to get back on its feet .
How far can the investigators continue to unearth wrongdoing on Wall Street in the name of the small investor ?
As long as scandal is in the headlines , the small investor is not benefiting in any material way as share prices continue to tumble .
The "" perp walks "" - when criminals are displayed in handcuffs for the camera - of white collar criminals are intended to restore some confidence .
But how many fresh scandals can anyone stomach ?
That need for some form of closure was evidenced when a week ago , many of the chief prosecutors in the Wall Street scandals came together to agree to pool their interests and attempt to achieve some form of global settlement instead of the death by a thousand cuts .
The agreement was between the New York Stock Exchange , Mr Spitzer 's office , the securities and exchange commission , the National Association of Securities Dealers and others .
Keeping a lid on the scandals might not be entirely in their own hands , however .
They can not control Congress .
And the prosecutions are now being used as the basis for a swelling number of lawsuits from individual investors that could be a dark cloud over Wall Street for a long time to come and cause more companies to fall than the few examples that officials would like ."
2002-10-12,"Abbey National last night filed an $ 80 m lawsuit against seven Wall Street banks to recover losses related to failed US energy trader Enron .
The suit filed in a Manhattan court claims the banks , including Credit Suisse First Boston and JP Morgan Chase , were aware that Enron 's books were fraudulent when a unit of Abbey invested in notes issued by two separate subsidiaries of the energy firm .
The banks have faced large class action lawsuits from shareholders because of their role in the Enron debacle , but this is one of the first large institutions to fix its sights on Wall Street .
In the suit , Abbey contends that the bankrupt energy company had the ultimate responsibility for repaying debt incurred by two of its entities : Marlin Water Trust II and Marlin Water Capital Corporation II .
Abbey alleges the banks that underwrote the bond offerings related to the entities knew that Enron 's accounting was questionable , and should therefore be responsible for the debt . ""
The defendants intentionally or recklessly omitted to disclose "" what they knew about Enron 's condition , the lawsuit claims .
The other banks named in the action are Deustche Bank , Bank of America , Canadian Imperial bank of Commerce , Dresdner Bank and ABN Amro .
Victoria Harmon , a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse First Boston , declined to comment ; she said the bank was aware the suit had been filed but had not yet had a chance to review the contents .
The banks that helped to structure many of the arcane deals and off - balance sheet entities that ultimately helped to mask Enron 's massive debt load are coming under intense pressure , not only from a mountain of lawsuits but also from the threat of investigations by Congress and the US justice department .
Three former Greenwich NatWest workers have already been indicted for their part in Enron 's offshore entities ."
2002-10-15,"A powerful group of shareholders is calling for the establishment of tough new audit committees made up of completely independent non - executive directors to police corporate accounts in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
The group , co - ordinated by Schroders , wants the independence of the audit committees guaranteed and members to have unrestricted access to documents and information from internal and external auditors .
They would be able to call upon any employee to give evidence to them but will ban senior executives from attending meetings except by invitation .
The proposals are being circulated by Schroders , which controls investments worth more than £ 100bn , among 19 other leading fund management groups and five leading pension funds with assets totalling hundreds of billions of pounds .
The move comes amid growing speculation about the outcome of the Higgs review of the overall role of non - executive directors .
Derek Higgs , a former merchant banker , was commissioned by trade secretary Patricia Hewitt to consider a range of changes demanded by investors , companies and lobby groups .
The suggestions include a clearer definition of what constitutes independence , a ban on executives combining the roles of chairman and chief executive , and demands for a strict limit on the number of posts any one director may accept .
A report in yesterday 's Financial Times said the Department of Trade and Industry has already ruled out putting a limit on the number of board seats an individual is allowed to hold , effectively emasculating the Higgs review .
If true , the move will be hailed as a victory for lobbying by the CBI and the Institute of Directors , which have argued against prescribed limits on non - executive directorships .
Yesterday the DTI said there would be no announcements ahead of publication of the Higgs review in late December ."
2002-10-18,"Enron trader 's admission A former top Enron energy trader is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to commit fraud in the alleged ramping of electricity prices during the California energy crisis that led to blackouts in 2000 and 2001 .
Timothy Belden , who was employed as head of the West Power Trading Division of Enron , was due to make the plea in a San Francisco court yesterday .
In August the federal energy regulatory commission in the US launched a formal investigation into allegations that Enron and two other companies used trading schemes to deliberately inflate the price of wholesale electricity .
California officials have demanded that Enron and more than a dozen power suppliers refund nearly $ 9bn ( £ 5.8bn ) gained from overcharging .
The plea is the latest alleged corruption to emerge since Enron went bankrupt last year after the discovery that the company had masked billions of dollars in debts .
Success for Pru 's US push Insurer Prudential revealed that strong sales in the US and Asia helped to offset a sharp fall in Britain .
The figures mean almost 75 % of Prudential 's business comes from outside the UK .
The new business figures were better than some analysts expected , helping to lift the shares 8 % to 467p , but they failed to dampen speculation in some quarters that Prudential may cut its final dividend or join the queue of battered life companies seeking cash to restore their balance sheets .
Total British insurance sales in the third quarter of 2002 were £ 166 m , down 17 % on the £ 199 m achieved in the same quarter in 2001 .
Among the products that have suffered are the Prudence Bond with - profits bond .
US sales jumped 35 % and those in Asia were 16 % higher .
The Pru has embarked on a £ 20 m advertising campaign and internal revamp in Britain .
Body Shop sees UK uplift Body Shop has found the going tough so far this year but new management , installed eight months ago , is still looking for an overall improvement in profits . Pre - tax profits declined from £ 3 m to £ 2.5 m in the six months to August , when like - for - like store sales were 1 % down on the same period a year ago .
But the company , which is heavily dependent on the Christmas trading period , has seen a 3 % uplift since the second half began , reflecting "" much better "" trading in Britain .
Conditions in the US remain difficult .
Delta cuts 8,000 jobs Delta Air Lines , the third largest carrier in the US , said it would cut up to 8,000 jobs , 11 % of the workforce , in response to dismal conditions in the commercial airline industry .
The Atlanta company reported a third quarter loss of $ 326 m this week and deferred delivery of new planes for two years to conserve cash .
It has already shed 7,000 jobs since the September 11 terrorist attacks ."
2002-10-26,"Sanford Weill , chairman of the financial services behemoth Citigroup , has n't said much since Wall Street was engulfed by scandal more than a year ago .
The firm , after all , has been knee deep in trouble , with loans to Worldcom and highly problematic investment research from its Salomon Smith Barney arm , yet Weill 's most striking comment , late last July , was that he 'd wished he 'd ' never heard of Enron ' .
Last week , the crusading New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer put an end to that by inviting Weill in to discuss the multiple investigations into research practices at the financial giant .
The Wall Street Journal said Spitzer was considering legal action against Weill .
It was announced that Weill had retained a legal team and would be willing to provide information .
For his part , Spitzer said Weill was not himself a target of a criminal probe .
At least not yet .
It was hard to miss the point : investigators are probing deeper into Wall Street , and not even its fattest of cats , nor its biggest banks , could be considered safe .
Central to Spitzer 's interest in Citigroup 's chairman is the role he may have played in Salomon Smith Barney 's initial public offering of the AT&amp;T Wireless arm in 1999 .
Weill - it has been alleged - prodd ed Jack Grubman , then the firm 's star telecom analyst , into changing his assessment from a ' hold ' to the equivalent of a ' strong buy ' .
A few months later ( after SSB had won the underwriting account , and $ 45 million for the work )
Grubman downgraded the stock .
Grubman , who resigned from SSB in August and is said to be co - operating with the investigations , later handed over a letter he wrote to Weill apologising that he had omitted AT&amp;T , a Salomon banking client , from a list of the top telecom players of the future .
Investigators have been keen to note that Michael Armstrong , AT&amp;T 's chief executive , is not only a friend of Weill but a longtime Citigroup board member ; Weill is a board member of AT&amp;T. Last week , Weill reiterated his claim that he ' never told any analyst what to write ' , and that his conduct has been ' entirely lawful ' .
Nevertheless , Spitzer 's investigators have floated the idea that Weill 's interests and those of Citigroup may now be diverging - a notion Weill 's attorneys have dismissed as ' outrageous speculation ' .
To some , Spitzer 's interest in Weill is not in itself problematic : it is merely a method to win a considerable settlement from Citigroup and ultimately force Wall Street banks and brokerage houses to divest themselves of their research arms , a proposition that they are resisting .
Regulators no longer believe a partial separation between investment banking and research , offered as settlement by Salomon and others , is enough to restore confidence .
But against the power of the investment houses and fund managers , the idea of a complete separation has yet to win favour .
Earlier this month , Goldman Sachs ' chief executive Henry Paulson sought to shift the blame from analysts to corporate executives , saying they put ' relentless and sometimes intense ' pressure on analysts to produce favourable reports .
The firm has also announced a cosmetic reform , changing the rating system of ' buy ' , ' hold ' and ' sell ' to ' outperform ' , ' in - line ' and ' underperform ' .
On Thursday , regulators and top securities firms met to discuss restructuring the relationship between investment and research , possibly by creating an oversight board to fund research to be used by major brokerage firms .
Already , the combined forces of Spitzer and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Harvey Pitt have said they 'll work together to create a single plan to combat abuses involving analysts ' conflicts and allocations of new stock issues .
But Spitzer 's aggressive lead in forcing Wall Street reforms is problematic for the SEC and Pitt .
Pitt believes Spitzer , as a state prosecutor , is encroaching on his turf ; Spitzer believes the SEC has been negligent in going after the analysts .
But as investigators focus on the higher echelons of Wall Street , few expect a quick resolution .
For regulatory muscle , Spitzer has dusted off the 1921 Martin Act , a law barring fraud in the sale or offering of securities , to restructure the way the investment banks and brokerage houses conduct business and to bring fraud cases , notably against former Tyco chief executive Dennis Kozlowski .
Weill 's willingness to speak to Spitzer has been interpreted as an indication of his commitment to resolve issues raised by the probes .
Weill is , after all , a corporate titan bar none .
The 68-year - old New Yorker was a leading architect of the massive finance mergers of the Nineties .
In 1998 he capped his career by merging the insurance giant Traveler 's Group with Citicorp in a $ 70 billion deal that created the world 's largest financial services company .
Wall Street faces an inspired opponent in Spitzer , however .
The son of a property tycoon , and a graduate of Princeton and Harvard , he is a tireless reformer .
Even if Weill escapes with nothing worse than a singed reputation , Spitzer 's interest in him signals that the most respectable executives are far from immune from the shakedown and , possibly , criminal investigation ."
2002-10-29,"Lawyers looked to be one of the few commercial professions to somehow avoid the fallout from Enron and other recent US corporate scandals .
Until this weekend , that is , when an internal memo from Clifford Chance surfaced , detailing suggestions from disgruntled junior lawyers that some of their colleagues in America might be "" padding "" the billable hours of work charged to clients .
Now , no one who has had even the most cursory brush with the legal profession would be surprised for a moment that some lawyers inflate their fees unfairly .
The needless expansion of legal work to fill both time and budget is a standing joke in the business world .
But the devil is in the Clifford Chance detail .
The leaked memo runs to more than 5,000 words and details the grievances of a number of Clifford Chance associates , namely lawyers still working to become partners .
Crucially , it discloses that associates each have a target of billing 2,420 hours to clients each year .
Assuming four weeks holiday , that averages out at just over 50 hours per week per lawyer .
Even factoring in the allegedly macho working culture among corporate lawyers - with the early starts , late finishes , and the work taken home at weekends , - it remains quite absurd that any professional could consistently concentrate on specific client work for such a period , each and every week .
Lawyers eat food at lunchtimes , some go to the gym , they walk to the coffee machine near the lift , they fart around on the internet sending emails , and they chat to their colleagues occasionally about nothing in particular .
In short , on some levels at least , lawyers behave like office workers across the world .
They do human things , which do n't add up to a stroke of "" billable client hours "" .
Unless , of course , they lie .
The Clifford Chance memo does not go this far .
It simply , but damagingly , reveals that its lawyers are motivated by volume rather than quality .
If the complainants are accurate , the firm 's entire culture appears to rest on hitting clients for the maximum amount of money , while working their juniors to the bone .
And the targeted internal return is such that most of the firm 's lawyers must be too tired to think , never mind advise .
That alone should be enough for many of its existing clients to start demanding a refund .
Clifford Chance is the biggest law firm in the world .
It is a fair bet now that it will not be so for long .

Billing : £ 30.83 Regressive With minimal fanfare , the London Stock Exchange launched a new market here yesterday in the form of "" covered warrants "" - derivatives which are rather like long - term stock options , giving the holder the right to buy or sell shares or stock indices at a particular price at or before a particular time .
Embarrassingly , the launch had already been put back by a couple of months after somebody at the exchange noticed that no one had bothered to check with the Inland Revenue that this new way of speculating in equities would be exempt from stamp duty .
However , with all the right boxes finally ticked , warrants over 160 individual stocks and indices , such as the FTSE 100 , were rolled out .
Scores more should follow over the coming weeks .
Of course , the idea of issuing stock warrants is not new ; one variant , Japanese warrants , caused a major invest ment scandal in the late 1980s .
But the new London warrants will be formally listed by the exchange and are being offered by a number of top drawer investment banks , including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs .
It will be interesting to see whether they take off .
The derivative gives an investor leveraged exposure to a stock or index , meaning he or she can make a much bigger percentage gain on their investment rather than by simply buying or selling the underlying security .
At the same time , an investor loses money quicker if the price moves against them as the ratchet works in the opposite direction .
These instruments are not for the faint - hearted .
Covered warrants are already popular across continental Europe and the exchange assumes they will become so over here .
But then the continental Europeans do not have a roaring , financial spread - betting industry as Britain does , with its near - tax free status , nor the sort of easy access to contracts for difference ( another derivative which gives leveraged exposure and avoids stamp duty ) .
But what yesterday 's launch does highlight once again is how stamp duty is fast becoming a voluntary tax in Britain for everyone other than old - fashioned pension funds or ordinary amateur investors who are unaware that it can be avoided so easily .
The financial industry constantly harangues the Treasury on the matter , saying that stamp duty damages the City of London 's competitive edge and raises companies ' cost of capital - arguing that it should therefore be abolished .
But they never seem to make the obvious and powerful point that stamp duty is a regressive tax , which hits poorer investors rather than rich speculators .
It is time the issue was addressed ."
2002-11-01,"Harvey Pitt , the chairman of the US securities and exchange commission - America 's financial watchdog - has made a complete hash of appointing the head of a new accountancy industry oversight board .
The board was supposed to be a cornerstone of efforts to restore public confidence in Wall Street and corporate America , after a plethora of scandals stretching from Enron to WorldCom .
In a 3 - 2 vote last Friday , the SEC decided to pick William Webster ( the former head of the CIA and the FBI ) over much more qualified candidates ; notably John Biggs , the outgoing head of TIAA - Cref , one of America 's biggest pension funds .
Mr Pitt , who voted in favour of Mr Webster , denies bowing to pressure from the accountancy industry to keep the job away from someone who might come down hard on the industry 's shortcomings .
But few people take these denials seriously , especially now that Mr Pitt 's credibility has sunk to a new low after the fiasco over Mr Webster 's appointment .
Mr Pitt neglected to tell his fellow commissioners that Mr Webster had been head of the audit committee of US Technologies , which is being sued by investors who claim that management defrauded them of millions .
Investors are furious that US Technologies ' audit committee fired an outside auditor when it raised concerns about the financial controls .
Mr Pitt now finds himself in the ludicrous position of having to request the SEC inspector general to investigate Mr Webster 's appointment .
The congressional watchdog , the general accounting office , will also conduct an investigation , and Senator Paul Sarbanes , the Maryland Democrat who co - authored the legislation that created the new accounting board , said he would hold hearings on the matter when Congress returned next month .
The debacle of Mr Webster 's appointment would be laughable if it did not have such serious implications .
Millions of investors lost money in the scandals that blighted Wall Street , while Mr Pitt 's ineptitude only reinforces the Bush administration 's reputation for economic incompetence .
On corporate sleaze , Republicans assert that the scandals took root under the Clinton administration .
They have a point , but they neglect to mention that it was the Republican - controlled Congress that did so much to strip away the power of regulators to prevent financial skulduggery .
However the ructions at the SEC are unlikely to make waves in the last few days before next week 's midterm elections , which could see the Republican White House win control of the Senate as well as extend the Republicans ' slim majority in the House .
But that is because President George Bush , who has campaigned virtually non - stop in the past month , has been allowed by the Democrats to dictate the agenda .
Mr Bush has managed to keep the focus firmly on his war against terror and Iraq to deflect public attention from a weak economy , rising job insecurity , a growing budget deficit and corporate sleaze .

2002-11-05,"By mid-1999 Enron had a sticky finance problem .
A year earlier , the company had invested $ 10 m ( £ 6.4 m ) in a fledgling internet service provider called Rhythms NetConnections .
In early 1999 , Rhythms had gone public and the internet bubble had sent its stock into the stratosphere .
On the first day of trading , the company 's stock closed at $ 69 .
Suddenly , Enron 's share in the company was worth about $ 300 m .
But Enron could n't sell it .
Under the terms of its original investment , Enron had agreed to hold the shares until the end of 1999 .
After thinking about the matter for some time , Andy Fastow , Enron 's cocky young chief financial officer , came up with a convoluted plan to help Enron preserve the value of its Rhythms NetConnections investment .
The plan would be executed by a new limited partnership called LJM Cayman , LP , which would be controlled by Fastow .
The name had Fastow 's personal stamp on it , created from the initials of Fastow 's wife , Lea , and the couple 's two children .
LJM1 would function as a parking lot for Enron , a place where the company could stow and retrieve assets .
Those assets would be hidden from Wall Street and small investors because LJM would not be owned by Enron .
Therefore , all of LJM1 's functions and assets would be separate from Enron 's balance sheet .
Unlike an earlier off - balance - sheet deal , Whitewing , LJM1 would be controlled by an Enron insider , Fastow .
On June 18 , 1999 , Fastow met with chairman Ken Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling .
He proposed to create LJM1 with an investment of $ 1 m of his own money and $ 15 m from two limited partners .
Additional capital for the new entity would come from Enron , which would invest 3.4 m shares of restricted stock in LJM1 .
Lay and Skilling apparently thought Fastow 's idea was a good one , even though on the surface it appeared that LJM1 failed to meet the test for off - the - balance - sheet deals .
LJM1 was going to be used to move debts and risky investments ( including Rhythms ) off Enron 's balance sheet .
But to do that , LJM1 had to satisfy three requirements : · At least 3 % of the equity had to come from outside ( that is , non - Enron ) investors .
· The entity could not be controlled by Enron .
· Enron was not liable for any loans or other liabilities .
LJM1 might have qualified under two of the three .
But how was Enron going to be able to prove that LJM1 was n't controlled by Enron when the company 's CFO was managing all of the investments ?
It appears that neither Lay nor Skilling thought about it .
Nor did Lay consider how much money Fastow might make on the assets he was buying from Enron .
After a bit more discussion , Lay agreed to bring Fastow 's proposal to the Enron board of directors at the board meeting on June 28 , 1999 .
At that board meeting , after a short debate , the company 's board of directors agreed to waive Enron 's ethics policy , which prohibited the company 's officers from doing deals directly with the company , and approved the LJM1 deal .
The approval opened the floodgates .
And LJM1 became the cornerstone of Fastow 's financial house of cards .
No one at Enron - or anyone else , for that matter - ever accused Fastow of excessive humility .
And throughout 2000 and early 2001 , the company 's chief financial officer was at the apogee of his self - diagnosed genius .
Fastow was fully convinced that his skein of partnerships and off - the - balance - sheet entities , with its mind - numbingly complicated spider 's web of interconnections and interdependent relationships , was the ultimate advance in financial engineering .
"" I can strip out any risk , "" Fastow once bragged to a co - worker .
It is not just his colleagues who were convinced .
At the end of 1999 , CFO magazine had named him one of their CFOs of the year , giving him its "" CFO excellence award for capital structure "" , an award given to him for helping make Enron into "" a master of creative financing "" .
The magazine praised Fastow 's work on the financing structure , which he created so that Enron could buy water company Azurix , as well as several power plants , while keeping the debts off its balance sheet .
When the award was announced , Skilling praised Fastow to CFO magazine , saying that Enron needed "" someone to rethink the entire financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts .
Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways .
[ He ] deserves every accolade tossed his way . ""
Fastow enjoyed the rewards of his special position too .
On top of his salary and earnings from the sale of Enron stock ( $ 33,675,000 between 1998 and 2001 ) , his investments in LJM1 and LJM2 earned him no less than $ 45 m .
He was partial to fancy watches : he often wore a Franck Muller model known as a "" Master Banker "" ( no snickering , please ) , a spiffy analogue watch that showed the time in three different time zones .
It cost about $ 9,000 .
In late February 2000 , he bought a house in the exclusive Houston suburb of River Oaks .
Other Enron big shots already lived in the same 77019 postcode .
Ken Lay had been in River Oaks for years .
Jeff Skilling also lived there .
So it made sense that when Fastow started pulling the big money , he bought a house on Del Monte Drive in the heart of River Oaks . ""
Andy wanted to keep up with the things that Skilling was doing .
Skilling had a house in River Oaks .
For Andy to be at that level , he needed the big house , too , "" said one finance executive who worked closely with Fastow .
Fastow 's special - purpose entities became a fast and dirty way for Enron to manufacture additional revenues in a big hurry .
In the last 11 days of 1999 , Fastow 's companies did seven separate deals with Enron .
In addition to a power plant in Poland , Fastow 's LJM2 entities bought a stake in some of Enron 's loans , bought part of Enron 's stake in a natural - gas gathering system in the Gulf of Mexico , bought a stake in a trust Enron had invested in called Yosemite , and bought part of Enron 's stake in a company that provided financing for natural - gas producers .
The advantage Fastow brought to Enron with the off - the - balance - sheet entities was the ability to do deals quickly .
Enron was "" looking for a quick way to sell assets to generate income , "" said one long - time Enron finance person .
"" If you control both sides of the deal , you can do it very quickly at any price you want .
That 's an advantage versus a situation where you 're trying to sell it to a third party , where it might take a year or more .
It was a way for them to control the entire process . ""
Fastow helped Enron control the process through a flock of entities with names such as Osprey , Osprey Trust , Timberwolf , Bobcat , Egret , Condor , Rawhide , Sundance , Ponderosa , Harrier , Porcupine and Mojave .
He also created a quartet of misbegotten entities known as the Raptors .
The sham deals quickly became one of Enron 's main business units .
In 1999 alone , Fastow 's deals inflated Enron 's profits by $ 248 m - that 's more than one - fourth of the $ 893 m in profits Enron reported that year .
In between September 1999 and July 2001 , Fastow 's LJM1 and LJM2 did about 20 different deals with Enron .
And Fastow 's flimflam partnerships made a profit on every transaction they did with Enron .
It looked as if Fastow could not lose .
Using Enron 's stock instead of cash to prop up his financial house of cards seemed like a great idea .
Enron 's stock had begun 2000 stuck at about $ 43 .
However , thanks to the hype surrounding Enron Broadband Services , it quickly began to climb into the ionosphere .
By the middle of the year , it was trading in the $ 70s .
On August 23 , 2000 , it hit its all - time high - $ 90 a share .
Enron 's stock - it seemed - was better than cash .
Given that rising stock price , Fastow apparently convinced Enron to pledge a total of $ 1bn worth of its stock to the Raptors .
The Enron stock would provide the "" capital "" that the Raptors needed to do transactions .
In return , the Raptors would help Enron lock in tens of millions of dollars in gains on stock it held in newly public companies , like hardware maker Avici Systems and The New Power Company , an energy company that planned to sell electric power to individual homeowners .
While the accountants slept , Enron 's attorneys were starting to worry about the Raptor deals .
On September 1 , 2000 , Stuart Zisman , an attorney who had been looking at the Raptors , sent an email to his superiors in Enron 's legal department that said : "" We have discovered that a majority of the investments being introduced into the Raptor Structure are bad ones .
This is disconcerting - it might lead one to believe that the financial books at Enron are being ' cooked ' in order to eliminate a drag on earnings . ""
Enron was cooking the books and Fastow was the chef de cuisine .
So where was
Andersen this whole time ?
It was , as usual , cashing Enron 's cheques .
In exchange for its work on the Raptor deals , Andersen charged Enron a total of $ 1.3 m ."
2002-11-06,"Surely it 's just a coincidence .
What else would explain why Enron Oil and Gas , a subsidiary of Enron Corp , would have been in business with George W Bush back in 1986 ?
Bush the Younger was many things , including the eldest son of the vice president of the United States .
A successful oilman he was not .
Bush 's forays into the energy business had been nothing short of disastrous .
In 1984 , Bush had no choice but to merge his faltering firm , Bush Exploration Company , with another company , Spectrum 7 .
But by mid-1986 , Bush had done his magic on the privately owned Spectrum 7 .
The company was n't producing much energy of any kind , and Bush was actively trying to sell again .
Despite Spectrum 7 's lousy record , it somehow got into business with Enron Oil and Gas .
And on October 16 , 1986 , Enron Oil and Gas announced that it had completed a well a few miles outside of Midland , Texas , that was producing 24,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 411 barrels of oil per day .
Enron owned 52 % of the well ; 10 % belonged to Spectrum 7 .
Now , the oil and gas business is full of speculators , and wells are often drilled with multiple investors with varying backgrounds .
But the early Bush - Enron connection points out just how small the energy business is .
Lay 's ties to George W Bush go back to 1980 , when Bush made his first bid for the White House .
Bush , who had recently served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency , needed campaign funds after his surprise win in the Iowa caucuses .
So Lay , who had probably met Bush through mutual friends in the energy business in Houston , gave money to Bush 's campaign .
Though Bush did n't win , Ronald Reagan made him vice president .
Bush went on to chair the panel that pushed Reagan 's task force on deregulation .
One of Reagan 's biggest moves in deregulation involved the lifting of federal controls on natural gas markets , a move that Lay had long favoured .
When the elder Bush got to the White House , he did n't forget Lay .
Bush rewarded Lay during his presidency with one of the most coveted perks of being a presidential pal , a sleep - over at the White House .
When Bush the Younger decided to run for governor of Texas in fall 1993 , one of his first stops on the campaign trail was Houston .
During his visit , George W Bush asked Lay to be the finance chairman of his campaign in Harris County , which includes Houston .
Lay did n't take the job .
He preferred to give George W Bush a $ 12,500 ( £ 8,000 at today 's rates ) cheque and work behind the scenes .
In his stead , Bush 's campaign in the county was headed by Lay 's second in command at Enron , Rich Kinder .
In all , Lay , Kinder , and other Enron executives donated $ 146,500 to George W Bush , almost seven times more than the amount they gave to the incumbent candidate , Democrat Ann Richards .
The donations by the execs , combined with money from Enron 's political action committee , made the Houston company Bush 's biggest campaign contributor .
After George W Bush defeated Richards , Enron gave $ 50,000 to Bush 's inaugural committee .
Lay began lobbying Bush almost immediately .
In December 1994 , before Bush moved into the Governor 's mansion in downtown Austin , Lay began sending him regular letters on energy policy , tax issues , lawsuit reform and other matters .
That month , Lay asked Bush to appoint Pat Wood , who supported the deregulation of electric utilities , to the state 's public utility commission .
Bush complied with Lay 's request .
And later on , Bush would appoint Wood - again at Lay 's recommendation - to the federal energy regulatory commission .
And while Lay maintained close ties to the Bush family throughout George W Bush 's stint as governor of Texas , those connections would be even more valuable to him and to Enron if Bush the Younger could throw the Democrats out of the White House .
In December 1999 , while Bush was pounding the campaign trail , Lay again wrote to his friend , addressing it to "" George and Laura "" [ Bush 's wife ] .
"" Linda and I are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the White House . ""
Lay had been one of Bush 's first "" pioneers "" , each of whom pledged to raise $ 100,000 for Bush .
He had also made Enron 's fleet of aircraft available to his campaign .
The Bush campaign used Enron 's jets to fly to different events on eight different occasions - more than any other corporation .
During the 2000 election cycle , Lay contributed more than $ 275,000 to the Republican National Committee .
Enron 's total donations to the party exceeded $ 1.1million .
When the outcome of the election was in doubt after the polls closed in November 2000 , Lay and his wife , Linda , gave $ 10,000 to help finance the Bush campaign 's Florida operation during the recount after the election .
After Bush prevailed in the election ( thanks to assistance by the US supreme court )
Ken and Linda Lay gave another $ 100,000 to help finance Bush 's inaugural gala .
In all , Enron and its top execs kicked in $ 300,000 for the inauguration festivities .
Naturally enough , the day after the inauguration , Lay went to a private lunch party at the White House , where he got to schmooze with the new president one on one .
A few weeks later , Lay had dinner with the president .
It was n't long before Enron 's bet on George W Bush was paying off in more important ways , too .
Although the California energy crisis was raging throughout his first few months in office in 2001 , the president refused - for nearly six months - to consider the possibility that the golden state 's power markets were being manipulated .
In some parts of the state , electricity rates had gone from $ 30 per megawatt hour to an alarming $ 1,500 per megawatt hour .
Rolling blackouts - and threats of blackouts - had the state in a near constant uproar .
By the time Bush had spent about 180 days in the White House , the state of California had spent nearly $ 8 billion buying power on the open market just to keep the lights on .
Despite the crisis , Dianne Feinstein , a senator from California - the most populous state in the union - could n't get an appointment with Bush .
The White House had plenty of time for Enron , though .
On April 17 2001 , Vice President Cheney had a private meeting with Enron chairman Ken Lay .
During the meeting , Lay offered suggestions for Cheney 's energy task force and lobbied Cheney against price caps in California .
Cheney quickly adopted Lay 's argument .
The day after his meeting with Lay , Cheney mocked the idea of price caps .
He told the Los Angeles Times that caps would only provide "" short - term political relief for the politicians . ""
In late May , Bush visited California and , like Cheney , attacked the idea that price caps - something the California governor , Gray Davis , and Feinstein had been begging for - might help the state restore order to its electricity system .
Bush and Cheney were wrong .
Enron and several other power companies had been manipulating the California energy market for months and collecting huge revenues for their efforts .
Using strategies with colourful names like Death Star , Get Shorty , Fat Boy , and Ricochet , Enron had apparently figured out ways to play the state 's power system and drive up prices .
Finally , on June 18 2001 , after weeks of rising intrigue , the federal energy regulatory commission approved limited price caps for California .
The move quickly settled the state 's power markets .
Enron 's connections in the White House went much further than George W Bush .
The new president 's chief economic adviser , Larry Lindsey , was on Enron 's payroll before going to the White House , earning $ 100,000 in consulting fees from the Houston company .
Marc Racicot , the former governor of Montana , lobbied for Enron before Bush named him to lead the Republican national committee .
Robert Zoellick , Bush 's choice for US trade representative , served on an Enron advisory council .
Thomas White , Bush 's secretary of the army , was the vice chairman of Enron Energy Services , a money - losing charade of a company .
Nevertheless , when White left Enron , he owned more than $ 25 million in the company 's stock .
Bush 's chief strategist and political guru , Karl Rove , owned more than $ 100,000 of Enron stock when Bush took office .
Bush 's White House provided Lay and Enron with unprecedented access .
In addition to the meeting with Lay , Enron officials met with Cheney 's task force ( the national energy policy development group ) five times and talked to it by phone on at least six other occasions about the measure .
Their effort shows .
The national energy policy development group 's final report - Reliable , Affordable and Environmentally Sound Energy for America 's Future - released in mid - May 2001 , contains a number of provisions very favourable to Enron .
For instance , the report recommends the creation of a national electricity grid , a move that could allow Enron to trade electric power more readily in all regions of the country .
The report says permitting for gas pipelines should be expedited , a factor that would help Enron , already one of the largest pipeline companies in the world , build more capacity more quickly .
The report talks about the California crisis , the need for energy efficiency , increased domestic natural gas production and , of course , India .
Did n't you know that the cost of butane in Bombay is critical to soccer moms in Seattle ?
Cheney 's group recommended that "" the president direct the secretaries of state and energy to work with India 's ministry of petroleum and natural gas to help India maximise its domestic oil and gas production "" .
Not only could Lay get Bush 's ear on appointments , he could get federal reports to mention countries like India , where Enron , with the Dabhol electricity and liquefied natural gas project ( also mentioned in Cheney 's report ) , was a major investor .
To be fair , the energy report also discusses America 's growing reliance on energy from Mexico and Canada .
But the state department , which participated in the writing of the energy report , did n't add the India section ; the White House did .
Ken Lay 's money on George W Bush had been well spent ."
2002-11-06,"The Bush administration today began the search for a new financial regulator after Harvey Pitt , the gaffe - prone chairman of the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) , resigned .
Mr Pitt stepped down as head of America 's financial watchdog after a tumultuous 15 months , as a rash of scandals from Enron to WorldCom undermined public confidence in corporate America and Wall Street .
From the beginning of his time as head of the SEC , Mr Pitt laboured under the initial handicap of being considered too close to the industry he was supposed to regulate .
The final straw came last week over the fiasco surrounding the appointment of the head of a new accountancy supervisory board , a cornerstone of legislation designed to clean up Wall Street .
William Webster , the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation , was appointed by a deeply divided SEC as head of the public company accounting oversight board .
Even before Mr Webster 's selection , the process turned into a quagmire for Mr Pitt , who was accused of caving in to the accountancy lobby when he backed away from the early favourite , John Biggs , the highly respected and independent 66-year - old head of the TIAA - CREF pension fund .
Mr Pitt 's problems became terminal when it emerged that he had failed to inform the other four commissioners that Mr Webster had served on the audit committee of US Technologies , a company that was subject of allegations over its accounting practices .
Democrats called for Mr Pitt 's resignation and Mr Pitt found himself in the embarrassing position of having to call for an SEC investigation into the whole episode .
"" It is with deep regret that I have decided to tender my resignation to you as chairman , and a member of the securities and exchange commission , effective as soon as I can help your staff ensure a smooth transition of leadership , "" Mr Pitt said in a letter to the president , George Bush .
Mr Pitt 's departure was widely expected by the markets , where the focus was very much on the midterm elections , with the Republicans taking control of both the House and the Senate .
For markets , "" the real issue is the election "" , said Arnie Owen , managing director of equities at Roth Capital Partners in New York .
"" The Pitt issue has been going on for a couple weeks ...
I do n't think it will matter for the markets . ""
Names that have been mentioned as possible successors include a former top SEC lawyer , James Doty , a corporate lawyer , Gary Lynch , and the a former federal judge , Stanley Sporkin ."
2002-11-07,"A row over new rules that will wipe billions of pounds off the profits of big companies is likely to erupt today when international accounting regulators launch an initiative to clean up corporate statements following the collapse of Enron .
Sir David Tweedie , head of the international accounting standards board , believes new rules on accounting for stock options awarded to executives and employees around the world are crucial to improve corporate governance .
The rules - published for consultation this morning - will for the first time require companies to treat the options as a cost .
At the moment they do not have to put a value on the options awarded as part of incentive schemes for executives or under employee share ownership schemes , so they do not appear to cost the company anything .
There are concerns that this encourages the excessive use of options as a form of regular pay , which prompted some of America 's recent corporate scandals by encouraging directors to boost their stock in the short term for personal gain .
"" There was an incentive to ramp up share prices .
Options are a real corporate governance issue , "" Sir David said .
The Scot , who was the former head of Britain 's accounting standards board , is braced for controversy over the rules , which have already been opposed by a £ 50 m campaign in the United States and have prompted the expression of doubts from President Bush .
"" This is going to get political , "" Sir David said .
The changes - which would not be implemented until early 2005 - will hit hardest companies which use share options as a large component of pay , such as technology companies .
Microsoft , for instance , could see its profits dented by $ 3bn ( £ 2bn ) if it adopted the rules .
Estimates on the overall cost have mainly been made for the US stock market suggesting it would take 12 % off the operating income of companies in the S&amp;P 500 .
Dissenting voices in other parts of the world are expected to come forward now that the international accounting standards boards is publishing its rule .
In Britain , Proshare , the shareholding lobby group , has expressed its concern that it will hit employee share - ownership schemes by making them too expensive for companies to run .
The Law Society is understood to have questioned the legality of the proposals , which are being backed by the accounting standards board .
Sir David indicated yesterday that he was determined to fight for the new accounting standard and believes he has the support of powerful institutional shareholders .
Peter Montagnon , head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers , whose members control 25 % of the stock market , backed the international accounting standards board .
"" Proper accounting for share incentive schemes in the profit and loss account is the single most useful step towards injecting sanity and order into executive remuneration , "" Mr Montagnon said .
Corporate scandals in the US have prompted some American companies to begin accounting for their options voluntarily .
While only Boeing and Winn - Dixie Stores did so before the scandals , about 120 companies do so now .
In Britain , HSBC has been one of the first groups to adopt the measure .
Under the proposals put forward by the international accounting standards board , companies would have to put a cost on the value of shares on the date they are awarded to employees .
The cost can then be spread over the life of the incentive scheme ."
2002-11-12,"Flagship US business paper the Wall Street Journal has axed 23 journalists , including editors and reporters who broke some of the year 's biggest financial stories such as the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
The cutbacks in America are part of a plan by parent company Dow Jones to axe 230 staff worldwide .
The redundancies , which left staff "" stunned and angry "" , were more severe than expected and accounted for the entire New York legal department and regional economic reporting teams Among the heads to roll were the head of the legal reporting team Francine Schwadel , Jerry Markon , who broke stories on the Martha Stewart and WorldCom scandals , Enron reporter Kathryn Kranhold and terrorism and civil liberties reporter Jess Bravin .
Eight more reporters took voluntary redundancy .
In a memo to staff , Paul Steiger , the managing editor of the WSJ , said the cuts amounted to 5 % of the broadsheet 's news staff .
The cuts "" have and will hurt "" he added .
Dow Jones has been hit severely by the downturn in advertising and any rebound has been thwarted by its dependence on technology and financial services advertisers .
Last week , Peter Kann , the chairman and chief executive of the company , said Dow Jones would eliminate as many as 230 jobs and freeze the salaries of most managers and senior executives .
"" In a business such as ours , it is impossible to reduce costs meaningfully without reducing staff , "" said Mr Kann .
"" This has been a very painful price to pay but we saw no other realistic alternative .
"" The cuts are further evidence of financial difficulties taking their toll of editorial staff .
Last week , rival financial news provider Reuters admitted it would cut up to 500 editorial positions .
Staff "" are stunned and they are angry , "" said Tom Lauricella , a WSJ reporter and union representative for US news staff at Dow Jones "" People in the newsroom feel that by forcing these cuts , upper management at Dow Jones is doing a tremendous disservice to our readers , "" he told Dow Jones Newswire ."
2002-11-15,"Jean - Marie Messier , the disgraced former chief executive of Vivendi Universal , has dismissed allegations of fraud at the French - American media group , insisting it is "" not an Enron "" .
He said investigators in the US and France poring over Vivendi 's accounts will find no evidence of wrongdoing . ""
Vivendi Universal is not an Enron .
There was no fraud and manipulation at Vivendi Universal .
There were no executives at Vivendi Universal who filled their pockets at the expense of shareholders , "" he said .
He added that the investigations were the best way to "" kill rumours "" about the company and his tumultuous six - year reign as chairman and chief executive of the world 's second largest media group , which ended in July this year . ""
Let the judges do their jobs , "" he said .
France 's market watchdog has been scrutinising Vivendi 's books , while Paris - based prosecutors are examining allegations that financial reports were falsified during Mr Messier 's period in charge .
In the US , the Attorney 's Office in New York has opened a preliminary investigation and an informal inquiry has been launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Vivendi Universal was created by Mr Messier two years ago in a blockbuster merger between French water treatment and telecoms business Vivendi , the Universal film and music empires , and the Canal Plus pay - TV group .
However , the group nearly collapsed under the weight of a £ 12bn debt burden built up by Mr Messier 's spending sprees , triggering a boardroom revolt which forced out the colourful chief executive .
Mr Messier was speaking at a press conference to promote his account of his startling fall from grace , called Mon Vrai Journal , or My True Diary .
In one chapter "" My Errors "" , he admits he made six mistakes while in charge of Vivendi : that he should have sold out sooner from Vivendi 's utilities subsidiary , Vivendi Environnement ; he should have fired Pierre Lescure , the head of Canal Plus , sooner ; he should have changed the board of directors ; he should not have struck so many deals so quickly ; he should have had a better rapport with the French political establishment , and he should have listened to warnings from his family and colleagues .
Mr Messier continued his testy relationship with the press at the packed press conference , berating photographers for taking pictures and complaining that his family had been harassed by paparazzi .
He added that he had put all his savings into Vivendi stock , and he was now struggling financially .
The man who once had 380,000 people working for him now runs a small consultancy called "" Ahead "" , with one employee .
But he told the Liberation newspaper that he was not suffering from depression , despite enduring one of the most high - profile falls from grace of any business executive .
"" I do n't have time to be depressed , that 's a luxury for the rich , "" he said ."
2002-11-16,"Whistleblower quits Enron The Enron executive who warned of questionable accounting months before its collapse left the company yesterday to advise corporations on ethical issues .
Vice president Sherron Watkins , who said she was afraid Enron 's accounting misdeeds could "" implode "" the company , testified before Congress earlier this year on events at the energy trader .
"" She is leaving today and she plans to go into consulting work in the area of corporate governance , "" her lawyer , Philip Hilder , told Reuters yesterday .
"" It was a voluntary decision and we wish her all the best , "" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer .
Credit Suisse investigated Investment bank Credit Suisse is being investigated over allegations that it revealed details of its third - quarter results to selected analysts ahead of their release on Thursday .
Yesterday a spokesman for the Swiss stock exchange said : "" We have started an investigation to see what really happened .
"" It follows a Sunday newspaper report citing unnamed analysts , who said they had received hints from Credit Suisse that it would post a record quarterly loss of around SFr2bn ( £ 886 m ) .
On Thursday it reported a loss of SFr2.1bn .
Credit Suisse has rejected the charges but said it would cooperate fully with the investigation .
ImClone losses increase ImClone , the US cancer drug developer whose ex - chief executive pleaded guilty in an insider - trading scandal , yesterday reported a slightly wider quarterly loss due to a sharp rise in drug development costs and expenses linked to the crisis .
Third quarter losses rose to nearly $ 42 m ( £ 26 m ) from a loss of $ 41 m the year before .
Chief executive Sam Waksal resigned earlier this year and pleaded guilty last month to six of 13 felony charges against him .
Johnson round table with rivals
Restaurateur Luke Johnson was last night forced into negotiations with his rivals to save his buyout of Signature Restaurants , owner of London eateries The Ivy and Le Caprice .
The Takeover Panel yesterday gave Mr Johnson time to talk with Park Place Capital , the 29.9 % shareholder in Signature which is run by friends of Mr Johnson 's rival , Giuliano Lotto .
Park Place refused Mr Johnson 's 60p - a - share offer and has been considering a counterbid .
Advisers to both companies were last night trying to thrash out a deal which will give Park Place , and potentially Mr Lotto , a stake in Signature if they support the buyout .
Royal Doulton fires
250 Pottery firm Royal Doulton is to lose a further 250 jobs as part of a global restructuring programme .
Up to 200 of the 250 new job cuts will be made at the Etruria and Nile Street sites in Stoke - on - Trent , and the remainder at the company 's overseas sites .
The firm is to also close its factory in the Beswick area of city in January , six months ahead of schedule , with the loss of 200 jobs ."
2002-11-18,"Richard Lambert , the former editor of the FT , said it first .
Soon his little homily on how the press missed the Enron story had been repeated enough for it to be in danger of becoming a cliche .
Must do better .
But just as newspapers resolved to be more alert watchdogs of City wrongdoing in future another truth began to dawn : that the job had just been made infinitely harder by the very organisation whose job it is to do the same .
It is a story of unintended consequences .
It is also an object lesson in how the British press nodded when draconian legislation was wending its way through parliament .
All this was rather painfully laid bare during a conference on financial reporting held at the Guardian 's Newsroom Centre last week .
It is virtually unprecedented for five national editors to share a platform on the same side .
It is a mark of the seriousness of the issue that the editors of the Independent , Times , Guardian , Financial Times and Reuters joined together to voice their worries .
They were followed by the City editors of the same papers , along with the City editors of the Sunday Telegraph and Observer .
The bond that united most participants was having been on the sharp end of a legal action by Interbrew , in which the Belgian company did its best to force us to expose an anonymous source who had posted confidential documents relating to a proposed takeover .
At one point during the summer the brewers came within seven days of putting accountants in to run the Guardian , which found itself in contempt of court by refusing to hand over the document .
Interbrew , wounded by hostile publicity , withdrew from the action - but not before it had claimed more than £ 100,000 in costs and handed the case over to the Financial Services Authority .
This was something of a fire and frying pan situation .
While the FSA has , to date , acted slowly and courteously it soon became apparent that an agency intended to clean up the City has awesome powers should it wish to turn them against the press .
The powers derive from the Financial Services and Markets Act ( FSMA ) , which came into effect nearly a year ago .
Under the act the FSA has virtually unlimited rights of entry , search and seizure .
Any journalist refusing to hand over a document or notebook - or , worse still , destroying it , hiding it or lying about it - can be hauled straight before a judge for contempt of court .
The FSA representative who attended the conference made emollient noises about being on the same side as journalists in rooting out corruption .
But he repeatedly declined to rule out demanding that journalists reveal their sources in future investigations .
All of the City editors said their lives had become harder since the FSMA passed into law .
Sources were more reluctant to speak .
Many phone lines in City offices were routinely taped .
Stories which could be regarded as market sensitive could only be checked at the peril of being widely disseminated in accordance with the new rules .
Some editors now routinely shredded documents .
Others felt this left them exposed in the event of libel actions .
One senior reporter said he was concerned about assuring a source that his / her identity would be protected .
A newspaper might stand firm , but who was to know whether phone companies would resist handing over phone logs , or whether emails could be retrieved ?
So what was the British newspaper industry doing at the time the FSMA was being passed ?
There was no shortage of opportunity to lobby .
The 215-page act was three years in the making .
It passed through two parliamentary committees as well as both houses , resulting in 1,450 amendments .
The answer appears to be almost nothing .
"" We were asleep , "" admitted Geert Linnebank , editor of Reuters .
"" We lost the plot , "" said Robert Peston , City editor of the Sunday Telegraph .
The Newspaper Publishers ' Association ( NPA ) left it to individual publishers .
Individual publishers did nothing .
I t is a depressingly familiar story .
Very little active lobbying has been done by the newspaper industry over the past 10 years to reform the libel laws .
Such progress as has been made has invariably been achieved by lawyers , or by individual papers fighting rearguard actions .
Nothing has been done over the troublesome section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act - supposedly there to help protection of sources , but which has gradually turned into a lethally double - edged sword .
Nothing has been done over the increasing use of Norwich Pharmacal - style actions to force sources into the open .
Without the vigilance of Reuters , I doubt any British editor would have woken up in time to the aptly named MAD ( Market Abuse Directive ) which will impose still more shackles on our ability effectively to expose future Enrons or WorldComs .
European regulators have had to be persuaded that City journalists should not be regulated the same as financial analysts .
The tabloid press is ruthlessly effective in seeing off anyone who threatens laws or regulations which might affect its operations .
For too long the broadsheets and mid - market papers have complacently nodded while being trussed up in legal red tape .
Must do better ."
2002-11-27,"The Conservatives yesterday accused Gordon Brown of using Enron - style accounting tricks to avoid busting his self - imposed rules on public borrowing .
Mr Brown is committed to keeping borrowing below 40 % of gross domestic product , on his so - called "" sustainable investment rule "" - but the Tories said that the cost of underwriting Network Rail , and financing public private partnerships , pushed him to within a whisker of the limit .
"" The government is making the public accounts look better than they are by pushing borrowing off balance sheet , Enron style .
If the chancellor had to put them on the public books , he would already be at the limit of sustainable debt as defined under his own fiscal rules , "" said Michael Howard , the shadow chancellor .
Official figures put public debt at £ 316.5bn at the end of October - 30 % of GDP .
The Tories claim the government is hiding more than £ 100 m of extra liabilities by shoving them off the balance sheet .
Their figures put the real debt - GDP ratio at 39.6 % .
With the chancellor expected to announce hefty increases in borrowing in today 's pre - budget report to cover the shortfall in tax revenues caused by the downturn in the economy , Mr Howard was last night preparing to accuse him of breaking out of his own fiscal straitjacket . ""
If Gordon Brown increases his borrowing today it is likely he will be in breach of one of his own key rules .

2002-11-27,"While your survey on the UK 's top 100 companies illustrated that more are giving profits to community projects ( Verdict on corporate donations , The Giving List , November 25 ) , the corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) debate is now not just about what firms do with the profits they make , but how they make those profits .
Enron did social responsible community projects , but was still rotten at the core .
Of all the government 's CSR charters , only about 10 % of the FTSE-350 companies have signed up to any .
CSR also means being responsible overseas , not just at home , particularly in developing countries .
This means more than digging a few wells in a few villages .
Clearly at the UN world summit on sustainable development there were increasing concerns over the role of business in overseas development .
The nub of the issue is one of regulation .
Most non - governmental organisations feel that there is a general lack of accountability and transparency in the operation of businesses and yet the same NG0s are extremely keen for businesses to have compulsory corporate social responsibility strategies .
Clearly a balance needs to be struck .
It is imperative to stress that Kofi Annan , the UN secretary - general , urged businesses at the summit to move forward without waiting for governments .
Corporate investment , even in developing countries ' public services , can be of real benefit .
While recently in southern Africa it was clear to me how little foreign direct investment reaches the region .
Tony Baldry MP Conservative , Banbury ·
Surely the real givers are those multinational corporations that pay their dues in tax .
Tax ought to be at the core of corporate social responsibility but it barely gets a mention .
Tax avoidance costs the Treasury billions a year .
Some of the UK 's largest companies routinely avoid paying tax using sophisticated accounting techniques that enable profits to be transferred to tax havens the world over .
Developing countries lose billions from the process by being forced to compete over tax rates , offering ever - lower taxes , tax holidays and tax - free zones .
Is it really responsible for a company to give with one a hand and take away with the other ?
Given that most of these companies pay far less tax than they should ( estimates for tax avoidance by big business is 40 times higher than your figure for the top 400 "" givers "" ) , would it not be better to publish a list of the top tax givers , and so avoid promoting what is still potentially a PR exercise for most companies ?

· I read The Giving List to discover that while we ( the public ) have been giving more charitable support over the last 10 years
, donations from the business sector have actually declined in real terms since 1991 .
Companies rightly point to the good work that they are doing .
But the implicit statement here is that , without their support , this would not happen - or in other words , that company charitable donations ( although shrinking in real terms ) are better than nothing .
But better than nothing is not good enough .
Companies depend upon our communities .
They depend upon schools to give them educated employees , upon transport systems to move their goods around , upon the health service , and often upon charities , to provide care for some of their employees and customers .
And what do they give back ?
Well , less than they did in 1991 .
Not good enough .

2002-12-02,"Discipinary hearings against accountants will be heard in public if recommendations today by the profession 's regulatory body are adopted .
The Accountancy Foundation Review Board , set up in March 2001 , is suggesting the move in the light of big changes facing the industry , particularly following the collapse of Enron and WorldCom .
In a 60-page report , the review panel acknowledges that changes are needed because of "" increased concern about whether the profession is serving the public interest "" .
Sir John Bourn , chairman of the review board , said : "" While we found much to commend in the current disciplinary arrangements , our report makes a number of recommendations for improvement which will strengthen the system and enhance protection of the public interest . ""
The review is one of the first to be undertaken by the board since the introduction of a new system of non - statutory regulation for the accountancy ."
2002-12-03,"JP Morgan Chase yesterday began its move to wring $ 1bn in Enron - related losses out of 11 insurance companies which have refused to honour contracts signed before the energy group went bankrupt .
The court case opened in Manhattan and is the first trial related to the collapse of the company since the successful prosecution of its auditor Arthur Andersen .
The case begins exactly a year after Enron filed for bankruptcy and the complex deals to disguise debts began to unravel before investors .
The Wall Street bank wants the insurers to honour six surety bonds they wrote to back trades involving Enron and a Jersey - based vehicle Mahonia .
The insurers are ar guing that the bank misrepresented the transactions as oil and gas trades when they were in fact little more than straightforward loans .
Legal experts have said that JP Morgan is pursuing a dangerous strategy .
Shareholders in Enron will be eagerly watching the outcome and could use it as a basis to undertake further legal actions against the bank .
It could also provide further details of some of the more complex financial engineering used by Enron .
The banks that advised Enron are viewed as a more cash rich target for legal action than the company itself .
The judge presiding over the case , US district judge Jed Rakoff , has twice refused JP Morgan 's request that the insurers be forced to pay up without the case being presented before a jury .
Lawyers for both sides were involved in jury selection yesterday and due to deliver opening arguments .
The bonds covered six contracts between 1998 and 2000 .
JP Morgan funded Mahonia , which prepaid Enron for future delivery of gas and oil , but the energy firm defaulted when it filed for bankruptcy .
They were supposed to cover the risk that Enron might default but the insurers claim to have been misled .
A JP Morgan spokesman described the insurers ' version of events as a "" brazen distortion of the facts "" .
He said : "" The insurance companies sold us guaranteed protection against Enron credit risk .
They agreed that their obligation to pay was absolute and unconditional . """

"" You are n't the victims of Enron , you folks helped perpetrate these deceptions , "" said Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations .
Both banks maintained that they had done nothing wrong but admitted they would not enter into similar deals in today 's less forgiving climate . ""

A video recorded for the leaving party of a former employee shows senior executives joking about how they could manipulate the accounts to make "" a kazillion dollars "" .
It also features the current and former President Bushes paying warm tributes to the departing executive .
George Bush senior tells Enron 's then president Rich Kinder : "" You have been fantastic to the Bush family .
I do n't think anybody did more than you did to support George . ""
The 1997 video , shown on MSNBC last night , turned out to be prescient .
In one skit , Enron 's then chief executive Jeffrey Skilling is shown handing a budget report to a colleague , and explaining how Enron could achieve 600 % revenue growth in the coming year .
"" We 're going to move to something I call HFV , or hypothetical future value accounting , "" he says .
"" If we do that , we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line . ""
On the tape , then chief accounting officer Richard Causey jokes : "" I 've been on the job for a week managing earnings , and it 's easier than I thought it would be . ""
George Bush junior , then governor of Texas , says to Mr Kinder , who has not been implicated in the financial scandal : "" Do n't leave Texas .
You 're too good a man . ""
The relationship between the White House and Enron came under heavy scrutiny following the Enron collapse , during which it emerged that the company had been hiding massive debts .
President Bush was close to the Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay , referring to him affectionately as "" Kenny boy . ""
Congressional hearings into the role that the now defunct Enron auditor Arthur Andersen played were concluded yesterday with the recommendation that a criminal investigation be opened on Nancy Temple , the firm 's former in - house lawyer .
She sent an email which reminded staff of Andersen 's document retention policy , which was alleged to have sparked the shredding of important papers ."
2002-12-19,"Lord Wakeham 's role on the board of the collapsed energy company Enron is to be scrutinised by the British body which polices the accountancy profession .
The former energy secretary in Margaret Thatcher 's government could be barred from operating as a chartered accountant if the investigation by the joint disciplinary scheme finds any wrongdoing .
Christopher Dickson , executive counsel of the scheme , said yesterday that Lord Wakeham came within the remit of his investigation as did the role of the now disbanded accountants Andersen .
Accusations have been raised in the US that employees of Andersen in London were involved in shredding documents relating to Enron .
The case was referred to the joint disciplinary scheme by the institute of chartered accountants in England and Wales a year after Enron collapsed from a multi - billion pound fraud .
Mr Dickson stressed that referral and opening of an investigation "" should not be construed as meaning either that a view has been formed that a prima facie case exists against any member or member firm "" .
The Tory peer , who did not return calls yesterday , was a non - executive director at Enron , sitting on the audit committee .
Enron 's collapse has forced Lord Wakeham to step aside from the £ 156,000 role as chairman of the press complaints commission .
He is said to have told friends that non - executives did raise concerns about the management of Enron ."
2002-12-22,"Just how was it possible for Enron , WorldCom and Marconi to get into such difficulties ?
Why did n't the supposed checks and balances of the corporate governance system restrain the excesses of these over - mighty chief executives ?
And why has all of the media coverage been about shareholders rather than the workers , many of whom will be looking forward to a miserable Christmas ?
The answers reflect the way business people and commentators think about companies in the economy today .
Organisations exist to deliver value for shareholders and everything else takes second place .
As long as ' value ' is being squeezed from a business then investors will not pay too much attention to how the organisation is managed .
It is only when a series of transactions begins to unravel ( as with Enron and WorldCom ) or a change in management direction is seen to be a strategic blunder ( as with Marconi ) that investors begin to bail out .
Making an ' exit ' or selling your shares is favoured over having a ' voice ' - engaging with the company , remedying management errors and looking for long - term growth .
On my election as the TUC 's next general secretary last week I said that unions needed to get smarter .
Our challenge is to limit the scope for these management mistakes and protect workers from the consequences of management stupidity .
Traditionally we have argued for changes in company law , better redundancy compensation and consultation rights , and limits on executive greed .
These are all essential if we are to domesticate the less house - trained elements of Anglo - Saxon capitalism .
But I believe there are new levers unions can pull as well .
Let 's start with a question .
Who are these shareholders who are supposed to benefit from the ' maximisation of shareholder value ' ?
Today most shares are not owned by individuals but rather by large institutional investors .
Britain has failed to realise the Thatcherite dream of becoming a share - owning democracy .
Direct ownership of shares by individuals has fallen to its lowest level since 1963 .
By the end of 2000 individuals directly owned only 16 per cent of UK shares , compared to 54 per cent in 1963 .
Instead the largest domestic owners of UK shares are pension funds and insurance companies who now hold about 18 per cent and 21 per cent of equities respectively - or two out of every five UK shares .
But they hold these shares on behalf of workers contributing to pension schemes and insurance policies .
Working people are now the ultimate owners of most blue - chip firms in the UK .
In formal terms , British capitalism has given workers ownership of the means of production .
But this is a case where ownership does not equal control , because pension fund managers take the key decisions .
They look for quick returns to guarantee the continuation of their fund management mandate .
In turn , corporate managers need to keep the share price high .
And how do you do that ?
The simple answer is that you downsize , outsource or look for a merger or acquisition .
Across much of the British economy financial engineering is now more important than producing the goods and services that people want to buy .
Workers ' own assets are being used against them .
There are now new opportunities for unions to change this .
Many pension fund trust boards include member - nominated and union - backed trustees .
They are not just a source of valuable intelligence about the activities of fund managers , but can influence investment decisions - and in particular how the fund 's votes are cast at company AGMs .
This is why the TUC is building a network of trustees to give the trade union movement collective shareholder power .
The potential is growing .
The Treasury - sponsored review of institutional investment headed by Paul Myners proposed that there should be a legal duty on funds to intervene in companies where it would be in the interests of pension scheme members .
This would mean working with other shareholders to remove poor management at board level .
Myners is clear that investors exercising ' voice ' is better for the economy as a whole than their current strategy of looking for the nearest exit .
The Government 's early response , however , is not encouraging .
Instead it is exploring whether a voluntary code prepared by the Institutional Shareholders ' Committee can generate the necessary change .
However , the institutional investment community is still on notice , as the Government will legislate if nothing has changed in two years .
Separately the Department of Trade and Industry is changing the law to give shareholders an annual vote on directors ' pay .
This will come into force in April 2003 .
Already the TUC has helped encourage a shareholder vote against the remuneration policy at Vodafone .
One in 10 shareholders voted against the chief executive 's package and 15 per cent of shareholders refused to endorse it .
With the annual vote kicking in next year , the TUC will target a series of companies where the remuneration policy is clearly unacceptable .
In other countries , notably the US and Canada , unions already use shareholder power to promote employee interests .
The TUC hopes to mirror these achievements .
I want to make the case to the investment community that the way employees are treated and the quality of workplace relationships has a big impact on corporate performance .
Our plan is to produce a simple template for investors that will enable them to assess whether an organisation is deploying the working practices that deliver high productivity .
In some cases , of course , it is important to use the power of public embarrassment and expose companies to reputational risk .
In other words , we can sponsor resolutions at AGMs that expose unacceptable behaviour - particularly the abuse of labour standards .
Earlier this year the TUC built support among UK investors for a resolution at the AGM of US oil company Unocal over its involvement in Burma .
We contacted 100 UK pension funds and sent information to all members of the trustees ' network about the resolution .
As a result a number of large investors supported it .
The resolution ultimately won 34.1 per cent of the shareholder vote - a good example of modern trade unionism in action .
The keys to the boardroom are in our hands - the challenge is to use that power wisely once we get through the door ."

2002-12-24,"Citigroup will take a $ 1.5bn ( £ 94 m ) charge in the fourth quarter to pay for its involvement in the financial scandals of the past year , but yesterday admitted the bill could rise .
The sum relates to last week 's broad settlement of conflict of interest allegations on Wall Street , as well as potential lawsuits related to the settlement and from disgruntled shareholders in Enron , the bankrupt energy firm .
The bank agreed to pay $ 300 m in penalties plus $ 100 m to fund independent research and investor education as part of the deal with the New York state attorney general , Eliot Spitzer , and financial regulators .
The fine was the largest paid by any bank involved in the agreement .
Sanford Weill , the chairman and chief executive , hoped the settlement would "" bring to a close a difficult chapter in our history "" .
Shares in the bank slipped 54 cents to $ 37.60 in midday trading .
Friday 's deal involves the 10 largest Wall Street banks paying $ 1.4bn to settle allegations that analysts misled investors to attract investment banking business to their firms .
Salomon Smith Barney , owned by Citigroup , has been at the centre of the claims .
Publication of internal emails disclosing conflicts of interest led to the resignation of a star telecoms analyst , Jack Grubman , and the ousting of Michael Carpenter , who ran Salomon .
Citigroup and Mr Grubman face 62 potential class actions regarding research , according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission .
The bank is setting up a $ 1.3bn reserve for the cost of the settlement and toward the estimated costs of private litigation related to the conflict of interest allegations and Enron .
The other $ 200 m in the next quarter 's charge is to cover bad loans .
A statement from the bank said there were many lingering issues .
"" Given the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation , the large number of cases , the novel issues , the substantial time before these cases will be resolved , and the multiple defendants in many of them , this reserve is difficult to determine and of necessity subject to revision .

2003-01-02,"Popping champagne corks have been rare in the City over the past 12 months , with the stock market recording its biggest ever annual loss .
Any hopes that shares would recover in 2002 after the shock of the September 11 attacks and the scandal of Enron were soon dashed .
Fears of more terrorist outrages , the threat of war with Iraq , economic gloom and a seemingly endless list of corporate scandals in the US saw to that .
By close of play on New Year 's Eve , the FTSE 100 had lost 24.4 % of its value , its third annual loss in a row .
In such a climate , the Guardian 's share tips of last year were always going to struggle , and so it proved .
Our portfolio of 10 shares lost a total of 25 % .
While this was a hefty fall , it was commendable to achieve a result pretty much in line with the market .
City bonuses are paid out on worse performances than that .
A survey by the Sun of share tips from rival newspapers showed that the Guardian turned in the second - best performance of the year , behind the Sunday Telegraph whose shares lost 19 % .
According to the survey , the Daily Mail lost 27 % , the Observer 27 % , the Times 28 % , the Sun 30 % , the Independent 37 % , the Daily Express 41 % , the Independent on Sunday 44 % , the Daily Mirror 45 % , the Daily Telegraph 48 % , and the Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday 59 % each .

That takes care of the risers .
Speckled Hen brewer Greene King slipped back slightly but proved a fairly resilient defensive pick .

Analysts believe profits for the 12 months to the end of this month will come in at about £ 7.5 m , down from £ 8.6 m last year .
They could recover to about £ 9 m next financial year .
Despite the profit fall , the dividend is likely to be held and the management is reasonably well regarded .
The sector is also seeing consolidation moves involving House of Fraser and Allders , and it would be no surprise to see James Beattie joining the fun .

Yet some of the City 's shrewdest investors have built big positions in the world 's second - largest glassmaker and readers would do well to follow .

Nippon is already rumoured to have hired advisers and if an offer should come it will be in excess of the current 58p price .
If it does not , shareholders can sleep safe in the knowledge that they have invested in a well - run company which is committed to holding the dividend of 5p a share .

Not that safe Safeway is one for the brave .
Shares in the fourth - biggest supermarket chain rattled down from 418p to 213.25p as serious doubts set in about chief executive Carlos Criado - Perez 's turnround plan .
Recently Safeway disclosed underlying sales growth of 1.9 % - markedly less than its rivals - and the latest Taylor Nelson Sofres market share data shows the chain still losing ground .
Why buy ?
Because Safeway recently reported profits up 4 % at £ 188 m , despite £ 8 m spent on refurbs .
Because there remains an at least even chance that its new price campaign will work and that shoppers will start spending more per visit .
If the strategy does backfire , a bid is likely .

Any investment in Vodafone involves some prediction of the general movement of the FTSE 100 over the year because it is such a sizeable constituent of the index .
But , if financial armageddon does not hit during 2003 , Vodafone at 113.25p is worth a serious look .
The company 's last set of results was much stronger than anyone expected , with the business throwing off almost £ 3bn of spare cash in six months .
That cash is likely to start coming back to shareholders because capital expenditure has been reduced - 3 G services are not going to get going in any meaningful way until the end of the year .
Finally , the Vodafone Live service looks to have been a success - proving that customers will use their phones for more than just talking .
Richard Wray History lesson
Since the FTSE 100 index was launched in 1984 , on just about every occasion where the index has fallen six or more days in a row it rallied by 300 points or more within the next three months .
On December 11 , an eight - day run of losses - the longest on record - came to an end at 3,925 .
Since then the index has made a little progress , closing at 3,940 on December 31 .
For the rule to hold true , it should see a 285-point rally to 4,225 or more by March 11 .
So my recommendation would be to buy the top 100 for the next three months .
One way of doing this would be through traded options - derivatives which allow speculators to leverage their bets .

2003-01-03,"JP Morgan Chase said yesterday it would receive about $ 600 m ( £ 400 m ) in a settlement with insurers of a disputed $ 1bn in losses from deals the bank hatched with Enron , the bankrupt energy firm .
The bank also said it would set up a $ 900 m reserve related to other outstanding litigation against the firm stemming from Enron and other issues .
It warned that it could be another four years before all the cases were put behind it .
Yesterday 's agreement was reached with all 11 of the insurance firms that issued surety bonds against the deals with Enron .
The settlement ends a month - long court battle that has done little to repair Wall Street 's tarnished image .
The firm will take a $ 400 m charge against fourth quarter earnings for the sum it has failed to recover .
JP Morgan sued the insurance firms after they refused to pay the guarantees on oil and gas trades arranged between Enron and an offshore subsidiary of the bank , Mahonia , after the energy firm filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 .
The insurance firms argued that JP Morgan had misrepresented the deals as transactions when they were nothing more than disguised loans .
The pivotal moment of the case appeared to occur when the judge , Jed Rakoff , ruled a few days before Christmas that internal bank emails describing derivatives transactions as "" disguised loans "" could be admitted as evidence .
JP Morgan claimed the emails did not refer to the Enron transactions in question .
"" We believe our firm acted appropriately but , given the current environment and the uncertainty of jury verdicts , we felt it was prudent to accept the settlement , "" the bank said .
The jury was due to begin deliberations yesterday .
Losing the case outright would have wiped out much of the $ 2.1bn in profits JP Morgan has made over the first nine months of its financial year .
Shares in the bank had risen 6 % to $ 25.23 by lunchtime in New York .
Like other Wall Street banks , JP Morgan is eager to put the financial scandals of last year behind it .
In the dying weeks of 2002 , the bank agreed to pay $ 80 m as part of the $ 1.4bn industry - wide settlement of allegations that investors had been deliberately misled during the stock market boom .
JP Morgan , Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have been grilled in congressional hearings , and investigations into the collapse of Enron are continuing .
The bank last week launched a lawsuit against Enron in an attempt to recover $ 184 m in loans that the bank alleges the disgraced energy firm has no claim over .
The suit argues that the cash was part of a $ 500 m line of credit to an Enron subsidiary which was advanced in order to fund the building of five power plants and should not be included as an asset of the bankrupt energy firm ."
2003-01-04,"Robert Rubin , the chairman of Citigroup , has been cleared of any wrongdoing in urging a senior US treasury official to intervene on behalf of Enron as the energy group spiralled toward bankruptcy .
Mr Rubin , who resigned as treasury secretary in July 1999 before joining the board of the Wall Street bank , sparked a political furore after it emerged that he had called Peter Fisher , the under secretary of the treasury on November 8 2001 .
According to a report issued by US Senate investigators , he made the call after learning that Enron 's credit rating was about to be downgraded by Moody 's Investors Service , jeopardising a planned merger with rival Dynegy and $ 1bn loan the bank had made to the energy firm .
Mr Rubin , who remains a leading Democrat , asked Mr Fisher to lean on the credit rating agencies and get them to delay publishing their downgrades .
Mr Fisher refused , the merger fell apart and Enron filed for bankruptcy in December of that year .
Mr Rubin and William Harrison , the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase , which was also advising on the merger , both made calls to Moody 's as well asking for the downgrade to be forestalled .
Republicans , whose own connections to Enron were under scrutiny at the time , made capital of Mr Rubin 's attempt to prevent the energy firm 's failure .
But the report issued yesterday by the Senate governmental affairs committee said : "" It does not appear that Rubin violated any laws or regulations in contacting Fisher and proposing that the treasury department contact a credit rating agency in connection with Enron 's rating . ""
Interviewed by Senate staff , Mr Rubin said the phone call to Mr Fisher was "" not only proper
but I would do it again "" .
Citigroup is struggling to restore its reputation after the financial scandals of last year .
A separate congressional committee investigating Wall Street 's links to Enron on Thursday called on financial regulators to examine a string of deals ."
2003-01-13,"Glenn Roeder is so honest it seems fair to assume he was not guilty of the greatest public deception since Enron when he announced he hoped to complete his transfer dealings by buying a striker .
In that case the West Ham manager is embarking on a bold but risky strategy .
It means Roeder will leave untouched a defence which has conceded more goals than any Premiership side .
He is either trusting that they will tighten up or gambling that his team will score more than they let in .
For Roeder , who does not have the budget to sign players in all the positions he would like , this month is decisive .
Soon there will be no chance to wheel and deal .
A few weeks can make or break a career or club .
On the face of things finding the net has not been West Ham 's biggest problem .
Two goals on Saturday followed two at Blackburn in their previous league match .
After 22 games they have scored only two fewer than Everton and Southampton had at the same stage .
Those are top - six clubs .
Here Jermain Defoe showed his talent , particularly in the first half during which he scored from Steve Lomas 's cross .
His tendency to shoot on sight may occasionally frustrate team - mates but he rarely misses the target and has four goals in three matches .
Joe Cole , too , is starting to score the goals which have been lacking from his game .
He equalised and played with real verve .
In two or three weeks Roeder hopes to have Paolo Di Canio and Frédéric Kanouté fit , and Lee Bowyer should add strike power .
Bowyer was not at his sharpest after a month out but three times made trademark bursts into the box .
Trevor Sinclair did a decent job up front , where Don Hutchison and Ian Pearce can also operate .
When Sir Bobby Robson said he felt West Ham would survive , it was on the basis of their attacking prowess . ""
Of all the teams at the bottom I see West Ham getting out of it because they can score goals and , if you can score , you have a chance , "" said the Newcastle manager who will today discuss with Laurent Robert reported remarks
- denied by the Frenchman - criticising his English team - mates .
On the basis that high - scoring teams rarely go down it is understandable Roeder wants a striker , with Tottenham 's Les Ferdinand a target .
But , since the Premiership 's launch , the teams conceding most goals have always been relegated .
Everton let in four yesterday but they and Southampton have prospered from being defensively tight .
West Ham last kept a clean sheet in October and have not found a reliable central defensive partnership .
West Ham did not defend dreadfully against Newcastle , who possess one of the Premiership 's most dangerous attacks .
But another two goals conceded meant two points dropped and they could easily have lost late on .
Though Jermaine Jenas 's equaliser was unstoppable , it was born of Christian Dailly 's failure to clear .
The same defender was partly at fault for Newcastle 's opener , beaten by Shola Ameobi in the build - up to a finish by Craig Bellamy .
"" I would like to sign both a striker and a defender
but I do n't think the money available is going to stretch that far , "" said Roeder , "" and I would prefer to bring in a striker .
"" There were pluses for Roeder , beyond his team moving off the bottom .
They confirmed they have the talent to stay up and worked exceedingly hard in midfield , where Cole and Michael Carrick caught the eye .
With games to come at West Bromwich and Bolton and at home to Sunderland , West Ham remain defiant .
It would be nice to think Roeder 's attacking instincts will be rewarded .
But the club could stand or fall on this next signing .
Man of the match : Joe Cole ( West Ham )"

The FSA is pressing the government to shake up corporate policing and grant it the same armoury as its US counterpart .
Such a change would see the FSA responsible for investigating the accounts of companies suspected of breaching accounting standards and laws .
The Financial Times said the DTI had provisionally agreed that the FSA should determine which accounts need to be scrutinised .
But it added that FSA chairman Sir Howard Davies is urging ministers for the regulator to take on an even bigger role .
Under such a plan the FSA , which refused to comment on the report , would resemble the US Securities and Exchange Commission .
It would also help tighten up procedure ahead of the adoption by EU - listed firms of international accounting standards in 2005 .
Ministers ordered a review of the way company accounts were investigated last July after the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
The headline - grabbing cases rocked investor confidence and contributed to the 24 % slide in the FTSE 100 Index last year .
Currently UK accounts are scrutinised by the Financial Reporting Review Panel , which can only act after complaints or media reports .
The government is believed to want more proactive investigations and a report could be out later this month .
The Financial Times said the DTI is keen to retain the Panel in some form despite its relatively small size .
A recent rule change meant the FSA can now impose unlimited fines on breaches of listing regulations committed after December 2001 .
The watchdog has been criticised recently for not taking enough robust action amid the falling stock markets .
Sir Howard Davies announced in October his intention to step down as chairman later this year to become director of the London School of Economics ."
2003-01-17,"AOL Time Warner is facing further criticism after announcing that Dick Parsons will become chairman as well as chief executive of the company , following the resignation of Steve Case earlier this week .
The move directly contradicts recommendations given by the US government in the wake of the Enron and Worldcom scandals that the two roles should be kept separate .
"" I am highly gratified that the board shares my determination to maximise AOL Time Warner 's tremendous potential , "" Mr Parsons said last night .
"" As we address the challenges facing our company and the industries in which we operate , I will work together with the extraordinary people in this company to focus on increasing value for our customers and our shareholders , "" he added .
Steve Case , who built AOL from scratch before pulling off the £ 66bn merger with Time Warner , announced his resignation earlier this week amid growing shareholder anxiety over the company 's stock , which has lost half its value in the last year .
By taking on the dual role , Mr Parsons completes a remarkable personal rehabilitation .
The former Time Warner president was virtually sidelined when AOL bought Time Warner in a record - breaking £ 34bn deal in 2001 .
But as the lustre of the America Online internet division wore off in the wake of a slump in revenues , slowing subscriber growth and an SEC probe into its accounting practices , former Time Warner executives have retaken the reins .
They face trying to restore AOL Time Warner 's reputation with Wall Street investors , whose disenchantment with the media giant has seen its value fall 60 % since the merger .
They broadly welcomed the appointment of Mr Parsons , who is seen as a consensus builder and a steadying influence on the company .
In the last year , nearly all the key architects of the merger have left , including Jerry Levin , the Time Warner chief executive who pushed for the AOL Time Warner deal .
They have been replaced by a team chosen by Mr Parsons , who , in the short term at least , appears willing to try to work out America Online 's problems rather than selling it ."
2003-01-20,"The chancellor , Gordon Brown , was accused of "" cooking the books "" and "" Enron - style "" accounting today for his decision not to include Network Rail in the government accounts .
Members of the Labour - dominated treasury select committee said ministers should make clear the extent of its "" contingent liabilities "" , such as a £ 21bn loan guarantee to Railtrack 's not - for - profit successor .
Mr Brown chose not to put the sum in November 's pre - Budget report after the office for national statistics ( ONS ) ruled that Network Rail should count as a private company .
They had been advised by Department of Transport accountants that because the loan facilities had not yet been drawn on , they did not need to appear in the public accounts .
But the move was disputed by Whitehall spending watchdog the National Audit Office ( NAO ) , whose head said the public would find it incomprehensible .
Sir John Bourn , the comptroller and auditor general , said it should be made clear that the exchequer would have to carry the costs of any failure .
Opposition MPs said the government was hiding the extent of its underwriting of major projects to give a more positive picture of the state of the nation 's finances and "" massage down "" debt levels .
Today the committee 's investigation found that "" the extent of contingent liabilities is now of such significance to the state of public finances "" that they should be listed in "" the red book "" - the chancellor 's annual financial statement and Budget .
The team of MPs , led by Conservative Michael Fallon , said it should also include an estimate of the proportion of the liabilities that might have to be met and an indication of where a complete list of the liabilities could be found .
Its report also raised fears of a "" conflict of interest "" in government departments giving advice to the ONS about their own arrangements , and said they should be approved by the NAO .
Contingent liabilities should also be included when new whole - of - government accounts - a measure aimed at boosting transparency - are introduced , the committee found .
Mr Fallon said that classifying Network Rail as a private company in the national accounts but in the public sector for accounting purposes was "" confusing to the public "" .
The shadow chancellor , Michael Howard , said : "" Every week a new report casts doubt on the chancellor 's credibility .
This report confirms the view that the government has been engaged in Enron - style accounting .
It is clear that Gordon Brown has been cooking the books . ""
Twice in a week a Labour - dominated committee has told the chancellor to come clean over the public finances . ""
Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb , a member of the select committee , said Mr Brown had been caught out "" cooking the books "" .
He said : "" Gordon Brown has been slapped on the wrist for cooking the books . ""
By trying to hide billions in contingent liabilities , the chancellor has shown that he is not committed to transparent accountancy . ""
The challenge for Gordon Brown is to open the iron gates of the Treasury to proper scrutiny . """
2003-01-21,"Michael Howard , the shadow chancellor , last night accused Gordon Brown of "" cooking the books , "" after a Labour - dominated committee of backbench MPs denounced the Treasury 's attempt to hide the public sector 's financial responsibility for the railways .
On a day when he launched a full - scale attack on the chancellor 's financial record , Mr Howard accused the government of "" Enron - style accounting "" , for burying its £ 21bn liability for Network Rail .
Paul Boateng , the chief secretary to the Treasury , was forced to defend Mr Brown , following a hard - hitting report from the cross - party Treasury select committee , which called for the government 's so - called "" contingent liabilities "" to be totted up in the Budget . ""
Labour ca n't have it both ways , "" said Michael Fallon , the Conservative chairman of the sub - committee which produced the report .
"" You ca n't go down to the party conference and claim to be renationalising the railways , and then say these are private sector liabilities .
You ca n't take the applause without accepting the debit rating . ""
"" If they do n't now agree to this proposal , they are as good as admitting that they want to hide these liabilities . ""
Mr Boateng dismissed Michael Howard 's criticisms of the government 's accounting practices as utterly without foundation , saying : "" We have introduced fully transparent rules , much clearer than those we inherited from the government of which Michael Howard was a member "" .
The shadow chancellor used a speech at the Institute of Directors last night to deliver a damning critique of the government 's economic record , accusing Mr Brown of "" tax and spend and fail "" .
Mr Howard said the economy was suffering from very severe imbalances , corporate profitability was at its lowest level for a decade , and Britain was running its biggest trade deficit in goods since records began in 1697 .
The higher national insurance contributions due in April were a "" tax on jobs at a time of economic uncertainty .
This is a damaging tax , imposed for the wrong reasons at the wrong time . ""
Mr Howard said the public was not getting the improvements in services that were promised for their higher taxes .
The government was "" locked in a vicious circle of ever higher taxes and ever failing public services . ""
In contrast , the chancellor 's spending plans were praised last night by the governor of the Bank of England , Sir Eddie George , who said the fiscal boost had underpinned the economy at the right time .
"" We [ the monetary policy committee ] were helped by the chancellor 's decision to increase public spending , "" Sir Eddie said in a speech in Scotland .
"" That 's something which , as a central banker , I 'm supposed to frown upon ... but I must confess to you it is something that I positively welcomed in the immediate situation with which we were confronted . ""
Without it we would have been even more dependent upon consumer demand than we have been . ""
Sir Eddie dropped a broad hint that there would be no need for an immediate increase in the cost of borrowing . ""
The labour market remains remarkably robust , and the prospect for inflation - and hence the prospect for interest rates - remains relatively benign . ""
The governor said he thought it unlikely that the global economy would suffer a double - dip recession or that the UK economy would be hit by a retrenchment in domestic demand triggered by a "" crash "" in house prices ."
2003-01-22,"Citigroup and Credit Suisse were yesterday counting the cost of the scandals that erupted on Wall Street last year when both delivered sharply lower results .
Citigroup , the world 's largest financial services group , said profits had fallen 37 % to $ 2.4bn ( £ 1.5bn ) in the fourth quarter after charges including its share of the industry wide settlement of allegations that banks issued deliberately misleading research during the dotcom boom .
Provisions have also been made for regulatory inquiries and private lawsuits relating to the bank 's dealings with Enron , the bankrupt energy firm .
Credit Suisse hit by many of the same concerns ran up record losses .
Sanford Weill , Citigroup chief executive , summed up a difficult year : "" During 2002 , our company faced several significant challenges ; continued weakness in global markets , record bankruptcies in the developed world , political and economic upheaval in a number of countries in which we operate , and intense scrutiny of its business practices .
"" Citigroup is taking a total charge of $ 1.3bn , as well as increasing its bad debt reserve by a further $ 254 m as loans to the telecoms and technology sector and in volatile countries like Argentina are written off .
The charge was behind a loss of $ 344 m at Salomon Smith Barney , Citigroup 's investment banking division .
Salomon revenues in the quarter were 9 % lower at $ 4.7bn .
Across the year , Citigroup was buoyed by its consumer division , including retail banking and credit cards .
The consumer division grew 21 % in 2002 .
In the full year , group profits were 8 % higher at $ 15.3bn .
The charges at Credit Suisse - including a $ 150 m settlement with US regulators , a further $ 250 m against the sale of its Pershing business and an additional $ 450 m against legal actions relating to Enron - helped push the group into a Sfr3.4bn ( £ 1.5bn ) loss for the year .
But senior executives insisted the aim was to get the group back into the black in this year and made it clear that the firm intends to hang on to its investment bank , Credit Suisse First Boston . ""
The board has made it very clear that it is committed to current structures and businesses , "" said co - chief executive John Mack ."
2003-01-22,"After confidence was shattered by the September 11 attacks on the US and the collapse of Enron and WorldCom , the theme of this year 's World Economic Forum in Davos , "" Building Trust "" , is appropriate .
War may be about to break out and security is high on most governments ' agendas .
But beyond this , ActionAid believes that rich nations and corporations face growing insecurity unless they win more trust from people in poor countries through new measures to help to increase fairness and justice .
Three years ago the rich countries signed up to eight goals that must be achieved if we are to overcome poverty by 2015 .
There are precise commitments on health , food , education , gender equality and the environment .
But it is glaringly obvious that we are still waiting for the resources and policies that would allow the UN 's millennium development goals to be achieved .
It is unlikely that the rich countries will take their commitments seriously , so long as they see aid as charity and poor people as beneficiaries .
Poor people should receive assistance as an entitlement , by virtue of being members of the global community and they have the right of participation in decisions affecting them .
Here are some of the things that the rich world 's business and political leaders should do if they want to build trust with the people in poor countries : · Increase development aid .
Estimates suggest , that as a minimum , an additional £ 25bn-£35bn per annum is needed to achieve the millennium development goals .
Even this would still fall far short of the UN target of 0.7 % of national income .
· Untie aid .
Half of world aid remains tied , and must be spent on goods and services from the donor country .
If all aid were untied , an additional £ 3bn would be released .
· Get rid of unfair subsidies to agriculture and industry that encourage overproduction in rich countries and undermine the livelihood of producers in poor countries . · Review the trade - related aspects of the intellectual property rights ( Trips ) agreement and remove the requirement that all countries should enforce patents on crop seeds . ·
Act on the commitment made at the Doha meeting of the World Trade Organisation in 2001 , to give people in poor countries access to cheap alternatives to patented drugs .
· Introduce mandatory codes of conduct outlawing exploitative , dangerous and polluting business practices .
Conflict diamonds , which financed ugly wars in Africa , have been outlawed .
Soft approaches to corporate social responsibility , based on self - regulation , are inadequate .
The business leaders at Davos know that the world is not in sound economic health .
Formerly strong economies such as Germany and Japan are in trouble .
War in Iraq would deliver a further shock to the world economy - not to mention the appalling humanitarian cost .
While 1.2 billion of the world 's people are still living in poverty , the US - led mobilisation against Iraq is diverting attention and vital resources away from the most pressing issue of our times ."
2003-01-23,"Businesses worldwide face an uphill struggle to wipe out corruption and restore public trust after the collapse of Enron , the world 's top anti - corruption think tank said yesterday .
Launching its annual global corruption report , Transparency International said public confidence in governments and firms had fallen sharply over the past year , as one scandal followed another . ""
The over - arching theme is one of trust , "" said TI 's Jeremy Pope .
"" People just do not believe politicians any more ; they do n't trust the private sector any more . ""
Cataloguing cases of corruption and bribery across the world - from the Hobsons - Co - op cash - for - contracts scandal in Britain to police protection rackets in the Ivory Coast - TI said the key to progress was greater access to information . ""
The antidote is for us to know much , much more about what they 're doing , "" Mr Pope said .
The organisation criticised knee - jerk "" actionism "" among western governments keen to be seen tackling the problem .
Jermyn Brooks , TI 's executive director , said the US Sarbanes - Oxley act , aimed at cleaning up corporate America , had failed to get to grips with corruption .
"" Forcing CEOs to sign off the company 's accounts looks good , but it 's irrelevant , "" he said .
"" There are much more fundamental issues , like whether the all - powerful US CEO is tenable . ""
TI said it was working with firms and governments to set up ground rules .
These included "" integrity pacts "" for public contracts , in which firms agree not to pay bribes to help the bidding process ."
2003-01-25,"Former Enron lawyer jailed A former London - based lawyer for bankrupt energy trader Enron was last night beginning a year in jail after admitting embezzling almost £ 400,000 from the company .
Von Bock und Polach , 38 , had been an Enron vice - president and assistant general counsel on a salary of £ 250,000 .
He pleaded guilty to 17 counts of theft from Enron subsidiaries .
The fraud was unearthed by an Enron director suspicious of German consultancy firm GU after it billed for work in countries in which Enron did not operate .
An internal inquiry revealed that only Von Bock und Polach knew anything of GU .
It later emerged that GU 's registered address was Von Bock und Polach 's home in Hampstead , London .
Porsche powers ahead German sportscar - maker Porsche posted a sharp rise in earnings in the first half of its fiscal year as the world 's most profitable motor manufacturer again defied the weak economic conditions hitting its rivals .

tax profit in the six months to January 31 rose 18 % to 185 m euros ( £ 122 m ) while revenues were up almost 20 % to about 2.2bn euros .
The company said it would sell about 65,000 vehicles in the year ending in July , up from 54,234 in the previous year .
EU close to Microsoft ruling European competition commissioner Mario Monti said a long - running monopolies investigation into Microsoft was now well advanced and a ruling would be made in the "" first part of this year "" .
Mr Monti , speaking at the world economic forum in Davos , Switzerland , said all options remained open but any ruling needed to take into account developments in US cases against Microsoft and should benefit consumers .
Mr Monti said the EU would make a statement "" in the next few days "" about an inquiry into whether France Télécom 's 9bn euros of state financing was illegal .
E*Trade chief steps down E*Trade 's chairman and chief executive , Christos Cotsakos , resigned from the online bank and brokerage yesterday .
Mr Cotsakos came under fire from shareholders last year over his 2001 compensation package , which reached almost $ 80 m ( £ 50 m ) .
In May last year , he agreed to give back about $ 20 m .
He will be replaced by the company 's president , Mitchell Caplan .
Unilever sees strong growth
The head of Anglo - Dutch consumer products group
Unilever said yesterday that he expected 2002 sales growth of its top brands to exceed the 5.3 % recorded in 2001 .
"" I ca n't give a figure for the fourth quarter because that is price - sensitive .
But we will do better in 2002 than in 2001 , "" said chief executive Antony Burgmans .
Henderson stays on Land Britain 's largest property group , Land Securities , announced yesterday that chief executive Ian Henderson was to stay on and oversee a revamp - but that it had also appointed a possible successor .
The market expected the firm to announce a replacement for Mr Henderson , 59 , and the uncertainty unsettled its shares .
The firm appointed Francis Salway , 41 , head of development business , as its chief operating officer ."
2003-01-26,"The Government will launch a crackdown this week on accountancy firms that offer lucrative consultancy services to companies they also audit .
Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt will announce measures resulting from a year - long review by the Government 's co - ordinating group on auditing and accounting set up in the wake of the Enron scandal .
The measures seeking to end the ' cosy ' relationship between some companies and their auditors will : · instruct powerful new industry regulators to monitor consultancy work ; · demand fuller disclosure by companies of non - audit work conducted by auditors ; · require accountants to list any clients from whom they derive more than 5 per cent of their total fees ; · impose a two - year ' cooling - off period ' on anyone seeking to join a company from its auditors ; · require individual auditors to rotate after five years .
Hewitt wants to end the possibility of conflicts of interest that arise when accountants receive business from companies they audit .
A DTI source said : ' We want a review of the circumstances where it is permissible for accountants to provide these services . '
Measures will be enforced by ' spot checks ' on accounts ."
2003-01-29,"Government plans to reform regulation of the accounting profession in the wake of Enron - style conflicts of interest were attacked last night by Unison , the leading public sector union .
Ahead of today 's announcement by the trade and industry secretary , Patricia Hewitt , the union complained that the "" big four "" accountancy firms have "" stitched up "" the private finance initiative ( PFI ) and public private partnership ( PPP ) which provide private cash for major public projects like schools and hospitals .
A previous report from Unison found 45 examples where the main accountancy firm acted as financial advisers and auditors on major public authority projects - the kind of conflict of interest which Ms Hewitt is seeking to curb in the private sector .
Today 's proposals are expected to merge the financial reporting council with the accountancy foundation , the current watchdog body , and strengthen its monitoring functions .
But it will remain funded by the industry itself .
A Unison report claims there is a revolving door between the big four and government .
Ms Hewitt once worked for Andersen Consulting , the management consultancy arm of the now defunct global accountancy firm in the Enron affair .
"" Ministers , ex - ministers , MPs , and civil servants have all been in the pay of these firms who , in turn , provide secondees to government and sit on key working groups .
The big four devise , develop and profit from PFI policies , "" Unison says ."
2003-01-29,"The accountancy industry is to be overseen by a new regulator in an effort to avoid an Enron - style scandal in Britain , the government announced today .
The new body , unveiled in the Commons by trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt , would set , enforce and monitor accounting and auditing standards as well as oversee the regulatory functions of existing accountancy bodies . ""
The collapse of Enron and WorldCom - and the accountancy malpractice they revealed - appalled investors all over the world , "" Ms Hewitt said .
"" We owe it to savers , investors and employees as well as honest business people to ensure that our defences are as robust as they sensibly can be . ""
The new body is the centrepiece of a wide - ranging package of reforms following the recommendations of two reviews set up last year .
The final report of the coordinating group on audit and accounting issues and the findings of a DTI review into the accountancy profession were both published today .
"" The government has focused on rationalising the regulation of accountants so the system is less complicated and more transparent , "" said Gavin Hinks , news editor of industry newspaper Accountancy Age .
"" They have also indicated that they are broadly happy with the way services are run and have accepted the measures accounting firms have already put in place to get their houses in order . ""
Tim Yeo , a Conservative MP , said he "" broadly welcomed "" the government 's approach , a response broadly echoed by the industry , which had lobbied against the introduction of too many new regulations . ""
The government appears to have succeeded in avoiding over - regulation , "" said Lord Borrie , chairman of the accountancy trade body , Accountancy Foundation .
"" We are confident that the proposals will provide the necessary degree of independent oversight in a cost - effective way . ""
Today 's announcement is the latest in a raft of new measures designed to strengthen corporate governance in the UK after similar moves in the US in the wake of a spate of scandals on Wall Street .
Earlier this month Derek Higgs , a former investment banker appointed to review the role of non - executive company directors , and Sir Robert Smith , also appointed by the government to look at audit committees , published their reports .
"" Our approach has been measured and proportionate but we 've been tough where we needed to be , "" Ms Hewitt said .
"" Today 's announcement puts our corporate governance structures among the best in the world for the good of the millions of pensioners , savers and business that depend on them . ""
Although the UK has avoided the malpractices that did so much to undermine investor confidence in the US , Britain had little choice but to introduce its own reforms in line with the new "" best practices "" in America .
Highlights of the package include : · A single authoritative regulator with responsibility for setting accounting and auditing standards , pro - actively enforcing and monitoring them as well as overseeing the regulatory functions of the professional accountancy bodies . ·
Transferring responsibility for setting ethical standards on independence , objectivity and integrity from professional accountancy bodies to an independent body - the auditing practices board .
·
A new independent audit inspection unit to monitor the audits of listed companies , major charities and pension funds - work currently done by the accountancy profession .
· The rotation of the lead audit partner every five years and greater transparency in major audit firms ' businesses . · A break of at least two years before partners and senior employees who leave auditing firms can work for a company they audited . · Strengthening the role of audit committees and increasing the disclosure by large companies about non - audit services they buy from their auditor ."
2003-01-29,"The government will give the accountancy profession a generally clean bill of health today after a year - long investigation .
It has concluded that the structure of Britain 's auditing firms , the rules governing their conduct and the nature of their relationship with clients are sufficiently robust to eliminate any immediate risk of an Enron - style corporate collapse here .
However , Patricia Hewitt , the trade and industry secretary , will impose some important changes as she unveils the findings of the investigation .
She will make it clear that vigilance is critical to guard against lapses in professional standards , and will demand greater transparency from the big accounting firms .
She will insist on clear procedures to ensure auditors do not develop cosy relationships with their clients , and transfer regulation of the profession from the accountancy federation to the more independent financial reporting council .
But the firms will not be forced to ditch lucrative non - audit work for clients - notably providing tax advice - unless conflicts of interest threatening the auditor 's independence are identified .
Today 's report is the third tranche of new rules to be introduced on both sides of the Atlantic in only 10 days - all aimed at improving corporate governance and strengthening auditor independence to ensure there are no more Enrons .
First came the parallel reports from Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith ; then the securities and exchange commission 's introduction of new regulations to implement more of the Sarbanes - Oxley legislation ; and now the government has weighed in with the findings of its own inquiry .
That the accountancy profession has emerged relatively unscathed from such a wide - ranging examination of its role and responsibility , conducted against a political backdrop of fear and retribution , is being attributed to the role played by Peter Wyman , the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales .
For the past year , Mr Wyman has been engaged in shuttle diplomacy between London , Washington and Brussels .
He has persuaded legislators , ministers and officials that the accountancy profession will not shirk its responsibilities to shareholders , and has argued eloquently that any changes to the structure of the profession must be designed to improve the quality of the audit and enhance the integrity of auditor independence . ""
A large part of what I 've been trying to do is calm everyone down , "" said Mr Wyman .
"" These are very important issues .
We 've got to deal with them in a carefully considered way . ""
He is confident that today 's government findings will continue his own philosophy of sensible reform . ""
A huge over - reaction would simply damage business by trying to solve a problem that did n't exist , "" he said .
Mr Wyman is not merely battling to preserve the status quo .
As one of PricewaterhouseCoopers ' brightest tax partners , he has learnt the importance of constructive dialogue aimed at delivering tangible improvements .
He has already overseen the pre - emptive introduction of measures to enhance auditor independence without undermining audit quality .
"" There is a great risk that we take auditor independence to an illogical extreme by having incredibly independent auditors that are completely unable to do the job , "" he said .
"" Then quality goes down rather than up . ""
The ICAEW has already introduced measures to guard against auditors becoming too cosy with clients .
It has a five - year rotation of lead audit partners , and has established the concept of an independent review partner who can oversee the audit but who does not know the client .
Even on the vexed question of no - audit services , the profession can report good progress towards ensuring that the lust for lucrative contracts does not affect the audit relationship with the client .
Mr Wyman insists that turning the big firms into purely auditing businesses will have negative implications for the quality of the audit .
Mindful of accountancy 's less - than - glamorous image portrayed in the Monty Python sketch of the accountant who wants to be a lion tamer , he gives warning of recruitment shortfalls if the profession becomes purely audit - based . ""
In the longer term , I would worry because no one would want to be an accountant .
If we created an audit - only profession we would n't be able to recruit .
Twenty years from now , we 'd not have the same quality of staff as we do today . ""
Great shame
In the short term , he also fears that the quality of the audit would decrease if auditors could not call on the specialist staff who provide important support on complex and technical issues .
My Wyman has been able to persuade legislators of the dangers of introducing rules that are made counter - productive .
One accountant said : "" He 's done a great job of making the point that any reform has to be effective .
The great shame is that he steps down as president in June . ""
Mr Wyman is less concerned about his own role in the debate , preferring to focus on how that debate is shaped . ""
The most significant change on both sides of the Atlantic is the enhanced role for the audit committee , which changes the fundamental relationship between auditors and their clients by bringing the interests of auditors into direct alignment with the interests of shareholders , "" he said .
"" This may all seem quite subtle stuff , but I think the change of the audit relationship will be quite deep - rooted .
This will be the biggest change and it will deal with both the perceptions and reality of auditor independence . ""
Ms Hewitt may well go out of her way in parliament today to argue that the accountancy profession is not getting off lightly .
Mr Wyman will not be depriving her of the chance to demonstrate the government 's commitment to preventing an Enron happening here .
No one is prepared to say it could never happen here , but after the reforms , that is less likely ."
2003-01-30,"The government has ordered a complete overhaul of the accountancy profession 's regulatory framework as part of an initiative to protect Britain from an Enron - style corporate collapse .
The overhaul , which will see the introduction of a single super - regulator , was part of a package of measures announced yesterday by trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt . ""
The collapse of Enron and WorldCom , and the accountancy malpractice they revealed , appalled investors all over the world , "" she said .
"" We owe it to savers , investors and employees as well as honest business people to ensure that our defences are as robust as they sensibly can be . ""
The reform package follows the recommendations of the two reviews set up by Ms Hewitt and Gordon Brown last year .
The government is proposing a single regulator under the auspices of a revamped Financial Reporting Council with responsibility for setting and enforcing accounting and auditing standards , as well as overseeing the regulatory functions of professional accountancy bodies .
The Financial Reporting Review Panel will continue to investigate defective company accounting but will take advice from the financial services authority on which companies should be investigated .
The government stopped short of ordering accountancy firms to end the supply of lucrative non - audit services such as tax advice to their clients .
Peter Wyman , president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales , praised the decision not to impose such a ban .
"" I particularly welcome government 's recognition in the report that there are benefits to companies , their shareholders and audit quality arising from the provision by auditors of some non - audit services such as tax advice .
In the areas of IT systems installation and internal audit outsourcing , we have already gone further than the government 's recommendations , and these services will no longer be provided .
"" The CBI and leading accountancy firms also welcomed what was seen as a measured response to concerns about auditor independence .
Companies will be forced to give more details of non - audit services they buy from their auditors and the audit firms will have to make their work more transparent by producing full annual accounts .
John Cridland , deputy director - general , of the CBI , said : "" Patricia Hewitt has announced measures that will boost confidence in UK boardrooms and auditing .
The government is to be applauded for not overreacting to financial scandals in America with hasty or heavy - handed legislation .
"" There had been fears that the government might introduce the compulsory rotation of audit firms to prevent the development of cosy relationships which could undermine auditor independence .
Instead Ms Hewitt opted for the rotation of the lead audit partner every five years .
She has also barred partners and senior employees from taking up employment with a client they audit within two years of leaving the firm ."
2003-02-02,"Why does business figure so meagrely in recent film and TV drama ?
Needless to say , to ask the question is not to support the loony right 's conspiracy theories of anti - business bias - a thesis which , since Enron outdid anything fiction could imagine , has self - destructed with an enormous raspberry .
But consider .
The momentous last 15 years have seen the collapse of communism ; then the expansion and explosion of the 1990s bubble in a welter of excess and scandal , leaving small investors and pensioners to pick up the pieces .
What is this but a modern morality tale on a global scale ?
Business is at the heart of many of today 's sharpest ethical debates - globalisation , poverty , even the future of the planet .
Yet representations of the perennial themes of ambition and power , good and evil , take place in the never - never terrain of Hogwarts School , Middle Earth and intergalactic space rather than in Wall Street or the City , where the real dramas of our lives are shaped .
The underlying history of business in the Nineties was a struggle for the corporation 's soul .
But little of this is reflected on the screen .
Indeed , apart from a brace of gritty French films ( the excellent Ressources humaines and L'Emploi du temps ) , the estimable Ken Loach ( Bread and Roses ) , and a couple of US movies ( The Boiler Room , the feelgood Erin Brokovich ) , the real world of work barely surfaces on the screen or page .
Ironically , Dallas and Dynasty , in the Seventies andEighties and the film Wall Street , now look like more prescient reflections of millennial US excess than anything produced contemporaneously ; while in the less exuberant UK , the great issues are characteristically milled down into the petty tyrants and grotesques of The Office , themselves the corporate equivalent of that most enduring encapsulation of the British entrepreneur , Arthur Daley .
Today 's paucity of imagination is odd considering that work ( or lack of it ) and business are the direct or indirect subject of at least three cinema masterpieces - Modern Times , Citizen Kane and Bicycle Thieves - and inform whole genres , for example postwar Italian Neo - Realism .
The archetypal Western ( cattle barons vs settlers ) is about the founding of US capitalism .
Could it be that today 's shenanigans are a bit near the bone ?
Tinseltown , after all , is the capital of hype and porn as well as the legit film industry , and its accounting was legendarily creative before Enron was born .
Whatever the reasons , it was cheering recently to watch a rare Hollywood movie that instead of treating business as a plot accessory is actually about the fundamental issues : the purpose of the company , the nature of work , and the responsibilities of those who run it .
A very ' now ' story of boardroom intrigue and dodgy share dealing , it pits six directors in competition to control a quoted industrial company after the sudden death of its charismatic saviour and architect .
The company , a furniture maker , has recently been compromising on quality to cut costs , and in the climactic scene in the penthouse Wall Street boardroom - amid Gothic , even church - like furnishings to underline the point - the battle for the company 's soul is played out in the rivalry of two candidates for the president 's job .
Rarely has the dilemma of capitalist governance been so clearly stated in fiction .
The front - runner , an ambitious , efficiency - obsessed accountant , believes that the company answers only to its shareholders . '
To fulfil that obligation , the primary emphasis must be placed on return on investment .
That 's the only sound basis for corporate management today . '
That 's why , too , the company should be run by a financial expert , someone who can ' plug every profit leak ' and ' run to earth every cause of waste and inefficiency ' .
There is a responsibility to shareholders , responds his rival , an engineer who cares most about the things the company makes .
And then he makes an extraordinary speech .
The directors , he declares , have a bigger responsibility , to keep the company alive - and that means sometimes investing profits to grow rather than maximising dividends .
The firm 's leader , he adds with growing confidence , lost his vision of what the company was for in the last few years .
That was why the firm faltered , producing shoddy goods and paring back spending on new products . '
The force behind a great company ca n't be the pride of one man , ' he says in a jibe at all the outsize corporate egos now in the dock . '
It has to be the pride of thousands .
You ca n't make men work for money alone - you starve their souls when you try it , and you can starve a company to death in the same way .
How do you suppose people feel when they buy this stuff ?
What do you suppose our employees feel when they make it ?
What must they think of a management that stoops to sell this kind of junk to put a dime a year on the stockholders ' dividend ? '
It 's a great speech , and the real engineer deservedly overcomes the financial one . '
We will never again ask a man to do anything that will poison his pride in himself and his work , ' he promises , in a peroration which could have come straight from the mouth of quality prophet W. Edwards Deming .
The company will pin its future on making low - priced furniture , but it will sell on function and value , not gimmicks . '
We 're going to give people what they need at prices they can afford to pay , and as fresh needs come up we 'll meet them too .
And what 's more , we 're going to do it together . '
Too good to be true ?
Oddly not : it 's a measure of our confused times that it 's the optimistic message that looks radical , even subversive .
As both a reminder of the power of the imagination to illuminate the drama of business and a statement of the basics at a moment when too many managers have lost sight of and faith in them
it could hardly be bettered - a true message for 2003 .
Ah , but there 's just one thing .
The film , Executive Suite , was made by Robert Wise in 1954 .
Maybe its other lesson is that we 're not quite as sophisticated as we think we are .
Simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk · Re ' The Scary Mr Mintzberg ' last week
, I should point out that ' scary ' was meant as a compliment .
As many of you made clear , his views are a breath of fresh air which can only encourage the good guys ( and only frighten the bad ones ) ."
2003-02-14,"Like most oil companies , Enron created partnerships - with the assistance of banks , accounting firms , and law firms - for its projects , such as oil wells and pipelines .
These partnerships - not Enron - borrowed money , purchased assets , and entered into contracts .
By using partnerships ( or other legal entities , such as trusts or corporations ) , Enron could create non - recourse financing - meaning that the company could borrow for a project based solely on the assets of the partnership ; investors in the partnership could not hold Enron responsible for debts .
So long as Enron controlled no more than 50 % of the partnerships , accounting rules did not require that Enron consolidate the partnerships ' assets and liabilities , any debts belonged to the partnerships , not to Enron , and they would appear only in a footnote to Enron 's financial statements .
By keep ing debt off its books , Enron would appear healthier , and the credit rating agencies would give it a higher rating .
Enron began using offshore special purpose entities to do various over - the - counter derivatives deals , including swaps , that enabled Enron to borrow money without recording the debt .
For example , in 1992 Enron and Chase Manhattan did a swap using a company called Mahonia , which had been incorporated in 1986 in Jersey .
Chase effectively controlled Mahonia , so in reality Enron was doing the swap with Chase ( the legal independence of Mahonia potentially protected Chase from liability ) .
At first , Enron used Mahonia to do deals that reduced its taxes .
After several years , Enron also borrowed billions of dollars in prepaid swaps with Mahonia , organised by Chase and - after Chase 's merger with JP Morgan - JP Morgan Chase ."
2003-02-14,"The collapse of Enron led to numerous lawsuits , government investigations and criminal prosecutions .
But the question remained : were the direct participants really responsible ?
Ken Lay , [ chairman ] who stepped down in January 2002 , benefited financially ; in all , he sold $ 144 m of stock .
Although Lay was not directly involved in the deals that ruined Enron , he helped to fashion the trading - focused culture .
After August 2001 , when he learned details of Enron 's partnerships , he should have been more engaged in Enron 's business and more forthcoming with investors .
Even then , he did not seem to understand what was happening .
Jeff Skilling [ chief executive officer ] also benefited - selling $ 76 m of stock - and some people questioned whether his reasons for resigning on August 14 2001 , were truly "" personal "" .
However , it seemed likely that Skilling was telling the truth when he testified to Congress that , after months of scrutinising Enron 's dealings , he still believed the financial statements were accurate .
Indeed , there was a strong argument that although Enron 's practices made little economic sense , they were perfectly legal .
Andy Fastow benefited directly from Enron 's schemes , selling $ 30 m of stock .
He arguably was playing within the rules of a game whose very structure and purpose had been corrupted .
Enron paid several hundred million dollars in fees to banks for work on various financial aspects of its business , and yet none of those firms pointed out to investors any of the derivatives problems at Enron .
Its bankers faced serious conflicts of interest and many were even investors in Enron 's partnerships .
But the bankers and lawyers were n't accountants , and it was difficult to hold them responsible for accounting mistakes .
Most people blamed Andersen , and even Enron 's top auditors seriously considered that they might be responsible for Enron 's malfeasance .
The strongest argument that Andersen was to blame was one few commentators made : the auditor had been willing to opine that Enron 's internal controls were adequate when it was obvious , based on Enron 's financial statements alone , that the firm was out of control .
Parties outside Enron were most to blame : credit - rating agencies that propped up Enron 's grading and then pulled out the carpet at the end ; investors who had not scrutinised Enron 's public filings ; and legislators and regulators who passed the rules Enron used to rationalise its dealings , then stood by for years while those rules distorted the corporate and financial culture so that dealings which should have been reprehensible became permissible .
Enron was not merely about a few bad guys , and anyone who believed it was would miss the important connections with even bigger bankruptcies that were about to follow ."
2003-02-14,"Even given the extensive media coverage , it was difficult to capture the breathless pace of Enron 's collapse .
October 23 2001 was a relatively quiet day throughout most of Houston .
For Ken Lay , it was the beginning of the end .
He spent much of the morning on a conference call with investors and analysts , trying to explain some recent troubles .
As the call began , the participants asked what Lay was going to do about the fact that the stock price , which months earlier had fallen from $ 90 to a plateau of $ 35 , was now falling off a cliff .
Lay admitted that having a chief financial officer run partnerships that did business with Enron was an "" inherent conflict of interest "" .
But he defended Enron , saying the company had set up procedures to ensure that shareholder interests were not compromised .
Meanwhile , at the Houston offices of accounting firm Arthur Andersen , October 23 was even more frantic .
Enron was Andersen 's most important client in Houston , and had paid Andersen $ 52 m in fees in 2000 alone - more than half of which was for consulting , not audit .
The ties between the firms were very close , and many Enron employees had spent time working at Andersen .
While Ken Lay was spinning a tangled web during his conference call , employees at Andersen had powered - up the shredders .
David Duncan , the lead Andersen partner on Enron 's audits , called a meeting to organise an "" expedited effort to dispose of Enron - related documents "" .
The document destruction continued until November 9 .
Andersen later would attempt to distance itself from Duncan , issuing a statement that the shredding "" was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm "" .
Duncan must have anticipated that he would be left without friends in upper management , because he took at least six boxes of documents home before Andersen fired him on January 15 , 2002 .
Those boxes contained documents investigators otherwise might not have seen .
Prosecutors offered Duncan a deal : if he agreed to testify against Andersen , he could plead guilty to obstruction of justice , and prosecutors would recommend leniency .
A Houston jury convicted Andersen of obstructing justice , in part based on Duncan 's testimony .
On November 28 credit rating agencies downgraded Enron 's debt .
Enron 's proposed partner Dynergy immediately terminated the merger .
On December 2 Enron filed for bankruptcy protection , fired 4,000 employees ( and ) sued Dynergy for $ 10bn .
The derivatives profits lingered at Enron even after bankruptcy , when all of its derivatives traders were gone .
By July 2002 , the bankrupt company was awash with $ 6bn in cash , according to one source - a reminder that although the company had died , its heart had been healthy throughout ."
2003-02-19,"Three electricity power workers were burned beyond recognition and killed by an explosion after an attempt to adjust a national grid transformer , an inquest heard yesterday .
One of the victims was hurled 40 ft across a power station by the cross - circuit at the Enron plant on Teesside , which supplies almost 5 per cent of Britain 's power .
The first of an expected 34 witnesses gave evidence at Teesside coroner 's court in Middlesbrough yesterday .
The victims of the explosion in August 2001 were Andrew Sherwood , 36 , Darren Higgins , 28 , and Lawrence Surtees , 40 , who were trying to "" tap "" the transformer to change its voltage when the blast took place .
Ian Clifford , site director , told the inquest the change was necessary to allow essential maintenance to be carried out .
But when specialist staff realised that power levels were too high to allow a straightforward shutdown , it was agreed to carry out a "" tap change "" , working while the power was reduced but still on .
The work led rapidly to the explosion , after the transformer short - circuited and overheated , leading oil inside it to boil and trigger the blast .
Mr Sherwood , from Hartlepool , was flung the length of the transformer room , and Mr Higgins , from Normanby , Teesside , was also killed instantly .
Mr Surtees , of Hawthorn , Co Durham , suffered 90 per cent burns and died in hospital .
Detective Sergeant Ian White , of Cleveland police , said that an inquiry had found no evidence to back charges of corporate manslaughter and the investigation had been handed to the health and safety executive .
The hearing continues ."
2003-02-20,"A federal judge ruled yesterday that claims brought by more than a thousand investors , alleging that Wall Street banks rigged initial public offerings during the internet boom , could go ahead .
Many of the biggest investment banks are already facing a deluge of claims related to other issues , including the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom , and allegations that research analysts offered biased advice to secure corporate banking fees .
The ruling by district judge Shira Scheindlin followed an attempt by the banks , including Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston to quash the claims .
In her 238-page judgment , she said there was evidence of "" a coherent scheme by underwriters , issuers and their officers to defraud the investing public "" .
The claim is one of the largest class action suits ever filed against the securities industry .
It names 55 underwriting banks and 308 companies that issued shares .
Lawyers for the investors said the damages could top $ 1bn .
The complaints argue that analysts manipulated the market and that investors allocated IPO shares were forced to buy further shares to keep the price high .
They also claim that recipients of IPO shares gave kickbacks to the banks .
As a result of the verdict , the plaintiffs ' lawyers can demand thousands of internal bank documents .
During the dot.com frenzy , Wall Street made billions of dollars of fees underwriting IPOs for internet firms , many of which have since gone bust .

2003-02-22,"Some of the biggest names on Wall Street were last night facing the threat of civil fines related to their involvement with Enron , the scandal - hit US energy group , after Merrill Lynch agreed to a penalty of $ 80 m ( £ 50.5 m ) .
Banks including Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase are expected to be among the next targets of the securities and exchange commission , which agreed the settlement with Merrill .
The banks earned millions of dollars in fees from Enron and have come under scrutiny by the financial regulator since the collapse of the energy firm exposed a labyrinth of dubious deals designed to inflate profits and hide debts .
The Merrill settlement is the first civil fine extracted from Wall Street in relation to Enron and the bank has submitted to an injunction against any future violations of securities laws .
It is understood that JP Morgan has yet to open settlement talks and any further penalties could still be some way off .
JP Morgan and Citigroup both declined to comment .
Practices commonly employed on Wall Street in the boom times are coming back to bite .
In December , Merrill was among 11 firms party to a $ 1.5bn settlement of allegations that research analysts misled investors during the late 1990s .
A US judge earlier this week allowed more than a thousand private suits to proceed against Wall Street , claiming that banks had conspired with internet companies to artificially inflate share prices .
A wave of private litigation related to Enron is also pending .

2003-02-26,"Mayflower , the engineering group whose audit committee is headed by former prime minister John Major , has restated its accounts following the appointment of new auditors .
The change knocks £ 1.8 m off 2001 's profits , and comes after PricewaterhouseCoopers replaced Arthur Andersen , which was removed in the wake of the Enron scandal .
Profits before tax , exceptionals and goodwill for 2002 were bolstered by the change , but still fell from £ 27.6 m to £ 25.3 m .
The final dividend was cut from 3p to 2.25p leaving it looking like "" a failed IT stock "" , according to some in the City .
Mayflower previously had been logging a chassis as revenue the moment it had been completed against a customer order at its TransBus International business .
Now the company will only book the sales in its accounts once the entire bus is completed and handed over in a change that increases 2002 operating profits by £ 2.6 m .
David Donnelly , the joint managing director , insisted it was the board 's move rather than pressure from PwC that led to the change .
"" We took the decision internally and they [ the auditors ] concurred , "" he said , adding that it was triggered by the 2001 amalgamation of three separate businesses into TransBus .
Group pre - tax profits reached £ 2.8 m for the 12 months to December 31 , compared with a loss of £ 31.8 m previously .
Exceptionals included a £ 7 m charge relating to the sale of its technical services division to venture capital - backed Mayflower Aerospace .
The chief executive , John Simpson , said Mayflower had performed strongly given volatile markets and worsening global economic outlook . ""
Mayflower manufactures products that are either capital goods or components for capital goods and the continuing uncertainty in these markets led to relentless downward pressure on both volumes and jobs . ""
But Tony Lancelott , automotive analyst at Arbuthnot , expressed concern that interest cover had fallen to 2.4 times and net debt was higher than expected .
"" The share price chart and financial situation of Mayflower look like those of a failed IT stock , "" he said in a research note .
Mr Simpson said that the threat of war in the Middle East spread a shadow over prospects making it prudent to anticipate "" flat markets "" in 2003 .
Mayflower expects its automotive supply business to remain relatively depressed in the early part of this year but the heavy truck market should pick up later in 2003 ."

2003-03-06,"Enron , the bankrupt energy trader , may have improperly transferred as much of $ 5bn ( £ 3.1bn ) in assets to other entities as part of the company 's manipulation of its financial statements , a report said today .
The report , by Neal Batson , a lawyer who was appointed by the federal bankruptcy court in New York to investigate Enron 's financial transactions , also claimed that some former Enron executives earned more than had been previously thought from the transactions with outside entities .
Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer , received at least $ 60.6 m , from his dealings with the entities , the report said .
That is about $ 15 m more than previously thought .
Mr Fastow is under indictment in a federal court in Houston on several charges .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Mr Batson 's report , which was filed last month , set the stage for a battle in the Enron bankruptcy case , as creditors fight to get their hands on what they can from a collapse that shattered confidence in corporate America and Wall Street .
The report also held out the prospect of a confrontation between the company and its own former executives .
Mr Batson concluded that under the bankruptcy laws , the Enron estate could seek $ 74 m from Kenneth Lay , the former chairman .
Mr Lay borrowed the money and repaid it with company stock in the months before the bankruptcy .
The report also said it could seek $ 55 m in deferred compensation that was given as accelerated payments to certain senior executives soon before its bankruptcy in December 2001 .
In the most complete analysis of the Enron collapse to date , the 2000-page report concluded that the company violated accounting rules in a wide array of transactions that misrepresented its true financial performance and shifted billions of dollars in assets off the books .
Mr Batson described how Enron and its accountants at Arthur Andersen followed the letter of the law but often bent accounting rules , so that figures misrepresented the company 's true financial performance .
Like previous reports , Mr Batson 's account asserted that the company improperly used accounting and financial devices to vastly boost reported income while lowering reported debt .
In 2000 , such techniques accounted for 96 % of Enron 's reported $ 979 m in net income for the year and allowed Enron to report debt of only $ 10.2bn instead of $ 22.1bn ."
2003-03-07,"The scale of the deception at Enron , the bankrupt energy firm , was further exposed yesterday in a 2,000 page report detailing the increasingly desperate measures the company used to hide its true financial position .
The second in a series of reports from court - appointed examiner Neal Batson disclosed that Enron transferred as much as $ 5bn of assets off balance sheet through sham transactions as part of the attempt to manipulate its financial statements .
The disclosure sets the stage for a bitter fight in the bankruptcy court to determine which assets creditors have a claim over .
With every new examination of activities at Enron , the scale of the alleged fraud and corruption grows .
The latest report from Mr Batson is no exception .
Andrew Fastow , the former finance chief awaiting trial on fraud charges , creamed "" at least $ 60.6 m "" from arranging transactions designed to prop up earnings between Enron and its special purpose entities , the report claims .
Previous estimates were that Mr Fastow had pocketed $ 45 m from the deals .
The report also details the yawning gaps between Enron 's reported numbers and its actual state .
In 2000 , Enron reported income of $ 979 m , of which 96 per cent was generated from six "" accounting techniques "" used by the company to give the appearance that it was making money .
Enron reported income of $ 352 m from the sale of assets to SPEs , which had taken loans to pay for the acquisitions - loans that Enron was liable to repay .
Debt that year was reported to be $ 10.2bn when in reality it was $ 22.1bn .
Cash flow should have been a negative $ 154 m instead of the reported $ 3bn in the black . ""
Enron so engineered its reported financial position and results of operations that its financial statements bore little resemblance to its actual financial condition or performance , "" Mr Batson says .
He concludes that the Enron estate could seek $ 74 m from former chairman Kenneth Lay , who borrowed the money and repaid it in company shares in the months before it fell into bankruptcy .
The estate could also go after $ 55 m in deferred compensation that was handed out as accelerated payment to a number of senior executives in the weeks before Enron collapsed .
One of the accounting techniques , called mark - to - market , was used aggressively by Enron .
Assets were carried at their "" fair value "" , a figure that can be estimated by management and was used by Enron to accelerate earnings of new projects which actually were not generating any cash .
A deal with Blockbuster to deliver video on demand never got off the ground but Enron recorded a gain of $ 111 m from it .
It ultimately used the accounting method on 35 per cent of its assets so that "" a mere 5 per cent fluctuation in the value of these assets would have resulted in a gain or loss of $ 1.1bn "" .
To mask the fact that the earnings were not "" real "" , the company was forced to come up with schemes to generate cash flow .
One was a 1999 deal codenamed Project Nahanni .
Enron , weeks away from the year - end , borrowed $ 500 m in treasury securities from Citibank , sold them immediately and reported the proceeds as operating cash flow .
That represented 41 per cent of the total cash flow from operations recognised by Enron in 1999 .
The firm swiftly repaid the loan without it ever showing up as debt on its financial statement .
Pre - pay transactions were also widely used .
Enron would promise delivery of oil or gas contracts in return for an upfront payment designed , according to a memo from Mr Fastow , "" to bring cash forward to match earnings "" .
Seven such deals were facilitated by JP Morgan Chase and four by Citibank .
A managing director of Citibank affiliate Salomon Smith Barney allegedly described the technique as giving "" oomph to earnings "" .
According to the report , up to $ 2.1bn in assets had been moved off balance sheet as part of the SPE deals while another $ 2.9bn was fraudulently shifted out of the company shortly before its bankruptcy filing in December 2001 .
A third report from Mr Batson is due in late June ."
2003-03-07,"Federal prosecutors investigating Enron scored their most significant victory so far when they arrested finance chief Andrew Fastow early in October 2002 .
He was indicted on 78 counts of fraud , money laundering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and faces five to 20 years in jail on each charge .
The Enron scandal erupted in the dying months of 2001 and sparked other corporate scandals where prosecutions have been far quicker .
Legal experts said yesterday 's report builds the case against former senior staff at Enron who have yet to be charged .
The complexity of the financial engineering that Enron employed perhaps underlines why the inquiry is taking so long .
Kenneth Lay , a friend of President Bush , and Jeffrey Skilling both filled the chief executive post during the time in question but have maintained their innocence and have not been prosecuted .
Mr Fastow , whose trial has yet to be scheduled , insisted he was only following orders and has pleaded not guilty .
Enron 's auditor , Arthur Andersen , was found guilty of obstructing justice , leading to the demise of the accountancy .
The first Enron employee to admit guilt was Michael Kopper who worked alongside Mr Fastow in the energy firm 's finance department and could be a key witness .
Merrill Lynch has been the only bank to settle with the securities and exchange commission over its relationship with Enron , paying out $ 80 m ."
2003-03-13,"Two more arrests were made yesterday in the Enron scandal as US federal prosecutors continue to unravel the events that led to the energy firm 's bankruptcy over a year ago .

They surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Houston , Texas and have been accused of securities and wire fraud , conspiracy and making false statements to authorities .
The project was an internet video service , codenamed "" Braveheart "" .
Enron booked the profits over 2000 and 2001 , even though it failed to get off the ground and generated no revenues .
Blockbuster pulled out in March 2001 .
The partnership sold part of the venture and the future revenue stream to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , allowing Enron to book a profit .
But prosecutors claim the arrangement was invalid because it secretly guaranteed that CIBC would profit from the venture even it was not successful .
Prosecutors have so far secured a handful of indictments against Enron workers ."

2003-03-27,"Why are media companies facing shareholder rebellions ?
In the post - Enron and WorldCom era , any signs of large payouts for executives are attracting protests from shareholder lobbying groups .
In the past month , several media companies have come under fire for "" rewarding failure "" .
Granada chairman Charles Allen was criticised by the National Association of Pension Funds , whose members own about 20 % of all UK stock market shares , for signing a two - year rolling contract .
The executive board of Carlton , Granada 's partner in the ITV network , was also attacked for failing to disclose how its pay was linked to performance .
Reed Elsevier , the Anglo - Dutch publisher , is under the spotlight for giving executives a £ 20 m share options scheme .
Why are two - year rolling contracts and lucrative options schemes labelled "" rewards for failure "" ?
The NAPF and other shareholder associations argue that a two - year contract , which is more common in the media than in other sectors , would hand a sacked executive a payoff worth two years ' salary .
They believe this is in breach of best practice .
The Reed scheme has been criticised because it replaces an options scheme that was in trouble because of the two - year slump in media stocks .
How have shareholders reacted ?
About 25 % of Granada investors failed to back Mr Allen 's re - election to the board at the annual meeting last week , in apparent protest at his contract .
More than 30 % did not endorse Carlton 's remuneration report at its AGM earlier this week .
Reed is facing a similar rebellion at its annual meeting next month , with the NAPF and others urging a vote against its option scheme .
How have the companies reacted ?
Granada is standing by its line that two - year rolling contracts are needed to attract top executives , but Carlton is wavering .
Finance director Paul Murray said he is unlikely to take a two - year payoff if the merger between Carlton and Granada is cleared and he loses his job in the ensuing reshuffle .
Reed has no plans to alter its options scheme ahead of the annual meeting .
Should all media companies be tarred with the same brush ?
The Association of British Insurers , representing a further 20 % of the UK share market , says : "" Each company has to be treated on an individual basis .
It is not a blanket thing for the sector . ""
However , the NAPF has warned that two - year rolling contracts are becoming a problematic fixture at British media companies and it is an issue shareholder groups will continue to highlight ."
2003-04-01,"Where 's the Enron of the university world ? "" demands Sandra Burslem .
As vice - chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan university she runs a £ 150m - a - year business on very small margins .
"" Universities are very complex businesses and we have n't really had the kind of disasters the private sector has had . ""
She believes ministers ' criticism of the way universities are managed is wide of the mark , but it looks as though they are about to be hit with a lot more .
The brief for the inquiry into higher education links with business under the former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert was expanded to include what industry leaders think about university management .
Few expect their views to be complimentary .
It was a former vice - chancellor of Exeter , Sir Geoffrey Holland , who declared : "" There are few sectors of our society so amateur , so apparently unconcerned , as higher education about the development of its leaders . ""
He called for a big expansion of programmes in which higher education leaders sit alongside leaders in business , the public sector and voluntary organisations .
Quite apart from the Lambert inquiry , due to report in October , the job of vice - chancellor is under scrutiny as never before .
There are high - profile vacancies looming at Oxford and the newly merged Manchester giant - both Sir Martin Harris at Manchester University and John Garside at Umist are retiring next year .

Cambridge has just filled its top job with Alison Richard , provost of Yale - only for the dons to scupper her proposed job description by voting down plans to make the job more like a chief executive .

Sir Derek Roberts , provost of University College London , found his enthusiastic backing for a merger with Imperial College rudely rejected by his academic colleagues and saw it was hopeless to press ahead .
( He was only back in the job because of a putsch by senior academics against his succes sor , Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith . )
He remains positive however .
"" It 's the most incredibly exciting and rewarding job that one can have , "" Sir Derek says .
"" You have to be seen by every bit of the college - whether it 's a small department of Scandinavian studies or a major department of medicine - to be equally enthusiastic and committed to helping them in fulfilling their own particular academic objectives .

Democracy may have worked for a little village like Athens , but I am not sure that it works in the complex environment that we are operating in today . ""
UCL , he points out , is a very big and complex business .
The college , which has an annual research income of some £ 400 m , includes the Slade School of Fine Art , the Royal Free medical school and the Institute of Archaeology .
Universities , he adds , need to be led in an open way that involves everyone who wishes to get involved .
But at the end of the process there has to be a hierarchy of decision making .
"" I am charged with providing the academic leadership and the overall executive management of the institution and that really means being responsible for everything . ""
Sir Martin Harris , on the other hand , managed to steer through a merger with his neighbour , Umist .
"" I have to get academics and support staff to see a vision and move forward towards it .
Now that was clearly a major strategic vision , which I had to sell to staff .
I had to get them to vote very , very substantially in favour and my opposite number at Umist had to do exactly the same . ""
The core things that his university does are teaching and research .
For these to succeed , however , the business that is the University of Manchester , which does masses of other things as well , has to be successful .
"" My job is to create an environment in which the two core academic businesses can flourish .
I always say that solvency is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for that . ""
Certain parts of the university - such as catering services , the halls of residence and sports facilities - are run like straightforward businesses .
But when it comes to teaching and research , Sir Martin has to proceed more circumspectly by persuading and motivating his fellow academics .
In some ways Sir Martin said he was a mediator between external pressures - the government , research councils , private sector funders - and the aspirations of the teacher / researchers . ""
For example , "" he says , "" if any university at the moment said flatly that increased access was a load of bollocks and we were not going to make any effort whatsoever to look at the social composition of our entry , that would not be a very tactful , sensible thing to do , would it ? ""
So what one says to colleagues is : ' Look , here is an important policy objective .
With the aspirations and goals of this particular university , how can we make reasonable changes to what we do in order to bear that agenda in mind without damaging what we are about ? '
"" Being autonomous , he is not answerable to the government , but only to the chairman of the university 's governing body , which is in turn autonomous .
However , given that the government is the university 's principal source of funding , it would clearly be foolish totally to ignore its wishes .
Professor David VandeLinde , vice - chancellor at Warwick university , says that a university 's vision has to be shaped in partnership with senate , university council and the wider university community .
It is up to the VC to lead such discussions and interpret their results . ""
If you do n't talk to people and you do n't take advice , then you run the risk of being isolated and working in a vacuum , "" he adds .
Professor Leslie Wagner , vice - chancellor at Leeds Metropolitan university , says that his style is to delegate.""Style is an important factor in leadership as well as process , "" he adds .
"" Some people are more open than others .
Some are more gregarious .
Some find it easier to delegate .
And people behave differently at different times during their leadership .
In the first two years at an institution , you will probably want to play a much more hands - on role . ""
The financial pressures on universities today are such that VCs can not afford to be self - indulgent or to act as mavericks - the margins for error are too narrow , he says .
Stephen Bampfylde , chairman of headhunters Saxon Bampfylde Hever who are currently "" scouring the world "" for the next vice - chancellor of Oxford , said the length of time university heads stay in the job has dropped over the past 10 years , just as it has for company chief executives .
"" They have less time to make an impact and it 's a much more competitive world .
The job has got tougher .
Sometimes listening to all the things people want from one person I wonder if anyone can do it . ""
Serial consensualist job - hops his way to London
He already has a knighthood and a published engineering text in Portuguese to his name .
Now , at 65 , Graeme Davies has acquired another distinction , as our foremost serial vice - chancellor .
He is starting his third post , moving from Glasgow to the University of London , a progression begun at Liverpool in 1986 , when Kenneth Baker was education secretary , Tony Blair belonged to the Tribune group and England were about to win a Test series in Australia .
Davies punctuated a career of running single universities by a spell superintending large numbers as chief executive of the Universities Funding Council and Higher Education Funding Council for England .
As the large number of academics who would n't be a VC for David Beckham 's salary would ask , why does he do it ?
"" I love the job , "" he says , "" and I 've never been bored .
I love leading a community populated by intelligent people .
They can be stubborn , disputatious , challenging and will rapidly work out how to turn any situation to their advantage , but the most important thing is that they will engage with you . ""
He is frequently consulted on appointments ( including Cambridge 's new VC ) and favours candidates who offer "" evidence of inclusiveness , transparency and the ability to communicate "" , while warning against "" those with confidence in excess of their ability .
You must have confidence in your own ability , but this has to be matched by ability to listen to others . ""
Asked how the job has changed since 1986 , he emphasises the extent to which a university is now a business : "" You have to have a real awareness of financial management ; human resource management must be paramount .
You can work through the comparisons - management structure , financial , operational and strategic requirements , accountability , budget controls , cashflow and so on - and tick every box . ""
But there is a vital difference .
"" You ca n't do things by diktat .
You have to be a serial consensualist and able to deal with minorities .
There are occasions when you wo n't have the whole community with you , but if they are all against you , you ca n't achieve much . ""
People from outside academic life are surprised by the extent to which , if you put something forward , academics will talk back .
They still expect an element of Socratic dialogue .
"" This is particularly important for institutional mergers .
Davies was unsurprised when the proposed University College London - Imperial merger fell apart .
"" Where you have two different cultures , you have to prepare the ground extremely carefully .
You have to gain acceptance from the bottom up , which means investing time in allowing people in the institutions to talk through their reservations and taking them seriously .
"" Glasgow 's own merger with St Andrew 's College has taken six years from conception to completion .
It is perhaps no coincidence that so many vice - chancellors have been , like Davies , engineers . ""
You need a feel for taking multiple inputs , synthesising them and arriving at the best possible output . ""
While the eye - catching item among his publications is Solidificacao e Fundicao das Metais e Suas Ligas ( 1978 ) - both the language skills and the research were acquired as a visiting professor in Brazil - the significant one may be Superplasticity ( 1981 ) , on persuading metals to stretch far beyond their normal breaking point .
Davies attracts astonishingly little dislike for someone so prominent in academic politics .
He believes that being a New Zealander - British enough to understand our class system , foreign enough to escape definition by it - helps .
"" It certainly helped me in 15 years at Cambridge .
I was welcomed into the system , but hard to pigeonhole . ""
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and Clarifications column , Thursday April 3 2003
The vice - chancellor of the University of Central England , Dr Peter Knight , tells us that , contrary to what we said in this article , he is not retiring in 2004 ."
2003-04-14,"A split emerged today between industry and investment institutions over the Higgs report , designed to prevent Enron - style scandals in the UK .
Fifteen leading UK investment institutions have written a letter to the Financial Times urging for the recommendations in the Higgs report to be adopted without delay .
The City institutions , which include Co - operative Insurance , Aegon , Jupiter and Merrill Lynch Investment Managers , said they supported the "" thrust "" of changes to the combined code of corporate governance - the UK industry standard for best business practice - proposed by Derek Higgs , a former investment banker .
"" Some constructive refinement may prove useful , "" the City firms said .
"" However , wholesale change or delay is not required . ""
The letter - on the final day for consultation on the Higgs report - follows stronger criticism of the document from business leaders who fear that the proposals will lead to divisions within the boardroom and too rigid an approach to corporate governance .
Showing much less enthusiasm for the reforms , Digby Jones , the head of the Confederation of British Industry , warned that the proposals to strengthen corporate governance could have "" unintended consequences "" .
Mr Jones was due to meet Patricia Hewitt , the secretary of state for trade and industry , to discuss business concerns about the Higgs report .
Published in January , the Higgs report followed a shake - up in corporate governance practices in the US after scandals at Enron and WorldCom .
Those mammoth breaches of US investor confidence led to the Sarbanes - Oxley act that created an oversight board for the accountancy industry .
The Higgs report avoided the legalistic US approach and upheld the "" comply or explain "" principle that leaves it to companies to convince their own shareholders if there are valid reasons for non - compliance with measures .
The report called for at least half of a company 's board to be made up of independent non - executive directors and said non - executive directors should have regular meetings with shareholders .
But the CBI argues that the proposal would create divisions within boards .
Mr Jones said : "" Everybody wants united boards , but the proposed role of the senior non - executive director could create unnecessary divisions . ""
The financial reporting council - whose purpose is to promote and secure good financial reporting - is currently considering how to incorporate the reforms into a new code of corporate governance ."
2003-04-15,"A transatlantic spat over extra - territorial US corporate fraud law grew increasingly antagonistic last night as the European commission warned Washington to exempt EU firms or face retaliatory measures .
At issue is the international reach of the Sarbanes - Oxley act , a radical piece of legislation rushed through Congress last year in the wake of the high profile accounting scandals seen at companies such as Enron and WorldCom .
The US authorities want all foreign audit firms that deal with US listed firms to be subject to the new regime but Brussels said yesterday that such a move would be unnecessary , expensive , disproportionate and contrary to its own legislation on the subject .
In a strongly worded letter to the US authorities from Frits Bolkestein , the EU commissioner for the internal market , Brussels rejected the US legislation out of hand and warned that transatlantic relations would suffer if the act was foistedon EU firms .
"" If we are not able to find a common approach to these highly sensitive matters , I see a danger of additional tension which might have a negative impact on confidence and the performance of financial markets , which we can ill afford at the moment , "" he wrote .
Retaliation from the EU side would almost certainly follow , he added , with US accountancy firms being forced to register with every relevant regulatory authority in the 15-nation bloc . ""
If we can not move forward ... it will be difficult to avoid calls for reciprocity and requirements whereby US audit firms would have to register with all our member states and be subject also to EU oversight mechanisms . ""
The row over the Sarbanes - Oxley act is the latest in a series of trade disputes which have brought relationships between Brussels and Washington to an all time low - even before the diplomatic fallouts over Iraq .
With negotiations over global trade talks stalled in Geneva , Britain had hoped last weekend 's meeting of the World Bank and IMF would start to mend economic relationships .
Brussels , however , is in no mood to compromise over accounting rules .
"" We do n't want European firms to pay the price for ... legislation drawn up in haste , "" said one official ."
2003-04-23,"US federal prosecutors today filed criminal charges against Frank Quattrone , one of the top investment bankers of the dotcom era , accusing him of obstruction of justice and witness tampering .
Mr Quattrone , who resigned under pressure from Credit Suisse First Boston last month , has been under investigation by Eliot Spitzer , the New York attorney general .
Mr Spitzer has been the scourge of Wall Street since a spate of scandals from Enron to WorldCom .
Mr Quattrone was also under scrutiny by the Manhattan US attorney 's office , which filed the criminal charges .
In March , NASD , the Wall Street regulator , accused the former high - flier of corrupt behaviour designed to win lucrative investment banking business for CSFB .
Earlier , Mr Quattrone 's attorney , John Keker , said : "" Frank Quattrone is innocent .
He never obstructed justice .
The only way we can prove that is to try this case , which is why we will ask that the jury trial occur at the earliest possible moment . ""
At the core of the charges against Mr Quattrone is whether he knew of federal investigations into CSFB 's involvement in hi - tech companies going public ( initial public offerings [ IPOs ] ) that had crashed in value when he sent an email urging the destruction of certain records .
According to prosecutors , on December 5 , 2000 , Mr Quattrone sent an email entitled "" time to clean up those files "" after he had been notified about the investigation by a CSFB lawyer , David Brodsky .
Mr Quattrone is the latest high - profile investment banker to fall from grace , following the likes of Henry Blodget and Jack Grubman , analysts whose pronunciations on internet and telecommunications companies were treated as gospel by many investors .
For federal prosecutors seeking to draw a line under the conflict of interest scandals on Wall Street , Mr Quattrone could represent the biggest fish of all .
In the early 90s , he was a relatively unimportant Morgan Stanley banker , based in California , who followed hi - tech and internet companies .
When technology stocks began to soar in the mid-90s , Mr Quattrone 's star also rose .
In 1996 , he and his team were poached by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell when the European investment bank was seeking to make inroads in the US .
Mr Quattrone led Amazon.com 's IPO , a high point of the dotcom boom , and then defected to CSFB over "" control issues "" .
At CSFB , he was in the unusual position of overseeing both investment banking and research , areas that were traditionally split on Wall Street to avoid conflict of interest .
He now stands accused of steering lucrative IPOs to friends and other executives , who would then award investment banking business to CSFB ."
2003-05-02,"The US justice department yesterday announced new charges against former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and for the first time accused his wife , and seven other ex - Enron officials of fraud and other criminal violations in connection with the company 's collapse .
A grand jury in Texas returned a 109-count indictment charging Fastow , who was originally indicted last October on 78 counts , with fraud , insider trading and falsification of Enron 's accounting records .
The indictment also named former Enron corporate treasurer Ben Glisan and former finance executive Dan Boyle .
The grand jury also returned a six - count indictment charging Fastow 's wife , former Enron assistant treasurer Lea Fastow , with conspiracy to commit wire fraud , money laundering conspiracy and filing false tax returns .
The grand jury also increased the number of charges relating to Enron 's failed internet division .
Earlier seven of the former Enron executives , including Mrs Fastow , surrendered to federal authorities in Houston ."
2003-05-15,"A new corporate code designed to shake up Britain 's boardrooms and avoid an Enron - style collapse faces a delay of six months after a panel was set up yesterday to review the proposals published by Derek Higgs in January .
The financial reporting council , which is charged with implementing the Higgs code , immediately faced criticism that it was planning to water down the proposals , which were due to come into effect on July 1 .
Charles Bridge , the assistant secretary to the FRC , conceded that the new code might not be introduced until January .
Mr Higgs was asked by the government to review the structure of boardrooms ; he devised a code which gave non - executives a bigger role and recommended that a senior non - executive director should be appointed to work alongside the chairman .
Although the FRC held a consultation period until April , it concluded that a new group , which met for the first time yesterday , was needed to rework the code .
It is chaired by Sir Bryan Nicholson , the chairman of the FRC , and includes Sir John Egan , the president of the Confederation of British Industry , David Clementi , the chairman of Prudential , Paul Myners , a former fund manager and the chairman of Guardian Media Group , along with Mr Higgs himself .
Pirc , the investor lobby group , warned about the danger of a further dilution of the proposals by "" corporate lobbying "" .
"" It would represent a major missed opportunity if best practice governance proposals are watered down in the face of unrepresentative and shortsighted criticism from such sources , "" Pirc said .
Peter Montagnon , the head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers , said the new process should allow for input from investor bodies .
Mr Bridge said investor bodies would be kept abreast of developments ahead of the publication of a new code in July and insisted that the aim was not to "" water down "" the Higgs review .
The FRC has blocked Mr Higg 's recommendation that the chairman of a company should not be allowed to chair the nomination committee and will allow smaller listed companies to breach the principle that half of the board should be non - executive .
However , the FRC made no mention yesterday of an issue that has perplexed some boardroom executives - that chief executives should not become chairman of the same company .
Digby Jones , the chairman of employers ' body the CBI , said : "" This approach may take a little longer , but it will be done properly and will have a better chance of standing the test of time . """
2003-05-22,"The Wall Street Journal is gearing up for a legal fight with Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed after comparing the upmarket department store with the failed US company Enron .
A high court judge today refused to stop a libel action brought by Harrods against the WSJ 's owner , Dow Jones and Company , over an article in which the paper described the shop as "" the Enron of Britain "" .
The article , which appeared in the paper on April 5 2002 , warned that if the company ever went public , investors would be "" wise to question its every disclosure "" .
It referred to a press release Harrods issued the day before April Fool 's Day , which claimed Mr Fayed would make an important announcement the next day about a "" first come , first served share option offer "" .
The release claimed the information would be posted on Mr Fayed 's personal website , Alfayed.com , until 12 noon on April 1 and invited anyone interested to contact LOOF LIRPA - an anagram of April fool .
Mr Justice Eady today said Harrods had written to the WSJ to complain "" in the strongest terms "" about the article , claiming it had caused serious damage to its reputation worldwide .
It said it was "" quite scandalous "" to have equated Harrods with Enron and required an immediate apology and substantial damages , which were to be donated to charity .
The WSJ , which denies defamation and says the piece was a humorous response to Mr Fayed 's joke , asked the judge to "" stay "" the matter in the English courts .
The article did not appear in the European edition and only 10 copies were sent to UK subscribers from the USA .
The online edition scored a very small number of hits .
The newspaper argued it would be ridiculous to have the case dealt with in England when the store 's real grievance was , according to its complaint , "" worldwide "" damage .
But the judge said the English publications relating to an English corporation , however limited and technical , were most conveniently dealt with in an English court .
Harrods , he said , wished to pursue the action in order to demonstrate , as an objective matter of truth , and for the record , that the imputations reflected in its claim were unjustified .
"" It may be over - sensitive but I believe , as a matter of English law , and for that matter public policy , it is entitled to do so , "" he said .
The judge encouraged the two sides to arrive at a "" sensible compromise "" before further legal costs were incurred .
"" My words may fall on stony ground but that is no reason for not making an attempt , "" he said ."
2003-05-26,"Many thousands of hours of courtroom time and tens of millions of dollars in lawyers ' fees may be going to be spent determining what GAAP and other accountancy rules "" mean "" in the context of Enron and similar episodes .
A case that gives a flavour of what may lie ahead was between one of America 's most august banks , JP Morgan Chase , and 11 insurance companies .
The latter provided the bank with "" surety bonds "" totalling $ 1 billion against Enron defaulting on "" forward "" contracts with the bank .
( A "" forward "" is a customised future , and unlike a future is n't traded on organised exchanges . )
The insurers declined to stump up , arguing that the apparent forwards were actually disguised loans from Morgan Chase to Enron .
The case was settled out of court at the beginning of January this year ( with Morgan Chase getting $ 600 million ) , and thus without a legal ruling on the distinction between forwards and loans .
There may be hundreds of such definitions to contest , and if Wittgenstein is right , none of them can ever be made so unambiguous that they can never be contested again .
Understandably , momentum is gathering behind an apparent fix to American accountancy 's Wittgensteinian problems .
It is to shift from the "" rules - based "" US approach to the "" principles - based "" approach currently used to regulate accountancy in Britain .
In the latter , detailed rules are supplemented by an overarching requirement that a company 's accounts give a "" true "" and "" fair "" view of its financial situation .
It might indeed be a useful reform .
It would almost certainly be easier to persuade a jury of lay people that the balance sheet of Enron ( or of WorldCom , which went bankrupt on an even larger scale in July 2002 ) did not give a "" fair "" account of its situation than it would be to get a jury to understand a host of detailed accountancy rules and prove beyond reasonable doubt that they were violated .
Principles , however , are a species of meta - rule , and the Wittgensteinian analysis applies to them , too .
It is easy to anticipate that , especially in the US legal system , a thicket of GAAP - like interpretation will come to surround them , and "" principles "" have not entirely shielded investors in British companies from the sudden discovery of black holes in corporate accounts .
Accountancy , it is often thought , is boring .
The limited attention given to it by social scientists seems to suggest that we share that prejudice .
However , the numbers that accountancy generates are consequential .
Profit is the signal that a free - market economy uses to allocate resources to some activities and not to others .
A back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests that the $ 38 billion of debt run up by Enron would pay around a - fifth of the capital costs of providing safe drinking water to every human being on earth who currently lacks it .
Universally available safe water would avoid some five million deaths a year and countless person - months of debilitating water - borne illness .
It would have economic as well as humanitarian benefits , but those benefits would not show up as profit on any of the balance sheets that currently matter .
Enquire into almost any of the numbers that abound in the world of finance , and one discovers that it is the endpoint of an often complex chain of construction .
Those chains often also lead deep into people 's lives : into what happens to their savings and their pensions , into whether or not they have jobs or homes .
Bill Peterson 's wife and children will tell you that .
Mr Peterson worked for Enron , and was being treated for cancer when the corporation became bankrupt .
He lost his job , and with it his Enron - subsidised health insurance .
With expenses mounting , and his wife unable to take up paid work because she needed to look after him , the $ 800 a month the couple had to pay to keep their insurance going could be met only by selling the house in which they had brought up their children .
Mr Peterson died last September , not at home but while staying with relatives 175 miles away from the rest of his family . ""
He should have been allowed to die in his own bed , "" his wife told the Financial Times .
What happened to Mr Peterson is one of the casual cruelties of the American system , cruelties that are the other side of its restless , innovative , money - making , winner - takes - all energy .
His fate should also remind us that numbers matter .
We need to understand how they are constructed , and perhaps to start to imagine ways in which they can be reconstructed to better ends . ·

2003-05-31,"Infectious Greed :
How Deceit and Risk Corrupted the Financial Markets by Frank Partnoy 320pp , Profile , £ 20 Power Failure :
The Rise and Fall of Enron by Mimi Swartz ( with Sherron Watkins ) 320pp , Aurum , £ 14.99
The Support Economy :
Why Corporations Are Failing Individuals and the Next Episode of Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff and James Maxmin 480pp , Allen Lane , £ 25 A finance professor sees a $ 20 bill on the floor but refuses to pick it up .
He argues that it could n't actually be there because if it was , someone would have picked it up already .
In Infectious Greed , Frank Partnoy uses this anecdote as a way of characterising capital markets , the places where businesses go when they want to raise cash .
From the late 1980s until recently , he says , the capital markets were littered with millions of such "" $ 20 bills "" , in the guise of unsophisticated institutional investors and arbitrage opportunities for savvy traders .
Partnoy , who writes with a mix of seriousness and professorial dry humour , uses the metaphor of disease and epidemic to describe not only the greed of financial markets but also , and more subtly , their increased risk appetite , with "" infection "" being passed along to those least able to bear it .
The "" patient zero "" of this epidemic is identified as the Bankers Trust currency trader Andy Kreiger , who , when awarded a $ 3 m ( £ 1.8 m ) bonus in 1987 , resigned in a huff because by his calculation he deserved $ 15 m .
One might think that this greed , or , as Alan Greenspan puts it , "" irrational exuberance "" , is nothing new , but Partnoy sets out a robust case ( he is a professor at the San Diego School of Law ) for the exceptional circumstances of the past 15 years .
His key thesis is that financial markets are spinning out of control and that corporate scandals such as Enron are not rare rotten apples but evidence of systemic failure .
Partnoy uses case studies to illustrate his point .
For example , the ambition of financial institutions such as Salomon Brothers was to create new financial vehicles unencumbered by regulation and ideally off - balance sheet ( to manipulate reported profits ) .
The banks marketed these risky , complex and often unnecessary instruments primarily to bamboozle investors and generate higher fees .
In turn , corporate treasurers on the hunt for higher returns bought the instruments because they enabled participation in markets from which they were explicitly excluded .
These instruments became increasingly baroque in their construction : one instrument was even linked to the Utah Jazz basketball team 's wins .
Some of the really "" toxic "" ( ie super risky ) instruments were known as "" nuclear waste "" by those involved .
Unfortunately , not only were the banks ' clients unable to assess the risks , senior banking executives often could not understand what their employees are doing .
The risks involved were literally incalculable .
Although Partnoy 's protagonists are undoubtedly a parade of macho or geeky grotesques with overdeveloped quantitative skills , one could argue that their activities were entirely consistent with both classic economics and basic game theory .
The pursuit of self - interest and maximum pay - off trickled down from traders to CEOs to equity analysts .
Why worry , they reasoned , when the chances of being caught were minimal and the chances of being convicted even lower ?
Partnoy describes a hysteria akin to that of the South Sea Bubble : "" Imagine a casino full of gamblers betting on a roulette wheel .
Spin after spin , the ball lands on a red .
The gamblers bet on red numbers and win ... as the cheers grow louder , they begin ignoring the fact that the wheel has as many black numbers as red ...
they believe they have entered an incredible new world where the roulette ball only lands on red ... substitute ' low interest rates ' for red numbers and you have a description of the early 1990s financial markets .
Inevitably , on February 4 1994 , the ball landed on black . ""
Interest rates rose .
His more serious point is that the allocation of risks and rewards among the various market participants is misaligned .
Put crudely , John Meriwether of Salomon Brothers was paid a $ 10 m bonus in 1990 ( by no means the largest bonus Salomon Brothers paid that year ) , yet was fined only $ 50,000 ( about one day 's salary ) for financial impropriety .
Clearly a risk worth taking .
Moreover , says Partnoy , "" Meriwether was suspended for just three months .
He sued Salomon for lost compensation , and received $ 18 m in a settlement "" .
That 's nice work if you can get it .
Those who had the least understanding of the risks involved ( ie anyone saving for a pension ) were left to bear them .
But even the president was not immune .
After numerous half - hearted attempts at regulation , Clinton exploded : "" You mean to tell me that ... my re - election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders ? ""
In the end , Partnoy 's advice is paradoxical .
He suggests that untutored investors spend more time examining annual company reports - yet he despairs of them ever yielding a semblance of truth .
"" If you think you really understand a company whose stock you own , a perusal of the section of its annual report discussing Financial Accounting Standard 133 ( an 800-page set of rules on accounting for derivatives ) probably will change your mind .
"" While Partnoy lays out his case like an expert witness , Mimi Swartz 's book on Enron sits squarely in the genre of financial thriller .
Indeed , the book 's narrative arc is almost identical to John Grisham 's The Firm : a corrupt corporate culture overreaches itself and is brought down by a principled whistleblower - in this case the book 's co - author , Sherron Watkins .
The authors attribute blame to key Enron executives ( Kenneth Lay , Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow ) but overlook two key points .
First , Enron was not uniquely corrupt , as the subsequent discovery of financial impropriety at WorldCom and Global Crossing attests , and second , Enron did pretty well .
In fact , Enron was so good at trading that as late as 2001 it made $ 3.8bn and was trying to reduce its stated profits .
The real problem with Enron was that it was , in effect , a derivatives trading company rather than an energy supplier or technology company , and as a result its financial liabilities were off the balance sheet and difficult to evaluate .
When the extent of these liabilities was known , the ratings agencies were eventually forced to downgrade Enron 's credit rating .
This in turn hampered Enron 's ability to raise debt on the capital markets and triggered a severe drop in the share price .
As late as July 2002 , the bankrupt company had $ 6bn in cash , "" a reminder that although the company had died , its heart had been healthy throughout "" .
In truth , the probability of Enron defaulting on its debt within the next 12 months was 0.33 % .
It was more creditworthy than most of us .
In contrast to Swartz 's formulaic narrative , The Support Economy is an ambitious attempt to challenge the hegemony of enterprise - based capitalism .
Indeed , the early section is an articulate neo - Marxist analysis of the rise of consumer society and its underlying assumptions .
Its key thesis is that we are "" cash - rich / time - poor "" and under ever - increasing stress as we try to reconcile being both good workers and "" good "" consumers .
But instead of pragmatic solutions , Shoshana Zuboff and James Maxmin offer verbiage : "" Deep support enables psychological self - determination .
The I - You means that one encounters another in the true wholeness of his or her reality .
In the I - You , the individual is no longer an economic abstraction - consumer or producer - but a vital , intricate , self - originating , and irreducibly unique life . ""
The opening line of the preface - "" This book begins in silence "" - should have been a warning .
The Support Economy is full of unsupported assertions and non - sequiturs .
It is not written with the "" time - poor "" in mind .
Do markets bring out the worst in us ?
Partnoy takes some solace from investment guru James Grant 's observation that ' "" People are not intrinsically greedy .
They are only cyclically greedy . ""
Unfortunately , recent experience suggests that , like the professor 's notionally untouched $ 20 bill , any explanation of markets that is inconsistent with observed human behaviour is best treated with suspicion .

2003-06-21,"Sherron Watkins , one of the world 's best known whistleblowers , takes a wry view of corporate morality .
"" I do n't think Enron is that unusual , "" she says of one of the biggest corporate scandals of recent years .
"" After all , we have a chief executive class which act like dictators of small Latin American countries .
"" Immaculately dressed in a woollen suit , she still looks the part of an ambitious executive , sitting in the genteel offices of her lawyer in Houston , the home city of Enron , once the seventh biggest company in America .
The woman who made global headlines for telling her boss , Ken Lay , that Enron was mired in accounting fraud is now , after more than a year in the media spotlight , happy to talk about her life at the firm . ""
The money was good , the bonuses and the stock options .
And the trips were always top notch , "" she says .
Her company , the world 's biggest energy trader , often won awards for innovation .
Gradually it became clear that some of its accounting practices were more than innovative .
In December 2001 , Enron filed the biggest US bankruptcy case to date .
Thousands of workers lost their jobs and their pensions invested in its shares , and other investors lost billions of dollars .
Back in 1996 , Watkins was working with Andrew Fastow , the chief financial officer now charged with fraud , when she began to witness aggressive accounting .
"" I was starting to see Andy Fastow cross the line , "" she says , claiming he asked her to lie to one of Enron 's partners about an investment .
"" It should have been a huge warning flag , "" she admits .
It merely prompted her to move to a different part of the empire , Enron International , where she later became a vice - president .
All this time , Harvard graduate Jeffrey Skilling had been growing in influence at Enron , reinventing what it did for a living to include power trading , selling retail electricity and even the provision of broadband internet services .
In 2001 he became chief executive officer . ""
Jeff Skilling was incredibly charismatic , "" she explains , "" but very , very intimidating .
He can really cut people off at the knees .
You were certain he was just the brightest guy around , but in hindsight I really feel we were somewhat like cult followers . ""
By mid-2001 , Watkins was working for Fastow again .
This time , she stumbled across evidence of massive fraud .
When the penny dropped She was looking at an Excel spreadsheet listing 200 assets which Enron wanted to sell to raise cash .
Against half a dozen , she saw the name Raptor .
These were complex , off the books partnerships used to hedge assets .
"" I was seeing hundreds of millions of dollars in the loss column , "" she recalls .
"" I mean you could n't do the math , it did n't work . ""
She questioned other staff , was shown stupefyingly complex charts of boxes and arrows , and at last the penny dropped .
She realised these Raptor structures were empty , shell companies capitalised with nothing but a promise of Enron stock .
They were hiding debt .
"" When I saw that I just knew this was accounting fraud .
It 's outrageous .
I thought , I have got to get out of here .
I ca n't work for a company that is doing this .
I 'm gon na work up the guts , if I can , to confront Jeffrey Skilling on my last day . ""
But soon after , Skilling resigned unexpectedly , for what he said were personal reasons .
""
He beat me out the door , "" she now says .
So Watkins sent an anonymous memo to the man who 'd taken the helm , the founder and chairman , Kenneth Lay .
Touchingly , she showed it to her mother first , who corrected it .
The memo details her eerily prescient fears that Enron might "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
Soon after , she met Lay to convey her fears face to face .
She showed him comments from a colleague close to the Raptor transactions , who 'd said : "" I know it would be devastating for all of us , but sometimes I wish we would get caught , we 're such a crooked company . ""
Watkins pauses .
"" When Ken Lay read that , he actually winced , you know , a crooked company , how could that possibly be ? ""
Enron began an inquiry , but it failed to use independent investigators and her claims were largely dismissed .
Months later , it revealed the black hole in its earnings , and confidence in the company evaporated .
"" My warnings came too little , too late to save Enron . ""
Some former colleagues take a dim view of her actions , arguing she raised concerns only when it was clear the ship was going down , and they point out that she sold Enron stock options worth $ 17,000 shortly after talking to Ken Lay .
That 's minimal , compared to sell - offs by other executives .
Others claim that what she did does n't even qualify as true whistleblowing , because she never took her concerns outside the company , to the financial regulator or a third party .
Why not ?
She clears her throat at what 's obviously a recurring question .
"" When a company cooks the books , it rarely has a chance of surviving , but to do that it has to come clean itself , to admit its problems and re - state its financials .
I felt here was Enron 's chance to come clean . ""
Soon after Enron 's bankruptcy , her part in its drama suddenly came to light .
In January 2002 , a Congressional committee published her memo to Ken Lay .
Overnight , massed ranks of TV and press reporters beat a path to her door in Houston .
"" It was mind - boggling , "" she recalls , "" but in some respects it was vindication that I had been right .
"" There was an even bigger media circus to come .
Last February , she testified before the Congress and Senate .
Jeffrey Skilling gave evidence beside her , maintaining he knew nothing of Enron 's troubles when he resigned .
She believes Skilling was "" hoping his old intimidatory tactics would work ; he would give me the evil eye and I would not give my opinion to Congress "" .
If so , it did n't work .
Was he telling the truth about how little he knew ?
She is unbending .
"" I think that was not true .
He knew the future for Enron was looking bleak .
I think he could look down the road and say , oops , I do n't have another rabbit to pull out of the hat , these Raptor structures are going to explode on me in a couple of years
and I 've got ta get outta here . ""
The criminal investigation into the scandal goes on .
A number of former executives have been charged with offences including fraud , among their number Andrew Fastow .
If convicted , he faces hundreds of years in jail .
He has pleaded not guilty .
But Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay have not been indicted , to the consternation of many former employees and investors .
I asked Watkins what she expects to happen to them .
She measures her words carefully .
"" I do n't think Ken Lay in the long term will be indicted .
I think it is likely they will indict Jeffrey Skilling . ""
Rumours have been circulating in Houston that a key executive is about to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors investigating Skilling .
Watkins now gives lectures about corporate ethics .
She 's co - written a book about Enron , and is launching a company offering the services of older independent directors to sit on boards .
The Ken Lay defence
In the end , what did her actions really achieve ?
She sits back and considers .
"" It may help convict some people , "" she hazards , "" but I think it 's really more helpful in the legislation that got passed . ""
Members of Congress were shocked by what 's known as "" the Ken Lay defence "" .
Watkins describes it thus : "" Sorry , I was asleep at the switch , out to lunch , did n't know what was happening .
"" As a result , the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley Act requires CEOs and CFOs to certify financial accounts are true .
If they 're found to be lying , they face up to 20 years in jail .
She takes a pugnacious pleasure in explaining why this could be a great motivator . ""
Monetary fines do n't do it .
If you 've made a hundred million dollars and you 're fined $ 25 m , you 're still filthy rich .
To go to jail scares these guys to death .
Standing in a cafeteria line for food , communal showers ?
It will change them forever .
"" It 's not clear how much the new legislation owes to directly to Watkins .
And in any case , institutional investors and other critics feel the new law falls far short of what 's needed .
But there is one thing her whistleblowing actions certainly achieved .
They changed her own life , forever .

2003-06-26,"The hunt for high - yielding financial returns in a climate of low interest rates may be tempting investors into risky assets , the Bank of England warns today .
In its half - yearly health check on the state of the global financial system , the Bank reports an easing of the concerns voiced last autumn during the fall - out from the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
The latest edition of the Financial Stability Review says that the system has shown few signs of stress despite weaker growth , the sharp fall in share prices up to mid - March and the heightened uncertainty related to oil prices and the build - up to war in Iraq .
It adds that one of the main safety valves - lower interest rates - is not just relieving pressure on borrowers but encouraging investors and financial intermediaries to take on greater risks to secure higher yields . ""
During the last six months there have been widespread downward revisions to forecasts for short - term economic growth .
Even so , credit spreads have declined markedly and the heightened concerns about corporate credit risk evident in autumn 2002 appear to have abated "" , said Sir Andrew Large , the Bank 's deputy governor for financial stability .
"" This seems partly to reflect firms ' efforts to restructure their balance sheets , and also the low level of interest rates , which has reduced cash debt service requirements for corporate , household and sovereign borrowers . ""
Sir Andrew added that low interest rates and plentiful liquidity may also have stimulated a "" search for yield "" , with some investors as a result shifting their portfolios towards riskier assets .
The decline in credit spreads may in part reflect such shifts rather than a genuine reduction in credit risk .
"" The implications of this ' search for yield ' for the overall distribution of risks in the financial system would seem to merit further investigation and additional vigilance . ""
In addition to the steps taken by the corporate sector to improve balance sheets , the review said there were two other reasons why the financial system had been able to shrug off the effects of weak growth and geo - political tension .
First , there had been a growth in bank lending to households , considered less risky than exposure to companies and where recent losses had generally remained small .
Second , the banking system was resilient despite the recent pressures . ""
In each case , the further decline in interest rates has been a major influence , with both nominal and ( in most cases ) real interest rates now exceptionally low across the maturity spectrum . """
2003-06-28,"One of today 's most hallowed economic truths is that markets function better than planned economies .
Yet looking at the errors , follies and abuses perpetuated in the name of the market since the collapse of communist eastern Europe , you begin to wonder .
Enron , Arthur Andersen , AOL - Time Warner , Marconi , Lucent , the Wall Street investment banks , the dotcoms ...
these are supposed to be adverts for rationality , efficient markets and the evident superiority of the market system .
The ironical truth is that those who believe most fervently in markets - businessmen , consultants and the business press - are their most unreliable guides .
They argue vociferously that the best markets are the freest , that they are powered by greed and self - interest , that the role of the state should be minimal , that success is the result of brilliant design and that regulation automatically damages ' competitiveness ' and costs jobs .
Yet these beliefs are false , as are the strategies based on them , with the results seen only too clearly in the corporate catastrophes mentioned above .
Capitalists , you might say , are capitalism 's worst enemy - and particularly the market fundamentalist tendency which has been in the ascendant for the last 20 years .
John Kay calls this the American Business Model , or ABM for short , and the perverse consequences of its delusional account of economic reality are one of the principal threads of his provocative new book The Truth
About Markets :
Their Genius , Their Limits , Their Follies ( Allen Lane The Penguin Press , £ 25 ) .
Kay says he wrote the book to counter the crass oversimplifications of market fundamentalists since the end of the Cold War .
Their precepts are both unattractive and untrue , he says .
In poor countries they have done fearful damage , holding back development ; while in rich ones ' the assertion that greed is not only our dominant economic motivation but even an admirable value has not led to universal prosperity but to corporate theft and corruption ' .
Markets work , Kay notes , through ' disciplined pluralism ' - a process of endless trial and error which leads to con stant but unpredictable small - scale incremental improvements .
These in turn provoke evolutionary adaptations in the surrounding social and institutional framework .
Successful markets are inseparable from the supporting context in which they are embedded ; truly free markets are countries such as Nigeria , Haiti and post - Cold - War Russia which are poor , chaotic and venal .
The only rich country to have deliberately applied the ABM is New Zealand , which after a decade and a half of outstandingly poor performance has abandoned it in favour of more moderate policies .
Companies are n't markets ( that 's the point ) , but to survive and evolve they too need to work through ' disciplined pluralism ' - management by delegation and accountability - rather than central diktat .
Centralised bureaucratic firms and state enterprises are the last refuge of the planned economy and stagnate and decay for the same reasons , not to do with ownership but lack of adaptive experimentation .
It is the invisible , not the visible hand that makes the market work : countless small interactions , not the big bet , which is almost bound to be wrong , whether in public or private sector . '
We do n't have and never could have the precise knowledge to maximise shareholder value in a scientific way , ' says Kay .
This helps to explain why instrumental motivations are often self - defeating - profit - oriented companies are n't necessarily the most profitable , because delusions about the way markets work induce them to act in ways that defeat their own long - term interests .
In the name of shareholder value , they cut costs , slash R&amp;D or make large ' strategic ' acquisitions , all of which halt evolutionary experiment in its tracks and wreck the co - operative , team - based behaviour that supports it .
Markets - and company success - are about developing little stories , not grand narratives . '
It 's hard to find many companies which have gained enduring advantage as a result of a grand vision , ' he says .
Grand corporate visions are like governments trying to pick winners .
And those that are half right can play out as badly as those that are 100 per cent wrong .
For example , AOL and Time - Warner were right to foresee convergence of internet content and delivery : providers need content and vice versa .
But they were wrong to bank on the merger being the one best way to achieve the finished article .
Similarly , ATT correctly saw that telephones and computers would come together , but buying a second - ranking computer company was a disastrous way of trying to force convergence into one particular channel .
Other disfigurements of capitalism derive from similar misconceptions about markets .
The obscenity of so much executive pay is nothing to do with the market .
If there were a market in top executives , companies would n't need remuneration committees and consultants to tell them what to pay .
Instead , it 's based on the delusion of design - the idea that successful companies are or even can be the product of a mind that can foresee all eventualities and deliberately plan for them .
Instead , a company like GE is the product of countless interactions between countless actors down the years .
No one ' designed ' today 's GE , not even its series of legendary chief executives , although Jack Welch appeared to have succumbed to that belief by the end of his tenure .
Kay 's inquiry , developed through a large number of ' little stories ' ranging from Van Gogh and Picasso to the San Remo flower market , is a welcome antidote to the one - dimensional , reductionist accounts of the business world produced by followers and fellow - travellers of the ABM .
With Adair Turner 's Just Capital and our own Will Hutton 's The World
We 're
In , Kay 's book provides another justification and foundation stone for trying different , less arrogant ways of running our companies and working life .
The truth about markets is that there are alternatives , after all . simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2003-07-05,"The criminal behaviour of a hard core of corporate crooks risks prompting a government backlash that will drive genuine risk - takers away from careers in business , the head of one of Britain 's biggest multinationals says today .
Niall FitzGerald , the joint chairman and chief executive of Unilever , said the Enron and WorldCom scandals meant chief executives were now seen as even less trustworthy than lawyers or estate agents .
In an outspoken interview with the Guardian , Mr Fitz Gerald said those running boardrooms could be divided into three categories : "" There are the crooks , there are the incompetents , and there are the mostly competent . ""
Only 5 % were crooks , he said , but a recent poll had shown that 86 % of the public believed executives were up to no good . ""
The crooks should be driven out , tried and put in jail .
The incompetents , once they have manifestly been seen to be incompetent , should be taken from their responsibilities and allowed to do something else .
The mostly competent should be judged on what they deliver . ""
Government ministers have started to reflect public disquiet at big payouts to underperforming executives .
Mr FitzGerald - whose pay package from Unilever was £ 2 m last year - said salaries should be transparent , have demanding criteria , and be based on the principle that "" people who do n't perform do n't get paid "" .
Mr FitzGerald said there was a danger that the assumption of blanket criminality would be used to impose draconian new laws on companies which would damage wealth creation .
"" If governance structures are based on that assumption , the mostly competent people , the risk takers , will be driven out of business altogether , "" he said .
Mr FitzGerald said the corporate culture of the 1990s had encouraged criminal behaviour .
"" The reward for being a crook was greater "" he said .
In the US , he said , a chief executive officer earned 50 times the wage of the average worker in 1990 , but 500 times as much by 2000 .
"" The productivity of the average US CEO did not increase tenfold in the 1990s , "" Mr FitzGerald added .
"" So my question is , when did we lose a sense of proportion and value ? """
2003-07-10,"Patricia Hewitt is today expected to announce plans to strengthen the powers of auditors through legislation designed to avoid an Enron - style scandal in Britain .
But by announcing the new companies and community interest bill the trade and industry secretary will be tacitly acknowledging that her plans to make sweeping reforms of company law will not be ready for the next session of parliament .
Instead of waiting for the company law bill , she will introduce separate legislation that will allow auditors to demand information from company directors as well as require directors to state they have not withheld information from their auditors .
The financial reporting review panel , the accounting regulator , will also be given new powers to enforce its rules .
In addition the tax authorities will be able to pass on any suspicions from their investigations .
Ms Hewitt embarked on a review of the accounting and auditing professions after the collapse of energy company Enron in an unprecedented accounting scandal which raised questions about the role of auditors and non - executive directors .
Businessman Sir Robert Smith has already made proposals to toughen up the role of audit committees on company boards , while Derek Higgs has reviewed the role of non - executive directors .
Ms Hewitt is expected to tell an audience of business leaders today that the government has avoided legislation on the scale of Sarbanes - Oxley in the United States , which has been criticised for being a knee - jerk reaction to the Enron scandal .
Ms Hewitt is expected to tell the business in the community conference today : "" Our response to the Enron and Worldcom scandals [ in the US ] has been well thought through , and it is important that we press on now with this priority legislation , tightening up both company auditing and the regulation of auditors themselves .
"" She is also expected to outline proposals for community interest companies , or CICs , which are intended to be used by companies aiming to help local communities .
She will also commit the government to introducing draft regulations - which do not need legislation - to require companies to publish an operating and financial review - which is again intended to improve the transparency of companies ' accounts .
These OFRs , which will be in addition to annual reports , are supposed to contain information about all areas of a company 's business , including social and environmental issues .
It seems likely that Ms Hewitt 's companies and community interest bill will steer clear of the controversial issue of limiting the liability of auditors to any legal action in the event of a company collapse .
It is thought this issue will be held back for the company law review , which involves changes rules dating back as far as the 19th century .
The bill will , however , require companies to publish full details about the non - audit services they have bought from their auditors ."
2003-07-11,"Enron 's creditors will get a fraction of what they are owed when the scandal - ridden company emerges from bankruptcy , under new arrangements it has revealed today .
According to the plan , which Enron finally submitted after five deadline extensions , most creditors will receive 14.4 cents to 18.3 cents on every dollar owed .
Enron will also be divided into two new , separate companies .
The Enron bankruptcy , one of the most expensive in history , has left 20,000 creditors owed an estimated $ 67bn ( £ 41bn ) .
By comparison , bondholders in WorldCom 's bankruptcy are to receive 36 cents on the dollar , in the only bankruptcy to eclipse Enron 's .
When it comes to picking over the remains of a bankrupt company , bondholders are normally second in line to creditors ( such as large banks ) that arranged loans for the firm .
But in Enron 's case , financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are , as unsecured creditors , classed as bondholders - so they will receive the same paltry leftovers .
The rest of the Enron plan , already approved by major creditors , says creditors will divide proceeds from asset sales and auctions and receive equity in the two new companies - one domestic , the other international .
The domestic business , CrossCountry Energy , will take on Enron 's complete or part - interest in three North American natural gas pipelines .
The second company , temporarily dubbed InternationalCo . , includes 19 international power and pipeline holdings .
If Enron decides to keep Portland General Electric , its Pacific Northwest utility , that would form a third independent company in which creditors also would receive equity .
Enron is currently soliciting bids on the utility .
The US bankruptcy judge in New York , Arthur Gonzalez , must approve the plan , which includes several previously announced components such as the spin - offs of its pipeline and international assets .
Last month , Enron announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with its creditors on the reorganisation plan , and asked the court for a short extension to file its long - delayed blueprint for recovery .
In December 2001 , Enron made what was then the largest US bankruptcy filing in history , collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented financial accounting scandal which was the first of several that helped to undermine investor confidence in Wall Street ."

2003-07-15,"Labour MP Chris Bryant has apologised to the BBC for comparing the corporation to Enron , the disgraced US energy company , in a parliamentary committee hearing earlier today .

2003-07-15,"BBC chairman Gavyn Davies has hit back at a Labour MP who compared the corporation to the disgraced US energy firm Enron , warning him he could be sued for libel if he repeated the claim outside parliament .
Chris Bryant , a veteran critic of the BBC , said in a culture select committee hearing today that the document "" feels more like an Enron annual report than a BBC annual report "" - a reference to the US energy firm that went bankrupt in 2001 after fiddling its accounts on a grand scale .
"" When you make a libellous comment like that , you should be careful where you make it , "" Mr Davies said this afternoon .
"" The governors have generally come to the view that the BBC has had a good year .
I do n't see why we should n't reflect that in the annual report , "" he added .
The BBC director general , Greg Dyke , said he thought Mr Bryant 's comment was an "" outrageous suggestion "" .
"" I would expect better of a member of parliament .
We all know what Enron means , "" Mr Dyke added .
Mr Davies also accused the culture select committee chairman , Labour MP Gerald Kaufman , of giving a "" misleading description "" of the BBC governors ' review of the corporation 's performance in the annual report .
The Labour MP said earlier today the report "" contained no criticism "" of the corporation and was "" complacent in the extreme "" .

2003-07-15,"BBC director general Greg Dyke today clashed furiously with Labour MPs over the corporation 's annual report after one likened it to that of disgraced energy giant Enron , which went bankrupt after fiddling its accounts on a grand scale .
In a renewed onslaught on the embattled BBC , the Labour MP Chris Bryant rounded on the corporation 's chairman , Gavyn Davies , and the board of governors , saying the report "" contained no criticism "" of the BBC and was "" complacent in the extreme "" . ""
This feels more like an Enron annual report than a BBC annual report , "" he said , accusing the BBC governors of omitting the fact it had missed its target for the number of independent commissions and glossing over the fact that many people were paying for digital channels they could not receive .
Mr Dyke hit back , saying he deeply resented Mr Bryant 's "" disgraceful "" accusations and demanded an apology . ""
Enron was a corrupt financially managed business .
That 's what you 're implying .
I think it 's disgraceful and you should apologise for it , "" said Mr Dyke , who has spent the last month sparring with the government over the Iraq war dossier .
Mr Bryant said he was happy to apologise for any inference that the BBC was financially corrupt but insisted his central point , that the report glossed over many of the BBC 's deficiencies , still stood .
In a stormy exchange at the annual meeting of the media select committee to discuss the BBC 's annual report , Mr Davies retorted that "" the BBC in my judgement has had a very strong year .
It is my judgment and that of the board of governors that the BBC has had a very strong year .
I do n't apologise for saying it . ""
Mr Dyke also took issue with the committee 's claims that the BBC was wasting its money by spending £ 280 m a year on digital channels that could not be picked up by the whole population . ""
The Labour government decided that there should n't be a digital licence fee so therefore for a period of time there would be people paying the licence fee who were n't receiving digital services , "" he said , adding that the BBC 's recent decision to broadcast unencrypted on satellite meant that "" virtually everyone "" could now receive BBC channels if they had the right equipment .
The corporation also came under attack from Labour MP Gerald Kaufmann , who accused it of making "" preposterous and untenable "" claims about the popularity of BBC News 24 .
Mr Kaufmann demanded to know why the BBC claimed its rolling news channel had been "" seen by 70 % of the population - 40 million people - in the first week of the conflict "" when another section of the report revealed it could be seen by just 0.4 % of all viewers .
When Mr Davies replied that BBC News 24 had been simulcast on BBC1 during the first week of the Iraq war , Mr Kaufmann said : "" I 'm not saying you 're not being very honest but the report is not very honest .
You do n't say ' as part of the BBC1 audience ' .
You just say it . ""
Whoever put together this report - and I assume that you and Mr Dyke take overall responsibility - has made a preposterous and utterly untenable claim . ""
Mr Dyke said the report pointed out that BBC News 24 had been shown on BBC1 and BBC2 during the war . ""
During the war there were many hours of BBC News 24 that were switched and shown on BBC1 , "" he said .

2003-07-16,"The BBC was drawn into another bruising encounter with politicians yesterday when MPs accused the corporation of producing a "" gushing , Enron - style "" annual report laden with "" euphemistic phraseology "" .
Members of the Commons select committee for culture , media and sport lined up to attack the BBC 's governors for putting a positive gloss on the corporation 's performance over the past year .
The BBC responded by criticising the "" disgraceful "" comparison of its annual review to the failed US energy giant , which collapsed because of financial mismanagement .
The row was brought about by the rosy picture painted by the annual report , published yesterday .
Gavyn Davies , the BBC chairman , said in his foreword that 2002 - 03 was a "" very successful "" year with "" real progress made in delivering programmes of quality and distinction "" .
Greg Dyke , the BBC 's director general , said : "" By any standards it has been a remarkable year at all levels - global , national and local . ""
One of the few negative references concerned the corporation 's failure to connect with ethnic minority audiences .
But beyond the glowing tributes and glossy pictures , there is evidence to support serious questions about the BBC 's performance : · The launch of new digital services has pushed the corporation into the red by £ 74 m .
The debt will double by 2006 before a projected break even point that coincides with the BBC 's new charter in 2007 .
· There is a £ 1bn shortfall in the BBC 's pension fund .
The corporation leaked this news last week to prevent it overshadowing yesterday 's launch . · The BBC spent £ 102 m on publicity and market research , almost £ 8 m more than on newsgathering . ·

· A new accounting procedure makes the BBC 's budget appear lower : BBC1 's budget was placed at £ 858.9 m but calculated in the same way as the previous year , it would be £ 1.13bn .
The BBC said the channel budgets have been separated from PR and news budgets for "" transparency "" .
Critics said the BBC was trying to look leaner in the run - up to charter renewal .
The positive spin infuriated members of the select committee , to whom the report is presented every year .
Chris Bryant , the Labour MP for Rhondda , said : "" This feels more like an Enron annual report than a BBC annual report . ""
He accused the BBC of failing to acknowledge that many people paid for digital channels they did not receive .
"" This is just about the most complacent report I have ever seen , "" he said .
Mr Dyke said he resented the "" disgraceful "" comparison with Enron , and demanded a retraction .
Mr Bryant apologised if his remarks suggested the BBC was corrupt but stood by his charge that the report was misleading .
Gerald Kaufman , the Labour chairman of the committee , criticised the BBC for the "" preposterous and utterly untenable "" claim that 70 % of the population had "" seen "" BBC News 24 , whereas the channel 's audience , when measured by conventional ratings standards was tiny .
He challenged the executives to find "" one critical adjective "" in the "" gushing "" document , saying the board of governors had proved itself unsuited to its task .
Mr Dyke said at a news conference : "" We all know what Enron means and the idea that our accounts are anything to do with what went on at Enron was an outrageous suggestion . ""
Mr Davies said the Enron remark was libellous , but conceded Mr Bryant enjoyed the protection of parliamentary privilege .
He said the governors genuinely believed the BBC had performed well in the past year ."

2003-07-23,"A corporate code aimed at avoiding an Enron - style scandal will be published today , behind schedule and watered down from the hard - hitting proposals outlined by Derek Higgs six months ago .
The financial reporting council , responsible for implementing the Higgs code , is believed to have given ground to businesses which claimed the proposals were too rigid and would alter the balance of power in Britain 's boardrooms .
The code needs to be ratified by a 30-strong committee today .
It is expected to be accompanied by a suggestion that company bosses and leading institutional investors consider meeting informally as part of an attempt to relieve the tension caused by this year 's rowdy annual meeting season .
The Higgs code was commissioned by the government and outlined a bigger role for non - executives .
It suggested a senior non - executive director be appointed to work with the chairman .
Complaints by business delayed its introduction this month and the FRC is thought to have concluded that it needed to be adapted .
The suggestion that chief executives should not be elevated to chairmen - the subject of much resistance by business leaders - has been tempered to require companies to consult with their shareholders before proceeding with such a move .
They must also give a clear explanation in their annual report .
The idea that companies should comply with the code or explain their deviation is also thought to have been turned on its head so that shareholders must seek explanations from companies , to avoid a "" box - ticking "" approach to corporate governance .
The FRC is thought to have reacted to concerns from company executives about proposed meetings between shareholders and senior non - executives - in addition to company chairman - by concluding that they need take place only once a year .
Digby Jones , director general of employers ' body the CBI , said : "" It looks like the FRC is going to deliver something much more workable .
There were concerns that the original proposals would become overly prescriptive , undermine chairmen and threaten boardroom unity , making British companies less competitive . ""
The FRC had already blocked a Higgs recommendation that company chairmen should not chair the nomination committee , which is involved in succession planning ."
2003-07-24,"Former Enron workers are seeking to recover $ 72 m ( £ 45 m ) in bonuses paid to senior executives in the hours before the energy firm went bankrupt .
The committee representing employees of the company said the bonuses were awarded to 286 staff in amounts ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 5 m .
The average severance payout for ordinary workers was just $ 15,000 .
"" We intend to hold 11th hour bonus recipients accountable for their self - dealing as Enron fell into bankruptcy , "" said Richard Rathvon , co - chair of the employee committee .
"" Even as thousands of regular Enron employees and retirees were facing the loss of life savings , health benefits , their jobs or pensions , these favoured few were scheming to get millions more for themselves . ""
According to the filing , on the day before Enron filed for bankruptcy , finance director Jeffrey McMahon received $ 1.5 m to stay with the firm for 90 days .
James Fallon , former president and chief executive of Enron Broadband Services received $ 1.5 m , even though the division was never profitable .
A further 56 commodity traders and another 228 employees are also named .
The suit argues that because the cheques paid to staff did not clear until after the bankruptcy was filed , they needed approval by the bankruptcy court .
Enron maintained the bonuses were a legitimate means of retaining key staff and keeping the business going after it filed for bankruptcy .
Four lawsuits , which related to the bonuses but had not previously been made public , were filed in a Houston court earlier this year and were recently consolidated into one .
Enron fell into bankruptcy after it emerged the firm had been shifting debt off its books and inflating revenues through dubious accounting ."
2003-07-24,"Industry leaders and powerful City investors yesterday used the publication of a new corporate governance code to call for a truce in the recent public rows over boardroom pay and practices .
All market - listed companies had to comply with the original code , which has already cleaned up corporate Britain since it was first published in 1998 .
The revised code incorporates recommendations from businessman Derek Higgs , who says a bigger role for non - executive directors is necessary if Britain is to avoid a corporate disaster on the scale of that caused by US energy company Enron .
The revised combined code is being implemented four months later than scheduled .
Revisions were made following heavy lobbying by bodies such as the CBI , which represents larger companies .
Even so , big investors said it was an opportunity to try to close the rift between them and the big corporations after one of the most stormy annual meeting seasons on record .
Peter Montagnon , head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers , which represents shareholders controlling a third of the stock market , said it was time to "" draw a line "" .
He added : "" It is not natural for owners of companies to be in confrontation with companies . ""
Sir Bryan Nicholson , chairman of the Financial Reporting Council , which is responsible for designing the code , agreed .
He was looking at ways of fostering a more "" productive "" dialogue between companies and shareholders .
Sir Bryan was adamant that the code had not been watered down . ""
The code contains virtually all the key recommendations of the Higgs report .
The strictly limited refinements made do not in any sense in any way undermine the fundamental advances in corporate governance that the code offers . ""
Digby Jones , head of the CBI , hailed changes to the Higgs proposals as a "" victory for commonsense "" .
The 83-page code contains a model recruitment letter for new non - executive directors , to try to break the "" old boy "" network , and requires that boards ' performance is evaluated .
It also sets out guidelines for remuneration committees , saying they should take a "" robust line on reducing compensation to reflect departing directors ' obligations to mitigate loss "" and be "" sensitive "" to pay and conditions elsewhere in the company .
Brendan Barber , general secretary of the TUC , said : "" The code has the potential to make Britain 's boardrooms work better .
It is now up to business to turn good words into good practice . ""
Employers ' body the CBI won the following amendments : · Comply or explain : shareholders must explain why they do not like a company 's stance towards the code , shifting the onus from firms having to explain why they do not comply · Role of the chairman : will be allowed to chair the nomination committee , which had been ruled out by Higgs · Senior independent directors : instead of their chairing regular meetings of non - executives without the chairman present , the meetings need only be annual · Chief executives should not become chairmen : now possible provided there is consultation with shareholders ·
Smaller firms : Those below FTSE 350 size need not comply with the rule that at least 50 % of the board should be non - executives , provided they have at least two non - executives"
2003-07-28,"Enron unleashed a flood of corporate failures .
Yet , throughout 2002 , it was the telecommunications sector that routinely delivered entries to the top 10 US bankruptcy list , culminating with WorldCom , the mother of all chapter 11 filings .
The energy sector 's woes were less dramatic , giving the impression it might escape .
But investigations , over - capacity , deceptive accounting and huge debt in a sea of downgrades characterise nearly every US merchant energy company .
Only the year of debt refinancing with a nervous Wall Street has prolonged the decay .
Mirant bagged the biggest bankruptcy of the year honours two weeks ago .
There 's more to come .
The power marketers took advantage of deregulation to not only control the creation and distribution of energy , but to engage in complex financial activities designed to inflate profits and gouge consumers , trading everything from natural gas and electricity to bandwidth and the risk of earthquakes or rain .
After 1996 deregulation , energy debt issuance rocketed .
The sector borrowed more than $ 1.2 trillion through loans , credit and bonds ; $ 80bn is due by 2006 , $ 23bn within the next six months .
That debt supported numerous endeavours , none of which had anything to do with customer service .
It capitalised those highly leveraged , speculative trading operations , since shut down or still unwinding at huge losses .
Debt was also stashed in "" goodwill "" buckets on corporate balance sheets .
The sector has n't produced the write - downs that telecoms did , but this is coming .
Debt funded plant and generator constructions and acquisitions , contributing to today 's capacity glut .
US companies raised money to buy international ones .
Debt provided the avenue for energy firms to expand fibre - optic networks that nobody needed .
The sector vaporised half a trillion dollars in market value .
Once prominent investment grade , merchant companies such as Dynegy , Reliant Resources , El Paso , Mirant , Calpine , CMS , Aquila and Allegheny were downgraded to junk and slapped with fraud investigations .
Their stock remains 90 % off past highs .
Companies shed assets at fire sale prices and refinanced , yet posted 20 % declines in revenue last quarter .
El Paso got a new chief executive after months of searching : Douglas L Foshee , a former Halliburton boss with no pipeline experience .
He received a $ 2.65 m joining package , not exactly confidence inspiring .
El Paso and others count on Washington buddies to follow a "" too big to fail "" motto that has the federal energy regulatory commission handling investigations with kid gloves .
The FERC dropped a ball by upholding corporate contracts negotiated with California at the height of the 2000 - 2001 price gouging period , but individual states continue fighting .
Montana has filed a suit against 13 energy and two Wall Street firms for price rises resulting from their California market manipulation .
Companies such as Dynegy , Reliant Resources and El Paso remain at death 's door despite huge refinancings , though some analysts think El Paso will survive because it has real pipelines , providing stable ( read regulated ) income .
According to Tyson Slocum , head of energy research at Public Citizen : "" The rough water is far from over ; anyone who says otherwise is n't investing their own money . ""
True .
Last week , Aquila in Missouri persuaded the Colorado public utilities commission to use its assets as collateral for daily operations , a desperate request .
Then there 's Allegheny , which has sought SEC approval for a $ 2.2bn cash injection .
Because of the entwined relationship between its regulated utility and unregulated trading businesses , a likely bankruptcy would cause significant service disruptions .
The picture is bleak .
The question of a broad sector implosion is not if , but when .
As Robert Rubin , Deutsche bank utility and energy credit analyst , put it : "" There are no winners in this sector , only non - losers . "" · : Former banker Nomi Prins is author of the forthcoming book , Money for Nothing"
2003-07-29,"JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup , two of Wall Street 's leading investment banks , yesterday agreed to pay a combined $ 255 m ( £ 157 m ) to settle charges that they helped Enron , the bankrupt energy company , to commit fraud .
The settlement closes another chapter in the Enron saga and regulators hope it will go some way toward restoring the confidence in Wall Street which has been eroded by 18 months of scandals .
Andrew Fastow , the former finance chief at Enron who faces multiple fraud charges , was due back in court in Houston yesterday to discuss trial dates , currently scheduled for January .
A total of nine former Enron executives have been indicted .
Yesterday 's settlement with US financial watchdog the securities and exchange commission and the Manhattan district attorney , Robert Morgenthau , was for claims that the banks helped disguise loans as income from trading to make Enron appear more profitable than it was and to hide debt .
JP Morgan is paying $ 135 m and Citigroup $ 120 m , with the proceeds going into a fund for fraud victims .
Neither company admitted liability or any wrongdoing .
A small part of the Citigroup penalty related to similar charges stemming from its work with a separate energy company , Dynegy .
The banks are not in the clear yet .
They still face private shareholder lawsuits and a separate report on the banks ' role , by a bankruptcy court - appointed examiner , was due to be published last night .
Stephen Cutler , director of the SEC 's enforcement division , said : "" These two cases serve as yet another reminder that you ca n't turn a blind eye to the consequences of your actions - if you know or have reason to know that you are helping a company mislead its investors , you are in violation of the federal securities laws . ""
Enron filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 and sparked a wave of corporate failures and allegations of financial misdeeds that stunned investors .
It emerged that Houston - based Enron had been hiding debts and inflating revenues through a series of off - balance sheet ventures .
Merrill Lynch in February agreed to pay $ 80 m to settle an SEC investigation into two Enron deals involving power - generating barges in Nigeria .
Merrill did not accept any liability in the settlement and said the agreement concluded the SEC 's investigations into its relationship with bankrupt company .
Mr Morgenthau yesterday said he would not file criminal charges against JP Morgan or Citigroup or any of their employees for activities relating to Enron , as a part of the agreed settlement ."
2003-08-21,"Enron Corp , the bankrupt American energy trading outfit , is looking for a buyer to snap up its headquarters in Houston , Texas .
The 50-storey building , with its rotating corporate sign outside , became a familiar sight on television screens across the world when Enron collapsed 18 months ago amid one of the most spectacular financial scandals in US corporate history .
The signs have already been sold , and now it is time for Enron to rid itself of the rest of the building .
The first of the four Enron ' E ' logos was sold for $ 45,000 while the last went for just $ 8,500 .
Enron is hoping the sale of its headquarters will be a more successful auction .
It has appointed New York - based firm Granite Partners to sell 1,400 Smith Street in downtown Houston , which it has occupied since just after it was built in the early 1980s .
Bids are due by September 19 .
The building is actually owned by Brazos Holdings , but Enron 's major creditors will receive most of the proceeds of the sale - which could net up to $ 100 m .
When Enron was riding high the building housed 7,500 workers .
It now employs 1,200 , and is planning to move to a more modest address in Houston in March .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 , crippled by $ 35bn of debt .
Separately , New York 's state comptroller , Alan Hevesi , yesterday announced that the wave of corporate scandals that have engulfed the city 's financial centre over the past three years have cost the state an estimated $ 2.9bn .
Corporate corruption , from Enron to WorldCom , reduced state revenues by $ 1bn and decreased the state pension fund value by $ 9bn .
Companies restating their earnings increased by 230 in 2001 - up 379 % from 1996 .
Federal securities fraud class action suits more than quadrupled to 488 in 2001 from the 78 filed in 1996 ."
2003-08-30,"Opposite Enron , WorldCom will forever stand beside the gateway to the great end of millennium bear market : a colossal pillar of corporate excess , an enduring reminder of the perils of greed and corruption .
This week , the man charged with overseeing WorldCom 's douching published an appropriately weighty blueprint for a squeaky clean corporate future .
The numbers involved are still mind - boggling .
Accounting fraud at the telecommunications giant "" created "" billions of dollars of fraudulent profits .
The firm , once valued at hundreds of billions of dollars , went bankrupt .
Its guilty executives pocketed hundreds of millions in the process .
Reputations were destroyed , including that of accountants Arthur Andersen .
Underneath the artifice a real company existed , employing tens of thousands of staff and with millions of customers worldwide .
That company still exists - albeit under the name of MCI - and , in the true American way , a path has been determined whereby a phoenix should arise from WorldCom 's ashes .
Part of this process has been the appointment of a corporate monitor whose role was initially to stick his fingers in the financial dyke and , more recently , to establish corporate governance practices sufficient to prevent a return to the past .
This latter role , although not of immediate financial criticality , could yet prove vital to MCI 's future fortunes .
Richard Breeden , appointed by the US courts as corporate monitor , boasts an impressive CV as a turnaround specialist .
He helped to bail President Bush Sr out of the savings and loans crisis , has a stint as chairman of the securities and exchange commission under his belt and is available to speak on all manner of subjects for a fee of up to $ 30,000 plus expenses via The All - Star Agency .
Money , of course , lies at the root of most problems and solutions in the American system .
Breeden 's report , setting out 78 recommendations whereby MCI should be governed in future , does not duck the money issue .
Indeed , he clearly believes that successful executives deserve substantial rewards and that non - executives must be fairly compensated for the risks and responsibilities they shoulder .
Compete and thrive Breeden drew much flak in the US last December for the proposed compensation package for MCI 's new chief executive , lured from Hewlett - Packard .
The company was forced to slim it down by a few million dollars .
This week commentators including the Guardian criticised Breeden 's recommendation that executives could be granted up to $ 15 m annual pay and rations without shareholder approval .
These criticisms risk missing the point , which is that Breeden 's report aims to create a framework within which MCI can compete and thrive in the real commercial world - while at the same time ensuring that executives ' actions remain within agreed , acceptable boundaries .
It is not for MCI to conduct a one - firm crusade against high levels of compensation , especially if that might hobble it in the competitive race .
Breeden 's recommendations constitute a welcome dose of common sense .
It would be easy to dismiss them as yet another exercise in box ticking governance , but only if one chooses not to read beyond the executive summary into the meat of his text .
The recommendations are knitted together into a whole that is logical and coherent .
It would not be right for every company , but - thankfully - not every company is a WorldCom .
But there is much that could be adopted by American businesses which , on the whole , have enjoyed a much more lax governance regime than that ingrained in the UK .
This report could , for example , constitute a big step towards recognition that separation of the roles of chairman and CEO is for the best - though , as it happens , WorldCom had separate individuals in these posts .
Shareholder profits Two recommendations , although not the most significant , stand out for me .
One goes to the heart of the debate about shareholder responsibility that is raging in Britain .
The other is a welcome return to a sensible investment past .
Breeden is not only keen to ensure that MCI 's board does not get stale and that a regular turnover of non - executive directors is established through limited terms of office , but that shareholders are proactive in the selection process .
He proposes that a committee of main shareholders nominate candidates and that it be no shame if elections become genuinely competitive if MCI and its owners fail to agree .
Such an spirit is to be applauded , whatever the burden on institutional investors .
Combined with realistic non - executive fees , this might even help achieve the expansion of the pool of candidates that is so desperately needed .
The second notable recommendation , for me , is that MCI publish a target for the percentage of profits it will pay shareholders as dividends .
In recent years , partly for tax reasons , dividends have fallen out of fashion in the US .
Yet they are real flows of cash that focus management 's minds and - correctly determined - a worthwhile barometer for shareholders .
Target payout ratios will differ across companies and industries - Breeden recommends 25 % for MCI - so that they need not starve growing businesses of cash .
But they would restore one discipline that has withered to the detriment of the investment system 's health .

2003-09-11,"A former treasurer at Enron yesterday became the first executive to be jailed for his part in the scandal that tilted the energy firm into bankruptcy more than 18 months ago .
Ben Glisan was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to criminal conspiracy .
He was taken into custody immediately .
Mr Glisan , 37 , had earlier maintained his innocence in the face of charges including money laundering and wire fraud as part of a 109-count indictment against him and his one - time boss , former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow .
Mr Glisan told Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston , Texas , yesterday : "" I think I would simply like to say I take full responsibility for my actions . ""
Leslie Caldwell , head of the Enron taskforce of prosecutors , said the guilty plea should serve as a warning to others who were involved in the accounting scandal that shifted massive debts off the company balance sheet , hyped profits and allowed a select few executives to bank millions .
"" There is a lot of value in someone standing up and admitting there was financial fraud at Enron and it sends a very strong message to other people who have yet to step up to the plate , "" she said .
Mr Glisan has not struck a deal to implicate his former bosses and he is unlikely to be called as a witness in the trial of Mr Fastow in April next year .
Michael Kopper , another of Mr Fastow 's lieutenants , pleaded guilty more than a year ago to wire fraud and money laundering but is cooperating with investigators and has not yet been sentenced .
Mr Glisan is also forfeiting $ 1.4 m ( £ 875,000 ) in profits and tax refunds from a transaction with one of Enron 's off - balance sheet ventures .
Shareholders who lost billions of dollars in Enron have expressed disquiet about the pace of the case and the failure to net more senior executives .
The former chief executives of the company , Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , have both maintained their innocence .
Ms Caldwell yesterday defended the investigation .
"" We are moving at our own pace and doing a very thorough job , "" she said ."
2003-09-18,"Three former senior Merrill Lynch bankers were yesterday charged with criminal conspiracy stemming from a 1999 deal with bankrupt energy firm Enron .
The news was announced by assistant attorney - general Christopher Wray at a Washington press conference .
The arrests bring the number of people charged in the Enron investigation to 23 .
The men - Robert Furst , Daniel Bayly and James Brown - were involved in an obscure but now notorious transaction to sell three barges carrying generators off the coast of Nigeria .
It is alleged the transaction was a sham , and allowed Enron to book fictitious profits of $ 12 m ( £ 7.5 m ) which helped the company meet its fourth quarter targets that year .
In a separate settlement with the justice department , Merrill Lynch - which has not been charged - said it accepted responsibility for the conduct of its employees and would institute reforms , including monitoring all complex transactions with third parties .
It paid $ 80 m in March to settle civil charges relating to the Nigerian barges brought by American regulator the SEC .
The men , accompanied by their lawyers , surrendered to the Houston office of the FBI yesterday morning .
They were charged with falsifying books and records , carrying a maximum sentence of five years .
Mr Brown was also charged with obstruction of justice and perjury , and could face an additional 15 years in prison .
Prosecutors alleged that the Nigerian deal was structured to look like an asset sale , when in fact the barges were simply being "" parked "" with Merrill Lynch .
The indictment claims the bank was lending Enron the money and holding the barges on the understanding it would be paid back with interest in six months .
Charges from the inquiry into Enron 's collapse have been brought against former finance chief Andrew Fastow , his wife and assistant treasurer Lea ; seven people in connection with Enron 's broadband business and two in relation to energy trading in California .
Enron 's audit firm , the now defunct Arthur Andersen , was found guilty of obstruction of justice ; three former NatWest bankers have also been charged .
Ben Glisan , Enron 's treasurer , became the first of the company 's executives to be jailed last week after pleading guilty to conspiracy ."
2003-09-24,"Debt - stricken French engineering group Alstom received a sharp reminder yesterday that its fight for survival is just beginning when it emerged that the manufacturer of London Underground trains is facing a class action lawsuit in the United States .
The news - which came one day after a controversial € 3.2bn ( £ 2.2bn ) rescue plan for Alstom was agreed - appeared to unsettle investors , who began to fret about the company 's long term viability , sending its shares plunging 14 % on the Paris stock exchange at one stage .
The complaint is similar to that levelled at Enron in the US last year and alleges that Alstom deliberately deceived investors by overestimating its results and understating its net debts at various times between November 1998 and June 2003 .
The plaintiffs are unnamed minority shareholders who claim that Alstom artificially propped up its share price in the process .
They are seeking an undisclosed amount to compensate them for subsequent losses .
The fact that US lawyer Bill Lerach , the scourge of corporate America and the man who lodged the Enron complaint , is said to be handling the case will make Alstom executives all the more nervous .
According to the French magazine , L'Expansion , the case has already been filed in New York and targets
Alstom itself as well as the present and former chief executives , Patrick Kron and Pierre Bilger .
Yesterday Alstom also admitted that it may have to lay off more than the 7,000 workers - out of a total workforce of 110,000 - it is already losing as part of a radical restructuring plan .
Higher than expected restructuring costs - of € 100 m - are the main reason for the additional redundancies .
When a spokesman was asked whether the increased costs would mean more jobs lost , he said it was "" a deduction that could be made "" .
In Britain , where Alstom has already announced that it will halve its 10,000-strong workforce , such comments will send shivers down workers ' spines .
Analysts said that euphoria over the 11th hour rescue plan agreed on Monday by the European commission , the French state and Alstom 's creditors , was already starting to evaporate .
Investors had realised , they said , that Brussels ' definitive verdict on the deal would not be forthcoming for a further six months , and that Alstom 's chances of recovery were far from guaranteed .
On Monday , Mr Kron predicted two more years of losses and scant orders for the company 's high - speed trains , gas turbines and cruise ships .
Orders in the first half of this year until the end of September have plummeted by some 25 % , and Alstom 's shares have lost 90 % of their value over a two - year period ."
2003-10-02,"Ahold , the Dutch retail giant dogged by an accounting scandal in the US , published much - delayed results today , showing a € 1.2bn ( £ 841 m ) loss for 2002 .
The publication of the figures came seven months late after problems at its US subsidiary , US Foodservice , where profits had been overstated by $ 880 m ( £ 528 m ) .
The former family - owned grocer with a history going back to 1887 saw its market value crash by 70 % in February amid fears of an Enron - type scandal , after it revealed the overstatement of profits at US Foodservice .
The group 's chief executive and its finance director resigned over the debacle and several US Foodservice executives were fired .
The mis - statements were detected for 2001 and 2002 after accountants went over the books again in the US and elsewhere .
The 2002 losses stemmed from writing off € 1.3bn on operations in Spain , Argentina and the US , the company said .
By publishing audited earnings , Ahold will finally get access on a € 2.6bn credit lifeline .
Lenders had blocked the funds until they could see exactly how much damage was done by the financial scandal .
Notwithstanding its accounting problems , Ahold - the world 's third largest retailer behind Wal - Mart of the US and France 's Carrefour - reported solid results for its core business .
Its operating profit for 2002 before charges was € 2.1bn , with net sales of € 62.6bn ."
2003-10-29,"Nobody ever lost money underestimating the shameless cynicism of corporate America .
As if , in this post - Enron world , any more proof were needed , along comes the latest ad campaign from KFC promoting fried chicken for its health benefits !
The first work from KFC 's newly appointed ad agency FCB introduces the new tagline "" "" You 've Got ta KFC what 's Cookin ' "" .
As if this were not bad enough , more significantly it introduces the world to the more than faintly obscene notion that junk food is good for your diet .
In one commercial , fit and healthy looking young people compliment each other on how they look before revealing the secret of their slimline appearance : "" KFC chicken "" .
In another , a woman plonks a bucket of chicken down in front of her man with the immortal line
"" You know we 've been talkin ' about eating better ?
Well , it starts today ! ""
A voiceover in each spot then claims that an average portion of KFC contains only "" eleven grams of carbs and packs 40 grams of protein . ""
Well , that 's all right then .
This is of course the latest crass attempt to piggyback the global phenomenon that the Atkins - style low carb - diet has become , by promoting the low - carb , high - protein content of fried chicken . ""
So , if you 're going low - carb , high - protein , go KFC , "" says the voiceover .
Never mind the fat and the cholesterol levels in each portion .
You would have to read the small print ( superimposed on the screen ) to be told that "" a bucket of fried chicken is not a low - fat , low - sodium , low - cholesterol food "" .
So now we know .
A matter of weeks after Miller Lite ditched its mud - wrestling babes to promote itself as a lower calorie alternative to Bud Light and Coors Light ( and , astonishingly , got plaudits from industry commentators here for doing so ) , along comes even better news for America 's obese legions of couch potatoes .
What is going on ?
Do America 's marketers suddenly really believe that the American consumer is belatedly ready to ditch its "" eat as much as we like as long as it 's cheap "" mentality in a backlash against the epidemic of obesity ?
After all , since McDonald 's starting offering healthier varieties including salads , its sales have rebounded from their recent slump .
Is this really about consumers wanting to buy lower fat , skin free , roast chicken dishes ?
It 's a nice idea , but in reality it is far - fetched .
The cult of super sizing is as rampant as ever in fast food outlets and shopping malls all over America .
Other than the element of Atkins - inspired fashion , what 's really going on here is America 's food marketers and their ad agencies waking up to the twin threats posed by litigation and regulation .
As I wrote in a previous column , the spectre of lobby groups led by former presidential candidate Ralph Nader threatening to introduce class action lawsuits relating to obesity of the kind McDonald 's is already facing has woken up food marketers .
Early evidence of this has seen Kraft introducing smaller food portions in its ready meals , and McDonald 's , Burger King and Jack
In The Box and others changing their menus .
( Wendy 's has long dominated the healthier or salad end of the fast food market . )
Add into that mix the threat posed by regulators led by Sweden , Norway , Poland and Greece towards advertising to children on television , proposed bans that could include fast food ads as well as toy commercials , plus new threats to advertising freedoms posed by countries such as the Ukraine which this year banned tobacco and alcohol ads .
A tide of regulation is gathering against them , and marketers are well advised to take it seriously .
That 's because we have been here before : with tobacco .
Although the threat of a total ban on tobacco advertising hung over the ad industry for a quarter of a century or more , it was not taken entirely seriously until it was too late .
Instead advertising and marketing groups watched as the right to advertise tobacco was eroded piecemeal .
First , banned from television , next cinema , then print and now sponsorship .
Global food marketers operating in Europe will be more alert as a result .
And so will those same marketers in America .
However , the truth is that nothing concentrates the mind in American business life like the threat of litigation , and it is the class action lawsuits that are really behind the current sea change in menu content and marketing messages .
Not to mention the involvement of politicians such as Nader in the run - up to the presidential election next year .
There are votes in obesity .
It 's a cynical view , yes .
But the scenario is also flawed .
Surely I 'm not the only person who can see that promoting the idea of low - fat beer and fried chicken as a nutritious meal is simply a class action lawsuit waiting to happen ?
Watch this space .
It really will be the battlefield upon which the freedom to advertise will be fought . ·

2003-10-31,"Investigations into the collapse of Enron appeared to be gaining momentum yesterday when officials charged a former senior executive with allegedly helping to falsify the energy firm 's earnings statements .
David Delainey , who had been chief executive of Enron North America and Enron Energy Services , entered a guilty plea to criminal charges brought by the US justice department .
He also settled allegations made by the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) .
He is paying $ 8 m ( £ 5 m ) in penalties and disgorgement of profits he made on the sale of shares in the company during the time in question .
He was due to appear in a Houston court later in the day .
Mr Delainey is one of the most senior former Enron executives to be charged for the alleged manipulation of the Houston - based firm 's books , which hid large debts and tilted the company into bankruptcy almost two years ago .
Prosecutors will regard Mr Delainey as a significant catch .
He has agreed to cooperate with the government 's investigation and could prove a crucial witness in securing cases against executives .
Prosecutors have brought charges against 24 people stemming from the company 's failure .
The SEC said Mr Delainey had engaged in a "" wide - ranging scheme to manipulate Enron 's publicly reported earnings ... to produce materially false and misleading financial results "" .
It further alleged that he profited from the manipulation of the books by insider trading , reaping "" millions of dollars in profits "" .
He was specifically accused of shifting money around to hide bad debts .
He was also implicated in the notorious deal involving the ' sale ' of energy barges in Nigeria to Merrill Lynch in 1999 to ensure the company met its targets .
The sale , it has since emerged , was actually a loan .
The US public has grown impatient at the slow pace of the investigation into the scandal , but recent evidence suggests that prosecutors are starting to make progress .
Last month , three former Merrill Lynch bankers were charged with criminal conspiracy in the Nigerian episode , and the one - time Enron treasurer , Ben Glisan , became the first person to be jailed after pleading guilty to conspiracy .
The most senior official to face charges so far is the erstwhile finance chief , Andrew Fastow ."
2003-11-11,"The outbreak of Enronitis that once plagued the United States might now be under control , but a different strain of accounting scandal fever could be about to sweep through Britain .
The Financial Reporting Review Panel , until recently a sleepy guardian of UK published accounts , has belatedly come over all proactive .
Previously it would wait until receiving a complaint before investigating a particular set of company numbers ; now it plans to read annual reports as they are published .
Yesterday we learned that out of a trial batch of 20 accounts , the panel reckons eight look dodgy , three seriously so .
The body has the power to make companies listed in Britain restate their accounts , and it is now promising to look at hundreds of accounts in detail over the next 12 months .
Whether this newly turbo - charged panel will have the impact of the securities and exchange commission remains to be seen .
The US regulator became as tough as old boots once Enron had imploded , but not before .
A common criticism was the relationship that some of its staff - including former chairman Harvey Pitt - had with some of the scandal - hit companies .
Mr Pitt had worked as an attorney for corporate clients , which included Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm at the centre of so many of the corporate storms .
But his perceived conflicts of interest pale against possible conflicts at Britain 's panel , where the roll call reads like a list of the great and good of the accounting world .
( Go to http://www.frrp.org.uk/committee.html for the full list . )
The chairman , Richard Sykes QC , has campaigned for stronger oversight of company accounts for some time , but as a barrister he advised British companies on aspects of company law and accounting practices .
Ian Brindle , the deputy chairman , is a former chairman of Pricewaterhouse - Coopers , and a senior partner at the time of the collapse of BCCI , which was the Enron of the early 1990s - although he was never involved in auditing the corrupt bank 's accounts .
Other members of the panel include partners of all major accounting firms and finance directors of BAE Systems , Tesco and others .
Brindle defends the composition firmly and says that any potential conflicts would be aired .
And he has a point , asking where we might find expert accounting adjudicators if finance directors and former ac countancy partners were automatically disqualified .
Brindle also insists that "" there is no [ accounting scandal ] crisis waiting to hit the UK "" .
Which is reassuring , but begs the obvious question : how does he know if it is only now that his panel is promising to do its job properly ?
One other point .
In the US , when the SEC tells a company that its accounts are under investigation , the company has to treat this as potentially price- sensitive information and is therefore bound to make a public announcement on the matter .
There is no such necessity over here , which - as yesterday - allows market manipulators and other financial bandits to rush around trying to guess which companies the panel has developed an interest in .
Full disclosure over here , SEC - style , is a real necessity - if only to spare the panel 's blushes when the inevitable leaks begin to appear .

So it will soon be time to bid a fond farewell to Lord Marshall , the colossus bestriding British Airways for the last two decades .
It has been a long , long tenure for one of the industrial world 's great survivors .
Marshall joined BA the month that Shergar was kidnapped , while the country 's feckless youth were going crazy over Spandau Ballet and Roland Rat .
Ryanair was two years away from beginning passenger flights and a teenage Stelios Haji - Ioannou was studying for the Greek equivalent of O - levels .
On a purely financial basis , Marshall 's record is unimpressive .
Shareholders would have been better off putting their money in the bank than investing it over 20 years in BA shares .
But in comparison with rival carriers , his reputation is more robust .
He deserves credit for the fact that BA emerged from the trauma of September 11 as one of the strongest of the world 's full - service airlines .
Unlike its American rivals , it had little state aid .
And although it has lost the top spot in Europe to Lufthansa , BA is likely to be a consolidator in the mergers and takeovers to come .
Marshall 's successor , Martin Broughton , received a hostile reception in certain circles yesterday .
The fact that he used to run a tobacco company need not , in principle , be a problem .
Aspects of BAT 's approach to business , however , are open to question .
BAT is alleged to have condoned and even encouraged smuggling of its products to avoid excise duty .
The company 's presence in Burma suggests a somewhat liberal attitude to ethics , although it has now promised to leave the country .
If criticisms of BAT are borne out in a report on the smuggling allegations by the Department for Trade and Industry , Broughton will be badly damaged goods .
It may be worth keeping the phone number of those headhunters ."
2003-11-17,"Enron , Tyco and WorldCom scandals have heightened public concerns about organised corporate tax avoidance through the use of tax havens , clever financial engineering , transfer pricing and other tricks .
Studies show that many major multinationals , including Accenture , Bank of America , Boeing , 3 M , Chevron , Exxon , Haliburton , Hewlett - Packard , Intel , Morgan Stanley and Nike are legally avoiding taxes by using schemes marketed by banks , lawyers and accountancy firms .
They are costing the US taxpayer more than $ 170bn a year .
Currently , the Senate finance committee is investigating some aspects of this anti - social trade .
In contrast , the UK government and parliament have shown little interest in examining organised tax avoidance .
Successive governments have been afraid to raise corporate taxes and other contributions , for the fear of upsetting corporations and their executives .
UK employers pay less in social security costs ( eg National Insurance contributions ) than their counterparts in Belgium , France , Germany , Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , or Sweden .
The 30 % UK corporation tax rate ( lower rates apply to small companies ) is lower than that in Austria , Belgium , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Portugal , Spain or the US , and is lower than the average of OECD countries .
Tax burdens have increased on individuals .
The overall income tax collection has increased from the 1989 - 90 figure of £ 48.8bn to £ 109.5bn in 2002 - 03 .
For the same period , despite massive growth in corporate profits , the collection of corporate taxes has increased from £ 21.5bn to only £ 29.3bn , barely amounting to 2.8 % of the GDP .
Not a lot of evidence , then , to support corporate giving to finance education , healthcare , environmental projects , corporate subsidies , inducements , rents / rates holidays , roads , export credits , embassies , trade missions , consuls , courts and many other things that the corporate world expects and gets .
What kind of corporate taxes should major British companies be paying ?
Companies rarely come clean about that .
Inquirers are directed to a plethora of corporate mission and vision statements and ' soft ' corporate responsibility statements which rarely provide any hard information about corporate taxation policies .
A starting point would be the annual accounts published by companies and distributed to shareholders .
These accounts contain the profit and loss account , which shows the pre - tax profits .
The amount of corporation tax paid is shown in the cash flow statements published by companies .
As Britain has one of the largest double taxation treaties with other countries , the taxes paid by companies in other countries are taken into account in calculating the 30 % corporation tax payable .
However , companies rarely make things simple for anyone interested in making sense of accounts .
In practice , companies submit another set of accounts containing different figures to the taxman .
For example , whilst companies are free to choose any rate of depreciation for their assets , for tax purposes the government specifies the rate .
Thus the accounting depreciation for plant and equipment is replaced by legally allowed depreciation or what are called capital allowances .
One hopes that over a period of time , say three to four years , the two figures are virtually the same .
As companies do not publish their tax computations , one is forced to use the information in annual audited accounts to make an assessment of the corporate taxes paid .
We have used the pre - tax profits / losses published by companies for the last four years , wherever possible , together with the amounts that they report having paid in corporation tax paid to estimate their social contribution through corporate taxation .
The information in the table is taken from the accounts that companies provide to shareholders .
These are signed by directors , authenticated by auditors as "" true and fair "" , filed at Companies House and form the basis of dividend payments , executive salaries , bonuses and share options .
The table takes a cross - section of major quoted companies and shows considerable difference between the corporation tax that the companies might be expected to have paid and the amounts actually paid .
A shortfall of £ 5,061 m is noted from a random sample of just 16 of the nearly 2,200 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange .
The financial statements of some unquoted companies may also raise some eyebrows .
In 2002 , the railways companies collected £ 1.32bn in public subsidies , making a total of £ 10.7bn in the first seven years of privatisation .
This is supplemented by some £ 10bn of public investment in track and signalling equipment .
Since privatisation , Virgin Trains has received £ 1.57bn in public subsidies but it is ultimately owned by secretive offshore trusts from the British Virgin Islands , which do not publish any financial information about their affairs .
The 2001 and 2002 accounts of Virgin Rail Group Holdings limited show that the company had "" franchise receipts "" ( or contributions from the taxpayer ) of £ 444 m .
The company received an additional £ 160 m in compensation because of the recent track access problems .
For the years 2001 and 2002 , the company declared pre - tax profits of £ 40 m , but paid corporation tax of under £ 6 m , an effective rate of just 15 % .
As part of an implicit social contract , companies should contribute to renew , expand and maintain social infrastructure , but the figures highlighted here should provide some food for thought about corporate mantras of social responsibility .
Organised corporate tax avoidance may improve company profits and executive salaries , but it also forces people on the minimum wage , nurses , pensioners and debt - ridden graduates to pay a higher proportion of their income in tax .
To facilitate better assessment of their social contribution through taxes , companies could improve the quality of their disclosures .
For example , they should publish a table showing profits made and taxes paid in each country .
Are the profits booked in the countries where they are made ?
Such information is readily available within companies .
The returns filed at Companies House show that many have subsidiaries in offshore havens , which are possibly used to reduce their tax bills .
However , no company provides any justification for skeletal locations in offshore tax havens , details of any tax avoidance schemes , or tax shelters used to reduce tax bills .
No company provides any information about "" transfer pricing "" policies that might have enabled them to shuffle profits across the globe .
None of these matters are on the accounting standard setters ' agenda , since they are funded and dominated by corporate interests .
A large number of tax avoidance schemes are marketed by major accountancy firms who also then audit the accounts of their client companies .
Audit reports issued by the same firms remain silent on their role in devising tax avoidance schemes .
Yet the UK government rewards them by giving them lucrative Private Finance Initiative ( PFI ) and other public contracts .
It is time that the Treasury Select Committee shook the government 's complacency and investigated corporate social responsibility and organised tax avoidance . · Prem Sikka is professor of accountancy at Essex University"
2003-11-22,"Unauthorised payments to Lord Black and former directors of Hollinger International have caused the owner of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph , Chicago Sun Times and Jerusalem Post to overstate its earnings by $ 17 m ( £ 10 m ) .
In a delayed filing to American regulator the securities and exchange commission , Hollinger was also forced to admit its third - quarter report was "" deficient "" because it had not been reviewed by independent accountants or signed off by the chief executive and finance director .
Lord Black brought forward his resignation as chief executive by two days to avoid signing off the accounts ; Gordon Paris , the new chief executive , has had insufficient time to give his personal certification , as required under the new Sarbanes - Oxley rules introduced after the collapse of Enron .
The 50-page filing reveals an independent review of Hollinger 's affairs led by former SEC chairman Richard Breeden , which discovered the unauthorised payments , had cost $ 3.4 m in the period up to the end of September and would "" exceed "" $ 8 m in the current financial year .
The quarterly report , which was expected a week ago , admits that before November 17 public statements by Hollinger may have been "" incomplete or inaccurate "" because of the recently uncovered $ 32.15 m of payments to Lord Black and former directors .
While they have promised to repay the fees , the company warned there can be "" no assurance "" that it would retrieve the amounts .
The company explained that the discovery of the payments - largely the result of "" non - compete "" clauses - had led it to calculate that it had understated its tax provision by $ 17 m .
But warned that "" this estimate is subject to change based on further analysis "" .
The regulatory filing also disclosed that Hollinger made a $ 2.5 m investment in Trireme , a venture capital firm with links to Hollinger directors Lord Black , Henry Kissinger and Richard Perle .
The company reported a net loss in the third quarter of $ 7 m , down from $ 32 m in the same period a year ago .
Although Canadian - born Lord Black has resigned as chief executive of Hollinger , he is remaining as chairman in order to oversee a "" strategic process "" on which investment bankers Lazards are advising the company .
The bankers are known to have received offers from rival publishing companies for the Telegraph titles and other Hollinger newspapers .
Lord Black , who has issued strongly worded defences of his position , is now reported to have hired high profile lawyer David Boies to advise him .
Mr Boies , who has represented US presidential candidate Al Gore in the Florida election case and former Enron finance director Andrew Fastow , is reported to have advised Lord Black to tone down his public comments .
In the regulatory filing , Hollinger promised to cooperate with an SEC investigation into the unauthorised payments .
The SEC has asked for documents from Hollinger , its audit committee and KPMG , which was unable to sign off the accounts because of the continuing investigation by the special committee led by Mr Breeden .
The filing also confirmed that the structure of the company was altering so that a management relationship with a unit of Ravelston , which is controlled by Lord Black , would no longer have fees payable to it ."
2003-11-25,"Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , the former Enron bosses who have so far avoided any direct blame for the energy firm 's collapse , were in part implicated in a report published yesterday .
The report , the fourth and final part in a series of inquiries by a bankruptcy court - appointed examiner , could prove invaluable to federal prosecutors .
The US justice department was handed a copy of it three weeks ago .
The analysis by Atlanta lawyer Neal Batson also examines the role that three banks played in structuring certain deals with offshore entities - Royal Bank of Scotland , Credit Suisse First Boston and Toronto - Dominion Bank .
Next Tuesday will be the second anniversary of the bankruptcy , which was the first in a series of financial scandals that shook Wall Street .
Andrew Fastow , the former finance chief , is the only senior executive to be charged by prosecutors .
He has pleaded innocent .
Mr Batson concluded that Mr Lay and Mr Skilling both breached their fiduciary duty by failing to properly supervise the various "" special purpose entities "" used to hide Enron 's debts and inflate its profits .
Both have maintained their innocence .
The report said that Mr Lay and Mr Skilling "" failed to respond appropriately to the existence of ' red flags ' indicating that certain senior officers were misusing [ special entity ] transactions to disseminate materially misleading financial information "" .
It added : "" There is evidence that they were in possession of facts necessary to conclude that [ some of ] these transactions lacked any rational business purpose ... "" From this evidence , an inference can be drawn that they acted in bad faith by approving the transactions and , therefore , breached their fiduciary duties of good faith . ""
Mr Batson said that Mr Skilling and Mr Lay - who both filled the chief executive post - might also have to repay certain loans ."
2003-12-05,"Company directors face criminal charges if they hide information from auditors under new legislation introduced by the government yesterday to prevent an Enron - style scandal in Britain .
Acknowledging that ambitious plans to update company law would not be ready for this session of parliament , the government instead published a separate companies bill to give auditors new powers to investigate companies .
DTI minister Jacqui Smith said : "" There is no denying that financial markets around the world have been badly shaken by the corporate failures of the last few years . ""
This bill completes a comprehensive package of measures aimed at restoring investor confidence in corporate governance , company accounting and auditing practices . ""
Ms Smith would only say that wider , comprehensive changes to company law - which have been more than five years in the making - would be introduced in "" due course "" .
Under the terms of the separate companies ( audit , investigations and community enterprise ) bill , company directors will have to state that they have not withheld information from auditors .
Companies will also have to publish details of non - audit services provided by their auditors and professional accountancy bodies will be given additional powers .
The bill also gives DTI investigators new powers to discover information about companies and gives immunity from breach of confidence claims to whistleblowers .
Investigators will also have powers to demand entry to premises without a warrant , although the government emphasised this was not the equivalent of a "" search and seize power "" , which would still require a court order .
The bill is also being used to set up a new kind of business - to be known as community interest companies - which are meant to use profits for the benefit of local communities .
The CICs will not have the tax breaks afforded to charities , and will have to prove that they operate with a social aim ."
2003-12-07,"By the end of America 's annual Thanksgiving turkey - fest last month , Boeing , the US aerospace giant , must have been hoping it had drawn a line under two scandals that had dragged its name through the post - Enron mud and led to the resignation of one of its brightest stars .
In the summer it had been fingered for allegedly stealing 25,000 pages of documents from rival Lockheed Martin to help it win military satellite launch contracts .
Meanwhile , its conduct in winning a deal initially worth $ 22 billion to lease 100 767 aircraft to the US Air Force as mid - air refuelling tankers was under scrutiny .
When it became clear to the Boeing board that its high - flying finance director Mike Sears may have been guilty of ' unethical conduct ' by talking to Darleen Druyun , a Pentagon official involved in the decision on the tanker contract , about a job at Boeing they fired him .
He denies any improper conduct .
With the Thanksgiving bloodletting over , however , Advent was heralded with the resignation of Boeing 's chief executive since 1996 , Phil Condit .
Then , last Tuesday , deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz said he was putting the tanker deal on hold pending an inquiry into the Druyun affair .
The tanker contract has assumed gargantuan importance to the company - and to the Pentagon .
It has been criticised by powerful congressmen including Senator John McCain , who argued that the original contract was too expensive .
It has been whittled down to $ 18bn by requiring that 80 of the 100 planes are bought by the US Air Force rather than leased .
It was important to Boeing for the very reasons that McCain was criticising it : it was a ' corporate bailout ' .
Condit 's resignation and the investigation turn what appears to have been a murky scandal involving defence contracts ( it is not the first ) into something with more widespread implications , including for UK defence businesses such as BAE Systems and procurement officials who , given the few global prime contractors , regularly consider Boeing bids on major contracts .
The latest , ironically , is a £ 13bn , 27-year deal to provide mid - air tanker services , the winner of which is due to be announced in the middle of this month .
As one procurement expert says : ' With the CEO going , the questions are not simply ethical but to do with performance .
That raises major issues over whether Boeing 's strategy is correct , but it also raises questions over the execution of specific contracts . '
The UK deal may not involve as many planes as the US one , but the importance of Boeing to the US , and of extending the life of its 767 via government - sponsored contracts - McCain 's ' bailout ' strategy - is sufficient for President Bush to have mentioned it to Tony Blair when he visited .
Likewise , it is thought , President Chirac did the same for its rival bidder , Airbus .
But there are bigger problems than the tanker deal .
Seen from this side of the Atlantic , Boeing 's relations with the Department of Defence matter to UK companies like BAE and smaller specialists such as Cobham Smiths and Meggitt , because Boeing , with Lockheed Martin , is the major conduit to Pentagon dollars .
The contrast with Europe could not be starker .
Indeed , the most confident prediction made about the UK tanker contract was that the MoD would allow the problems to delay the announcement until the new year , after the publication of a defence review that is expected to cut procurement budgets .
Boeing 's estrangement from the Pentagon could put transatlantic relationships under strain .
One Whitehall insider says : ' For our companies , they will want to know what the long - term implications are for the relationships with the Department of Defence . '
BAE , which has considered a merger with Boeing , is concerned . '
It is clearly not helpful , ' said one source . '
The vital thing is to sort out the relationship with DoD very quickly . '
But if confidence about the conduct of contracts and the use of information is damaged - as arguably it may have been - there could be wider effects on the way transatlantic defence co - operation develops in future .
In a speech last month , BAE 's chief operating officer , Steve Mogford , argued that it was essential that European companies worked with US giants to ensure that the technology gap between the US and its Nato allies did not grow any wider and that the European industry was not left behind .
He said that a freer transfer of technology was essential for the transatlantic collaboration that BAE views as so crucial to its future .
The alternative was a return to a ' fortress Europe ' mentality .
However , the Pentagon 's sensitivities over transferring information mean collaborative programmes are often hampered .
Only in recent weeks did it agree to transfer software codes to BAE , a sub - contractor on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme being run by Lockheed .
Some experts believe both on security and commercial grounds that the events at Boeing can do nothing but increase these sensitivities .
But it is its relations with the Department of Defence that has driven Boeing into the current crisis .
Defence , along with space , has become central to Boeing since its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas .
But Condit 's plan to move away from commercial plane - making , which is subject to cyclical demand and shocks such as the 11 September attacks , has faced serious difficulties .
First , it has seen its dominance of commercial aerospace - already under threat in 1996 from an emerging Airbus - rapidly eliminated .
This year , for the first time , Airbus is due to overtake Boeing , with deliveries to airlines from the European market expected at 300 , and from Boeing at 280 .
More concerning is the fact that Air bus 's order book represents $ 28.2bn , compared with Boeing 's $ 11.1bn .
To cap this , Airbus has a clear new product strategy based around its A380 superjumbo , due for launch in 2005 .
Boeing has had three false starts at its next major plane .
And doubts still remain .
Condit 's replacement , Harry Stonecipher , was forced to underline his commitment to the current proposal , the medium - sized , ultra - economical 7E7 .
UK analyst Sandy Morris says : ' The Condit strategy was wrong .
They should have kept their lead .
If you stop concentrating on the thing you are best at , it is always likely you are going to get passed , and that seems to be what has happened .
While the commercial backslide has caused acute problems , the space business has been a disaster .
After investing $ 6bn in satellite technology , Condit was forced to admit that Boeing had overestimated the requirement for the technology thanks to the telecoms slump and had to write off $ 1.1bn .
Most devastating , however , was the loss of the F-35 JSF contract to Lockheed .
Boeing 's defence business currently makes good money , and has healthy margins .
But as one expert who worked on the JSF bidding from the UK side says : ' The loss of JSF was a seminal moment in Boeing 's history .
It was catastrophic for the company and the defence strategy .
But the US Air Force was also very aware of what it had done .
I know that they were concerned about whether Boeing 's contribution to US defence was going to be undermined . '
In these circumstances it became vital for Boeing to win any satellite business available and to secure the tanker contract on as favourable terms as possible , terms that McCain and others saw as unacceptable .
With such high pressure on these deals , and on Condit 's strategy , it is perhaps not co - incidental that this is where the ' ethical ' problems arose .
Stonecipher , who came to Boeing from McDonnell Douglas and has gained a fearsome reputation for concentrating on the bottom line , is highly regarded in the Pentagon .
He says his priorities are to ' restore our reputation with that huge customer called the US government ' and get the tanker deal back on track .
There are other deals that may also be put back on track .
Discussions about a full - blown merger between Boeing and BAE have been going on for more than a year and Stonecipher last week emphasised that BAE was Boeing 's favourite overseas partner .
Once Stonecipher has got his feet under the desk , Mike Turner , BAE 's chief executive , is likely to want a chat - maybe not about a merger , although that has not been ruled out - but about ensuring relations remain close .
A meeting is being arranged ."

Instead , they represent the slow working through of a number of factors , most obviously the changing preferences of students , the ageing of key staff , the failure to adapt to external pressures or the falling off of grant income .
Unlike companies , where rising costs , falling orders or unwise acquisitions manifest themselves over quite a short timescale , both university and departmental decline are often not identified until some external event brings them to light , such as a poor performance in the RAE , a failure to win a research grant competition or a sudden fall in student applicants .
There have been cases ( Cardiff and Lancaster for example ) where financial mismanagement alone has provoked crises ; in Lancaster 's case , the institution survived without much long - term damage .
Cardiff survived only because it was taken over by the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology in a merger that brought in new management .
There have been others where misgovernance ( Huddersfield , Portsmouth and Glasgow Caledonian ) or academic organisational failures ( Thames Valley ) have caught the headlines .
But there are also many institutions that have not faced failure in the technical sense but where academic decline has simply not been arrested .
There are universities not punching their academic weight ; there are others , ambitious to propel themselves into "" the top 10 "" , that are anxious to improve performance .
Finally , there are those at the top who stay there in part because they are able to identify and turn round or eliminate failing activities so as to maintain a consistently high - performing institution .
AJ "" Chainsaw "" Dunlap set out four major principles for success in turning round companies : get the right management ; pinch pennies ; improve the balance sheet by focusing the business ; and get a strategy for success .
They could , with a certain adjustment , represent some key headings for action in universities .
Indeed , when he describes what he was told about the Scott Paper Company , around the rescue of which his book is built - "" This is acute .
It 's an overly bureaucratic organisation , spending too much money on the wrong things .
It 's so slow - moving that it ca n't get out of its own way
"" - it is not difficult to think of parallels in the university world .
Dunlap 's Mean Business is an unappealing work , long on the macho style of its author and short on sophisticated business analysis , but it contains strategic insights about turning companies round that go beyond the "" chainsaw "" nickname , which the author clearly appreciated .
In some ways it shows how different business life can be from the university world , but in others it can offer cautionary messages to universities .
Describing a major conglomerate with a large top - heavy headquarters staff , it makes the point that "" everything ran smoothly because nothing was happening "" .
This is not a bad description of some universities .
One might balk at firing the whole management team , which seems to have been the approach that won Dunlap his soubriquet , but changing the management in significant ways in a university , and doing it quickly , is likely to be much more effective than simply supplementing individuals already in place with yet more staff and hoping the situation will improve .
But in situations where huge communication gaps exist between central authority in the vice - chancellor 's office and the academic community , the removal of the vice - chancellor from the scene without other compensatory changes produces only vacuum and drift because no new leadership cohort or structure can be found to fill the gap .
Even when institutional decline or failure is primarily academic in nature , lax expenditure habits are likely to be associated because a loss of academic rigour usually replicates itself in administration .
The introduction of "" pinch penny "" cost reduction schemes should reintroduce corporate disciplines .
If we adapt Dunlap 's phrase "" improve the balance sheet by focusing the business "" to "" reviewing academic strengths and weaknesses and deciding whether to reinforce strengths and rescue weaknesses or eliminate them
"" we can begin to identify the analogies .
A research - intensive university facing a decline in research ratings will suffer a disproportionate financial impact because any decline in research reputation will be given publicity in the published league tables and may be reflected in falls in student recruitment .
Successful universities may be able to maintain recruitment to subject areas where there are national shortfalls in student numbers , for example engineering , because their overall reputation makes them attractive .
But universities perceived as being in decline will be under a double pressure in these subject areas .
Evidence of this can be found in the closure of some physics and chemistry departments where the costs of reinvigorating research has been rendered much greater in the short term by shortfalls in student - related income .
Thus the solution for a research - intensive university facing a dip in performance must be more radical if it is to be effective .
Turning round performance in a research - intensive university can not be achieved quickly : a period of two RAE cycles may be necessary .
The two critical issues must be a review of every academic department , not just those that have most obviously declined , together with an assessment of the investment funding necessary to put matters right .
The review must look at the research performance and potential of every member of staff and at the recruitment position , both undergraduate and graduate , of every department .
Turning round non - research - intensive universities is less complicated because the key dimension of non - performance is likely to be student recruitment ( although , like Thames Valley University , it might be the report of an external agency like the QAA ) .
But the turn - round of a non - research - intensive university must also address research issues and must establish some nodes of successful research , not only to raise morale and establish a more positive external image but to ensure that the university remains able to attract staff .
In either case , the institution will do well to consider how its estates and buildings reflect its reputation .
Institutions in decline instinctively cut their maintenance budgets to make savings that can be used to prop up weak departments .
They would be better advised to close the weak departments and use the money saved to refurbish the campus , thus raising student and staff morale and providing a better image for recruitment . ·

Freedom for high flyers Universities - particularly Oxford and Cambridge - still have some way to go to modernise themselves , according to the Lambert review of business - university collaboration commissioned by Gordon Brown .
Richard Lambert , former editor of the Financial Times , recommends a code of governance , but wants to free them from an "" uncoordinated and often unnecessarily burdensome "" system of accountability and regulation .
Institutions that are well managed , financially sound and performing well on teaching , research and working with industry should be allowed greater financial freedom and "" significantly lighter - touch "" regulation , he says .
But with greater entrepreneurial freedom , if not quite "" Chainsaw Al "" Dunlap ( see Michael Shattock , above ) , then at least the threat of serious consequences for a university that gets it wrong .
"" Relatively few universities have run into serious financial problems in recent decades ; it is possible that more will do so in today 's more complex and demanding environment , "" Lambert notes , adding that of 131 institutions in England , 47 ran deficits in 2002 with the remaining 84 averaging only a 2.2 % surplus on revenue .
UK universities are operating on the margin . ""
Universities that require central government support due to financial failure should expect consequences _ a restructuring of their management teams and probably their governing body as well as possible consolidation within the sector . ""
Oxford and Cambridge also had to speed up decision - making and not allow their colleges to block moves to keep them among the world 's leaders .

2003-12-10,"The "" imperial chief executive "" who treats the assets of a listed company as if they were his own is as active as ever despite attempts to clean up the corporate world , according to Sherron Watkins , who blew the whistle on her own bosses ' excesses at Enron .
Too many accounting rules can still be manipulated and analysts ' reports remain "" broadly inadequate "" for giving the real picture to investors , she argued yesterday .
Legislation such as the Sarbanes - Oxley rules in the US have improved corporate governance but behaviour "" has not got much better "" , the former Enron vice - president said after addressing a London meeting of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners .
It is up to institutional investors , who ultimately control most large corporations , to be more active in reining in rogue executives , she said .
"" I do think that the imperial chief executive officer is not dead in America .
You have a lot of CEOs acting more like dictators from resource - rich African countries treating their companies ' assets as their own . ""
The corporate excess at companies such as Tyco seemed to show a culture where senior executives could not get enough personal reward from their companies , added Ms Watkins , who was made Time magazine 's person of the year in 2002 for highlighting wrongdoing at Enron .
She joined Enron in 1993 , initially working for Andrew Fastow , who managed Enron 's $ 1bn - plus portfolio of energy investments .
In August 2001 she alerted the then chief executive , Kenneth Lay , to accounting irregularities and resigned in November 2002 .
Last night she described standing up against corporate excess as a "" lonely road to take "" and said she disliked the term whistleblower because it had a pejorative ring to it .
Other "" corporate sentinels "" were treated like pariahs - driven to divorce and alcoholism - and things would not change as long as bosses labelled as troublemakers those who warned of wrongdoing inside businesses .
Ms Watkins said it was symptomatic of the continuing rogue culture that a law firm recently organised a half - day seminar on whistleblowing under the title
The Corporation Under Siege .
She said she did not expect to get a job in mainstream corporate life for the time being , given her history , and her earnings on the conference circuit could not last indefinitely ."
2003-12-19,"Italian food group Parmalat today faced financial collapse as it revealed that € 4bn had gone missing from its books .
In a drama that drew comparisons with the meltdown at the US energy company
Enron , Parmalat admitted that the Bank of America had denied the authenticity of a document saying that the dairy group 's subsidiary , Bonlat Financing , held € 3.95bn in an account at the US bank .
The missing money would dwarf the € 1accounting scandal that rocked Dutch retailer Ahold earlier this year .
"" It is difficult to see how Parmalat can keep going after this clear indication of extensive financial irregularity , "" ABN Amro said in a note to clients .
Parmalat was holding an emergency board meeting this afternoon amid speculation that Enrico Bondi , named chairman and chief executive only this week , would resign .
Mr Bondi , a recovery specialist , was brought in after the resignation of the company 's founder , Calisto Tanzi .
Parmalat only managed to repay a € 150 m bond last week with help from creditor banks and the Italian government .
It must make more than € 100 m in bond payments in January and February , as well as meet an € 200 m payment to a Brazilian subsidiary next week .
Parmalat 's total debt as of September 30 stood at around € 6bn .
Parmalat 's shares and bonds have tumbled since the company 's admission earlier this month that it was in financial difficulties .
Trading in Parmalat was suspended after its shares fell more than the exchange 's allowed 10 per cent limit the day before .
In the latest dramatic twist to the crisis , Bank of America told Bonlat 's auditor , Grant Thornton , said that Bonlat , based in the Cayman Islands , did not have an account with the bank . ""
Further , Bank of America denied the authenticity of a document dated March 6 , 2003 , that certified the existence of securities and liquidity amounting to approximately € 3.95bn as of December 31 , 2002 , relating to Bonlat , "" Parmalat said a statement .
Bonlat and Epicurum , an investment fund , also based in the Cayman Islands , have been the focus of an emergency investigation into Parmalat 's accounts by PriceWaterhouseCoopers , hired this week .
Parmalat 's disclosure in November that it had invested nearly € 500 m in the little - known Epicurum fund started the slide in its share and bond prices .
When the group said it had not been able to recover the cash this month , Parmalat 's fall on the markets turned into rout .
The Parma - based group , with annual sales of around € 7.5bn , produces and sells milk , yoghurt , juice and other food products in Europe , the US and around the world .
The company , which started from a milk pasteurisation plant near Parma in 1961 , grew into a dairy empire producing long - life milk and now employs nearly 35,000 people in 30 countries ."
2003-12-22,"The former British ambassador to the United States Sir Christopher Meyer put enormous pressure on reluctant ministers to give red - carpet treatment to the head of the US energy giant Enron , according to documents obtained by the Guardian .
They reveal a wrangle in which he and other Foreign Office diplomats were pitched against Whitehall mandarins over whether Enron was being given privileged access to the government .
Sir Christopher was so worried that Kenneth Lay , its then chief executive , was being snubbed that he intervened to try to persuade a cabinet minister to change her mind and see him .
He was even prepared to raise the issue with Tony Blair because he believed that Mr Lay was "" important to the UK 's interests "" .
Margaret Beckett , the then trade secretary and now environment secretary , had refused to meet Mr Lay while she was carrying out a sensitive review of energy policy .
Diplomats were furious that she would not "" hear at first hand the views of someone of Mr Lay 's calibre and importance "" .
The British consulate general in Texas - the location of Enron 's headquarters - wrote : "" Ken Lay would be on anyone 's list of the most highly respected and influential businessmen in the US . ""
Two days later , in February 1998 , the British embassy in Washington faxed the Department of Trade and Industry to plead again for Mr Lay .
"" From the perspective of this embassy , we see great value in Ken Lay being received at ministerial level .
To offer less than this would send the wrong signal to the US about our keenness on attracting inward investment from here .
"" Enron claimed to have invested £ 1.8bn in Britain .
A concerned senior DTI official looked for a "" middle way "" solution that Enron would swallow .
Enron was keen to win government permission , known formally as section 36 consents , to build new gas power stations . ""
Clearly Enron is a very big player , equally clearly they will desperately want to talk about S36 consents which , as I understand it , leaves us open to all sorts of legal problems about who else we would also have to meet .
"" I would not want to upset Enron given the scale of their investment in the UK , equally I do not want to open a can of worms on S36 , "" wrote the official in documents released under the open government code after a year 's delay .
A junior minister , John Battle , who was responsible for energy policy , was eventually put up to meet Mr Lay in April 1998 on the understanding that the energy review was not discussed in detail .
A handwritten note says : "" Mr B is not keen to see Enron . ""
Mr Battle told the Guardian he listened to Enron 's case in silence and did not respond to it .
Two years ago , Enron , at one time America 's seventh - biggest corporation , collapsed in what was then the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history , amid allegations of fraud and negligence .
Enron 's political ties with the British and US governments have provoked controversy .
Enron donated £ 36,000 to Labour , as well as huge amounts to the Republicans and Democrats in the US .
Mr Lay is a friend of George Bush , who refers to him as "" Kenny boy "" .
Enron is the subject of a criminal investigation and the target of many civil lawsuits .
Sir Christopher , now head of the Press Complaints Commission , said it was "" perfectly reasonable "" for Mr Lay to make his case to ministers as there was no whiff of scandal surrounding Enron at that time .
He added that part of his official duties was to encourage foreign companies to invest in Britain . ""
A decision to build a gas - fired power station would have led to job - creating investment by Enron . """
2004-01-01,"Anyone who thought that an Enron - style fraud was unlikely to happen in Europe has had a rude awakening with the erupting scandal at Parmalat , the Italian dairy company .
Yesterday there were seven more arrests , including two of the auditors at Grant Thornton .
The founder - chairman Calisto Tanzi had already been taken into custody .
The Italian authorities are taking it very seriously , knowing the devastating effect it could have on overseas investment , particularly from the US .
It looks as though at least € 7bn - and probably more - has gone walkabout from the company 's porous balance sheet .
At this stage the scam looks more like the Nick Leeson false fax school of misaccounting ( he of Barings fame ) than the sophisticated off - balance sheet evasion of Enron .
The long - running scandal was only unearthed a couple of weeks ago with the discovery of a letter purporting to come from the Bank of America illegally verifying a € 3.9bn account that did not in fact exist .
The Italian authorities are reported to have found that it was in fact forged by Parmalat executives removing a B of A logo from another letter and using it to produce a phony fax .
No wonder it has been described as one of the largest and most brazen corporate financial frauds in history .
What can be done ?
The authorities have acted quickly and are already planning to set up a body along the lines of the Securities and Exchange Commission in America which proactively seeks out dodgy deals in company accounts .
This ought to do some good in a country like Italy where there is not a strong sense of corporate compliance - but it will not work miracles .
The existence of the SEC in the US did not stop Enron from happening .
Clearly more must be done to encourage auditors to do their job properly .
They get very large sums of money just to say that the accounts give a true and fair report of the company 's activities - yet if they can not spot a forged document for € 3.9bn , what hope is there for smaller sums ?
It may be unfair to penalise auditors for the full amount of the fraudulent accounting they fail to spot , but equally plainly they need stiffer penalties in order to motivate them to delve deeper into company accounts .
Sadly , globalisation has outstripped the ability of regulators to keep up with its seamier side .
Until there are transnational bodies to do the policing , it will be difficult to stamp out all domestic miscreants .
But at least Italy has a strong self - interest at present - the desperate need to avoid losing more foreign investment - to put its house in order ."
2004-01-02,"It has already been dubbed Parmasplat , and Europe 's Enron .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has called it : "" One of the largest and most brazen corporate financial frauds in history . ""
The sheer scale of the scandal - what started as a € 4bn black hole in the food company 's accounts has a liability now said to be somewhere north of € 10bn - that has engulfed the Italian food maker and the pace at which it has unfolded has left Italy gasping for breath and Parmalat 's founder , Calisto Tanzi , under arrest .
But if Parmalat was to prove the main event , corporate Europe was not without the odd warm - up act in the Scandals of 2003 .
Skandia , one of Sweden 's top financial services groups , parted company with several of its senior management team amid allegations of excessive bonuses and company money being used to renovate private appartments .
Skandia was not the only European corporate to feel the cold breath of financial scan dal .
Step forward Dutch retailer Ahold which early in the year found a $ 880 m hole in the accounts of a US subsidiary .
Still it was not all bad news : 2003 has been a good year for the euro .
On the foreign exchanges it has hit record highs against the dollar .
The strength of the euro was more a feature of the dollar 's weakness but it was all the more surprising because , according to the European commission , it should not have happened at all .
After all , according to many of the euro - zone 's great and good , the euro 's credibility hinged on the stability and growth pact .
Break the pact and the currency , maybe even the whole concept of the union , would be undermined .
Yet Germany and France did break the rules - refusing to rein in their public sector deficits for fear of suffocating sickly economic growth .
And the disaster failed to happen .
Not that the euro quite had things all its own way .
Back in September Sweden showed that while the forex markets might love the euro a majority of its citizens did not .
A referendum on whether the country should sing up for the single currency came up with the answer "" no "" - a blow to Sweden 's political and economic establishment .
Pierre Bilger , the former boss of French engineering group Alstom , could reasonably claim a place among the year 's losers .
Mr Bilger lost his job , departing the group in March clutching a € 3.8 m pay - off .
But come August , and after some virulent criticism Mr Bilger announced he was returning the money , saying that he did not want to become an ob ject of scandal for Alstom 's workforce .
Sadly Mr Bilger 's decency does not look like setting a trend .
It took the US Securities and Exchange Commission to persaude former Vivendi boss Jean - Marie Messier that his claim for a $ 25 m pay - off was just not on .
It has been a better year for Jean - Rene Fourtou , the man brought in to replace Messier as the head of Vivendi Universal .
He has spent 2003 restructuring a balance sheet undermined by his expansionist predecessor and can reflect on progress made ."
2004-01-05,"Fausto Tonna , the abrasive former finance director of Parmalat , today heaped abuse on journalists covering the fraud scandal at the Italian dairy group .
Mr Tonna - who has a reputation for uncouth manners - told them : "" I wish you and your families a slow and painful death . ""
The comment came as Mr Tonna entered the public prosecutors ' office in Parma , where he was to be interrogated for his possible role in the scandal , which has been dubbed "" Europe 's Enron "" , a reference to the collapse of the US energy company .
Mr Tonna , who was jailed last week , made no further comments as police escorted him into the office past a handful of reporters , photographers and cameramen .
The outburst was his first public statement on the scandal .
Parmalat 's long - standing finance director and the right - hand man to founder Calisto Tanzi , Mr Tonna quit his post as chief financial officer last March .
He stepped down from Parmalat 's board in December , before a € 4bn black hole in the global food group 's books was revealed .
As investigators attempt to get to the bottom of Europe 's biggest fraud scandal , it emerged that Parmalat could have tried to hoodwink the Italian antitrust authorities on two occasions .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Italian and US investigators are seeking to determine whether the dairy group tried to circumvent Italian antitrust laws when it was ordered to sell two of its businesses .
In mid-2000 , Parmalat tried to gain control of Carnini , a family - owned dairy business based in the Lombardy region of Italy .
It initially sought a 70 % stake , but eventually amassed 15 % .
Despite this , Italian antitrust authorities ordered Parmalat to sell its stake .
Parmalat sold its shares in Carnini to Boston Holdings , which also held a 55 % stake in Carnini .
The second antitrust ruling required Parmalat to sell Newlat , a company it controlled , when it purchased Eurolat , another Italian dairy company , in 1999 .
Newlat also ended up in the hands of Boston Holdings .
However , the Wall Street Journal reported that , in interviews with investigators , Mr Tonna claimed Parmalat 's moves to comply with the two antitrust rulings were a sham because Boston Holdings had ties to Gian Paolo Zini , Parmalat 's outside attorney , as well as to a California businessman .
Despite the sale , Mr Tonna said : "" Today Parmalat could obtain the restitution of these two companies , "" according to a deposition cited by the Wall Street Journal .
Investigators now say that the sales were designed to allow Parmalat to retain indirect control of the two companies .
The paper reported Mr Tonna as saying that the plan was hatched by Mr Zini , who divides his time between New York and Milan .
A corporation called Boston Holdings was incorporated in 2001 in the US state of Delaware , and was registered in New York with a Park Avenue address shared by Mr Zini 's law firm ."
2004-01-08,"The former finance chief of the disgraced energy company Enron , Andrew Fastow , is set to change his plea from innocent to guilty in charges relating to the scandal that brought down Enron , as part of a plea bargain , according to reports .
The New York Times reports today that Mr Fastow has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges and has given evidence against another former Enron executive , who will also be charged this week .
Mr Fastow could face a ten - year sentence , according to the paper .
A potential agreement for Fastow to pay at least $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) to the securities and exchange commission and his plea bargain are contingent upon a separate plea deal being reached for his wife , Lea , former assistant treasurer at Enron , before she left in 1997 .
The district judge David Hittner , who is presiding over Lea Fastow 's case , yesterday threw out a plea deal that would have called for her to serve five months in prison and be released before her husband 's trial began .
The judge said the deal was too binding and he wanted more leeway on her sentence .
The Fastows , who have two young children , do not want to agree to any plea deal that would force them to serve their sentences at the same time .
Andrew Fastow 's plea deal , if finalised , would go before Judge Kenneth Hoyt .
In November , plea talks with Lea Fastow , which also would have called for a five - month sentence , broke down shortly before Judge Hittner denied her request to move her February 10 trial outside of Houston .
Mr Fastow would be the highest - ranking executive to plead guilty in the criminal investigation of Enron .
The company 's collapse into bankruptcy in late 2001 was the first in a series of scandals that rocked corporate America and shook investors ' confidence in the stock market .
Mr Fastow allegedly masterminded complicated accounting schemes that hid Enron 's inflated profits and allowed him to enrich his family and selected friends and colleagues .
Prosecutors claim Mr Fastow benefited to the tune of $ 30 m from side - deals .
The potential plea deal could raise the likelihood of prosecutors bringing charges against Enron 's former top executives , Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling .
Authorities also were preparing criminal charges against Enron 's former chief accountant , Richard Causey .
The Associated Press news agency quotes unnamed sources as saying Mr Causey could surrender today or tomorrow .
Mr Causey was responsible for reviewing all Enron transactions with a partnership called LJM , which was controlled by Mr Fastow .
Prosecutors claim LJM was used to conduct sham transactions to improve Enron 's financial health fraudulently and enrich Mr Fastow and others .
The 98-count indictment against Mr Fastow says Mr Causey and others had a secret side agreement with Mr Fastow that LJM would not lose money in its dealings with the energy giant .
If attorneys and judges agree on the proposed plea deal with Mr Fastow , the former executive could appear in court to change his innocent plea to guilty today , according to reports .
When Mr Fastow was indicted , in October 2002 , his lawyers said Mr Skilling and Mr Lay approved his work .
Mr Skilling and Mr Lay have not been charged and both maintain their innocence in the implosion that wiped out billions of investor and employee savings and resulted in thousands of layoffs and dozens of lawsuits .
The Houston Chronicle quotes anonymous sources as saying that federal prosecutors are offering Mr Fastow a 10-year sentence .
The former financial chief has been charged with fraud , money laundering , insider trading and other charges .
He is free on $ 5 m bail pending trial scheduled for April .
If convicted , the maximum penalties for the charges against Fastow include 20 years in prison for money laundering , ten years for securities fraud and five years each on the mail fraud and conspiracy charges .
Lea Fastow , 42 , is charged with six counts of conspiracy and filing false tax forms for allegedly participating in some of her husband 's deals .
Mr Causey , 43 , was dismissed in February 14 2002 , after a board of directors ' report noted his failure to properly monitor the LJM partnership that became a focal point of the fraud investigation ."
2004-01-08,"Former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow was last night negotiating a plea bargain that could send him to prison for his role in the accounting scandal that brought down the energy firm more than two years ago .
Prosecutors were also preparing to charge the company 's former top accountant , Richard Causey .
He is expected to surrender to authorities today .
A plea deal with Mr Fastow would be the biggest catch yet in attempts by US officials to apportion blame for the Enron scandal .
The company , once the seventh largest in America , was tilted into bankruptcy after it emerged that debts were being hidden and revenues inflated through a complex web of accounting fraud .
Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Fastow masterminded the scheme which enriched him and a number of colleagues and friends .
He is charged with 98 counts of fraud , money laundering , insider trading and other charges .
He is free on a $ 5 m ( £ 3.3 m ) bond , pending trial in April .
If lawyers and judges agree , Mr Fastow would change his plea from innocent to guilty , possibly today .
One report said the deal could send him to prison for 10 years .
Mr Fastow could also provide a valuable source for prosecutors bringing a case against Enron 's former top executives Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay .
Neither of the men , both former chief executives , have been charged and both have denied wrongdoing .
Mr Fastow would have intimate knowledge of what they knew .
His wife , Lea Fastow , a former assistant treasurer at Enron , goes on trial on February 10 , facing six counts of conspiracy and filing false tax forms .
She has pleaded not guilty but is also negotiating a deal .
Mr Causey was fired in February 2002 for failing to properly monitor LJM , one of the special purpose entities created by Mr Fastow allegedly used to perpetrate the fraud ."
2004-01-15,"The former finance chief of Enron , Andrew Fastow , yesterday pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for a 10-year prison sentence .
The plea deal was the most significant breakthrough yet for investigators struggling to unravel the complex accounting fraud that caused the collapse of the once mighty energy firm more than two years ago .
Prosecutors hope Mr Fastow 's agreement to provide information will help them close in on the two former chief executives , Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , who ran the company while the fraud was taking place .
Both men have maintained their innocence .
Assistant United States attorney - general , Christopher Ray , appeared to send a warning , commenting that the plea deal "" opens wide a window to the fraudulent practices of Enron senior management "" .
Leslie Cauldwell , the head of the Enron taskforce set up by the justice department added : "" The investigation is very active and this is a very significant development which I expect will yield results . ""
Mr Fastow was the mastermind behind the complex accounting fraud that eventually led to Enron 's demise and marked the beginning of one of the most tumultuous periods in American corporate history .
Enron , once listed as the seventh biggest company in the US , was found to have been routinely creating false revenues and hiding debts through a series of off - balance sheet entities .
Under the deal with the justice department , Mr Fastow will also forfeit $ 29 m ( £ 15 m ) in assets .
He would have faced a 98-count indictment at trial that could have landed him in prison for life .
He is free on $ 5 m bail until sentencing on April 19 .
In a statement , Mr Fastow said : "" I and other members of Enron senior management fraudulently manipulated Enron 's publicly reported financial results . ""
The purpose , he said , was to mislead investors and inflate the company 's share price and credit rating .
"" I also engaged in schemes to enrich myself and others at the expense of Enron 's shareholders , "" he added .
The two sides came close to agreeing a plea - bargain last week but those talks fell apart over the potential sentence for Mr Fastow 's wife , Lea , who worked at Enron as an assistant treasurer .
Mrs Fastow also pleaded guilty last night to filing false tax returns .
Her deal calls for a five - month prison sentence and one year of supervised release - including five months of house arrest ."
2004-01-16,"Adecco , the world 's largest employment agency , today announced the resignation of two top executives , as it revealed widespread accounting flaws in its North American business .
The Swiss company said Felix Weber , chief financial officer , and Julio Arrieta , the head of its North American arm , had quit .
Adecco has lost one - third of its market value since Monday , when it warned of possible accounting problems , sparking fears of a scandal akin to those at Enron , Ahold and Parmalat , where billion - dollar frauds have triggered criminal investigations .
Adecco said its chairman , John Bowmer , would lead efforts to resolve the problems in North America , including IT system security , payroll bank accounts and billing errors .
It said it has taken steps to identify further problems and is focusing on accounting , control and compliance in the US and in other countries .
The securities and exchange commission , the US financial watchdog , and the US attorney 's office for the southern district of New York have opened investigations into the matter , Adecco said , adding that it was cooperating with the investigations .
"" Some [ of the problems ] have already been corrected , and the balance is being actively addressed , "" Adecco said .
"" The board remains strongly confident about the company and its future . ""
Attention has focused on Adecco 's 2000 takeover of the US firm
Olsten , which makes up the bulk of its Adecco Staffing business in the US and also has smaller operations in Europe .
Despite the list of problems uncovered in its North American activities , Ronald Wildmann , a Bank Leu analyst , noted that the business was a small part of the group in terms of profitability .
"" That 's very important , "" he told Reuters .
"" They have to restate the figures but I do n't believe the restatement should be too much . ""
Other countries involved in its investigation accounted for less than 10 % of service revenue in 2002 , Adecco said .
In total , the company is investigating businesses that account for around one - third of its 2002 sales of some 25bn Swiss francs ( £ 11bn ) and that involve its lower margin traditional "" temp "" agency activity .
Adecco 's more profitable businesses include headhunting and the placing of professionals such as engineers with companies and institutions .
The company said on Monday it was unable to close its books for 2003 as planned because of "" material weaknesses in internal controls in the company 's North American operations of Adecco Staffing "" .
The company said its audit and finance committee has appointed an independent counsel to resolve the outstanding issues .
The committee is investigating "" accounting , control and compliance issues in the US and in certain other countries , as well as ... accusations made by ' whistleblowers ' in the US "" , the company said .
Adecco , based near Geneva , directly employs 28,000 people in 68 countries and claims to connect 650,000 jobseekers and temporary staff with businesses every day .
It reported a 2002 net profit of 362 m Swiss francs on revenue of 25bn francs ."
2004-01-23,"The former top accountant at Enron yesterday surrendered to authorities and was taken in handcuffs to a federal court in Houston , Texas , to face criminal charges stemming from the energy firm 's collapse .
Richard Causey was mentioned by title , although not by name , in the breakthrough plea deal struck last week by Andrew Fastow , the former chief financial officer at Enron .
Mr Fastow agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for a 10-year prison sentence and the forfeiture of almost $ 30 m ( £ 16.3 m ) , raising government hopes that he might help them to snare other senior executives .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after details began to emerge of a massive fraud that used off - balance sheet entities to hide losses and make the company appear profitable .
Mr Fastow , who has been described as the mastermind of the fraud , admitted that he and others in Enron 's senior management team had conspired to mislead investors .
Mr Causey , 44 , flanked by two lawyers , arrived at the Houston offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shortly before daybreak .
One of his attorneys , Mark Hulkower , told reporters : "" Rick Causey has done absolutely nothing wrong and we will vigorously contest any charges the government may bring . ""
He was indicted on five counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud .
He faces a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison and a fine of $ 5.25 m if convicted .
Mr Causey pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 1 m bail .
Like Mr Fastow , Mr Causey reported directly to the former chief executives at Enron , Kenneth Lay and his successor , Jeffrey Skilling .
Both Mr Lay and Mr Skilling have maintained their innocence .
In his plea deal , Mr Fastow alleged that he had a secret agreement with the former chief accounting officer to ensure that he would not lose any money in transactions between Enron and some of the so - called special purpose entities that he controlled .
At the time , Mr Causey was chief accounting officer .
Mr Causey was fired in February 2002 after an internal inquiry concluded that he had failed to protect adequately Enron 's interests in dealings with those off - balance sheet partnerships .
Mr Causey joined Enron in 1991 and became chief accounting officer in 1999 .
He had previously worked at the energy firm 's outside auditor , Arthur Andersen , which was forced out of business because of its relationship with Enron .
He is the 24th person to face charges stemming from Enron 's demise ."
2004-02-16,"Harrods was subjected to an "" extraordinary attack "" when the top store was apparently equated with the disgraced US company Enron , the high court heard today .
Harrods Ltd has brought libel proceedings against Dow Jones and Company Inc over an article which appeared in The Wall Street Journal on April 5 2002 .
It referred to a press release issued by Harrods the day before April Fools ' Day which said that the chairman would make an important announcement next day about a "" first come first served share option offer "" .
The information would be posted on Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed 's personal website , Alfayed.com , until 12 noon on April 1 .
Anyone interested was invited to contact LOOF LIRPA at Harrods .
The Journal article , headed "" The Enron of Britain ? "" , referred to the "" joke "" and said that if Harrods ever went public , "" investors would be wise to question its every disclosure "" .
James Price QC , for Harrods , told Mr Justice Eady and a jury in London that the question posed in the headline appeared to be a serious one , and caused a good deal of concern at the store .
He said that it was quite predictable that a business like Harrods , which devoted a great deal of time and money to ensuring that its corporate reputation was in good shape , would object to what mounted to an attack on its corporate trustworthiness and its compliance with securities laws and regulations .
"" We say that it is an extraordinary attack by the Wall Street Journal on Harrods in that article "" .
Mr Price said the newspaper argued that the reference which appeared in the US edition - but not the European edition - and the online edition was tongue in cheek and meant to be humorous .
It denied libel , saying that the publication in this country was "" virtually non - existent "" and did not injure Harrods ' reputation .
The hearing is expected to conclude tomorrow .

2004-02-17,"Department store Harrods yesterday began a high court action against Dow Jones and Company , publisher of the Wall Street Journal , accusing it of libel after it ran a story triggered by an April fool 's hoax .
The piece , titled The Enron of Britain ? , appeared in 2002 in one of the Wall Street Journal 's regular columns , four days after the paper was taken in by an April fool announcement from Harrods ' owner , Mohammed Al Fayed , that the store was to be floated on the stock exchange .
The article at the centre of the libel action appeared in US editions of the Journal on April 5 and in online editions .
While the story acknowledged the newspaper had fallen for the hoax , it posed the question of whether Harrods was Britain 's equivalent of collapsed US energy trader Enron .
The court was told the article said that , should Harrods ever go public , "" investors would be wise to question its every disclosure "" .
The April fool hoax , launched by Mr Al Fayed on the store 's website , had appeared with a giveaway : the contact name for anybody interested in shares was Loof Lirpa , or April fool spelt backwards .
James Price , Harrods ' lawyer , said the store was worried about the article being archived on the paper 's website .
The Wall Street Journal told the court the piece had been meant to be "" tongue in cheek "" .
The paper 's lawyer , Gavin Millar , said there had been no attempt to make "" a real comparison between Harrods and Enron "" .
The article did not appear in European editions of the Journal and there were only 10 subscribers to the US version of the paper in Britain , he said .

2004-02-17,"Italian police today arrested the son and a daughter of Calisto Tanzi , the disgraced founder of Parmalat , the dairy group at the heart of one of Europe 's biggest ever frauds .
The arrest of Stefano and Francesca Tanzi , along with six others , brought to 18 the total number of people in detention in connection with the scandal , dubbed Europe 's Enron .
Other Tanzi family members arrested today included Giovanni , Calisto 's brother .
The arrests came as investigators in Parma put the amount of cash diverted from Parmalat at about € 900 m ( £ 607 m ) , including € 400 m into travel and tourism assets . ""
New elements emerged in the last month and a half of the investigation , "" a source told Reuters .
The new figure well exceeds what Mr Tanzi told investigators early on , when he said about € 500 m in Parmalat funds were withdrawn from the publicly listed company and put into travel group Parmatour and other family assets . ""
The siphoning off of funds into the tourism firms was done through payments with false accounts from both [ Parmalat and the tourism companies ] , "" an investigative source said , adding that the books of Cayman Islands unit Bonlat were then used to hide the cash .
Francesca served on the board of Parmatour , the family 's main travel group , but has denied having had a real management role .
Mr Tanzi told magistrates over the weekend that his daughter 's role in Parmatour was "" marginal "" , but other executives have said she guided the firm .
Stefano sat on Parmalat 's board and had ties to Parmatour via its former holding company HIT .
He was also a former chairman of Parma football club , which was owned by Parmalat .
Both siblings , already under investigation in the two - month probe , have denied wrongdoing .
Magistrates in Milan and Parma have been trying to find out what Parmalat did with billions of euros raised through bond issues and how the company concealed debts by using offshore units and shell companies .
They are also investigating the role of foreign and Italian banks which sold Parmalat bonds in recent years .
In January , Parmalat announced that its debts last year were over $ euro;14bn , almost eight times more than the bankrupt company 's former executives had initially admitted .
The figures - a first estimate by the company 's administrators one month after Parmalat went bankrupt - were worse than any previous estimate .
Analysts warned that the final figure for debt in the administrator 's final report due by early March could be even higher .
Since the scandal broke , investigators have uncovered widespread fraud throughout the complex network of subsidiary companies , over several years .
The cover - up involved forged documents , records of sales that never took place , and "" phantom "" executives ( in one case an unwitting switchboard operator ) allegedly running offshore companies which belonged to the group .
Parmalat began unravelling with the discovery of a € 4bn "" black hole "" in December .
The company , burdened with € 14.5bn in debt , has since filed for bankruptcy .
Administrators hope to salvage the milk company , which employs 36,000 staff in 30 countries and is still doing healthy business , despite the fraud ."
2004-02-18,"Mohamed Al Fayed 's Harrods store was left with an estimated legal bill of £ 500,000 yesterday after losing a libel case against the Wall Street Journal .
Harrods brought the action against publishing group Dow Jones after its prestigious financial newspaper ran a story titled "" The Enron of Britain ? "" in 2002 , four days after falling for an April fools ' hoax by Mr Fayed .
A jury at the high court threw out the claim and ordered Harrods to pay £ 40,000 towards Dow Jones ' legal costs , which are expected to be about £ 200,000 , within 14 days .
"" I was not concerned with winning damages in this case ; I simply wanted the Wall Street Journal to accept its comparison was unwarranted and to apologise to me and to Harrods .
It seems that the Wall Street Journal does not have the simple good manners and grace to do this , "" said Mr Fayed in a statement .
Mr Fayed - right , at the launch of Harrods rock ' n ' roll restaurant
Mo 's
Diner last year - had posted an announcement on the Harrods website stating that the store would be floated , leaving the giveaway name of Loof Lirpa , April fool backwards , as the contact for inquiries .
The statement added that a Harrods store would be floated on a canal boat and not the London Stock Exchange .
The newspaper admitted it had been hoodwinked and asked in an article published in the United States whether the famous store was the UK equivalent of Enron , the energy company that went bankrupt in 2001 amid revelations of multibillion - dollar fraud .
The high court was told that the article warned investors to question "" every disclosure "" from Harrods if it floated .
Dow Jones said it was "" delighted "" to have won the case but added that the legal battle was a waste of time and effort .
"" It seems ridiculous that Harrods , which could not sue in the US , has taken the time of an English court on an article with the most tenuous connection imaginable to England and with absolutely no evidence of any actual loss . ""
The Wall Street Journal told the court on Monday that the piece was meant to be "" tongue in cheek "" , but James Price , representing Harrods , said the company was concerned about the article being archived on the newspaper 's website .
The newspaper pointed out , however , that there were only 10 subscribers to its US version in Britain and there had been been 12 hits on the website carrying the piece by September 2002 ."
2004-02-19,"Jeff Skilling , the former chief executive of Enron , has been charged with 42 counts of fraud , insider trading and giving false statements to auditors in a federal indictment released today .
The indictment also includes new charges against former Enron chief accounting officer , Rick Causey , who pleaded not guilty to six fraud counts last month .
The charges come after Mr Skilling , 50 , surrendered himself to the FBI at their headquarters in Houston , Texas , accompanied by his lawyers .
Citing personal reasons , Mr Skilling resigned from Enron in August 2001 , four months before the company filed for bankruptcy .
His abrupt departure from Enron marked the beginning of the end for the energy company that had won plaudits on Wall Street for its "" innovative "" financial practices .
Enron 's collapse , the first in a series of financial scandals that rocked Wall Street and corporate America , also embarrassed the White House because of the company 's close ties with the Bush administration .
Enron , based in Houston , was a big contributor to Mr Bush 's presidential election campaign .
Mr Skilling is the most senior Enron executive so far to face criminal charges .
He is the 28th individual to be charged in a two - year federal investigation , which passed its two - year mark last month .
In 2002 , Mr Skilling maintained during testimony before two congressional panels that he believed Enron was financially healthy when he stepped down .
Mr Skilling 's former boss , Enron founder and former chairman Kenneth Lay , has not been charged .
Mr Skilling handed himself in just a month after former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and agreed to help prosecutors .
He is now out on bail pending formal sentencing and faces a maximum of 10 years .
Mr Fastow , who was hired by Mr Skilling admitted that he and others manipulated Enron 's books so the company would appear successful while using various partnerships to enrich himself , his family and chosen colleagues .
When he was indicted on nearly 100 counts in October 2002 , Mr Fastow 's lawyers said he was hired to do off - the - books financing and that Enron 's top brass approved and praised his work .
A week after Mr Fastow 's plea , former Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey was indicted on six fraud counts , but he pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 1 m bail .
Mr Causey 's indictment mentioned that Mr Lay and Mr Skilling , identified by title rather than name , were among "" the principal managers of Enron 's finances "" and accused Mr Causey "" and others "" of lying about earnings .
Mr Skilling joined Enron in 1990 and quickly moved up the company .
He was promoted to chief executive officer in February 2001 , replacing Mr Lay , who stayed on as chairman .
He helped transform Enron from a staid pipeline company into a trader that combined the energy business with new technologies at the height of the internet boom .
At its zenith , Enron was the seventh largest company on the Fortune 500 list .
But in August 2001 , after just six months , Mr Skilling suddenly resigned , saying he wanted time to enjoy life ."
2004-02-20,"Former Enron chief executive Jeff Skilling was charged yesterday with fraud , insider trading and lying about Enron 's finances before its collapse .
He pleaded not guilty to all counts in Houston and his lawyers vowed to fight a case they said was nothing more than government persecution .
A defiant Mr Skilling shook his head "" no "" as US magistrate Frances Stacy read a 42-count indictment which also included new charges against a former Enron chief accountant , Rick Causey .
Mr Skilling is the highest - ranking former Enron executive charged in a scandal which rocked Wall Street and Washington and led to a wider investigation of corruption in corporate America .
Former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay has not been indicted but officials have said he is under investigation . ""
Jeff Skilling has nothing to hide .
He did not steal , he did not lie , he did not take anyone 's money , "" his lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , said .
"" I guess they need a scapegoat and Jeff Skilling is that scapegoat . ""
He said Mr Skilling had taken a lie - detector test and passed "" with flying colours "" .
The former chief executive faces up to 325 years in prison and $ 80 m ( £ 40 m ) in fines if convicted on all counts .
The securities and exchange commission also filed civil charges against Mr Skilling , accusing him of fraud and seeking restitution .
The lengthy indictment accused Mr Skilling and Mr Causey of manipulating Enron 's books to meet earnings expectations , then repeatedly lying to analysts and auditors .
Enron was the nation 's largest energy trader before it unravelled amid disclosures that off - the - books deals had been used to inflate profits and hide billions of dollars of debt .
It filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 .
The indictment alleges that before the company 's demise , Mr Skilling and Mr Causey engaged in insider trading which helped net them profits of $ 89 m and $ 5 m , respectively ."
2004-03-07,"The European Investment Bank is the world 's biggest international public lending institution .
But , in the post - Enron world , it still fails to observe basic rules of corporate governance and transparency , according to a controversial report by a member of the European Parliament .
The Luxembourg - based bank - of which Chancellor Gordon Brown is a governor - borrows and lends more money than the World Bank , and does so in the names of all European taxpayers .
But it remains tight - lipped about everything from directors ' conflicts of interest to the performance of some loans and investments , according to the report , drawn up by Spanish MEP Monica Ridruejo . '
Ten years down the road we could have a big problem , '
Ridruejo , a former banker and political independent , said . '
One member of the board said he thought the management should resign . ' '
The EIB ... fails to comply with good corporate governance rules , which it is required to observe in its capacity as a public bank and the largest supranational lending institution in the world , '
Ridruejo says in the first draft of a report that sparked angry debate in Brussels .
EU countries jointly own the EIB , but the public information it provides on key decision - makers and their potential conflicts of interest is sketchy and in some cases wrong .
Its board of directors includes people with directorships on at least 11 commercial banks or other companies but the EIB 's annual report and website only refer to two of them .
The bank publicly states that two of its directors , Italian Rainer Masera and Frenchman Pierre Richard , are also chairmen or chief executives of commer cial banks .
Both those banks , France 's Dexia and Italy 's Sanpaolo IMI , are also EIB intermediary banks , handling some of the € 4 billion ( £ 2.68bn ) lent in France and the € 5.9bn lent in Italy last year .
Sanpaolo IMI is also the majority shareholder in two other EIB intermediary banks , Slovenia 's Koper and Hungary 's Inter - Europa .
Major blocks of its shares are held by other EIB intermediaries such as Deutsche Bank and Spain 's Santander .
There is no apparent evidence of public references by EIB to Richard 's directorships at Air France , Le Monde , Credit du Nord , Generali France Holding and the US 's Financial Security Assurance .
Nor is there mention of the 29,000 Dexia shares he holds , or the 177,000 shares held by Masera and his wife in Sanpaolo IMI at the close of 2002 .
There is no reference to the directorship on the SES Global satellite company of Luxembourg 's Gaston Reinesch or of Italian Lorenzo Bini Smaghi 's directorship at Finmeccanica .
British director Barrie Ireton is listed as a director of the UK 's Department for International Development , although he no longer holds that post .
There is no mention that he is chairman of Zambia Copper Investments Limited and Konkola Copper Mines .
A bank spokesman suggested one reason these directorships did not appear could be that they were on the boards as ' public officials acting on behalf of their respective member states ' .
There is nothing wrong with holding other directorships but , under the bank 's code of conduct , directors must inform president Philippe Maystadt if they hold any other ' official or professional posi tion ' and use their own ' best judgment ' to decide if there is a conflict of interest that means they should abstain from a board decision .
An EIB spokesman said such abstentions had happened some 30 times over the past three years . '
We have to know they do not have a conflict of interest , ' said Ridruejo , who wants directors to sign public statements to that effect . '
If they are complying with the code of conduct , why is it so hard for them to make a statement saying that ? '
Directors may have privately declared conflicts of interest .
However , the EIB 's rules mean such conflicts are not open to public scrutiny .
The need for more information on conflicts of interests is part of the draft report delivered to the European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by Ridruejo .
She said strong lobbying from the bank and its friends had seen the report sidetracked .
There was now a danger of of it being stopped from making it to a full parliamentary debate .
Brussels insiders said the critical tone of the report , and the vigorous rebuttal of some points by the bank , had shocked committee members .
Ridruejo asks in her report for the parliament to ' condemn the fact that the EIB has drawn up various codes of conduct but fails to comply with good corporate governance rules ... '
She calls for a public ' annual statement of income , assets and conflicts of interest ' of directors and senior management , as well as proper information on salaries and bonuses .
Ridruejo condemned the bank for its opacity over capital risk operations and apparent losses on venture capital .
She called on it to ensure , and publicly show , that the intermediary banks through which it channels loans are not taking abusive commissions and margins .
The bank is also criticised for failing to specify in annual reports ' the nature and final destination of its global loans ' , which are given to intermediary banks who divide them up and pass them on to clients .
Ridruejo said that at a tense meeting last Thursday the European Parliament 's committee bosses accused her of trying to ' name and shame ' the bank and said they were determined to stop the report .
Minutes of the meeting show they did not like its ' radical character ' and wanted to post pone it indefinitely . '
What they have asked was for me to take the report back .
I am not going to , ' she said . '
If the parliament decides to postpone it for ever then we know what is going on . '
An EIB spokesman said the bank agreed it needed to show at least the same level of corporate governance and transparency as private sector banks . '
It is in many respects much more transparent , ' he said , adding that the EIB normally welcomed European Parliament reports . '
The recent draft report was unusual in the tone and form .
It also contains factual mistakes , ' he said .
The Observer has seen some of the bank 's rebuttal document .
It accepts it could publish more information but claims it is ' at the forefront ' of corporate governance but can not meet all the rules set out , for example , in the EU 's recent Winter report .
Among other reasons it offered for not presenting more detailed information on the recipients of loans was the fact that there were 30,000 of these a year while the bank has 1,000 staff .
Ridruejo pointed out that the number of loans was hardly big by the standards of commercial banks .
She also said that , as a public bank financed by all EU taxpayers , the EIB should set even higher standards than private sector banks ."
2004-03-17,"Brussels has proposed tough new rules for auditors to try to prevent further scandals such as those at Enron and Parmalat .
But some business organisations say the European commission is going too far .
The new directive says all firms listed on the stock market must have independent audit committees which will recommend an auditor for shareholder approval .
It also says auditors or audit partners must be rotated , but stops short of separating auditors from consultancy work , despite protests that the linkage compromises the independence of auditors .
"" Auditors are our major line of defence against crooks who want to cook the books , "" said Frits Bolkestein , the internal market commissioner .
"" Parmalat was a reminder of what happens when that defence fails .
Faith in financial reporting and in the markets is destroyed .
Unless it is swiftly restored , investment , jobs and growth will be lost .
"" The Confederation of British Industry said the new rules go too far , and that corporate governance should be "" driven by business , not regulators "" .
It said that the Higgs code of corporate governance in the UK would be undermined .
The introduction of compulsory audit committees would produce an "" inflexible legal framework "" .
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales welcomed some parts of the directive but opposed compulsory rotation .
The new rules mirror the United States ' response to the accounting scandals that rocked the country in 2002 .
The Sarbanes - Oxley act brought in tough standards in response to the scandals , which revealed black holes in many company accounts .
The European Union wants to make auditors responsible for the accounts , a different approach from the US , where company executives sign off the books .
The EC also wants self - regulation of auditors to end , and Britain is already taking this step .
The commission is in the course of putting the directive to the European parliament and members ."
2004-04-08,"The US government yesterday suffered a setback in its efforts to prosecute the Enron fraud when a plea deal with the wife of former finance chief collapsed .
Lea Fastow , former Enron assistant treasurer , withdrew her guilty plea after US district judge David Hittner refused to accept a sentence of five months in prison , saying he could not disagree with probation officers who recommended 10 to 16 months .
A trial will proceed on June 2 .
Ms Fastow , right , surrounded by friends as she arrived at the court in Houston yesterday , pleaded guilty in January to filing a false tax form .
The Fastows wanted the deal to ensure that one of them would be around to look after their children .
The unravelling of the deal could throw the plea deal with Andrew Fastow , allegedly the architect of the financial fraud at Enron , into doubt .
Mr Fastow had pleaded guilty to conspiracy and admitted orchestrating schemes to make Enron appear in good health .
He agreed to a 10-year sentence and said he would cooperate with investigations .
If his deal falls apart , it could harm efforts to pin blame on the former top two at Enron , Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay ."
2004-05-07,"The wife of former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow was yesterday jailed for a year after pleading guilty to helping her husband hide the ill - gotten gains from his various financial schemes .
The plea seems likely to keep the United States government 's efforts to pursue Enron 's top executives on track .
Lea Fastow had withdrawn her guilty plea in April after a US district judge refused to accept a plea bargain deal of five months in prison with another five in home confinement .
Yesterday 's agreed sentence , which avoids a trial , is expected to secure the further cooperation of her husband , who was instrumental in the recent indictments of former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Enron top accountant Richard Causey .
Enron collapsed over two years ago after the discovery of a widespread complex accounting fraud that made the firm appear profitable and at the same time enriched a few senior executives .
Enron 's demise marked the beginning of one of the most tumultuous periods in American corporate history .
Ms Fastow , also a former Enron worker , pleaded guilty to the misdemeanour of filing a false tax form .
She had originally been charged with six felony charges ; four charges of filing false tax forms and two counts of conspiracy .
Last week prosecutors wiped out those counts and filed the single misdemeanour charge as part of the new deal .
Mr Fastow , regarded as the architect of the fraud , entered a guilty plea in January more than a year after first being charged .
He will spend ten years in prison after admitting to "" fraudulently manipulating "" Enron 's financial results and is forfeiting up to $ 29 m in assets ."
2004-06-21,"Three British former NatWest bankers accused of conspiring with senior Enron fraudsters to embezzle almost $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) will today begin their battle against extradition to the United States .
Gary Mulgrew , David Bermingham and Giles Darby are charged with seven counts of wire fraud and are facing the prospect of a high profile trial a stone 's throw from the former Enron headquarters in Houston , Texas .
Their alleged co - conspirators - former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and his right - hand man at the collapsed energy firm , Michael Kopper - have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the alleged fraud and are cooperating with the US department of justice 's Enron taskforce .
The three bankers are the first British nationals to face extradition under controversial new legislation that does not require the US to provide evidence of crimes alleged ; it is the same legislation being used by the US to pursue the extradition of Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al - Masri .
The extradition proceedings will be vigorously contested by one of Britain 's top barristers specialising in fraud cases , Alun Jones QC .
Mr Jones has successfully seen off high profile prosecutions against Kevin Maxwell , boxing promoter Frank Warren and Wickes ' finance director Trefor Llewellyn .
Mr Jones is expected to call for the UK authorities to provide a detailed explanation as to the grounds for extraditing the bankers and for them to make clear whether the matter has been put before Home Office ministers .
The Crown Prosecution Service will be representing the US department of justice at the Bow Street magistrates court hearing .
Lawyers for the bankers said : "" These are three UK citizens who lived and worked in the UK for a UK financial institution , from which they are accused of stealing ...
No papers were ever served on them .
They found out about the charges from the TV news and the internet . ""
The bankers , who believe they will be cleared of all charges , want to be put on trial in Britain .
They claim that in November 2001 they voluntarily provided information about Enron to City regulators , who in turn passed it to the US authorities .
NatWest , now part of Royal Bank of Scotland , also provided US prosecutors with a number of emails sent by the bankers .
The Enron taskforce claims the bankers hatched a plot with the two Enron executives involving the vastly undervalued sale of NatWest 's investment in an elaborate offshore corporate structure , controlled by Fastow , which purported to provide Enron with a hedge against various liabilities .
US prosecutors claim $ 7.3 m was transferred through a number of offshore businesses before being split among the bankers while a further $ 12.3 m was shared between Fastow and Kopper ."
2004-06-22,"Lawyers for three British bankers accused of plotting with senior Enron fraudsters to embezzle almost $ 20 m , yesterday called for a magistrate to dismiss an extradition request from a Texas court , suggesting the alleged conspiracy was "" none of their business "" .
Former senior NatWest bankers Gary Mulgrew , David Bermingham and Giles Darby are alleged to have duped the bank out of about $ 7.3 m in what the Crown Prosecution Service , representing the US authorities , yesterday said was "" a story interwoven with the collapse of Enron "" .
The bankers ' two alleged co - conspirators - Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and his lieutenant at the energy firm Michael Kopper - have entered into broad plea - bargain agreements in the US and signed statements admitting their role in an alleged plot with the British bankers .
The bankers are alleged to have hatched a plot with Fastow and Kopper involving the hugely undervalued sale of NatWest 's interest in an elaborate offshore corporate structure , controlled by Fastow , which had been set up to provide Enron with a hedge against various liabilities .
In 2000 Fastow told his Enron colleagues he needed $ 20 m to unwind NatWest 's interest in the structure .
In fact , US authorities claim , $ 7.3 m was split equally among the British bankers , while Fastow and Kopper shared $ 12.3 m .
The US claim emails between the British bankers provide details of the plot .
One email said : "" The story looks compelling , and even Andy would have trouble arguing that the benefit split is anything other than equitable . ""
Another said : "" We should be able to appeal to his greed . ""
A reference to Fastow , the US suggests .
Alun Jones QC , counsel for the bankers , told Bow Street magistrates ' court of his concern about relations between the US and UK authorities under the terms of Britain 's new Extradition Act , which does not require the US to produce evidence of crimes alleged .
"" If the US authorities say ' jump ' and the UK authorities immediately leap into the air , we should be told at the outset of this case . ""
Mr Jones noted that the alleged victim of the fraud was a British bank ; the defendants were British ; and that "" 90 % of the alleged scheme took place in England "" .
He suggested that seven counts of wire fraud on the US indictment against the bankers were peripheral to the core allegations of UK - based fraud .
The charges should not , therefore , be regarded as meriting extradition , he said "" Any normal , sensible person would regard this as none of their [ the US authorities ' ] business ...
We want to know why is this case not being tried in the UK ? ""
Mr Jones said the new act raised particular concerns as it released the home secretary from a discretionary role in this kind of extradition decision .
"" If somebody has been extradited from this country there is no person who is accountable for it .
There is nobody now who has the responsibility for saying : ' This extradition is fair ' . ""
Mr Jones is preparing to make further objections to extradition , claiming the bankers would not face a fair trial in the US .
Lawyers say they would be under pressure to enter into plea - bargain agreements in the knowledge that more than 90 % of defendants who do not do so in Texas are later found guilty ."
2004-06-22,"Larry Weinbach , the chief executive of Unisys , accused Congress of overreacting yesterday when it introduced legislation following Enron and other financial scandals .
Mr Weinbach , whose technology company boasts annual sales of $ 6bn ( £ 3.3bn ) , joined other executives who have recently criticised the Sarbanes - Oxley law for imposing too many burdens on companies .
Congress passed the Sarbanes - Oxley law in 2002 in reaction to a spate of financial scandals , notably Enron and WorldCom , that shook public confidence in corporate America .
Sarbanes - Oxley , which called for tighter internal company controls , caused a rethink of corporate governance laws in the UK as well , with the publication of the Higgs report , written by Derek Higgs , the former investment banker .
But in the US , a corporate backlash has been steadily building up against Sarbanes - Oxley .
Last week , the head of the New York stock exchange , John Thain , asked in the Wall Street Journal whether regulation had gone so far that foreign companies had decided against listing in the US .
Mr Weinbach , who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a European press briefing in the French resort town of St - Paul - de - Vence , added his voice to the upsurge of criticism of Sarbanes - Oxley .
"" Congress was shooting from the hip in response to mistakes some businesses made in not living up to financial transparency , "" Mr Weibach said .
"" Congress felt it had to do something and did not realise the full ramifications . ""
The Unisys boss said parts of the new corporate governance regime were appropriate , such as independent directors and a compensation committee , but others were onerous and very expensive .
Others have made the same complaint .
Hank Greenberg , the chairman and chief executive of insurance giant AIG , recently complained that his company was spending almost $ 300 m ( £ 164 m ) - 1.5 % of total operating expenses - on total regulatory and corporate governance expenses .
Mr Weinbach said Unisys 's audit fees had gone up and some of the documentation required was "" over the top "" .
Mr Weinbach admitted , however , that Sarbanes - Oxley was not going to go away . ""
It is expensive , some of it does n't make sense , but we have to live with it , "" he said .
But he predicted that the pendulum would swing back in the other direction and that parts of the legislation would be modified in two or three years .
Not everyone one believes that Sarbanes - Oxley is imposing too high a financial and administrative burden on corporate America .
The Teamsters union recently cited figures from Glass Lewis , the proxy advisory firm .
They showed that total audit fees for 461 of the Fortune 500 companies rose 15 % last year .
While the rise seemed large , the union argued , companies still managed to report record profit margins .
Nevertheless , some experts believe that congressional reaction to the spate of scandals has been over - legalistic , pointing to the advantages of the UK approach , where a lighter touch is being applied .
The UK has resisted taking a mandatory approach and relies on an essentially voluntary system .
One change has made a significant difference in Britain .
In requiring companies to put compensation packages to a non - binding vote at annual shareholder meetings , investors have had the chance to show their exasperation , notably in the case of GlaxoSmithKline , the pharmaceutical giant .
Shareholders at that company 's annual general meeting last year voted down proposed million pound remuneration deals for executives .
A revised package was approved this year . ""
Sarbanes - Oxley takes too detailed an approach , "" said Jonathon Story , professor of International Political Economy at Insead , the European business school ."
2004-06-28,"Kenneth Lay , the former Enron chief executive , yesterday spoke out for the first time since the company 's collapse and placed the blame for the firm 's failure squarely on finance chief Andrew Fastow .
In a lengthy interview with the New York Times , Mr Lay protested his innocence , spoke of his vilification in the media and the dramatic slump in his personal finances .
He said his wife had compared their lives to an episode of the science fiction series , the Twilight Zone "" where you live your whole life "" trying to be ethical and straightforward "" to almost overnight being referred to in the national media and elsewhere as a kind of pariah "" .
According to reports , Mr Lay could be indicted on criminal charges as early as this week .
He said if that were to happen it would be a "" great miscarriage of justice "" .
He would plead not guilty if he faces charges .
"" I know in my mind , I did nothing wrong and nothing criminal . ""
Enron collapsed in late 2001 .
The firm filed for bankruptcy after it emerged that a series of off - balance sheet partnerships , many controlled by senior Enron executives including Mr Fastow , were being used to inflate the company 's profits .
Mr Lay said that at the time , he saw nothing suspicious about the off - balance sheet ventures and no reason to distrust his finance chief .
Mr Fastow , alongside a handful of other former Enron finance executives , has since pleaded guilty to numerous fraud charges .
He is now cooperating with government prosecutors .
Mr Lay said : "" At our core , regrettably , we had a chief financial officer and a few other people who , in fact , mismanaged the company 's balance sheet and finances and enriched themselves in a way that once we got into a stressful environment in the marketplace , the company collapsed .
But by the same token , most , and I mean 98 % of the people who worked at Enron , were good , honest , hardworking individuals .
They were not crooks . """
2004-07-03,"Bank of America yesterday became the first bank to agree to a settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by Enron investors who are claiming $ 25bn ( £ 13.6bn ) from firms and individuals allegedly linked to fraudulent activities at the energy firm before it collapsed in 2001 .
The $ 69 m payout was heralded by lawyers behind the claim as the forerunner to a series of larger settlements with other banks .
It follows a $ 40 m settlement with Arthur Andersen two years ago .
"" We anticipate this settlement will be the precursor of much larger ones in the future , especially with the banks that face liability for participating in the scheme to defraud Enron 's common stockholders , "" said William Lerach , attorney for the lead claimant , the University of California .
Among the banks accused of playing a critical role in fraudulent Enron transactions are JP Morgan , Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , CSFB , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland .
The class lawsuit claimed Bank of America had "" actively engaged and participated in the fraudulent scheme "" and "" furthered Enron 's fraudulent course of conduct and business in several ways "" .
"" It helped structure and finance one or more of Enron 's illicit partnerships ... and helped Enron falsify its financial statements and misrepresent its financial condition , while its securities analysts were issuing extremely positive reports on Enron , extolling the businesses success . ""
Yesterday 's settlement was said to relate to Bank of America 's role in underwriting debt issues related to Enron activities .
The bank said in a statement : "" The bank believes it is in the best interests of the company to resolve these claims and put this litigation behind it . ""
Under the settlement , the bank denied that it violated any law and explained that it settled the matter solely to eliminate the uncertainties , expense and distraction of further protracted litigation ."
2004-07-03,"The accountancy profession is in denial , betraying its past and endangering the present .
Five years after the dotcom bubble , three years after the collapse of Enron and the evaporation of Arthur Andersen - then one of the globally pre - eminent audit firms - the business world is no nearer any reliable means of valuing the intangible assets that are critical to the way things are made .
In fact , says Clive Holtham , professor of information management at Cass Business School in London , the situation is worse than five years ago . '
The issue of measurement and reporting of intangibles is not only being ignored , there are active efforts afoot to play down its significance by the accountancy profession , ' he claims .
When , in the late 1990s , UK companies were given greater flexibility to report intangibles , not one top-100 finance director showed any interest , according to a Loughborough University report .
Most companies are indifferent or hostile to new measures , Holtham believes .
The result is a dangerous paradox .
With 75 per cent of wealth - creation now reckoned to be attributable to intangible assets such as knowledge and information , rather than physical assets , the numbers accountants give to investors , bankers and indeed their own managers are increasingly irrelevant .
Failure to come up with a robust way of measuring intangibles was at the heart of the dotcom boom and bust , the most spectacular miscalculation and misallocation of capital since the South Sea Bubble .
A convention of fortune tellers would have blanched at the analysis used to justify some investment decisions , says Holtham . '
Yet the accountancy profession appears to be using the Enron scandal to retreat into seeking reliability of traditional tangible financial statements , and paying even less attention to extending reporting . '
This can only increase the risk of the same thing happening again .
The accounting retreat betrays not only investors , but companies too .
Whether companies choose to report on ' soft ' issues - brand , reputation , human capital , learning , innovation - or not they do , like investors , have to allocate resources .
That 's hardly made easier when the accountancy stance gives credence to the view that measuring intangibles is both unimportant and impossible .
The absence of agreed overarching accounting principles at least has the advantage that companies can choose how they measure intangibles internally , points out Holtham , since they do n't have to satisfy formal stock exchange requirements .
As to importance , consider Shell , whose current travails are a classic case of knowledge mismanagement .
Some high - level officers were clearly aware of the discrepancies in reserve estimates and the dangers they posed to the company 's reputation , but their doubts were suppressed .
There also appears to have been a strong element of groupthink on the board .
Shell has always prided itself on being a socially responsible company , but it evidently did n't devote enough resources to nurturing the cause . '
At some stage something happened to Shell 's values that made it acceptable to put up figures that were n't completely above board , ' Holtham says .
On the other hand explicitly managing intangibles , as elusive and unpindownable as they seem , can bring substantial benefits .
This is because , as the Shell and Enron cases demonstrate , managing intangibles is closely linked to issues of risk and sustainability .
In a report entitled Unlocking the Hidden Wealth of Organisations , Cass researchers have developed a framework for looking at intangibles and identified a group of organisations that , despite the lack of official encouragement , have decided to cultivate their intangible production factors .
They include B&amp;Q ( sponsor of the report ) , Whitbread ( ' from manufacturer to brand manager ' ) , Bloomberg , the UK Fire and Rescue Service , MMO2 , Italian cosmetics company Intercos , the Austrian Research Centres and Swedish learning consultancy Celemi .
Together they chart some of the different ways in which companies can cherish their invisible assets and use them as a source of competitive advantage and wealth creation .
But it should n't be left to practitioners to pioneer new accounting methods , says Holtham .
He contrasts the timid approach of accountants and most managers to devising measures for the things that matter with physicians ' commitment to accumulating a deepening evidence base . '
Medicine as a profession has a deep belief that it can use evidence to develop better ways of making decisions than in the past , ' says Holtham . '
You ca n't but marvel at that compared with what 's not happening in business . '
Holtham , himself accountancy trained , notes that the first written script , cuneiform , was devised in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago not by storytellers but ( in effect ) by accountants , to record transactions and stock levels for an increasingly settled society - a brilliant social and economic inven tion .
Other accounting innovations such as double - entry bookkeeping in 15th century Venice and today 's financial accounting were equally daring intellectual advances .
We 're now desperately in need of a new cuneiform for the knowledge era , but there 's little chance we shall get it from a profession that seems determined to disavow its illustrious intellectual heritage .
Grey head and shoulders above the crowd
Having recognised that ultimately its fate is settled by the perceptions of those outside , DIY retailer B&amp;Q has learned to distinguish itself from rivals by careful management of its brand and other intangibles that affect how it is regarded .
As with many companies , its distinctive qualities were initially the result of an accident : growing fast in the late 1980s , it had to spread its recruitment net to the over-50s .
It discovered that the necessity of employing older workers could be a virtue .
As a result of a deeper skills base and wider experience , it found that its Macclesfield store , staffed entirely by over-50s , was outperforming others in profits , sales , customer service , short - term absenteeism and shrinkage .
Of the company 's 37,000 workforce , 21 per cent are aged 50 or more and 7 per cent are over 60 .
B&amp;Q even boasts two employees in their nineties .
The company amplified its knowledge advantage by setting up a corporate university .
In a self - reinforcing spiral , it transpired that over-50s were adept learners too - not just about products but also about the wider brand .
When , in response to uncomfortable questioning at an AGM , the company launched sustainable sourcing and an ethical trading policy for its timber , over-50s were quick to become persuasive company advocates .
In effect , the company now sells not products but what consumers can do with them and what they represent .
B&amp;Q
user clubs are a further investment in knowledge building . '
Having accidentally uncovered evidence of the value of the over-50s , B&amp;Q has had the wit to exploit it , ' says Clive Holtham of Cass Business School .
The same goes for sustainability . '
Rather than just hoping nothing will happen , it has anticipated the likely repercussions and acted to reduce the risks .
That 's knowledge management in action . ' simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2004-07-06,"The UK government will be urged today not heed calls to cap the liability of auditors following the collapse of Enron in the United States .
Mary Francis , the director - general of the Association of British Insurers , will tell an audience of accountants that putting a ceiling on the amount of damages they can face will be bad for competition among auditors .
"" We fear that if a cap were be to introduced it could mean that large firms were more tempted to use audit as a loss leader to generate consultancy business , "" Ms Francis is expected to say .
"" We are of the firm view that in considering how to respond to the issue of capping , the government should ensure that the competition policy issues are very carefully examined . ""

With only six months left until the introduction of international accounting standards , the clock is ticking loudly for listed companies . """
2004-07-08,"The US justice department today accused Kenneth Lay , the former chairman of Enron , of 11 charges , including conspiracy to commit securities fraud , making false and misleading statements , and bank fraud .
The wide - ranging charges were contained in a 65-page indictment and released hours after Mr Lay appeared in a court in Houston .
Mr Lay , who has steadfastly denied all wrongdoing , appeared calm and relaxed as he entered the FBI offices .
"" You guys are up early , "" the 62-year - old Lay said as he strode past a crowd of about 50 reporters . ""
Nice of you all to show up this morning . ""
In a statement after his indictment yesterday , Mr Lay said had done nothing wrong and that the indictment was not justified .
His statements go against the testimony of former employees at the disgraced energy giant .
They said they had alerted Mr Lay to mounting financial problems in the months before the company disclosed false profits and billions in hidden debt .
Mr Lay , Enron 's founder and a big contributor to the Bush presidential campaign , was replaced as chief executive for six months ending in August 2001 by Jeffrey Skilling .
Mr Skilling , Mr Lay 's handpicked successor , was indicted earlier this year , along with Enron 's former chief accountant , Rick Causey .
Both pleaded not guilty to more than three dozen counts of insider trading , fraud and lying on Enron financial statements .
In its most high - profile investigation into corporate fraud after the bull market of the 1990s , the government has been steadily making its way up the chain of command at Enron .
So far the justice department 's Enron taskforce has charged 30 people connected to the company with conspiracy and other crimes .
Eleven individuals have pleaded guilty or been found guilty after trial .
Enron was the nation 's seventh - largest publicly owned company by revenue before it went bust at the end of 2001 , in the biggest bankrupcty in the US at the time .
Enron started the wave of financial scandals that swept Wall Street , with the collapse of WorldCom , the telecommunications giant , to follow .
Once the head of one of American 's corporate titans , Mr Lay - nicknamed Kenny Boy by his friend President George W Bush - is now fighting to save his reputation .
The charges come two and a half years after the justice department began its inquiry into Enron .
Several top executives are now in jail , including Andrew Fastow , the former chief financial officer .
Mr Fastow , who managed the partnerships that struck questionable deals with Enron , pleaded guilty in January in exchange for a 10-year prison term and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors .
Mr Fastow helped prosecutors bring charges against Mr Skilling , who , under Mr Lay , oversaw Enron 's expansion from an energy company into the trading of everything from natural gas and electricity to internet network capacity .
At the time , Enron was the darling of Wall Street and the financial press , which praised the company for its innovative business practices .
As head of Houston Natural Gas , Mr Lay engineered a 1985 merger that formed the national pipelines giant that became Enron .
He was chief executive for most of the company 's history , ceding those duties to Mr Skilling in February 2001 until Mr Skilling abruptly left in August 2001 .
Mr Lay stepped back in as chief executive until he was forced out in January 2002 ."
2004-07-08,"Former Enron chairman Ken Lay is expected to be led in handcuffs into a Houston courtroom today following his indictment on charges related to the earnings inflation fraud that shook corporate America , destroying its seventh largest company .
The indictment , returned by a Texas grand jury yesterday and believed to target Enron 's most senior board member , is likely to prove particularly uncomfortable for Mr Lay 's onetime friend George Bush as he campaigns for re - election .
Mr Lay was one of the president 's most effective fundraisers and in 2000 Enron was the largest corporate donor to the Bush presidential campaign .
So close did Mr Lay come to the Bush family that the president gave him the nickname "" Kenny Boy "" .
Yesterday 's indictment follows a battery of charges brought against scores of Enron directors , executives and external accountant Arthur Andersen .
The justice department has negotiated several plea - bargain deals to advance its investigations .
It struck a breakthrough deal in January with Enron 's former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow .
Mr Lay , who refused to answer questions at a congressional inquiry after Enron 's collapse , has in recent weeks broken his silence , insisting he would protest his innocence should he be indicted .
He claims his role at the energy trading company was largely ambassadorial during the period under scrutiny and that he was detached from day - to - day operations .
Mr Lay told the New York Times the Enron board had been misled by Mr Fastow and other executives about the true activities of a string of off - the - books partnerships .
"" I take full responsibility for what happened at Enron , "" Mr Lay said .
"" But , saying that , I know in my mind that I did nothing criminal . ""
Such comments appear to place Mr Lay in conflict with other directors , particularly former chief executive Jeff Skilling , who was also indicted this year .
Mr Skilling has said his actions were approved by Mr Lay and the board .
Mr Lay took charge of the operational running of Enron after Mr Skilling 's departure in the summer of 2001 .
According to a civil claim brought by Enron investors , Mr Lay sold millions of Enron shares for more than $ 180 m ( £ 100 m ) in the knowledge its published accounts were a sham .
It is not known whether yesterday 's indictment will make similar allegations .
Mr Lay is expected to argue that share sales were in response to market pressures .
Commenting on his links to the White House , Mr Lay recently said : "" If anything , being friends with the Bush family , including the president , has made my situation more difficult because it 's probably a tougher decision not to indict me . ""
In 1985 , Mr Lay engineered the merger of two small energy firms to create Enron , overseeing its growth into the seventh largest US company ."
2004-07-08,"Former Enron boss and Republican party fundraiser Ken Lay yesterday appeared in court after being indicted on 11 counts mainly relating to his alleged role in hiding billions of dollars in losses in the months before the energy firm 's collapse three years ago .
A handcuffed but smiling Mr Lay was led into a Houston courtroom as the indictment against him was made public yesterday .
It accuses him of reassuring Enron employees and investors about the strength of its balance sheet when he knew it was carrying some $ 7bn ( £ 3.8bn ) in concealed losses .
Mr Lay , once a close friend to George Bush and his father , had been one of the Republican party 's most important corporate cheerleaders before his fall from grace .
The president , who affectionately knew the Enron boss as "" Kenny Boy "" , is said to have considered him for a cabinet post following his 2000 election .
Prosecutors said the indictment against Mr Lay should , in part , be read as "" a message to corporate America "" .
Andrew Weissmann , head of the department of justice 's Enron task force , said the message was : "" Your constituents are owed complete candour [ and ] ... if you violate that trust you will be brought to account .
No one is too powerful .
No one is too wealthy . ""
The indictment claims Mr Lay gave the impression that he was personally accruing Enron shares when , in truth , he had sold $ 20 m more than he had bought .
In the four years leading up to Enron 's collapse , Mr Lay made profits of more than $ 217 m from share sales and was rewarded with pay deals worth $ 19 m , according to the DoJ. Mr Lay is named in the indictment as one of three principal conspirators - along with Jeff Skilling , his protege whom he picked to take over the operational running of Enron in early 2001 , and senior accountant Richard Causey .
Mike Ramsey , Mr Lay 's attorney , yesterday said he would be seeking to have his client 's case heard in isolation .
He said Mr Lay was innocent of wrongdoing , and had been one of the biggest victims of an earnings inflation fraud masterminded by chief financial officer Andy Fastow and others .
Mr Fastow , whom Mr Ramsey repeatedly called "" a thief and a liar "" , struck a plea - bargain deal with the prosecutors in January .
"" Andy and others were not telling the boss that they were stealing from Enron , "" Mr Ramsey said outside court yesterday .
"" It may be there are people who say something different now to assist their plight . ""
Jim Comey , President Bush 's deputy attorney - general , said Mr Lay and his co - conspirators had "" a one - track mind "" as they strove to "" hit or beat targets set by Wall Street analysts no matter what it took "" .

Mr Lay pleaded not guilty to 11 criminal charges , including bank and share - trading fraud and making false statements .
He also faces an action brought by the securities and exchange commission .
Mr Lay 's indictment showed that "" even the whitest of white collars is not above the law "" and having friends in the White House provided no immunity from prosecution , said the Washington Post .
He was "" certainly entitled to a fair trial with open - minded jurors "" , noted the New York Times , which rejected the suggestion his prosecution was the result of anti - corporate scapegoating . ""

If he is found not guilty by "" reason of staggering ignorance and incompetence "" , said the paper , "" it will be a damning indictment of the corporate culture where this ( now ) self - proclaimed ignoramus rose to the top ...
And it will indict the Bush administration for allowing Mr Lay to help write the nation 's energy policy . ""
Mr Lay was guilty of bad management , conceded the Wall Street Journal , but "" no CEO can know all that is going on in a large corporation , and fraud at Enron was so complex that it took prosecutors more than two years to unravel . ""

2004-08-03,"The high court in London yesterday ruled that JP Morgan Chase had not engaged in any conspiracy with Enron , handing the American banking group a rare victory in the morass of lawsuits surrounding the collapse of the energy firm .
The court ordered the German bank , West LB , to pay $ 165 m ( £ 90 m ) to JP Morgan , honouring a letter of credit issued to back a complex energy transaction only weeks before Enron imploded .
The letter of credit in effect guaranteed payment in the event of a default .
West LB had argued that the transaction - a so - called energy - based swap deal , was in fact a disguised loan made to Enron to help the energy company fraudulently inflate its profits .
But Justice Jeremy Cooke wrote in his ruling that there was "" no dishonesty "" on the part of JP Morgan and "" no deception "" of West LB . ""
West 's claims against Chase all fail because Chase was not party to any conspiracy with Enron , "" he said .
The deal in question was structured through a Channel Islands vehicle named Mahonia .
In January , JP Morgan settled a similar suit with 11 insurers who had refused to pay about $ 1bn in guarantees on commodity deals struck between the bank and Enron through Mahonia during the 1990s .
The insurers agreed to pay $ 650 m ."
2004-09-02,"To the roll call of corporate scandals in recent years - a list of greed and shame that includes Enron , WorldCom , Tyco and others - the name of newspaper group Hollinger International may soon be added .
An internal investigation into financial malpractice within Hollinger conducted by Richard Breeden , a former chairman of the US securities and exchange commission , alleges a stunning sequence of "" corporate kleptocracy "" by Conrad Black , the recently ousted chief executive of Hollinger .
Mr Breeden 's report bluntly states that Lord Black and others "" committed deliberate acts of fraud , and violated civil and criminal statutes "" by pocketing secret payments worth hundreds of millions of pounds .
In essence , Lord Black and his coterie appear to have milked the finances of Hollinger 's assets , including the Daily Telegraph , the Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator , as a source of personal wealth , over the legitimate claims of its shareholders .
Mr Breeden 's 500-page report is alternately shocking and amusing in illuminating the scale and nature of the apparent abuse by Hollinger 's senior executives , which seem to have been blithely approved by the company 's directors .
From claiming $ 42,870 for a birthday party in honour of Barbara Amiel Black , the Daily Telegraph columnist turned Hollinger board member , to the more serious charge that Lord Black and allies received cash equivalent to 95 % of Hollinger 's entire net income for six years - more than £ 200 m - the 14-month long investigation supports its conclusion of "" aggressive looting "" .
Lord Black denies the report 's findings , having previously described Mr Breeden as "" truly evil "" and a fascist who menaces capitalism .
But those unconvinced by Lord Black 's denials may be more concerned to know how he was able to get away with such an apparently concerted fraud .
The answer lies in the unusual ownership structure that Lord Black enjoyed , with a holding company owning just 30 % of Hollinger 's equity but with a special class of shares that granted him 70 % of voting rights .
In effect he was - and is still , pending court battles in the US - effectively owner and manager , able to fire directors and executives as he saw fit , accountable to no one .
For all Lord Black 's lectures on the triumphant values of capitalism , they were values to which he seemed a stranger .
Hollinger 's byzantine ownership structure demanded a much more rigorous standard of transparency .
In this case , Hollinger 's shareholders were lucky to have had a small but persistent US fund manager named Tweedy , Browne that was prepared to aggressively pursue Hollinger and Lord Black .
Its success , in the face of Lord Black 's pompous bluster and posturing , is the real triumph .
Now the Hollinger report will be examined by regulators and authorities in the US , the UK and Canada , with the possibility of heavy civil and criminal actions being brought against Lord Black and others .
Hollinger is already suing Lord Black and allies for £ 700 m in compensation and damages .
Others may follow .
Finally , there is the issue of Lord Black 's title , a peerage unwisely bestowed on him at the request of the Conservative party .
If nothing else this , and the example of Jeffrey Archer , shows the need for reform of the House of Lords and its replacement by a democratically elected membership .
In the meantime , if these damning accusations are proved to be substantially true , it is inconceivable that Lord Black should sit in the upper house as a member of the British legislature .
If Lord Black has a shred of decency and self - respect in such circumstances then he should voluntarily resign his peerage .
If he does not , matters should be set in motion to strip him of this undeserved and unworthy title ."
2004-09-20,"The first criminal trial involving former executives of the now infamous energy company , Enron , begins today in a case that could have a crucial bearing on future trials of the company 's top officials .
None of the six defendants - four former Merrill Lynch executives and two former mid - level Enron executives who are charged with conspiracy and fraud - have the notoriety of Enron 's founder , Kenneth Lay , or former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling .
Nonetheless , the case starting today in Houston will be closely watched as a possible harbinger for when Mr Lay and Mr Skilling themselves appear in the dock .
At issue in the so - called Nigerian barge trial , as jury selection begins , is whether Enron 's financial machinations - the kind that led to its eventual collapse - went beyond the law .
Enron 's bankruptcy in 2001 was the first of several high - profile scandals that sent tremors through Wall Street and the US corporate world and its impact is still being felt .
"" It 's significant because this calls into question Wall Street practices in dealing with corporate America , "" Philip Hilder , a former federal prosecutor who represents several Enron - related clients in Houston , told the Associated Press . ""
The ramifications of this are broader than Enron , certainly .
"" Prosecutors accuse the six of helping push through a sale of several floating power plants stationed along the Nigerian coast to the brokerage Merrill Lynch in late 1999 that allowed Enron to report about $ 12 m ( £ 6.7 m ) in pre - tax earnings .
All six have pleaded innocent .
The defendants are : Daniel Bayly , the former chairman of investment banking for Merrill ; Robert Furst , the former Enron relationship manager for Merrill ; James Brown , former head of Merrill 's asset lease and finance group ; William Fuhs , former Merrill vice - president who answered to Mr Brown ; Dan Boyle , a former finance executive on former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow 's staff ; and Sheila Kahanek , a former in - house Enron accountant .
Merrill avoided prosecution a year ago by cooperating with the government and implementing reforms that prohibit questionable deals .
Six months earlier , Merrill paid the securities and exchange commission ( SEC ) , the US financial watchdog , $ 80 m to settle civil allegations involving the barge deal without admitting or denying wrongdoing .
The barge transaction took place in the last days of December 1999 , when Enron was struggling to sell the investment in the barges in time to be included in the quarter 's profit figures .
Merrill agreed to invest $ 7 m in a financial entity that made the purchase , based on an assurance that it would get back its investment , plus a profit , in six months .
At issue is whether Enron itself , as the seller , was guaranteeing Merrill against loss .
If so , Merrill was never at any risk as any future loss would have to be repaid by Enron .
Prosecutors will argue , therefore , that it was a sham sale , designed to inflate Enron 's profits .
Enron 's collapse , followed by several corporate scandals , prompted Congress to pass sweeping legislation .
The Sarbanes - Oxley law was designed to improve corporate governance , but companies are now complaining of over - regulation .
William Donaldson , the chairman of the SEC , has hit back , arguing that top executives have failed to provide "" ethical "" leadership .
Mr Donaldson has pointed to the lack of progress in linking pay more closely to performance as evidence that such leadership was wanting ."
2004-09-28,"Three British bankers have been accused of fraud "" as a means to prosecute major figures in the Enron scandal "" , a court heard today .
The trio of former NatWest investment specialists are alleged to have worked with two executives from the failed US energy giant to defrauded a subsidiary of the NatWest subsidiary .
The men are not being investigated by British authorities , but because correspondence was sent between London , Houston and the Cayman Islands during the transaction in question , the US government wants the men to be extradited to face seven counts of wire fraud in a Texas court .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew , all 42 , deny all the charges against them .
They are being "" used as a weapon "" in the Enron investigation , London 's Bow Street magistrates court was told . ""
The US did not really want to prosecute them for defrauding their bank in London but to get these defendants to implicate people in the Enron scandal , "" said Alun Jones QC , for the defence .
"" The reason these proceedings were advanced was to advance the case against American targets .
It was simply a British means to an American end . ""
Mr Jones said his clients had contacted the Crown Prosecution Service , the Financial Services Authority , the Serious Fraud Office and the home secretary , David Blunkett , but none of them had decided to launch an investigation in Britain . ""
This is not somebody burgled who has n't reported the burglary .
We have made every genuine effort to ask that there 's an investigation .
There has been no allegation by NatWest bank to anybody saying ' We believe we have been defrauded ' , "" he said .
Prosecutors allege that in 2000 , the three British bankers conspired with Mr Fastow and Mr Kopper to defraud a NatWest subsidiary of millions of dollars .
They allegedly advised the bank to sell its interest in a subsidiary of LJM , a Fastow - run partnership , to another Fastow - created entity for $ 1 m when it was worth much more .
Following the sale Mr Fastow , Mr Kopper and the bankers divided $ 19 m among themselves , with the bankers allegedly pocketing $ 7.3 m .
In June , district judge Nicholas Evans , who is also presiding over today 's hearing , ruled that the requirements of Section 137 of the Extradition Act 2003 were satisfied , meaning that the alleged offences did qualify for potential extradition .
During today 's proceedings - which are due to last three days - the bankers ' lawyers argued that because of the time which had elapsed between the alleged offences and the issue of the extradition order it would be a breach of their human rights if they were extradited .
It is the first time the new Extradition Act - brought in by Mr Blunkett to trap suspected terrorists - will be tested in the British courts .
The radical Muslim cleric , Abu Hamza , faces an extradition hearing under the same legislation in October .
The three bankers face 18 months in prison before a trial , and up to 35 years in prison and a fine if convicted on all counts .
A ruling against the three men may make it easier for US authorities to extradite businessmen that local regulators do not pursue .
The FSA , Britain 's financial watchdog , has said in letters to the men that it will await the outcome of the US process before deciding on action ."
2004-09-28,"Campaign group Liberty has warned of a potential human rights breach should Britain wave through the "" fast track "" extradition to the US of three former NatWest bankers accused of conspiring with Enron fraudsters to cheat the bank of $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) .
The group has written to Bow Street magistrates court ahead of an extradition hearing starting this morning , pointing out that the alleged crime substantially took place in the UK , and that the defendants and the bank are British .
Gary Mulgrew , David Bermingham and Giles Darby are said to have duped NatWest of $ 7.3 m four years ago .
They are accused of hatching a plot with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and his righhand man Michael Kopper - though they are not implicated in the fraud that led to the collapse of the energy trader .
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti called on the British authorities to explain their reasons for not bringing a case against the former bankers in the UK .
"" One can not help worrying that we are letting the Americans ' get on with it ' - that is not a good enough explanation for taking people away from their families . ""
Article 8 of the European convention on human rights sets out a right to respect for an individual 's family and private life .
It is thought the bankers will be detained in the US should the extradition request from the department of justice prove successful . ""
These are real human beings - with families and lives here .
It is pretty serious to be wafted to the other side of the world , "" Ms Chakrabarti said .
"" Is it necessary and proportionate for them to be dragged from their homes in Britain when everything is said to have happened over here ? ""
Liberty has taken an interest in the case after campaigning against elements of the Extradition Act which became law this year .
The act does not require the US to set out a prima facie case to secure extradition .
Details of the NatWest bankers ' actions came to light during interviews they gave voluntarily to the Financial Services Authority after US regulators announced they had begun investigating Enron in 2001 .
The FSA passed transcripts and other information to the US securities and exchange commission .
Together with admissions from Fastow and Kopper , the transcripts form the bulk of evidence against the bankers .
At no point have they admitted misconduct but the FSA is understood to have told them they could face legal action in Britain should the US fail to secure extradition .
The FSA declined to comment on the bankers ' case but made clear any decision to allow overseas proceedings to take priority always took account of where the alleged offence took place ; the nationality of the victim ; likely difficulties in accessing crucial evidence ; and the existence of more advanced investigations by overseas authorities .
Fastow and Kopper have pleaded guilty to their part in the alleged fraud on NatWest , through which they shared $ 12.3 m , and have signed plea - bargain agreements ."
2004-09-29,"The extradition of three former NatWest bankers , being sought by US prosecutors from the Enron Task Force , would have "" frightening consequences "" for the British legal system , a court heard yesterday .
Alun Jones QC , representing the bankers , suggested the US authorities had pursued the men as part of a strategy designed to put pressure on senior Enron executives believed to have played a central role in the fraud that led to the collapse of the Texan energy trader in 2001 .
"" The US did not really want to prosecute them [ the British men ] for defrauding their bank in London , but to get these defendants to implicate people in the Enron scandal , "" Mr Jones told Bow Street magistrates court .
"" It was simply a British means to an American end . ""
Former bankers David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby have been linked to ex - Enron finance director Andrew Fastow and his onetime lieutenant Michael Kopper , with whom they are accused of conspiring to defraud the British bank .
Together they are alleged to have embezzled $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) after engineering the hugely undervalued sale of the bank 's interest in an Enron offshore hedging structure .
The British bankers are not said to have defrauded Enron .
Mr Jones described the US authority 's approach - which has the backing of Britain 's Crown Prosecution Service , Serious Fraud Office and Financial Services Authority - as "" deeply aggressive "" , noting that the alleged fraud took place largely in the UK and that the victim was a British bank .
Mr Jones read extracts from letters setting out the position of various UK authorities - all of which declined to bring proceedings in the light of ongoing action in the US .
He described the British position as "" a supine and craven view "" , insisting it was "" just not good enough "" .
Mr Jones pointed to the fact that the US extradition request appeared to have been delayed until the government 's Extradition Act came into force this year .
Under the act there is no requirement for American authorities to present a prima facie case - although UK authorities must do so in seeking extraditions from the US .
Mr Jones recalled home office minister Caroline Flint 's remarks on the act .
Last year she said trials "" should take place in the country where the crime is alleged to have been committed "" .
Following the US extradition request concerning muslim cleric Abu Hamza , Mr Jones noted the position of the home secretary , David Blunkett .
"" Had we evidence of a crime committed here , of course the police and the attorney general would act . ""
Mr Jones asked district judge Nicholas Evans to consider the US request in the light of these comments .
Under previous extradition laws , the final decision lay with the home secretary .
Mr Jones , an expert in serious fraud and extradition proceedings , successfully defended Kevin Maxwell and represented the Spanish government in failed proceedings concerning Augusto Pinochet , the former Chilean dictator .
The hearing continues ."
2004-10-15,"Three former NatWest bankers should be extradited to the US to face trial over Enron - related fraud charges , a judge ruled today .
The three - Gary Mulgrew , Giles Darby and David Bermingham - have each been accused of seven counts of "" wire fraud "" by US authorities .
They all worked for Greenwich Natwest , the bank 's capital markets division , at the time of the alleged fraud four years ago .
The Britons have been fighting extradition over allegations that they conspired with Enron executives , including the former finance chief , Andrew Fastow , to defraud NatWest by secretly investing in an off balance sheet deal .
It is alleged they made £ 1.5 m each after cheaply selling an interest held by Greenwich NatWest in an Enron entity , and pocketing the difference .
US authorities , who want the men to face trial in Houston , Texas , have based their case on evidence given to the UK 's Financial Services Authority .
The three each face up to 35 years in prison .
None of the men - who all deny the allegations - has been charged in the UK .
After the hearing , Mr Bermingham said they planned to appeal to the high court and had 14 days to do so .
Should they fail to overturn the ruling , the final decision over extradition rests with the home secretary , David Blunkett .
Mr Blunkett will be sent a recommendation from Judge Nicholas Evans , who issued today 's ruling at Bow Street magistrates court .
"" There is a good and proper basis for prosecuting them in the US , "" the judge said , adding that the process of extradition was necessary in a democratic society .
He said he did not consider that it breached the three men 's human rights .
His order was made under new legislation - in force since January - designed to speed up the extradition of suspected terrorists .
The former bankers argue they would have to pay their own legal costs of up to $ 2 m ( £ 1.1 m ) , and would probably not be granted bail .
They have been told they face up to two years in a federal penitentiary before their case comes to court .
During the Bow Street hearing , they argued they should face trial in the UK .
Speaking outside the court , Mr Bermingham said : "" To do that would take one phone call to the Serious Fraud Office or the Crown Prosecution Service , and they could bring upon us the might of the UK legal system .
We repeat that request to the US government ... bring the action here , where it belongs . ""
Judge Evans had heard from a US federal criminal defence attorney , called on behalf of the former bankers , who said the men "" would not get a fair trial in Texas "" .
Douglas McNabb told the court they would not be able to get documents to prepare for trial if they were behind bars , and would be denied access to computers .
He also described the US federal justice system as "" incredibly unfair "" , pointing out that 97 % of people pleaded guilty to federal offences , arguing : "" In most cases they would be mad not to after looking at the sentencing guidelines . """
2004-10-15,"A skilful and powerful party - political broadcast for Bush 's unofficial opposition , the Michael Moore faction , Fahrenheit 9/11 ranges far and wide to provide an eye - opening state of the nation and provides a double whammy for art and commerce : it is the most financially successful documentary ever made and won the main award at the Cannes film festival .
Regular readers and watchers of the man from Flint wo n't be too shocked by some of his assertions : the close ties of the Bushes and Saudi leaders ; the country 's huge investment in the US ( 6 - 7 % of the economy , it is alleged here ) ;
the murky links with Enron and Halliburton ; scare tactics that propelled the Patriot Act through Congress ; denials of WMD from Rice and Powell in the early part of 2001 ; the cynical linkage of Iraq with al - Qaida .
But all of this needs saying .
The cumulative effect is compelling , and it may well have come as a shock for a sizeable proportion of its US audience , whose TV news agenda is at the other end of the spectrum .
As a film - maker , Moore 's main skill is to whip all this information and a vast amount of footage into a coherent shape - using everything from George Orwell to Neil Young ; from Britney Spears to the Bloodhound Gang ; from kids reading My Pet Goat with the Prez on 9/11 to kids losing limbs in Iraq to make his point .
Mostly , wisely , he gives you the facts and lets you provide the anger , starting with the extraordinary election hijack ( assisted by Bush 's brother and cousin ) and finishing by bringing it all back home to Flint , Michigan where huge unemployment gives two Marines a fertile ground for recruitment and a grieving war widow goes to Washington .
Sometimes just pointing a camera at the blank , bewildered face of Bush - a man who has looked badly constipated for the last decade - does the job for him .
Moore does for this Gulf war what Bill Hicks did for the last one , but has gained a far bigger audience .
He may be accused of preaching to the converted , but let 's hope his film has had a serious impact on the election .
The DVD adds footage from both camps in Iraq and from Cannes , where jury chairman Quentin Tarantino insisted the award was not simply political - "" You won it because it was the best film "" - and
jury member Tilda Swinton says it "" validates film "" ."
2004-10-16,"Three former NatWest bankers were told yesterday they should be extradited to the United States to face fraud charges connected to the collapsed energy company Enron .
A judge in Bow Street magistrates court concluded that the three should be sent for trial in Houston despite their protestations that their alleged crimes took place in Britain and they would not receive a fair trial in Texas , where Enron was based .
The three immediately said they would appeal against the decision , which the district judge , Nicholas Evans , admitted might lead to them receiving a "" substantial term of imprisonment "" if convicted by an American jury .
Mr Evans has sent the case to David Blunkett , the home secretary , who will make the final decision on extradition .
The three have six weeks in which to make representations to Mr Blunkett and then have another two weeks to launch a formal appeal once his decision is made , their spokesman said .
The three - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - are alleged to have schemed with Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former finance director , and his right - hand man , Michael Kopper , to defraud NatWest .
They are not implicated in the collapse of the energy company , however .
The three men sat closely together in court , at times holding their heads in their hands .
Outside the Bow Street court yesterday , Mr Bermingham urged the British authorities to take up the case so they could face trial here .
They believe they will have to sell their homes to cover the cost of a US trial and fear they will be denied bail by the US authorities while they await trial .
Mr Bermingham said it would take "" one phone call [ by the US ] to the Serious Fraud Office or the Crown Prosecution Services and they could bring upon us the might of the UK legal system "" .
"" We repeat that request to the US government .
Bring the action here ... where it belongs , "" Mr Bermingham said .
"" We will be appealing the decision , not just for ourselves but also for others who will inevitably also be caught up in the government 's extradition law changes , "" he added .
The Extradition Act , which became law this year and was designed to speed up action against terrorists , does not require the United States to set out a case against the men to secure their extradition .
Prior to this , the government could block an extradition if it felt it was unfair .
Mark Spragg , the bankers ' solicitor , accused the US government of waiting until the law change was introduced before applying to extradite them .
He said the appeal would be on the grounds that the court should have considered the "" rights and wrongs "" of the extradition in the way the government used to .
Mr Evans said : "" I am told these defendants would welcome a prosecution in the UK as it would give them the opportunity to clear their names . ""
However , he said that if the SFO did now begin an investigation , by the time it came to any proceedings being taken against the three they could argue the case had taken too long to come to court and should be stayed .
He accepted their argument that they would have to leave their homes and family to face trial in the US as an "" unattractive position "" .
"" Serious and complex cases do disrupt family life and interfere with earning a living but that does n't mean that extradition to face trial is incompatible with [ human rights law ] , "" he added .
The US authorities have based their case on evidence that the three men gave to the Financial Services Authority .
Sir Menzies Campbell , Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman and Mr Mulgrew 's MP , said he was anxious about whether his constituent and co - defendants would face a fair trial .
He cited concerns about links between Enron and the Bush administration .
Mr Mulgrew 's mother is Trish Godman , deputy speaker of the Scottish Parliament .
The three are due to reappear at Bow Street on Tuesday for a bail hearing ."

2004-11-19,"Enron said yesterday it had cancelled its nearly worthless stock three years after declaring bankruptcy in the latest move towards liquidation .
The company , in a flurry of filings with the US securities and exchange commission , also said it had completed the sale of its largest remaining assets and its court - approved bankruptcy plan became effective .
Enron sold its $ 2.11bn ( £ 1bn ) interest in Transwestern Pipeline Co , Citrus Corp and Northern Plains Natural Gas to CCE Holdings , a joint venture of Southern Union Co and GE Commercial Finance Energy Financial Services .
The deals were agreed earlier this year .
Enron , once touted as the seventh - largest US corporation , triggered a flood of indictments and lawsuits upon its slide amid accountancy scandals in late 2001 .
Once the pending $ 1.25bn sale of Portland General Electric to buyout firm Texas Pacific Group closes , the only remains of the once mighty Enron will be a collection of international assets which are also expected to be sold ."
2004-11-26,"New rules to improve corporate governance in Britain following high - profile accounting scandals such as Enron have been watered down and delayed after intense lobbying by business leaders .
Originally , the operating and financial review ( OFR ) was to have included a demand for auditors to confirm directors had made "" due and careful enquiry "" in their review .
Now companies only have to show they have exercised "" due care , skill and diligence "" as required under common law .
Implementation of the OFR has been put back from next January to April , and companies do not expect inspections of OFRs possibly until 2007 .
There is also only a need for companies to report on their social and environmental impact to the extent that they deem it necessary .
Friends of the Earth said last night that the new rules had been diluted so much that they were "" all but meaningless "" .
Craig Bennett , head of corporate accountability campaigns at FoE , said : "" The government is clearly willing to ignore public concerns and be led by the nose by the business lobby . ""
However , the employers ' body the CBI described them as "" excellent "" .
John Cridland , the deputy director general , said yesterday : "" The original proposals contained serious flaws that frankly would have killed the OFR . ""
The new rules follow four years of consultation and require all listed companies to provide details of their strategic plans through an OFR published with their annual results .
It is hoped that this will make companies more transparent to investors and reduce the likelihood of further Enron - type collapses .
Patricia Hewitt , the trade and industry secretary , said : "" I 'm pleased there was such active consultation and involvement from such a broad range of stakeholders .
Their feedback has helped strengthen our proposals and meet our policy objective : encouraging full and frank disclosure in a cost - effective and efficient way .
"" Accountants and the CBI complained that introducing legal liability into the OFR would have led to companies adopting only the most bland statements written by lawyers ."
2004-12-05,"Digby Jones will meet US financial regulators this week to plead for clemency on behalf of British companies facing the heavy cost of complying with new US corporate governance rules , writes Conal Walsh .
The CBI chief flies out to meet William Donaldson , chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission , on Wednesday in an attempt to secure exemption from the tough new accounting regulations introduced after Enron and other US scandals .
British companies with shares , American depository receipts or debt listed in the US are obliged to comply with the so - called Sarbanes - Oxley rules , which require detailed financial reporting and threaten prison sentences for directors if their companies state their accounts wrongly .
UK firms affected , including nearly half of the FTSE 100 companies , face estimated extra costs of £ 450 million a year .
The rules come into force for non - US companies in July .
Last week the CBI and its German equivalent wrote a joint letter to the SEC highlighting concerns in Europe over the legislation .
Many British companies are understood to have considered delisting in the US in response to Sarbanes - Oxley .
Under current US law , however , such a move does not represent a clear escape from the expensive new regulations , since the firms would still be on the SEC 's register of companies .
Deregistration from the SEC is only possible if the company 's American shareholders fall below 300 in number - not a likely prospect for any large UK company .
But the CBI is hopeful that Jones can secure rule changes in the US that will provide British companies with an exit route from American markets .
The CBI 's Rod Armitage said : ' It may be possible for the SEC to make the changes to their own regulations .
On the other hand , it might be necessary to go to Congress to get a change in the law .
But we are optimistic that there will be a deal on this . '"
2005-01-02,"MMO2 is considering a radical plan to buy out all its American shareholders in order to avoid the cost of meeting new US stock market regulations .
It could save the company up to £ 5 million a year .
The mobile phone operator is one of dozens of British companies affected by the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , which was passed by Congress last year in the wake of scandals at several of American 's biggest companies , including Enron and Worldcom .
It introduces tough new accounting regulations designed to prevent a repeat of recent corporate collapses and makes filing misleading or inaccurate company accounts a criminal offence .
Foreign companies with more than 300 American shareholders have to comply with the new regulations , even if their shares are not traded on the New York Stock Exchange .
Nearly half of FTSE 100 companies are affected and the overall annual cost to British business is estimated at more than £ 450 m .
MMO2 would be following the lead of ITV , which announced last month that it would save around $ 4 m a year by buying back shares held by its small American investors .
It has 609 US share holders , most of whom held Carlton shares before its merger with Granada formed ITV .
The broadcaster calculated that the cost of complying with the US regulations amounted to £ 6,600 for each US shareholder and estimates that it will recoup the cost of the transaction within a year if the proposal is approved at an extraordinary meeting in February .
If MMO2 implements its plan , other large UK companies are likely to follow .
Many British companies , including BT and leisure conglomerate Rank Group , have complained about the regulatory burden imposed by the legislation , which comes into force for foreign companies in July .
The CBI is lobbying the SEC , America 's stock market regulator , to change the rules .
Its director - general , Digby Jones , met SEC chairman William Donaldson last month

Andersen was forced out of business by the conviction .
It once employed 85,000 people but now has only 200 lawyers and support staff in Chicago .
The justices agreed to review an appeals court decision upholding the conviction last year .
The firm argued that the judge had incorrectly instructed the jury in the original trial .
Although too late to save the business , a ruling in Andersen 's favour could help the firm 's former partners defend themselves against dozens of civil lawsuits .
Meanwhile the University of California last night said it had reached a $ 168 m ( £ 88 m ) settlement with some former Enron directors in a class action suit , in which the executives in question will pay $ 13 m from their own pockets .
The settlement is the second this week in which former directors have agreed to pay cash to settle shareholder lawsuits .
Earlier 10 former directors of telecoms group WorldCom agreed to pay $ 18 m of their own money in a $ 54 m settlement ."
2005-01-19,"Krispy Kreme Doughnuts yesterday said its chairman and chief executive is stepping down as the retailer struggles with sharply falling sales and investigations into accounting irregularities .
The firm has hired turnaround specialist Stephen Cooper to replace Scott Livengood as chief executive .
Mr Cooper , chairman of the consultancy Kroll Zolfo Cooper , is still interim chief executive and chief restructuring officer of Enron , helping to liquidate the disgraced energy firm 's assets .
Mr Livengood , 52 , said he planned to retire .
Krispy Kreme shares yesterday jumped more than 18 % .
Until recently a Wall Street darling , Krispy Kreme warned last May that sales of its glazed doughnuts were slowing as consumers turned to low - carbohydrate diets .
The firm said that sales in the eight weeks to December 26 fell by up to 25 % .
That drop is in sharp contrast to a year ago when in the fourth quarter of 2003 , it had enjoyed a 10.7 % increase in same store sales ."
2005-01-22,"Roderick is in his kitchen , hoping .
He is pouring grapefruit juice into his souvenir Enron coffee mug , hoping with great psychic effort .
He knows that his wife , Janice , will awaken soon , and will spend a few minutes in the bathroom , and after her few minutes in the bathroom she will walk toward the kitchen and to him , and at that time she is very likely to talk about how much sleep she did not get .
Roderick is hoping , hoping with such effort that his knees are making noise , that she will not do this today .
Roderick and Janice have been married only a few months , and did not live together before their marriage , and thus he was not aware , prenuptials , of this habit of hers , of informing him every day of how little she has slept .
There are slight variations to how she delivers this information - "" I did n't sleep a bit last night "" ; "" I laid awake with my head vibrating "" ; "" I did n't fall asleep till four , and I 've been up since five ! "" - but deliver it she does , each morning over breakfast , thinking firstly that Roderick is interested in this information , and secondly that Roderick will believe her news , even though Roderick knows quite well that she sleeps just as much as he does , which is an average and adequate amount .
So Roderick butters his bagel and hopes .
He adds some jam to his bagel and wishes .
Then he hears the creak of the mattress , the turn of the doorknob , and sees her entry into the bathroom .
It will not be long now , he knows , until she will come to tell him the groggy news . ""
Oh lord , I 'm so tired , "" she will say , and he will tense up like a prisoner flogged .
How can he tell her , politely , that he does n't goddamned for one second give a rip about her sleep or motherboning lack thereof ?
Is he supposed to feel complicit with the forces who steal sleep ?
Is he expected to do something about finding or creating more sleep for her ?
He refuses to forever feel guilty about sleeping soundly while she does not - but she does ! -
and thus he decides that if she really wants to get knocked out , he can and will accommodate her .
There are sleep - aid drugs - Tylenol PM , Ambien , codeine , morphine - that he could slip into her late - evening hot chocolate ( for she refuses to take anything drug - like , even aspirin ) .
He wonders , as he cuts and carves his cantaloupe , about perhaps - more - permanent solutions to her problem , and then catches himself .
Might her daily complaints about missed rest drive him to send her off to a more ... indefinite kind of slumber ?
Would it all , could it all , possibly be that tidy ?
His eyes widen , and a grin involuntarily overtakes his face .
What would be the formula - 20 Ambien , 30 or more ? -

2005-02-05,"Newly discovered tapes have revealed how the energy corporation Enron shut down at least one power plant on false pretences , deliberately aggravating California 's crippling 2001 blackouts with the aim of raising prices .
The tapes also show that Enron , whose bankruptcy three years ago was the biggest corporate scandal of recent times , manipulated energy markets in Canada and was planning to rig the Californian market even before deregulation in 1998 , for which the Texan corporation actively campaigned .
The most damning revelations concern Enron 's secret role in creating artificial power shortages in California , helping to trigger an energy crisis in 2000 and 2001 which cost residents billions of dollars in surcharges .
The crisis ultimately led to the ousting of the state 's Democratic governor , Gray Davis , and paved the way for rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his place .
Meanwhile , the shortages helped Enron to make $ 1.6bn ( £ 850 m ) .
This week , the federal energy regulatory commission recommended that the company return almost $ 1.7bn acquired from shady energy deals dating back to 1997 .
Enron 's former chief executive , Kenneth Lay , an enthusiastic financial backer and friend of President Bush ( to whom he was "" Kenny Boy "" ) , has been charged with fraud and is facing trial , along with two other company officials , in Houston in September .
Those charges mainly involve allegedly cooking Enron 's books to make the energy brokerage appear more profitable and boost its stock price .
The new evidence suggests the company may also have promoted deregulation so enthusiastically because it knew it could fix the system to its own advantage . ""
Enron , more than any company in California came in with consultants and presentations to all the legislators and policymakers to explain how deregulation would work , to explain how Enron was just trying to help , "" Eric Saltmarsh , executive director of California 's Electricity Oversight Board , told the Guardian .
"" It later turned out to be part of their scheme .
From the earliest days of deregulation , Enron was arguing for market structures that from the beginning it took advantage of . ""
The tapes came to light when a local authority in Washington state went to court over Enron 's bills and was permitted to seize internal records from a company warehouse .
On one tape , an Enron official named Bill tells an employee called Rich at a Las Vegas power plant to take the plant offline on a confected excuse .
The conversation took place on January 17 2001 , in the last days of the Clinton administration , as blackouts were rolling across California , cutting off electricity to more than one million people , and after the energy secretary , Bill Richardson , had ordered generators across the west to direct their output to the troubled state . ""
Ah , we want you guys to get a little creative , and come up with a reason to go down , "" Bill says on the tape .
"" Anything you want to do over there ?
Any cleaning , anything like that ? ""
"" OK , so we 're just comin ' down for some maintenance , like a forced outage type thing ? ""
Rich replies , according to transcripts published yesterday .
"" I think that 's a good plan , Rich , "" Bill says .
"" ... I knew I could count on you . ""
A spokeswoman for Enron , which is still going through bankruptcy proceedings , refused to comment ."
2005-02-15,"Three former NatWest bankers facing extradition to America on charges relating to the collapse of energy company Enron yesterday stepped up their efforts to persuade the Serious Fraud Office to launch an investigation into their alleged crimes .
In an unusual move , the three bankers have asked the high court for permission to seek a judicial review of the decision by Robert Wardle , head of the SFO , not to investigate allegations that they defrauded the high street bank .
David Bermingham , one of the three , said : "" We are asking for a review [ of the SFO 's decision ] .
I do n't think that 's ever been done before . ""
Mr Bermingham and his former colleagues Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are alleged to have conspired with Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former finance director , and his right - hand man , Michael Kopper , to defraud NatWest .
The three , who deny the charges , had expected to hear today whether the home secretary Charles Clarke would extradite them .
However , Mr Clarke , who inherited the case from his predecessor David Blunkett , has been granted extra time - until March 29 - to decide .
The decision had originally been expected by December 15 but was extended to February 15 after an application by the Home Office .
The case is regarded as a high profile test of the Extradition Act that became law last year and was intended to speed up cases against alleged terrorists .
Under the act the United States no longer has to set out its case before securing extradition , as it would have done in the past .
The case was passed to the home secretary last October by Bow Street magistrates court , which had concluded the three should go to Houston , Texas , to face trial despite their claim that their alleged crime took place in Britain and that they would not get a fair trial in Enron 's home town .
At the time the three said they feared they would have to sell their homes to pay the costs of a US trial and that they would be denied bail in Texas while they waited for the case to be heard .
Mr Bermingham yesterday quoted statistics that 97.5 % of people charged in federal cases enter into plea bargains .
He said this put pressure on defendants to cut a deal with prosecutors .
In addition , the costs of fighting a case were not refundable even if the defendant was cleared .
"" That 's what our government is doing to its citizens , "" Mr Bermingham said .
The SFO said yesterday it was inappropriate to comment .
It has said that it has not investigated the case because the US authorities have already been investigating for some time and that the alleged fraud was inspired in the US .
The judge who heard the Bow Street extradition case , Nicholas Evans , acknowledged that the three had said they wanted to be prosecuted in Britain to clear their names .
Mr Evans also said that if the SFO did begin an investigation now , by the time it came to court the three might be able to argue that the proceedings should be stayed because of the length of time it had taken to come to court .
It was not immediately clear yesterday whether the application by the three men to the high court would have any repercussions on the home secretary 's decision .
Campaign group Liberty wrote to Bow Street magistrates court in September , as the case began , arguing that the extradition of the three men could be a breach of their human rights .
It pointed out that the alleged crime took place in Britain and that the defendants and the bank that lost money are British ."

2005-03-06,"If the directors have big share options , the chief executive is lionised in the press and the corporate governance is praised , bail out now : these are among the biggest predictors of corporate fraud , according to an analysis of 25 recent scandals .
The chief executives of the fraud - hit companies - including WorldCom and Enron - had an average of eight times as many options as those at comparable companies , according to research by Kees Cools , professor of corporate governance in the Netherlands and an adviser to Boston Consulting .
These were worth an average of $ 172 million ( £ 91 m ) in 2000 .
These bosses were also promising to expand their companies much faster than rivals : the average growth target was 230 per cent over five years , compared with 40 per cent for their peer group .
Not surprisingly , analysts were also forecasting superior growth rates for the firms .
The chief executives were also hitting the headlines : Cools calculates that they were rated three times more favourably than the comparator group , based on the number of mentions in the Wall Street Journal , the Financial Times and Fortune magazine .
The study also found that many of the fraud victims had high standards of corporate governance - Enron was said to have one of the five best - governed boards in the US in 2000 , a year before it collapsed , while Xerox had a separate chairman and chief executive , unusual in a US company . '
Think of the problem as the "" dilemma of the successful CEO "" , ' said Cools . '
When a CEO is successful , he gets a great deal of money and becomes celebrated and famous .
Driven by this , he is tempted to set unrealistic targets .
Then the problems start ; the organisation starts cooking the books and engages in fraudulent practices . '
The granting of share option has fallen sharply in recent years , partly because of the public outcry over excessive rewards in the boom years - nine executives cashed in more than $ 100 m in 2001 - but also because investors no longer believe they are an effective way of stimulating management ."

David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby will launch a judicial review of a decision by the SFO not to prosecute them in Britain .
Because they will not be charged here , the three face automatic extradition to the United States under the terms of the Extradition Act 2003 .
Lord Justice Laws , giving the ruling of the court , said the case raised "" novel "" issues about which would be the proper forum for the trial .
He said that under the Extradition Act , the home secretary had no discretion but must order extradition if conditions laid down in the act are fulfilled .
Alun Jones QC , for the three , had argued that they were employed by Greenwich NatWest in London and the alleged offences involved UK citizens against a UK company .
There were no allegations that the three had caused losses to Enron .
Extradition would violate his clients ' family rights under the European convention .

2005-04-20,"The widow of a former Enron top executive who killed himself after the company fell apart last night challenged how her husband was portrayed in a new documentary .

Later , Fortune Magazine reporter Bethany McLean , co - author of the 2003 book that inspired the film
, says Baxter was a manic depressive . ""
He was never diagnosed with that illness , "" an emotional Carol Baxter told McLean and film director Alex Gibney after a two - hour screening before a packed house of ex - Enron employees .

He had resigned from Enron in May 2001 ; the energy giant collapsed in an accounting scandal in December 2001 .
Director Gibney told reporters Carol Baxter had also asked that the reference to her husband 's suicide be removed , but he decided to retain it because it was a "" fair reflection of the highs and the lows "" .
The documentary was shown at a cinema near the wealthy Houston , Texas , neighbourhood which is home to Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling .

The terms were far lower than the sentences being sought by federal prosecutors , who wanted Mr Bayly to serve 15 years .
US district judge Ewing Werlein rejected the harsher sentences , citing the 10-year plea deal arranged by Enron 's former finance chief Andrew Fastow as a benchmark .
The two men were convicted last November with three others .
Enron sold the barges to Merrill only to repurchase them using an off - the - books partnership .

2005-04-27,"The accounting profession was yesterday left counting the cost of its failure to prevent the financial scandals that took hold in the United States during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
Arthur Andersen , the firm crippled by its relationship to the worst recent perpetrator of financial wrongdoing , Enron , has agreed to pay $ 65 m ( £ 34 m ) to resolve a shareholder lawsuit stemming from its audit of WorldCom , which filed for the biggest bankruptcy in history in 2002 .
Deloitte Touche is meanwhile paying a $ 50 m fine to settle charges that it missed a massive fraud at the cable television company Adelphia Communications .
A federal judge in New York gave preliminary approval to the Andersen settlement , ending a broad class - action lawsuit brought by former WorldCom investors .
Wall Street banks have already agreed to pay about $ 6bn to settle claims that they failed to check the financial stability of the company properly before selling securities to investors .
WorldCom 's former board members are also paying almost $ 25 m out of their own pockets as part of a $ 61 m deal .
Former chief executive Bernard Ebbers was convicted of playing a central role in the $ 11bn fraud earlier this year .
He will be sentenced this summer and could face spending the rest of his life in prison .
Andersen closed its auditing practice after being convicted of obstruction of justice in 2002 during a federal investigation into what went wrong at Enron .
Since then , the company has in effect consisted of a small army of lawyers working to clean up outstanding litigation .
It still faces civil suits related to Enron and two other telecommunications firms which also had brushes with notoriety - Global Crossing and Qwest Communications .
The firm denied wrongdoing in the latest settlement and has maintained that it was duped by WorldCom .
The settlement interrupted a five - week - long trial .
Deloitte Touche is settling civil charges brought by the American financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission .

2005-04-27,"Robert Zoellick is the archetypal US government insider , a man with a brilliant technical mind but zero experience of any coalface or war front .
Sliding effortlessly between ivy league academia , the US treasury and corporate boardrooms ( including an advisory post with the scandalous Enron ) , his latest position is the number - two slot at the state department .
Yet this ultimate "" man of the suites "" did something earlier this month that put the prime minister and the foreign secretary to shame .
On their numerous visits to Iraq , neither has ever dared to go outside the heavily fortified green zones of Baghdad and Basra to see life as Iraqis have to live it .
They come home after photo opportunities , briefings and pep talks with British troops and claim to know what is going on in the country they invaded , when in fact they have seen almost nothing .
Zoellick , by contrast , on his first trip to Iraq , asked to see Falluja .
Remember Falluja ?
A city of some 300,000 , which was alleged to be the stronghold of armed resistance to the occupation .
Two US attempts were made to destroy this symbol of defiance last year .
The first , in April , fizzled out after Iraqi politicians , including many who supported the invasion of their country , condemned the use of air strikes to terrorise an entire city .
The Americans called off the attack , but not before hundreds of families had fled and more than 600 people had been killed .
Six months later the Americans tried again .
This time Washington 's allies had been talked to in advance .
Consistent US propaganda about the presence in Falluja of a top al - Qaida figure , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , was used to create a climate of acquiescence in the US - appointed Iraqi government .
Shia leaders were told that bringing Falluja under control was the only way to prevent a Sunni - inspired civil war .
Blair was invited to share responsibility by sending British troops to block escape routes from Falluja and prevent supplies entering once the siege began .
Warnings of the onslaught prompted the vast majority of Falluja 's 300,000 people to flee .
The city was then declared a free - fire zone on the grounds that the only people left behind must be "" terrorists "" .
Three weeks after the attack was launched last November , the Americans claimed victory .
They say they killed about 1,300 people ; one week into the siege , a BBC reporter put the unofficial death toll at 2,000 .
But details of what happened and who the dead were remain obscure .
Were many unarmed civilians , as Baghdad - based human rights groups report ?
Even if they were trying to defend their homes by fighting the Americans , does that make them "" terrorists "" ?
Journalists "" embedded "" with US forces filmed atrocities , including the killing of a wounded prisoner , but no reporter could get anything like a full picture .
Since the siege ended , tight US restric tions - as well as the danger of hostage - taking that prevents reporters from travelling in most parts of Iraq - have put the devastated city virtually off limits .
In this context Zoellick 's trip , which was covered by a small group of US journalists , was illuminating .
The deputy secretary of state had to travel to this "" liberated "" city in a Black Hawk helicopter flying low over palm trees to avoid being shot down .
He wore a flak jacket under his suit even though Falluja 's streets were largely deserted .
His convoy of eight armoured vehicles went "" so quickly past an open - air bakery reopened with a US - provided micro - loan that workers tossing dough could be glanced only in the blink of an eye , "" as the Washington Post reported . ""
Blasted husks of buildings still line block after block , "" the journalist added .
Meeting hand - picked Iraqis in a US base , Zoellick was bombarded with complaints about the pace of US reconstruction aid and frequent intimidation of citizens by American soldiers .
Although a state department factsheet claimed 95 % of residents had water in their homes , Falluja 's mayor said it was contaminated by sewage and unsafe .
Other glimpses of life in Falluja come from Dr Hafid al - Dulaimi , head of the city 's compensation commission , who reports that 36,000 homes were destroyed in the US onslaught , along with 8,400 shops .
Sixty nurseries and schools were ruined , along with 65 mosques and religious sanctuaries .
Daud Salman , an Iraqi journalist with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , on a visit to Falluja two weeks ago , found that only a quarter of the city 's residents had gone back .
Thousands remain in tents on the outskirts .
The Iraqi Red Crescent finds it hard to go in to help the sick because of the US cordon around the city .
Burhan Fasa'a , a cameraman for the Lebanese Broadcasting Company , reported during the siege that dead family members were buried in their gardens because people could not leave their homes .
Refugees told one of us that civilians carrying white flags were gunned down by American soldiers .
Corpses were tied to US tanks and paraded around like trophies .
Justin Alexander , a volunteer for Christian Peacemaker Teams , recently found hundreds living in tents in the grounds of their homes , or in a single patched - up room .
A strict system of identity cards blocks access to anyone whose papers give a birthplace outside Falluja , so long - term residents born elsewhere can not go home .
"" Fallujans feel the remnants of their city have been turned into a giant prison , "" he reports .
Many complain that soldiers of the Iraqi national guard , the fledgling new army , loot shops during the night - time curfew and detain people in order to take a bribe for their release .
They are suspected of being members of the Badr Brigade , a Shia militia that wants revenge against Sunnis .
One thing is certain : the attack on Falluja has done nothing to still the insurgency against the US - British occupation nor produced the death of al - Zarqawi - any more than the invasion of Afghanistan achieved the capture or death of Osama bin Laden .
Thousands of bereaved and homeless Falluja families have a new reason to hate the US and its allies .
At least Zoellick went to see .
He gave no hint of the impression that the trip left him with , but is too smart not to have understood something of the reality .
The lesson ought not to be lost on Blair and Straw .
Every time the prime minister claims it is time to "" move on "" from the issue of the war 's legality and rejoice at Iraq 's transformation since Saddam Hussein was toppled , the answer must be : "" Remember Falluja . ""
When the foreign secretary next visits Iraq , he should put on a flak jacket and tour the city that Britain had a share in destroying .
The government keeps hoping Iraq will go away as an election issue .
It stubbornly refuses to do so .
Voters are not only angry that the war was illegal , illegitimate and unnecessary .
The treatment inflicted on Iraqis since the invasion by the US and Britain is equally important .

2005-05-23,"The home secretary will today tell three former NatWest bankers whether he is prepared to sign off a court ruling to extradite them to the US under controversial new rules and at the request of Enron taskforce prosecutors .
Despite efforts to get their case heard in the UK , David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby were last night expecting Charles Clarke to back the court ruling .
Under the Extradition Act 2003 , which was introduced to fast - track terrorism cases , Mr Clarke has reduced powers to overrule court decisions .
The bankers are accused of conspiring with senior Enron executives , including convicted former finance director Andy Fastow , to embezzle $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) from a complex NatWest investment in one of Enron 's now notorious off - shore hedging structures .
Mr Bermingham last night said : "" It would take an act of considerable moral courage [ for the home secretary ] to rule in our favour ...
In the current political climate we do n't expect it . ""
The home secretary has requested further time from the courts to consider the case on three previous occasions .
No such application has been made in recent days and Mr Clarke has been ordered to deliver his decision on time to meet today 's deadline .
The three , who deny any wrongdoing , will appeal against the decision , should it go against them .
Such an appeal is expected to be heard jointly with a judicial review of the Serious Fraud Office 's decision not to investigate them in this country .
The Extradition Act has also attracted controversy because it does not require American authorities to present a prima facie case to British courts before extradition is granted .
Meanwhile the American government is continuing to delay the introduction of a reciprocal fast - track arrangement for British authorities seeking to extradite defendants based in the US ."
2005-05-24,"The home secretary has signed a court order after months of delay to extradite three former NatWest bankers to the US .
Charles Clarke 's endorsement of the extradition order , requested by the Enron task force , comes after intense criticism of the Extradition Act 2003 , rushed through parliament two years ago in the hope of expediting terrorist cases .
The home secretary now has limited powers of discretion , and his support for the court decision was widely expected .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - all of whom deny wrongdoing - will appeal .
Mr Bermingham said : "" We may well be breaking new ground in cloning and stem cell research , but it still takes a long time to grow a spine , and there 's not much chance of that happening in government at the moment .
"" The Extradition Act waives the requirement on US prosecutors to set out a prima facie case in Britain .
The US has not yet reciprocated this fast - track regime .

2005-05-26,"Thousands of former Enron workers have been awarded $ 85 m ( £ 46.6 m ) to replace lost pensions , overcoming the objections of the former chief executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling .
They argued the cash should have been used for their legal defence .
Houston judge Melinda Harmon approved the settlement between Enron 's insurers and about 20,000 former employees of the energy firm , which went bankrupt in late 2001 .
Workers at Enron who held their pensions in shares of the company were prevented from selling in the weeks ahead of the bankruptcy , and many were left with nothing .
Enron , once listed as the seventh biggest company in the United States , was found to have been routinely creating false revenues and hiding debts through a series of off - balance sheet entities .
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling face criminal trial next January on charges including conspiracy and fraud .
Both have denied any wrongdoing and argued that the funds used in the workers ' settlement came from Enron 's corporate insurance policies that were to be used to help pay their legal costs .
Mr Lay was famously a friend of the president , George Bush .
Lawyers for the workers had expressed concerns that a long court battle with the insurers would have used up the available cash .
They had argued that the workers were owed as much as $ 1.5bn . ""
The settlement at this point would save great expense and would give the plaintiffs hard cash , a bird in the hand , "" Judge Harmon wrote in her ruling .
Lynn Sarko , a lawyer for the former Enron workers , said the settlement money would be paid in proportion to the losses suffered from holding Enron stock in their pensions .
"" There will be people who get tens of thousands of dollars , "" he said .
About $ 69 m will reach the employees .
Lawyers fees had reached $ 17 m .
Enron 's former finance chief , Andrew Fastow , pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges last year .
He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for a 10-year prison sentence .
Mr Fastow was the master mind behind the complex accounting fraud that eventually led to Enron 's demise and marked the beginning of one of the most tumultuous periods in US corporate history .
The settlement resolves claims against Enron 's administrative committee , officers and directors , with the exception of Mr Lay and Mr Skilling .
The company emerged from bankruptcy at the end of last year .
Its remaining assets are in the process of being sold off to repay creditors ."
2005-05-31,"The United States supreme court yesterday overturned the 2002 obstruction of justice conviction of Arthur Andersen for shredding documents related to its audits of the infamous energy firm Enron .
The court ruled that the judge in the case had given "" flawed "" instructions to the jury .
The ruling though is a bitter victory for Andersen .
The original verdict devastated the accounting firm , which had been in business for 89 years and employed 85,000 worldwide .
The firm now employs only 200 in Chicago dealing with legal hangovers from the conviction .
Rusty Hardin , who served as Andersen 's lead lawyer during the original trial , told Bloomberg News that the ruling is "" a tremendous vindication "" for the firm and its employees . ""
They never intended to do anything wrong , "" he said .
"" They certainly never intended to obstruct justice . ""
Andersen was convicted in a Houston , Texas courtroom on a single count of corruptly persuading its employees to destroy documents in October and early November 2001 , to keep them from federal investigators .
As a result the company lost its licence to audit public companies .
Enron , once the seventh largest company in the US , had filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 as details began to emerge of widespread fraud aimed at hiding debts and inflating its profits .
The case was the first high - profile victory for the US justice department , which was struggling to clamp down on the apparent rampant fraud that emerged in corporate America in the wake of Enron 's collapse .
During the original six - week trial , government prosecutors had argued that Andersen had subverted the investigation by ordering staff to "" undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction "" .
Andersen had argued in its defence that it was simply fol lowing its standard policy on document retention and had no intention of thwarting the government investigation .
The supreme court ruled unanimously that the instructions given by the judge in the original case were too vague and too broad for jurors to properly arrive at a verdict .
Chief justice William Rehnquist , in a written opinion , said : "" The jury instructions here were flawed in important respects . ""
He said the jury had been told that even if Andersen had sincerely and honestly believed its conduct was lawful , it could still be convicted .
The instructions "" simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing , "" he said .
"" Indeed , it is striking how little culpability the instructions required . ""
Most of Andersen 's affiliates around the world merged with rivals among the other large accounting firms , now narrowed to four .
Andersen had no immediate comment on yesterday 's ruling .
Assistant attorney general John Richter said the justice department would consider whether to retry the case .
He said the ruling was disappointing . ""
The justice department 's decision to charge Arthur Andersen was based at the time on the determination that the substantial destruction of documents in anticipation of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission violated the law .
We remain convinced that even the most powerful corporations have the responsibility of adhering to the rule of law . """
2005-05-31,"One of Britain 's cleanest and most profitable power stations has been bought back from its American owners by Britain 's International Power ( IP ) and the Mitsui company of Japan .
The offer of £ 500 m for the gas - fired Saltend station near Hull was accepted yesterday by Calpine , of San José , California , which has been selling non - core assets to cut debts after a squeeze on credit following Enron 's collapse in 2001 .
The highly efficient generating complex at the big Saltend industrial complex on the Humber estuary was the last British power station in Calpine 's portfolio .
It has earned environmentalists ' praise , in contrast to the battleship - like line of coal - fired power stations along the M62 at Eggborough , Ferrybridge and Drax .
IP , formed from the demerger of National Power in 2001 , now has 37 sites in 17 countries .
It will take a 70 % stake in Saltend with the rest held by Mitsui , which last year partnered IP in buying the Welsh hydro power stations Dinorwig and Ffestiniog from the US firm Edison Mission Energy .
Of IP 's 10 European sites , Saltend 's 1,200MW capacity ranks it second in output .
Philip Cox , chief executive , said : "" Saltend is a modern , efficient plant , and will be earnings - enhancing in the first full year of ownership and immediately cash generative . ""
Saltend made £ 16 m profit last year and also attracted interest from Centrica , owners of British Gas .
Some 7 % of generating capacity and all its steam output is fed into BP Chemicals ' neighbouring factory .
The rest of the output feeds directly into the national grid .
The deal is seen as a sign of returning confidence in the power - generating industry , which has suffered from over - capacity problems ."
2005-06-02,"Donaldson to leave SEC US securities and exchange commission chairman William Donaldson said yesterday he will resign on June 30 , raising questions about whether President Bush will nominate a successor who will press forward with the agency 's tough post - Enron reforms .
In a two - and - a - half - year tenure as the nation 's top securities markets regulator , Mr Donaldson backed a strong enforcement crackdown .
Under his leadership , the SEC in 2003 and 2004 smashed records by imposing more than $ 6bn ( £ 3.3bn ) in fines and other payouts on securities law defendants .
"" I have been honoured to serve as chairman , "" Mr Donaldson said .
He is 74 today .

Clarke to rule on extradition case Charles Clarke , the Home Secretary , will have to rule on whether to extradite a Briton to the US on charges of price - fixing .
The US government wants to try Ian Norris , 62 , former chief executive of Morgan Crucible , for allegedly fixing prices for carbon goods with rivals in Europe and the US from 1989 to 2000 .
District Judge Nicholas Evans ruled yesterday at Bow Street magistrates court in London that it would not be "" unjust "" to send him to the US and that the alleged offences were extraditable .
He was freed on conditional bail .
Mr Norris faces seven counts of conspiracy to defraud and two counts of perverting the course of justice .

Existing customers will not be affected .
Ofcom released 3 m of the new numbers to telecoms companies .
Another 7 m 0203 numbers will be issued in the future .
Nearly 400,000 new London phone numbers are allocated every year , Ofcom said .
As well as the new 0203 prefix , telecoms companies will continue to issue 0207 and 0208 numbers until their allocation of these runs out .

2005-06-10,"Citigroup has agreed to pay $ 2bn ( £ 1.1bn ) to settle a lawsuit brought by investors in Enron , by far the largest payout stemming from the collapse of the energy firm amid a huge accounting fraud in 2001 .
Charles Prince , chief executive of Citigroup , said the settlement was helping to "" put a difficult chapter in our history behind us "" .
Citigroup has been at the centre of the some of the biggest financial scandals of the past few years which battered confidence in corporate America and Wall Street .
In May last year , the banking group paid almost $ 2.6bn to settle claims from investors burned by the bankruptcy of telecommunications firm WorldCom .
It paid $ 400 m , the highest amount of any bank , to settle a wide - ranging investigation into the conflicts of interest rife among research departments on Wall Street .
More recently , Citigroup lost its Japanese private - banking licence when local regulators accused the bank of failing to prevent fraud and money laundering .
In Britain , the bank is under investigation after traders caused havoc in the European government bond market by selling a huge tranche and then buying them back moments later when the price plummeted .
The US Federal Reserve has told Citigroup to delay any acquisition plans until it could show that it had put better internal controls in place .
Former Enron investors , led by the University of California , had accused Citigroup of helping the firm to hide billions of dollars in debts offshore , inflate earnings with sham trades and raise money even as the business was going bust .
Enron , once the seventh largest company in America , became a byword for corporate corruption after the debts and other financial shenanigans were exposed .
Former chief executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling face trial early next year .
Citigroup did not admit wrongdoing .
The cash from the settlement will be distributed to investors who bought equity and debt issued by Enron between September 1997 and December 2001 .
The settlement could put pressure on other banks implicated in the Enron scandal to reach a deal with the energy firm 's former shareholders .
So far only two other banks have settled ; Lehman Brothers has agreed to pay $ 222.5 m and Bank of America $ 69 m .
The suit also names JP Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch , Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland , Deutsche Bank , Credit Suisse First Boston and three Canadian banks .
William Lerach , the lawyer representing the former shareholders , said he was pleased with the settlement .
"" It 's particularly significant in that several large , similarly situated banks remain as defendants in the case , so this is a step down the road , not the last step . ""
The shareholders have settled with accounting firm Andersen Worldwide , Enron 's outside directors and Ken Harrison , former vice - chairman .
Since taking the chief executive job in 2003 , Mr Prince , a former lawyer , has publicly stated that the restoration of Citigroup 's reputation is a priority .
In February he announced measures to raise ethical standards .
They included ethics classes for employees , so called "" town hall "" meetings with top executives and the creation of an independent compliance division .
He ousted three senior executives related to the loss of the Japanese licence .
He said the bank would be "" better positioned to realise our goals "" by clearing away the legal issues hanging over it .
The banking group faces investigations and legal action related to its relationship with Parmalat , the Italian dairy company which collapsed and was dubbed Europe 's Enron .
Last month , two Citigroup units agreed to pay $ 208 m to settle fraud charges related to the bank 's Smith Barney mutual funds ."
2005-06-15,"The University of California today said it expected other large settlements after JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay $ 2.2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) to the university and other investors following the collapse of the energy firm Enron .
The agreement is the largest settlement deal in lawsuits against banks , advisers and Enron executives in connection with the energy trader 's 2001 bankruptcy .
Enron 's collapse triggered between $ 40bn and $ 45bn of market losses , and investors can also seek tens of billions of dollars more in damages under securities laws .
The settlement covers stock and bonds that were issued by Enron between September 9 1997 and December 2 2001 , according to the plaintiffs .
Enron 's collapse was the first major Wall Street scandal to emerge following the bursting of the dotcom bubble .
The failure of Enron and subsequently of WorldCom , the telecommunications giant , eventually led to a tightening of corporate governance under the Sarbanes - Oxley law .
JP Morgan , the No 3 US bank , announced its settlement just four days after Citigroup , America 's biggest bank , said it would pay $ 2bn to Enron investors who accused the banks of helping the company in a huge accounting fraud .
Both Citgroup and JP Morgan denied breaking any laws and said they wanted to put outstanding litigation behind them .
Led by the University of California , which lost $ 144.7 m of its investments in Enron , the lawsuit alleges that a number of banks and brokerages helped the company to continue to operate and raise money even as the company was unravelling .
Among the individuals named as defendants are the Enron founder , Kenneth Lay , former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling , and former top accountant Richard Causey .
All have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy in a trial scheduled to start next January .
The financial institutions allegedly helped Enron set up partnerships that the company used to improperly boost profits while moving billions of dollars of debt off its balance sheet .
The manoeuvre gave a misleading impression of Enron 's finances and artificially inflated its stock and bond prices , according to the lawsuit .
About 50,000 Enron stock and bond holders filed claims as part of the suit , which also names Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland , Credit Suisse First Boston , Merrill Lynch , Toronto Dominion Bank , Royal Bank of Canada and Deutsche Bank .
"" These were two giant steps on the road , but we have a long way to go before the end of the road , "" said William Lerach , the lawyer representing the University of California .
"" There will be other large settlements coming soon .
"" All the settlements must still be approved by a federal judge in Texas , who will determine a formula under which claimants will be paid .
No date for a hearing has been set , and investors might not see any funds for more than a year .
Mr Lerach said he expected the final figure of the settlements to exceed the $ 6.1bn paid by over a dozen Wall Street banks to settle allegations they failed to adequately examine WorldCom 's financial health when they sold securities in 2000 and 2001 ."
2005-06-16,"JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay $ 2.2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) to settle a class - action lawsuit related to the collapse of Enron , the latest in a series of huge payments aimed at closing the door on one of the most turbulent periods in Wall Street history .
The payment to former investors in Enron is the second settlement in less than a week .
On Friday , Citigroup said it would pay $ 2bn to settle the class - action suit accusing the banks of helping Enron to mislead investors about its financial strength .
About 50,000 former stock and bondholders are part of the suit .
Other firms including Bank of America and Lehman Brothers had earlier agreed to pay a combined $ 491.5 m .
The total looks likely to exceed the $ 6.1bn to settle shareholder lawsuits stemming from the crash in 2002 of the telecommunications firm WorldCom .
Enron , once the seventh - largest company in the United States , filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 after it emerged that it had been shifting billions of dollars in debt off the balance sheet and inflating earnings .
Former Enron chiefs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling face trial on fraud and conspiracy charges early next year .
They have pleaded not guilty .
William Lerach , the lawyer representing the lead plaintiff , the University of California , said of the latest settlements : "" These were two giant steps on the road but we have a long way to go before the end of the road .
There will be other large settlements coming soon .
The noose is tightening around the necks of the other defendants . ""
A number of banks remain as defendants in the case , including Merrill Lynch , Barclays , Credit Suisse First Boston , Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs .
A trial is scheduled to begin in October next year .
It also names individuals including former Enron executives .
The payouts still represent only a fraction of the losses suffered by investors when Enron imploded .
Mr Lerach argues that investors lost about $ 40bn in equity and $ 2.5bn in bond investments .
JP Morgan in March agreed to pay $ 2bn to settle the WorldCom suit .
In that instance , it left the settlement to the night before the trial was due to begin and ended up paying a higher amount than other banks , a decision that drew sharp criticism .
With Enron , the bank appeared to have learned its lesson and settled early to take advantage of incentives offered by the plaintiffs .
The firm did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement .
"" We are working hard to put the uncertainty of litigation risk behind us , "" the chief executive , William Harrison , said ."
2005-06-28,"How much longer can this farce carry on ?
Everywhere the chickens released by the government 's private finance initiative are not so much coming home to roost as crashing into the henhouse and sliding down the wall in a heap of blood and feathers .
The prediction made in 2002 by the Banker magazine - that "" eventually an Enron - style disaster will be rerun on a sovereign balance sheet "" - could be starting to materialise .
The private finance initiative ( PFI ) is the scheme allowing private corporations to build and run our public services and lease them back to the government .
The government says that this allows it to commission more schemes than it could with public funds , and offers better value for money .
And it does n't seem to matter how often the story falls apart .
Last week , after spending £ 14 m on lawyers , consultants , architects and miscellaneous money - wasting schemes , the NHS ditched its plans for a massive hospital in west London .
The projected cost of the Paddington health campus had risen from £ 360 m to £ 1.1bn , while the number of beds had fallen from 1,000 to 800 .
This is pretty normal for a PFI scheme ; in one case I 've studied , beds fell by 20 % , while costs rose by 1,100 % .
What makes this case unusual is that the project was dropped before the money was spent .
Last Wednesday , the government admitted that PFI projects for council house repairs had been a costly disaster .
This is hardly news to anyone who has watched this programme 's seven - year meltdown .
But despite the admission , the policy has not been officially scrapped ; councils are still told they will receive no new money for refurbishments unless they hand their houses to the private or voluntary sector .
On the same day , we discovered that the PFI computer system that is meant to keep a record of MOT test results for cars in the UK has been delayed by another year .
It was supposed to have been ready in May 2002 .
On June 17 , Scottish ministers decided it was cheaper to spend £ 25 m buying out the private financiers who built the Inverness airport terminal than to let them carry on .
In six years , the corporations had made £ 8.5 m on an investment of just £ 5.5 m .
This is a photocopy of the Skye bridge bail - out ; it was bought back by the Scottish executive last year for £ 27 m .
A bridge that should have cost £ 15 m has hit the public for £ 93.6 m .
Two days before the Inverness announcement , the Ministry of Defence quietly dropped a £ 1bn PFI scheme for military training .
It did n't disclose how much money it had spent developing it .
On June 14 , a leaked government report revealed that so many corners have been cut in the construction of a £ 47 m privately financed mental health unit in Leeds that it might have to be pulled down and rebuilt .
On June 10 , the National Audit Office published a report showing how the companies that had built the Norfolk and Norwich hospital had , as well as making stupendous profits , legally walked off with an additional payment of £ 73 m by exploiting the gap between the financial risk the government said they had taken on and the risk they had really shouldered .
It was n't as if the government did n't know this was coming : in June 2001 , a summary of leaked documents that showed this was going to happen was published in this column .
The Treasury sat back and watched .
On June 9 , the Health Service Journal published an extraordinary admission by a senior civil servant in the Department of Health .
PFI deals , Bob Ricketts revealed , were locking the NHS into 30-year contracts for services that might become useless in five .
"" I 've seen some awfully grand PFI schemes , "" he warned , "" that are starting to give us a real problem . ""
So what has the government learned from all this ?
Nothing .
It is ideologically committed to part - privatisation .
It wo n't disclose how much it is planning to spend on PFI schemes - a spokesperson at the Treasury says this is "" commercially confidential "" - but it is locked into £ 3.6bn of new deals this year .
According to a spokesman for the Department of Health : "" The government has no intention of abandoning PFI . ""
The heap of blood and feathers , though brain dead , keeps running .
So the government fobs us off with spin , misreporting and lies .
PFI , the Treasury tells us , "" is a small but important part of the government 's strategy for delivering high - quality public services "" .
Small ?
£ 42bn has been officially committed so far .
This , according to the public - spending specialist Professor Allyson Pollock , is an underestimate , covering only the 43 % of PFI contracts classified as "" off balance sheet "" .
Less true still is the Treasury 's assertion that there is "" no bias in favour of any particular procurement route "" .
As people working for NHS trusts and local authorities will testify , the government made it clear that for certain kinds of projects , public funds are not available .
But the biggest lie involves the government 's claims of value for money . ""
All PFI projects , "" the Treasury says , "" were delivered within public sector budgets ...
no construction cost overruns were borne by the public sector . ""
Well , it 's a bit like hospital waiting lists : it depends when you start counting .
The genius of PFI is that the overruns take place before the project begins .
There are three ways in which this happens .
The first is that the schemes are tailored to suit the private sector .
Where public money might have been used to renovate a hospital , PFI demands that it is pulled down and rebuilt .
But the two costs are not compared ; instead we are told we have a choice between rebuilding it with public funds or with private funds .
Then the next fiddle kicks in .
Civil servants , knowing that , as the former secretary of state for health announced , "" it 's PFI or bust "" , must mash the "" public sector comparator "" figure to show that PFI delivers best value for money .
As Jeremy Colman , at the time the UK 's assistant auditor - general , said : "" If the answer comes out wrong you do n't get your project .
So the answer does n't come out wrong very often .
"" The third fiddle is that the concept of "" risk transfer "" can be used to come up with any figure you want .
You simply announce that x million pounds of "" financial risk "" is being transferred by PFI to the private sector , and hey presto ,
it 's x million pounds more expensive to build the project with public money .
As the Norfolk and Norwich hospital fiasco shows , the risk costing bears no relation to any actual hazard taken on by the contractors .
Is it an exaggeration to say that we might be facing "" an Enron - style disaster "" in the public sector ?
I do n't know .
But there 's something familiar about Colman 's warning that the "" pseudo - scientific mumbo jumbo "" behind the private finance initiative 's financial modelling "" takes over from thinking .
It becomes so complicated that no one , not even the experts , understands what is going on "" .
And the record of the past three weeks is hardly reassuring . ·

Diamond geezers
Last week , the Natural History Museum opened its diamonds exhibition - sponsored by De Beers - with a bash thrown by Vanity Fair .
Around 50 supporters of Survival International , including actor Julie Christie , picketed the event .
Survival 's director , Stephen Corry , explained that the protest was prompted by the museum 's refusal to include in the exhibition the issue of the Bushmen of Botswana 's eviction from their land - which many believe was to make way for future diamond mining by De Beers .
"" When the Bushmen were evicted , they were told it was to make way for diamonds , "" Corry says .
"" How can their destruction be completely ignored by one of the world 's foremost museums without us thinking commercial sponsorship has taken precedence over objective education ? ""
Nicky Oppenheimer , chair of De Beers , says : "" This is simply , absolutely untrue . . .

2005-07-31,"When George Bush arrived for his first term in the White House the lights were going out in California .
The former Texas oilman , advised by his number two , a Texas oil industry veteran , formed an interim administration including an energy task force which included top people from the oil , gas and utility industries in Texas and beyond .
The aim of Bush and Dick Cheney was to hear from those people - including Earl Nye of TXU , the lone star state 's utility provider , and Kenneth Lay of Enron - about an overhaul of energy legislation and regulation in the US .
Then the attacks of 9/11 , the Iraq war and the collapse of Enron intervened .
Cheney , however , pressed ahead , producing a report by his energy task force in 2002 , and last week the US congress passed a 1,725-page bill addressing every conceivable aspect of energy supply and demand management .
The passing of the bill comes against a background just as unsettling as the California blackouts - conflict in the world 's key oil producing region , crude prices nudging $ 60 a barrel , concerns about security of US energy supplies and reliance on imports .
The Washington politics are not easy either .
As the bill has gone through its last stages in Congress - a conference of the House of Representatives and Senate which stitches together separate bills from each house - key proposals have been torn out and others added .
Environmentalists point out that most of substance that was rebuffed was in the Senate bill .
This was considered a greater attempt to grapple with issues of sustainability and climate change than the bill from the House , which is more dominated by Republicans .
Dr Ana Unruh - Cohen , of the Centre for American Progress , says : ' The House bill was not any good at all .
The Senate bill was better , but a lot has been taken out .
And we end up with a very bad bill . '
For example , while both bills proposed tax relief packages for energy producers - which must be debated later as part of budget negotiations - the House proposes $ 415 million out of $ 8 billion ( 5 per cent ) for renewable energy and energy efficiency , with the rest targeted at fossil fuel and nuclear production , while the Senate proposes $ 10bn of a $ 24bn package ( 45 per cent ) .
Democrats , such as Senate minority leader Harry Reid , point to the need for laws reducing dependence on energy imports , cutting oil consumption , measures to source 10 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2030 ( 20 years later than the UK 's target ) and for a passage in the bill to indicate climate change is taken seriously .
But last week 's process was dominated by the Republican chairmen of the energy committees in the House and the Senate , Representative Joe Barton from Texas , and Senator Pete Dominici of New Mexico , two men known for their strong and deep connections with the energy industry and , particularly in the former case , with the White House .
Barton received $ 224,398 from the oil and gas industry and $ 221,951 from electricity utilities , the two largest contributions to his 2004 House election campaign .
For Dominici , utilities and oil and gas were two and three , contributing $ 190,970 and $ 180,308 respectively .
The bill has united natural opponents in condemnation .
Even those close to , and with influence in , the White House are opposed .
Ben Lieberman of the conservative think - tank the Heritage Foundation says : ' There are three responses to this bill : it is good , let 's pass it , it is bad , let 's reject it , and it is a bad bill that could have been worse , so we should pass it and have another go . '
Lieberman says he falls into group three , but adds : ' The people in group one are the energy industry .
This is the "" no part of the energy industry gets left out "" bill . '
His objections arise from the principle that government should not interfere with the market , so he is against the $ 11bn package of tax breaks for industry that was agreed .
And , while , like the White House , he is in favour of more nuclear power stations , he is against subsidies for a new reactor in Idaho and against a $ 2bn package of risk insurance if problems emerge during the planning and construction of the first six new plants .
Lieberman argues against tax credits full stop , unlike environmentalists who say they should be used to ' incubate ' new technologies such as wind , solar and wave power .
So , for example , he is against tax breaks for low - emission ethanol - one of the few measures greeted with enthusiasm by environmentalists - for the same reasons he is against those for coal .
He says policymakers should not try to pick technological winners .
Environmental groups point out that the proportion renewables receive is less than a third ( although the combination of renewables , energy efficiency and development of alternative vehicles and fuels is half of the $ 11bn total ) .
Lieberman says : ' This is an energy bill .
If it is morphed into an environment bill , that will not be good . '
The Heritage Foundation has shared White House scepticism on climate - change science , which has kept America out of the Kyoto Protocol , though US involvement in last week 's Asia Pacific arrangements concedes the fact of climate change .
Lieberman adds that the bill should not be concerned with reducing US reliance on imports . '
I am not in favour of trying to reduce imports .
Nor am I in favour of forcing energy reductions on the American people .
That would hurt the consumer and the economy . '
It is worth noting that Heritage lists Exxon , Chevron Texaco and General Electric among its corporate donors .
From the opposite end of the spectrum , Karen Wayland , of the Natural Resources Defence Council , says : ' This is a huge failure .
It is not going to reduce import dependence , it is not going to reduce dependence on oil .
It also pumps billions of dollars of subsidy into oil , gas , coal and nuclear industries that are a waste of taxpayers money . '
Much discussion last week focused on issues affecting US companies - for example , measures to penalise industries in areas where ozone levels are low and relaxing clean - air regulations on companies seeking to open or reopen refineries .
Both went against industry .
Opposition comes not just on what is proposed , but what has been left out .
Neither of Reid 's priorities from the Senate bill - the 10 per cent renewables standard , nor the reduction of oil consumption by a million barrels a day by 2015 - survived .
Proposals to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks were also dismissed .
And environmentalists point out that although one of the most contentious issues - drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic , which is supported by the House , opposed by the Senate - is not included , because it could be reintroduced later in another measure , avoiding the risk of a filibuster in the upper house killing it .
Unruh - Cohen says : ' There are some positives , [ such as ] the tax incentives for renewables and efficiency , but these must survive another round of negotiation in the budget discussions .
The problem is a lot has fallen out . '
The question is "" Does this help on imports and the environment ? "" .
The answer is that although President Bush will say the passing of an energy bill is a great political achievement , it is a terrible result for the American people . '"
2005-08-03,"The largest settlement so far stemming from the collapse of Enron was announced last night when the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce agreed to pay former investors in the firm $ 2.4bn ( £ 1.35bn ) .
The settlement brings the total amount recovered from banks that advised the fraudulent energy business to $ 7bn .
William Lerach , the plaintiffs ' lead lawyer , said each new settlement put additional pressure on the remaining banks .
Of the 12 named in the lawsuit , five have so far agreed to settle instead of going to court .
Other banks named include Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch .
"" It sends a very serious message to those banks that have not yet settled that they better get about settling soon or they are going to pay more as time goes by , "" Mr Lerach said .
"" We 've said all along that those that settle earlier will do better . ""
JP Morgan Chase has paid the next highest amount , $ 2.2bn .
Citigroup has agreed to pay $ 2bn and Lehman Brothers and Bank of America have agreed much smaller amounts , totalling about $ 292 m .
CIBC did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement .
Enron went bankrupt in late 2001 after it emerged that the firm had been using off - balance sheet deals to hide billions of dollars in debt and at the same time to inflate its revenues and earnings .
In a December 2003 settlement of civil charges , the US financial regulator , the securities and exchange commission , accused CIBC of structuring 34 financings for Enron as "" asset sales "" when they were in fact loans , between June 1998 and October 2001 .
The SEC said that the transactions had enabled Enron to boost its earnings by more than $ 1bn and avoid the disclosure of more than $ 2.6bn in debt .
CIBC agreed to pay $ 80 m to settle the SEC charges .
The Toronto - based bank is the fifth largest in Canada .
The collapse of Enron , once the seventh biggest company in the US , began one of the most ignominious periods in Wall Street 's history as a tide of financial fraud was uncovered .
Enron investors lost billions .
Some 50,000 share and bondholders took part in the suit .
CIBC chief executive Gerry McCaughey said : "" By settling this case and maintaining what we believe are adequate reserves for the remaining Enron related legal issues , we can better focus our energies on our other priorities .
"" Enron 's ex - chief executives Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay are due to stand trial in January ."
2005-08-17,"JP Morgan Chase agreed yesterday to pay $ 1bn ( £ 550 m ) to settle claims brought against it by Enron , bringing the total cost of the Wall Street bank 's brush with the notorious energy firm to $ 3.2bn .
The latest settlement will put further pressure on those banks that Enron has an outstanding claim against , including Barclays .
Enron filed suit against 10 banks , accusing them of helping the energy company 's former management to commit fraud .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 amid allegations that it routinely hid debts and inflated revenues and earnings through a series of complex off - balance sheet deals .
Almost four years later , the scandal continues to cast a long shadow over both the finances and the reputation of Wall Street .
JP Morgan agreed to pay $ 350 m in cash and to forgo certain claims in Enron 's bankruptcy proceedings , bringing the settlement to about $ 1bn .
"" We have put behind us another significant piece of our Enron exposure , "" said the bank 's chief executive , William Harrison .
The firm agreed in June to pay $ 2.2bn to settle a class - action lawsuit filed by former investors in Enron .
The Toronto Dominion Bank also announced a settlement with Enron yesterday and said that it would pay $ 70 m to resolve the allegations that it helped the company commit fraud .
Enron has now recovered about $ 735 m in cash in what the company calls its "" mega - claims "" litigation .
In earlier settlements , Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to pay $ 41.8 m ; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will pay $ 250 m , and Royal Bank of Canada will pay $ 25 m . ""
These are tremendous results for creditors and they will certainly add to their distributions , "" said John Ray , Enron 's board chairman .
He said talks were continuing with the remaining five banks that had not settled and that the latest agreements "" give us momentum "" .
The company emerged from bankruptcy late last year and now exists to liquidate assets and pay debts .
Before its collapse , Enron was once the seventh - largest company in the United States .
The Enron scandal rewrote corporate law in the US and the government has worked aggressively to pursue its former executives .
Convictions have been secured against a handful of former Enron employees with the biggest catch yet being the former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , who is facing 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud .
The most eagerly anticipated trial - of the former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and the former chairman Ken Lay , who was once a friend of President George Bush - is scheduled to begin early next year .
The shareholder lawsuits against Enron 's former advisers have accused the banks of helping the energy firm to mask its true financial state and to continue selling equities and bonds to investors even as it headed towards bankruptcy .
In August , the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce agreed to pay investors $ 2.4bn , bringing the total amount recovered from banks on shareholders ' behalf to $ 7bn .
In the investor lawsuit , Citigroup has paid $ 2bn .
A number of banks holding out against the suit brought by Enron - Barclays , Credit Suisse First Boston , Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank - have also yet to settle the class - action suit that was brought by shareholders .
The other firm that has yet to settle the Enron suit is Citigroup , while Royal Bank of Scotland is among the banks that have not yet settled the shareholder lawsuit .
William Lerach , the lawyer representing the former Enron shareholders , has warned that the longer the banks hold out against reaching a settlement , the more they will be forced to pay eventually ."

2005-10-10,"Refco drama shows danger still present
By late afternoon yesterday no fewer than 18 "" red alerts "" had appeared on the Reuters news service concerning Refco , a New York - based futures brokerage .
Number two set the scene : "" Refco says discovered receivable owed to co by chairman - controlled entity for about $ 430 miln . ""
Number 18 , while trying to calm the situation , betrayed the full seriousness of this event : "" Refco says has ample liquidity to run its business - memo . ""
The name Refco will mean just about nothing to most people on the street in Lower Manhattan , never mind little ol' Britain .
Yet the company is one of the largest derivatives brokers in the world , trading everywhere from the commodities pits of Chicago to the foreign exchange hub of London .
Unimaginable amounts of money pass across the desks of its traders each day .
The simple fact is that if that supposedly calming memo attained by Reuters had said , instead , that Refco did not have ample liquidity to run its business then we would possibly be writing now about the biggest test to the world 's financial system since Long Term Capital Management went belly up , along with its Nobel laureates .
Instead , on the sketchy evidence so far , we may just be looking at something akin to a mini - Enron - a story of supersonic growth until the point when the gravity of accounting brought this piece of shining financial spacecraft back to earth .
With the markets having the experience of dealing with Enron under their belts , the Refco ramifications may be limited .
What it does do , of course , is remind us of the dangerous life modern finance now leads .
The simple notion of a chairman being able to secretly move $ 430 m ( if that is what has happened ) out of a publicly quoted business would have been unthinkable a decade or so ago .
Add to this the fact that Refco was only floated in August and it raises the question of whether Enron , WorldCom , Tyco and all the other American scandals of recent years had any cathartic effect at all .
No carriage clocks
If you have ever felt under pressure to work longer and harder , it 's nothing compared to what awaits you - and there are sound economic reasons for this .
The OECD , the west 's leading economic thinktank , says mandatory retirement at , say , 62 or 65 should be abolished .
In a 130-page report for a summit in Brussels next week , it warns that by 2050 in Europe there will be one inactive person for every worker and this will put enormous pressure on public finances and living standards .
Per capita growth in the OECD , it says , will fall by almost a third to 1.7 % a year over the next 30 years .
Greater immigration , French - style plans to encourage fertility or faster productivity growth are not enough , the OECD says .
What the developed world needs now is older workers - far more than the less than 60 % of the population aged 50 to 64 who are now employed .
So the longer we live , the longer we work .
Those blessed few whose increased longevity was entirely spent in contented retirement - now 18 years for men , compared with just 11 in 1970 , and 23 for women compared with less than 14 - are already a thing of the past .
Pension reform , the OECD argues , is also not enough .
The real requirement is for employers to put aside prejudices and adopt policies , including training , that provide flexible work patterns for the ever - youthful elderly .
They need to work , anyway , to pay for their longer lives and finance their retirement .
100 % say good deal Sir Bob Worcester , founder of opinion pollsters Mori , has been written off as yesterday 's man more times than he can probably remember .
The internet , and newcomers such as YouGov , would change the industry , they said .
YouGov has certainly done well - it reported 50 % growth in profits yesterday - but there is still clear blue water between the two organisations .
Mori is selling itself to the French for £ 88 m ; YouGov , by comparison , is worth a shade under £ 30 m .
In other words , Worcester , who has been selling down his stake gradually as Mori has brought in minority investors in recent years , can retire undefeated .
He should also allow himself a chuckle about the price he has achieved .
French pollsters Ipsos are paying almost 16 times operating profits and 45 % more than Mori 's value 19 months ago .
It looks as if Worcester has capitalised on the fact that this time Mori is giving up its last claim to independent ownership - the French are buying 100 % .
But when you are already 49%-owned by venture capitalists , these things are hardly black and white .
Neat negotiating , Sir Bob ."
2005-11-14,"Companies too preoccupied with governance issues and short - term performance are more likely to fail , a new report said today .
The report , compiled by Dr John Roberts at Cambridge University and consultant and former board director Don Young , says the pressure to focus on checks and controls to prevent fraud and malpractice has been heightened by recent US scandals at Enron and WorldCom .
But far greater losses arise through strategic mismanagement , the two authors warn .
They argue that the use of share options , which can boost executive pay by an enormous amount , reflects the damaging impact of the "" star executive "" culture that has developed in the last decade .
Chief executives are appointed to turn around a struggling company , but realising they have only a short time to make a success and make money , they demand big remuneration packages .
Thus although investors in recent years have complained loudly about fat cat pay , they themselves have contributed to a "" self - feeding that ensures pay keeps going up and up "" . ""
In some instances rewards can produce unintended and negative consequences .
High levels of executive pay , and in particular share options , can be seen to have created rather than merely aligned executive self - interest , "" Mr Roberts argues .
Written two years after the Higgs report , which recommended greater use of non - executives to avert Enron - type scandals in the UK , the report also cautions against an "" us and them "" situation in the boardroom , where non - executives take on "" a policing role "" to an excessive degree . ""
The board needs to be a unitary board and the danger is that of a potential schism , "" said Mr Roberts .
The authors categorise boards into "" investor - driven "" and "" strategy - led "" .
The former is highly reactive to shareholder pressure and casts non - executive directors in a policing role , while the latter operates as a unified team and deploys all its talents to develop the business . ""
Compliance , while necessary , is seldom sufficient to generate sustainable value , "" the report says .
"" Part of the reason why boards struggle to create value is that they are caught up with responding to relentless demands from investors . ""
The report also notes the key importance of the chairman in a company .
"" The high performance company needs a chairman who constantly questions whether the board is fit for the purpose , "" the report says .
Another important function for the chairman is to resist short - term pressures from the City . ""
Companies that complain that institutions are short - term are often those which have not presented a long - term strategy - and they are mirrored back to themselves .
That can be uncomfortable , "" one chairman said in the report .
The report cites the use of share options as an example of short - term pressure from investors who think that such schemes encourage better performance .
Almost 40 individuals were interviewed for the report , entitled The Role of the Board in Creating a High - Performing Business and launched jointly by the Corporate Research Forum ( CRF ) and the Performance and Reward Centre ( PARC ) ."
2005-11-16,"Three former NatWest bankers facing extradition to the US on fraud charges relating to an Enron subsidiary yesterday launched a judicial appeal to discover why they have not been investigated in Britain by the Serious Fraud Office .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are accused of conspiring with Enron executives , including convicted former finance director Andy Fastow , to embezzle $ 20 m ( £ 11 m ) from a complex NatWest investment in one of Enron 's off - shore hedging structures .
The bankers ' lawyers say the alleged fraud is said to have been perpetrated , principally in London , by UK citizens against a UK bank and should be investigated in the UK .
Counsel for the bankers Alun Jones QC told the high court : "" We say the conduct [ of the SFO ] demonstrates that there is an acute danger that financial cases obviously concerning the City of London and UK financial institutions are simply going to be sub - contracted out to the US to prosecute on the grounds they got there first . ""
NatWest has not issued a civil lawsuit to recover the funds nor has it pressed the SFO to prosecute .
Neither the SFO nor City regulator the Financial Services Authority are pursuing an investigation into the affair .
The bankers argue US prosecutors are pursuing them to further their case against Enron defendants .
The three are separately challenging the fairness of using fast - track extradition procedures designed for terrorist cases ."
2005-11-20,"Fraud is costing British business £ 72 billion a year , according to a report out this week .
Despite the warning of recent corporate scandals involving Enron , WorldCom , Parmalat and Refco , UK companies are still estimated to be losing 6 per cent of their annual revenue to fraud and corruption , says a study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and international lawyers Mishcon de Reya .
Gary Miller , a partner at Mishcon , says : ' You would have thought recent corporate collapses would have been a wake - up call for UK plc , but we found only half of the nation 's top 350 companies are taking extra measures , such as hiring financial investigators , even where there are signs of things going wrong . '
Fraud takes many forms but typically includes overstating profits , establishing complex accounting schemes that involve siphoning money into offshore accounts , money laundering and elaborate cover - ups by senior managers designed to protect dealers who trade in derivatives or equities .
Miller says : ' Companies are not paying enough attention to the human factor .
No matter how many boxes you tick , and no matter how sanguine a firm 's auditors , corrupt practices are overlooked because few people inside firms draw the right conclusions from individual behaviour .
For example , an executive is drinking a lot , is tetchy and , importantly , never takes holidays .
Taking time off for these people is risky because it often means handing his or her client business to colleagues who might blow the whistle . '
Last year alone , the serious fraud office investigated cases estimated to have cost UK companies £ 2bn .
But much fraud remains undetected .
Patrick Grayson , the corporate investigator who founded Kroll in London but now runs his own firm , GPW , says : ' Companies need to establish proper fraud protection plans - and be more rigorous in their approach . '
Miller says that groups need to make greater use of independent investigators .
Despite the gloomy findings of the report , mandates awarded to firms such as Control Risks , Kroll , and Risk Advisory Group have increased over the years .
But Miller says : ' Corporate Britain is failing to accurately evaluate and effectively manage the risk of fraud . '"
2005-11-27,"According to a study by the consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton , of all the value destroyed by the largest US companies between 1999 and 2003 ( including Enron , Tyco and friends ) , just 13 per cent was the result of failures of regulatory compliance or board oversight .
Eighty - seven per cent was caused by strategic or operational error .
In other words , investors ' health is , now as ever , at much greater threat from managerial cock - up than conspiracy .
As Bob Garratt , visiting professor at Cass Business School , puts it : ' Think of Marconi , Equitable Life and Morrisons -
the issue here is n't financial propriety , just basic competence . '
Yet , over recent years , the governance agenda has increasingly been driven by the former , impropriety .
Britain was the early leader in code - setting : starting with Cadbury in 1992 , through Hampel , Turnbull and finally Higgs in 2003 , a succession of reports and ensuing codes have elaborated and refined the apparatus of corporate control .
Other jurisdictions have enthusiastically followed : there are now 273 governance codes in place around the world , according to Garratt .
The current culmination of this trend is the US Sarbanes - Oxley Act , Sox for short , which takes a giant step further by making executives personally responsible for signing off the accounts , on pain of criminal sanction .
Now investors need to be protected from fraud , of course - but the effect is nullified if the cure exposes the patient to an even greater hazard .
The results of governance 's reverse Pareto effect ( spending 80 per cent of attention on the state of the stable - door lock and 20 per cent on whether a contented horse is still inside ) are now coming home to roost .
Interviewing chairmen , directors and other usual suspects for a new report , The Role of the Board in Creating a High - Performance Organisation , researchers John Roberts and Don Young found that the constant pressure on boards to spend more time on investor relations and meeting regulatory requirements was diverting attention from strategic and operational issues , thus perversely increasing the chances of corporate failure .
This likelihood was greater for those boards that they characterised as ' investor - driven ' - that is , highly reactive to often conflicting short - term shareholder pressures and in which non - executives were cast in a primarily policing , compliance role .
By contrast , ' strategy - led ' companies aim to resist short - term City pressures in favour of long - term improvement .
Their boards operate as a unified team , and non - execs are expected to be more than policemen , adding value by acting as a resource whose distinctive knowledge is available to the rest of the business .
Everyone agrees that the intentions behind the codes were good , but , especially in the US , regulation has gone ' miles too far , as even the Sox authors acknowledge ' , says Garratt .
The orgy of box - ticking has ' developed into a bonanza for the people who got us into this mess in the first place , who are gold - plating the already onerous requirements .
This is the theatre of the absurd . '
Not only is compliance expensive - £ 50 million and up for a UK firm , says Garratt - but it is also eroding the propensity to take risks .
Sarbanes - Oxley is a greater threat to capitalism than Karl Marx , he concludes .
The effects are less marked in the UK , where the codes explicitly mention the need for boards to contribute to strategic direction .
But the direction of travel is inexorably the same .
This is not surprising , since all contemporary corporate governance principles share the same theoretical underpinnings : the enormously influential agency theory .
In brief , agency theory suggests that the prime role of the board is to ensure that executive behaviour is aligned with the interests of shareholder - owners .
Otherwise , self interested managers will use their superior information to line their own pockets .
This is the justification for the separation of the chairman and CEO roles , huge senior executive salaries , the overriding requirement for non - exec independence , and much more .
Putting the theory into practice , however , has revealed at least three main faultlines .
First , prescriptions based on it do n't seem to work . '
Good ' governance according to the codes may or may not prevent fraud ( Enron ticked all the boxes at the time ) , but it does n't by itself stop catastrophic strategic mistakes ; nor is there any evidence that it improves performance .
As the report notes , governance is necessary but not sufficient to create high performance .
Second , the theory is viciously self - fufilling .
As even its main progenitor , Michael Jensen , now acknowledges , the share options that he advocated as the remedy for agency problems did n't so much align directors ' self - interest as create it .
They generated perverse incentives for fund managers and executives first to collude in hoisting share prices above their underlying value and then to use any means to keep them there ; Enron , again , and the internet bubble are the classic examples .
It encourages the idea that , opportunism and greed being the norm , anything that is n't explicitly banned must be OK ; this , in turn , justifies the need for even tighter controls .
Hence Sox .
Third , even the description of market actors as agents and principals collapses in today 's market conditions .
Where there is a reported 90 per cent churn of FTSE stockholdings annually , the idea of ownership and the primacy of shareholder rights , the fountainhead of agency theory , simply dissolves .
Paradoxically , if we want companies to create value rather than destroy it , boards may need to pay less rather than more attention to corporate governance as it has come to be understood .
To be clear , this is not a matter of ignoring investors , but of creating their own code and thereby snapping the cord that is too often used to yank investor - driven boards around between conflicting priorities .
Boards ' first responsibility is the long - term sustainability of the organisation , not complying with investor demands for certain kinds of board structure and composition .
Good governance is a means , not an end ; not just about seeking conspiracies but averting cock - ups , too . simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2005-11-28,"Three City bankers today launched a high court challenge against extradition to the US over fraud charges related to the Enron scandal .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , all former NatWest investor specialists , argue that trying them in the US would be unjust and in breach of their human rights .
The three - day London hearing is also expected to rule on a judicial review of the UK 's Serious Fraud Office decision not to investigate or try the men 's case in Britain .
The three are accused of conspiring with Enron executives , including the former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , over the sale of a subsidiary of NatWest bank that made them $ 7.3 m ( £ 4.2 m ) .
They deny the accusations .
They are alleged to have advised NatWest to sell a stake in an Enron business for less than it was worth in 2000 .
The three allegedly then left NatWest , bought a share of the company and sold it for a much higher profit .
Enron collapsed in 2001 after revealing it had inflated its profits and lied about debts .
The US government issued extradition requests for Mr Bermingham , Mr Mulgrew and Mr Darby in February 2004 .
Their lawyers argued that the alleged offences are not extradition offences , and that forcing them to stand trial in the US is unjust because of the length of time that has elapsed .
Trying them in the US would also be an abuse of their human rights as they could be separated from their families for up to two years while they wait to be tried , the lawyers said .
The judges have already reserved judgment on a claim by the three that the Serious Fraud Office , not the US , should investigate the case , and any trial should take place in Britain .
This is because the allegations against them in reality relate to a "" UK crime "" , involving no US victims , and any trial should take place here .
Last December , the SFO ruled last December not to launch a UK investigation , saying the decision could not violate the human rights of the three men .
Alun Jones QC , for the trio , said : "" We say the conduct of the defendants [ SFO ] demonstrates that there is an acute danger that financial cases obviously concerning the City of London and UK financial institutions are simply going to be sub - contracted out to the US to prosecute on the grounds that they got in first . ""
Hugo Keith , appearing for the attorney general , said that the SFO could be ordered to conduct an investigation only in exceptional circumstances .
He said the present case did not fall into that category .
Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Ouseley will pass judgement on both high court challenges at the same time ."
2005-12-29,"A key defendant in the Enron prosecution yesterday agreed a last - minute plea deal , potentially worsening the outlook for his former bosses Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling who are due to face criminal trial next month .
Richard Causey , the former chief accountant at the bankrupt energy group , pleaded guilty to a single charge of securities fraud in exchange for a seven - year sentence .
The plea deal could prove pivotal in the most eagerly anticipated trial to emerge from the corporate scandals that gripped Wall Street in 2002 .
Mr Causey had detailed knowledge of the financial workings at the company and will now help the prosecution to prepare its case against Mr Lay and Mr Skilling , former Enron chief executives .
It was not clear whether he would also take the witness stand .
Enron filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2001 amid allegations of accounting fraud .
The company allegedly hid debts and inflated revenues and profits through complex off - balance sheet deals .
The company , once the seventh largest in the US , has since become a byword for corporate chicanery .
Thousands of workers lost their jobs and investors lost billions of dollars .
There was also political fall - out .
Mr Lay had been a close supporter of the Bush administration , advising the government on energy policy , and was nicknamed "" Kenny boy "" by the president .
Mr Causey , 45 , originally pleaded not guilty when he was charged with 34 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and other offences in January 2004 .
His sentence could be reduced to five years depending on his level of cooperation .
Mr Causey had been due to go on trial alongside Mr Lay and Mr Skilling , who maintain their innocence , on January 17 .
Lawyers for Mr Lay and Mr Skilling are now expected to seek a delay in the trial of up to two months .
"" We have all been working closely together to present a single defence , so if Mr Causey is not with us , we will have to substantially regroup , "" Daniel Petrocelli , an attorney for Mr Skilling , told the Houston Chronicle .
The Enron scandal rewrote corporate law in the US and the government has worked aggressively to pursue the firm 's former executives .
Convictions have been secured against more than a dozen former Enron employees .
The biggest catch has been former finance chief Andrew Fastow , who is facing 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to two criminal charges in January 2004 .
Mr Causey 's testimony could prove crucial .
The defence will attempt to portray Mr Fastow , who redirected millions of dollars from Enron into his own bank account over a number of years , as an unreliable witness .
The trial of Mr Skilling and Mr Lay is expected to last up to six months .
Mr Causey joined Enron in 1991 from Arthur Andersen , the firm 's former accountants .
He was fired in February 2002 when an internal investigation concluded that he had failed to adequately protect Enron 's interests in deals with offshore firms run by Mr Fastow ."

It 's not that investment bankers have abruptly lost interest in naked women ; the chill sweeping over clubs seems to be the direct result of post - Enron reform .
In the same way that Wall Street must now comply with new restrictions on how financial information is given and received , so banks can no longer risk the potential for sexual discrimination claims that comes with visits to strip clubs .
They say it 's not the topless women that upset them , but the possibility that women in the office will find what co - workers are doing disrespectful ; that it contributes to an inappropriate , potentially discriminatory , atmosphere in the office ; and that it gives male executives an unfair advantage .
Two years ago , Allison Schieffelin brought a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley claiming she was denied promotion because she refused to go along with co - workers ' boorish antics .
Morgan denied wrongdoing but settled the case for $ 54 m .
Last year , Morgan fired four employees after they took some clients to Skin , a strip club in Arizona .
The company says the X - rated outing was in direct violation of Morgan 's non - discrimination policy , which bars such activities .
Then , last week , six senior female bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein accused the firm of discrimination .
The Internal Revenue Service has also been dragged into the business of bare breasts and steamy gyrations .
Last October , Robert McCormick , former chief executive of IT firm Savvis , was sued by American Express over a bill of $ 241,000 .
He had apparently spent the sum in one night at Scores , the best - known strip club in New York .
His epic night out raised the question of whether lap dances can be considered ' ordinary and necessary ' expenses .
To help convince the tax authorities , strip clubs now have backstage conference rooms should businessmen decide , mid - lap dance , to get down to some important business decisions .
But the crackdown is not universal : Goldman Sachs still lets executives use ' discretion ' when deciding whether to take a client to an ' adult entertainment establishment ' .
Perhaps not entirely coincidentally , Goldman was ranked number one in investment banking last year while Morgan is still suffering from the aftermath of last year 's boardroom turmoil ."
2006-01-26,"When former Enron chiefs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling walk into a Houston courtroom next week to face 42 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading , Charles Prestwood will be watching closely .
Mr Prestwood , 67 , who lives with his dog and two horses in nearby Conroe , Texas , worked for Houston Natural Gas , which became part of Enron in 1985 .
He put in 33 years of hard work for the two companies as a welder and machine operator .
When he retired in 2000 he had amassed $ 1.3 m ( £ 730,000 ) in life savings .
All of it was held in Enron stock .
The company management told him again and again that Enron shares were undervalued and the best place to park his money .
But even as they told him this , the business was secretly starting to crumble .
When it went bust , Mr Prestwood was left with less than $ 8,000 - about £ 4,500 .
"" I had great plans , "" he said this week .
"" I wanted to travel , to see part of this good old USA .
Now I ca n't even afford to cross the county line .
I do n't make plans now .
I do n't live , I barely exist .
"" It has been more than four years since Enron collapsed , after its campaign to conceal debts and produce fake earnings through false accounting finally fell apart .
The headlines have become less frequent , but Mr Prestwood and countless others like him who lost everything still live with the consequences .
Their anger is undimmed .
"" I want justice done , "" he said .
He intends to make the hour - long trip to the courthouse at least once during the trial .
"" I would love to look them in the eye .
I 'll go to my grave believing they are guilty . ""
The trial of Mr Lay and Mr Skilling , due to begin on Monday , provides a bookend to one of the most turbulent and sordid periods of American corporate history .
The bankruptcy of Enron in late 2001 marked the beginning of a string of scandals unlike anything seen before .
For a year corporate America was awash with lurid stories of fraud and corruption , of executives fooling ordinary investors to make millions of dollars for themselves at some of the most trusted companies in the United States .
The likes of WorldCom , Tyco , Adelphia , Qwest , Global Crossing and Martha Stewart grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons .
After the stock market party of the "" anything goes "" 1990s , this was one heck of a hangover .
Since then , government prosecutors have secured a string of high - profile convictions , including WorldCom 's Bernie Ebbers , Martha Stewart , and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco , a man whose taste for $ 6,000 shower curtains redefined extravagance .
Arthur Andersen , the accountants and consultancy that had been Enron 's auditor , went out of business after a government prosecution .
A number of Wall Street banks accused of being complicit in the Enron fraud have paid almost $ 7bn to settle shareholder lawsuits and hundreds of millions more in penalties .
Now , finally , the men who led Enron are to get their day of reckoning .
Daniel Petrocelli , Mr Skilling 's lawyer , recently told Fortune magazine that the trial was the "" most important , most high - profile , most must - win case that the US government has ever prosecuted . ""
Barefaced lies The government alleges that Mr Lay and Mr Skilling conspired with others to hide the company 's mounting difficulties through a mixture of complex financial dealings and barefaced lies .
Mr Skilling faces 35 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading .
Mr Lay faces seven counts of conspiracy and fraud .
The indictment contends that Mr Skilling , 52 , spearheaded the scheme .
He had worked at Enron since 1990 and was regarded as a fiercely sharp intellect .
He took over as chief executive in February 2001 only to resign abruptly that same August .
Mr Lay , 63 , who had founded the company , resumed the chief executive job after Mr Skilling 's departure .
The narrower charges accuse him of perpetuating the scam .
The government alleges they had good reason to conceal Enron 's true financial state and keep the share price high .
Between 1998 and 2001 , the years on which the trial will focus , Mr Skilling was paid $ 14 m in salary and gained $ 89 m from the sale of Enron stock he had been awarded .
Mr Lay was paid $ 19 m and banked more than $ 200 m from selling shares .
Both men have protested their innocence .
Mr Lay , the son of a Baptist minister , recently took to the stage of the Houston Forum , an elite venue in the city , to rail against his government persecutors .
He is the victim , he said , of "" political and public hysteria "" .
He told the audience : "" Instead of the normal practice of first determining whether a crime was committed and then determining who did it , [ government investigators ] seemed to be reversing the order by first identifying specific Enron executives as targets and then setting about to see if they could build a case to indict and convict them . ""
Lawyers for Mr Lay and Mr Skilling had pressed the judge to allow them to move the case outside Texas , arguing that there was still too much anger in Houston for them to receive a fair trial .
The defence is intending to argue that the men were following normal business practice and they have nothing to hide .
The best accountants and lawyers in the land signed off the company accounts .
They have maintained that any misdeeds were relatively minor ones and were carried out by Andrew Fastow , the former finance chief who has already pleaded guilty to fraud . ""
Contrary to popular belief today , "" Mr Lay told the assembled business leaders in Houston , "" I firmly believe that Enron was a great company . ""
At its peak Enron was the seventh largest company in the US , with a market value of about $ 70bn .
It was also one of the most admired .
Mr Lay , who was a friend of the Bush family , had widely been tipped to become energy secretary in the younger Bush administration .
The business was created through the merger of two companies in 1985 and was a supplier of natural gas .
In the 1990s it began its transformation into an energy trader , buying and selling gas and power .
At the peak of the stock market boom , it attempted to turn internet bandwidth into a commodity that could be traded - it was an empty shell of a business which Enron persuaded Wall Street was worth billions .
The company became a stock market darling , delivering earnings growth of between 15 % and 20 % each quarter .
The company 's stock soared .
Sham
The government alleges that the profits were a sham .
In many cases , the income it booked was from the sale of assets to so - called special purposes entities - off - balance - sheet companies controlled by Mr Fastow .
Those entities had borrowed money to buy the assets , and Enron was liable to repay the loans .
According to an independent report , Enron booked $ 352 m in profits in 2000 from the sale of assets to what were effectively its own subsidiaries .
Its debt that year was reported as $ 10bn when it should have been $ 22bn .
The first sign of trouble was Mr Skilling 's abrupt departure .
He had been showing signs of strain before he quit , famously calling an analyst who was querying Enron 's finances on a conference call an "" asshole "" .
He maintains that he left for personal reasons and had no idea about Enron 's impending collapse .
But questions were starting to be asked .
The company began to unravel .
In October 2001 , two months after Mr Skilling left , Enron spooked Wall Street by reporting $ 1bn in losses .
Its credit was downgraded to junk status and its shares nosedived .
On December 2 Enron filed for bankruptcy .
In the firm 's last hours , the management authorised the payment of $ 72 m in bonuses to senior staff .
Yet as late as September 26 , 2001 , Mr Lay had been telling staff : "" My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices . ""
The third quarter , he said , was "" looking great ; we 're going to hit our numbers "" .
He had recently sold $ 24 m of shares , the government claims .
Seven weeks after the bankruptcy , Cliff Baxter , who had been a vice - chairman at the energy firm , parked his car half a mile from home , put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger .
Mr Baxter was later praised as one of the few in Enron to have voiced concerns about its allegedly dubious accounting practices .
In a suicide note left for his wife , he said the "" pain is overwhelming "" .
Prosecutors have so far charged 34 people in connection with Enron 's downfall .
Sixteen have pleaded guilty to various crimes ; five have been convicted .
The trial will set former colleague against colleague .
Mr Fastow , who managed to skim $ 61 m from the sham transactions , is the main witness .
The prosecution 's case was significantly strengthened this month when a third defendant who was due to have stood alongside Mr Lay and Mr Skilling in court , Richard Causey , also agreed a plea deal .
The former chief accounting officer will spend between five and seven years in prison depending on how useful he is .
Whistleblower The government has listed 61 possible witnesses .
They also include Sherron Watkins , a whistleblower who worked in the finance department and raised her concerns with top managers months before the deceit became public .
The prosecution is expected to try to keep away from the more complex financial aspects of the case and focus on the more easily understood allegations that the two men lied to cover up Enron 's true financial state .
"" If the government can not explain what happened at Enron and why it was wrong in terms a jury of 12 lay persons can understand , then the government will likely fail to obtain convictions , "" said former federal prosecutor Ross Albert .
Experts are divided over whether anything of the magnitude of the fraud that began with Enron could happen again .
Nell Minnow , a corporate governance specialist at The Corporate Library , the independent researcher and investment rating agency , applauds the reforms that have been brought in as result of the scandals , including new enforcement powers for regulators , an accounting oversight board and rules on the independence of boards .
But she warns against complacency .
"" There will always be crooks .
They will have to be a little cleverer next time , but there will always be scandals .
That 's just a fact of life .
Someone said to me the other day that Enron was an indictment of the American character .
I thought , greed , lust , sloth
- that 's an indictment of the human character . ""
Irrational exuberance
On March 15 last year Bernard Ebbers lowered his head in a Manhattan courtroom and wept .
The former WorldCom chief was sentenced to 25 years in prison for orchestrating an $ 11bn fraud at the high - flying telecoms company .
Mr Ebbers , 63 , gave up most of his $ 45 m personal fortune to settle with investors and will probably spend the rest of his life in jail .
WorldCom remains the biggest failure in corporate history .
Dennis Kozlowski became a byword for corporate greed after the former Tyco chief and Mark Swartz , the chief financial officer , were accused of looting the company of $ 600 m .
A first trial heard of Mr Kozlowski 's excesses including a $ 2 m toga party partly billed to the company and the $ 11 m renovation of his New York apartment .
At a second trial last year the pair were sentenced to between eight and 25 years in prison .
Martha Stewart spent five months in prison and five in home confinement for lying to investigators over a suspicious share trade .
Ms Stewart sold $ 225,000 of shares in 2001 in drug company ImClone , run by her friend Sam Waksal , shortly before the firm announced bad news .
Mr Waksal admitted insider dealing and is serving seven years ; but Ms Stewart has had two new TV shows since emerging from prison .
John Rigas , who at Adelphia Communications ran what was the fifth - largest cable TV company in the US , and his son Timothy , finance chief , embezzled $ 1bn from the business .
The senior Mr Rigas , 80 , was sentenced to 15 years in prison last June .
His son got 20 years .
Prosecutors said the two had treated Adelphia like a "" private ATM "" .
The father spent $ 25 m of company money on a forest to preserve the view at his ranch .
Wall Street has paid dearly for its involvement in financial scandal .
JPMorgan Chase has paid $ 3.2bn to settle lawsuits related to its involvement with Enron .
The first banker to be criminally charged was Frank Quattrone , once the star technology analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston , who was sentenced to 18 months in 2004 for obstructing an investigation into the allocation of shares in stock offerings .
Two former Merrill Lynch bankers have been jailed over a bogus Enron deal .
There is fallout to come : Joseph Nacchio , who ran telecoms firm Qwest Communications , was indicted in December for insider trading , accused of illegally selling $ 101 m in shares .
Gary Winnick , founder of telecom firm Global Crossing , agreed to pay part of a $ 325 m settlement to investors when it crashed .
He has not been charged ."

Trial of Lay and Skilling begins in Houston , Texas ."
2006-01-30,"Former Enron chiefs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling appeared in court today as jury selection began ahead of their trial on dozens of charges of conspiracy and fraud .
US district judge Sim Lake said he hoped all 12 members of the jury and four reserves would be selected by the end of proceedings today so the long - awaited trial could start in full tomorrow .
The judge told potential jurors at the federal courthouse in Houston , Texas , that their job was not to seek vengeance against Mr Lay , the founder of the former giant energy firm , or Mr Skilling , its former CEO .
The two men are accused of lying to investors about the firm 's finances while enriching themselves by selling millions of dollars worth of stocks .
The implosion in 2001 of the firm - which was once the seventh largest company in the US - was one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent years .
In pre - trial statements , both Mr Lay and Mr Skilling denied any wrongdoing and claimed prosecutors were trying to criminalise normal corporate behaviour .
In today 's proceedings , the judge led the questioning of the potential jurors .
He has repeatedly rejected defence pleas to allow lawyers to question potential jurors individually in the early stages of selection , though they will be able to ask questions later .
Before proceedings began , Daniel Petrocelli , Mr Skilling 's lead trial lawyer , told reporters : "" We 're looking forward to it .
We 're ready . ""
Mr Skilling himself declined comment , as did Mr Lay , who simply said , "" Fine , how are you ? "" when a reporter asked how he felt .
Defence lawyers have raised questions about whether an impartial jury can be established in Houston , in a courthouse just a few blocks from the firm 's former headquarters .
Many people in the city were affected by the collapse , which caused thousands of job losses and wiped billions of dollars out of staff pension funds .
But Judge Lake rejected a bid by the defence last week to move the trial somewhere else .
When asked today if he believed a fair jury could be found in Houston , Mr Petrocelli said : "" I 'm sure hopeful that we can . ""
Mr Skilling , 52 , faces 31 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and deceiving auditors for allegedly lying about Enron 's financial strength .
Mr Lay , 63 , faces seven counts of fraud and conspiracy for perpetuating the alleged scheme after Mr Skilling resigned in August 2001 .
If convicted , each could face decades in prison and millions of dollars in fines .
Sixteen ex - Enron executives have pleaded guilty to crimes and are helping prosecutors .
The trial is expected to last four months ."
2006-01-31,"One of the most eagerly anticipated trials in the corporate world began yesterday in a drab federal courthouse in Houston , little more than a stone 's throw from the still - gleaming towers that once housed the heart of the Enron empire .
Four years after the energy group crashed into bankruptcy from a stock - market value of $ 68bn ( £ 39bn ) , the trial of its former chairman , Ken Lay , and his chief executive , Jeff Skilling , began with the slow process of jury selection .
The former bosses listened as Judge Sim Lake told the jury pool : "" This will be one of the most interesting and important cases ever tried . ""
The trial , he added , would take up to four months , and the evidence "" may be complicated at times "" .
Judge Lake stressed : "" We are not looking for people who want to right a wrong ... to punish anyone or seek vengeance . ""
Defence lawyers lost a pre - trial application to have the case moved from Houston , where , they argued , there is still raw anger at Enron .
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling have denied 42 charges relating to the alleged orchestration of a complex accounting scandal .
They are accused of drawing a veil over spiralling debts at America 's seventh largest company while publicly hyping the company 's performance and stock price .
The Justice Department 's Enron task force , led by Sean Berkowitz , is expected to open its case today .
More than 5,000 people were left jobless after the company collapsed , and thousands more former employees had their pension finances decimated .
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling are not expected to claim ignorance of the main fraud alleged .
Instead , they will insist there was nothing wrong at Enron apart from an isolated profit - skimming scam conducted by the finance director , Andy Fastow , and a few of his closest colleagues .
Fastow has pleaded guilty to limited fraud charges and agreed to testify against his former bosses in exchange for a maximum jail sentence of 10 years .
Fifteen other Enron executives have also struck plea - bargain deals .
Mr Skilling , a former McKinsey management consultant , has already given a bold defence of his record at Enron , suggesting that prosecutors are seeking to criminalise what was normal , if highly complex , business practice .
He has blamed the company 's collapse on a "" liquidity crisis "" precipitated by banks spooked at certain off - balance - sheet accounting treatments .
He has also insisted : "" We were doing great things ... creating markets where markets did n't exist . ""
Mr Lay has been more circumspect in his rebuttals , though his lawyers are expected to echo many of Mr Skilling 's claims that Enron has been misunderstood ."
2006-02-01,"The fraud case against the two top executives who oversaw the collapse of Enron , once America 's seventh largest company , is "" not about the accounting but about the lies "" , prosecutors told a Houston courtroom yesterday .
Opening the case against former chairman Ken Lay and former chief executive Jeff Skilling , John Hueston , of the US justice department 's Enron taskforce , promised a jury that during the four - month trial prosecutors would "" take you inside the doors of Enron to tell you what was really happening "" .
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling deny a total of 42 charges related to their alleged engineering of a widespread accounting conspiracy designed to hide $ 100 m ( £ 57 m ) losses from investors .
Meanwhile , between 1999 and 2001 , a soaring Enron stock price triggered pay deals worth $ 220 m for Mr Lay and $ 150 m for Mr Skilling .
Mr Hueston said that Mr Skilling , a former management consultant credited with transforming Enron from a gas pipeline operator into a complex energy trading business , resigned five years ago knowing he had left the business in financial turmoil and investors in the dark .
Within a month , he had sold more than half his Enron stock for $ 15 m .
The jury heard how Enron 's accountant , Sherron Watkins , warned about the firm 's shaky finances .
An internal memo from him said : "" I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals . ""
Despite these alarm bells , "" He [ Mr Lay ] steps up to the microphone and tells the investing public there are no problems at Enron , "" Mr Hueston said .
"" What he does not tell the investing public is that he is taking action to cover himself ... selling millions of dollars of stock . ""
The prosecutor pointed out : "" Enron stock seemed to defy gravity - up and up it went ...
It is nothing but good news and sunshine for investors - but the reality is a grim struggling business . ""
Among the main prosecution witnesses will be Andy Fastow , Enron 's former finance director , who has struck a plea - bargain deal with prosecutors , and will serve a reduced jail term in exchange for testifying against his former bosses .
Mr Hueston said Mr Skilling used to hide Enron losses by selling bad assets to a web of companies controlled by Mr Fastow so that they did not appear on Enron 's balance sheet .
An alleged handshake agreement between the two ensured Mr Fastow would never lose out .
Other tactics included illegal use of company reserves , and misleading treatments of losses from failing divisions .
"" I told you the United States would take you inside the doors of Enron to tell you what was really happening .
And to do that we must bring you some insiders , "" Mr Hueston said .
A total of 16 former Enron executives have struck plea - bargain deals .
Opening the case for the defence , Mr Skilling 's counsel , Dan Petrocelli , said the former Enron boss had known nothing about Mr Fastow 's off - balance sheet deals through which the finance director embezzled $ 25 m .
But he claimed : "" Andrew Fastow did n't bring Enron down . ""
Mr Petrocelli said the collapse of Enron had been a tragedy caused by "" a punishing drain on liquidity "" .
He continued : "" Remember , the government has accused [ Mr Skilling ] of spearheading a massive criminal conspiracy .
This man , never led any criminal conspiracy , he was n't part of any criminal conspiracy , he did n't know of any criminal conspiracy ...
It was n't because he was sitting up in a chair in an office while the conspiracy was swirling around him .
There was no conspiracy .
This is not a case of ' hear no evil , see no evil ' .
There was no evil . ""
Mike Ramsey , counsel for Mr Lay also attacked the prosecution 's case , describing it as "" simply well off base "" .
The indictment , he said , misinterpreted common accounting practice as "" secret side deals "" .
The trial continues ."
2006-02-02,"Former Enron chairman Ken Lay , who is facing a raft of fraud charges relating to one of America 's largest corporate collapses , asked one of his senior lieutenants if a Wall Street analyst could be excluded from meetings with management after the analyst asked difficult and probing questions , a court in Houston heard .
Mark Koenig , head of investor relations at Enron , said Mr Lay had become frustrated with John Olson , of Merrill Lynch .
Unlike almost all of his counterparts , Mr Olson considered the Houston - based energy trading business to be overvalued , despite its published earnings growth .
Mr Koenig , who has himself pleaded guilty to fraud charges as part of a plea bargain deal with prosecutors , recalled how , five years ago , Mr Olson stood out among analysts . ""
He was one of the few that went out on a limb in probing and had a negative opinion about the company . ""
After one meeting in February 2001 , Mr Koenig said : "" Mr Lay asked me if we even had to invite Mr Olson to future meetings ... and I told Mr Lay that we did . ""
He said Mr Olson was not frozen out from subsequent meetings , though former Enron chief executive Jeff Skilling also asked if invites could be stopped .
Mr Koenig also recalled Mr Skilling putting Enron 's case to Mr Olson "" forcefully "" at a reception .
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling deny charges related to the alleged spearheading of a complex accounting conspiracy designed to mask spiralling Enron losses from investors over two years while the two bosses won bonuses and sold stock .
Mr Olson was fired from Merrill Lynch , blaming his dismissal on influence brought to bear by Mr Lay .
At a later analyst conference call , tempers again rose , with Mr Skilling referring to one questioner as an "" asshole "" .
Mr Koenig , who is the first witness for the prosecution , also told the jury of the pressure he was under to manage analysts ' expectations of Enron 's future earnings per share .
The day before publishing earnings for the last three months of 1999 he became aware that average expectation had risen to 31 cents a share .
This was above what was to be the published 30 cents earnings figure , breaking the company 's prized record of meeting or beating Wall Street expectations .
Quick discussions with senior accountants and Mr Skilling followed and the published earnings figure was raised to 31 cents .
The decision , Mr Koenig said , was taken by Mr Skilling .
Mr Koenig said he had discussed analysts ' reaction with Mr Lay after the announcement had been published . ""
Mr Lay said when he went to bed we were at 30 cents and when he woke up we were at 31 cents . ""
Mr Lay had not been alarmed by the episode .
Mr Koenig said a similar fudge had been ordered by Mr Skilling the following year .
Mr Koenig was one of a circle of about eight executive vice presidents in close daily contact with either Mr Lay or Mr Skilling .
The trial continues ."
2006-02-21,"Three British bankers today face extradition to the US over fraud charges in connection with the Enron scandal after losing a high court battle .
The former NatWest executives David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby failed in their appeal to challenge the legality of the extradition orders made by a Bow Street district judge and confirmed by the home secretary , Charles Clarke .
Mr Bermingham said the British government had failed in its first duty , which he said was to protect its citizens , and the three were being used as "" political currency "" to "" curry favour "" with another government . ""
This case is going to have a profound impact , not just on us , but many , many people , some who are already in the system , "" he said .
He added : "" I can honestly say for the first time in my life today : I 'm ashamed to be British . ""
The case has sparked widespread anger among the British business community over the perceived unfairness of the government 's 2003 Extradition Act .
Mr Bermingham 's MP , Boris Johnson , said there was "" a serious imbalance and asymmetry "" in the UK 's extradition arrangements with the US .
He told BBC Radio 4 's World at One : "" They [ the US ] can , under the 2003 Extradition Act , Hoover over to America , as if by some electromagnetic power , people against whom they are not obliged to produce any prima facie evidence - whereas we have absolutely no such corresponding right to extradite to Britain suspects that we want to .

The three men , all British citizens , are accused of defrauding Greenwich NatWest , a subsidiary of British parent company NatWest , of some $ 7.3 m ( £ 4.2 m ) .
US prosecutors allege that the men advised NatWest in 2000 to sell part of an Enron business it owned for less than the stake it was worth .
They then left NatWest , bought into the firm themselves and sold it for a much higher price , pocketing about $ 2.7 m each in the process .
The deal was allegedly carried out with the help of top Enron executives , including the former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow .
Lawyers for the NatWest trio fought the extradition on two fronts .
They argued , first , that the Serious Fraud Office , not the US , should investigate the case and that any trial should take place in the UK .
Second , they said the offences were not extradition offences and that putting them on trial in the US would be unjust and incompatible with European and UK human rights law .
But Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Ouseley dismissed both challenges .
The employers ' organisation , the CBI , has accused the government and the US of abusing anti - terrorism legislation to extradite British executives to America .
Under the 2003 law , the US does not need to put a prima facie case before a judge in a British court , and is instead able to extradite suspects to America and keep them on remand before a trial .
By contrast , US citizens can not yet be extradited to Britain in a similar way .
The Home Office , however , pointed out that no one could be extradited unless sufficient information to justify arrest pending extradition was presented to a judge .
The US government argued that , even though a company incorporated in the UK was the target of the alleged illegal conduct , part of the fraud occurred in the US .
US lawyers described the alleged offence as a classic transnational crime , with some of the conduct occuring in the UK , some in the US and some in the Cayman Islands tax haven .
Mr Bermingham has said of today 's case : "" The stakes could not be higher .
If we lose , the Trojan horse will have been safely delivered into the City .
In matters of criminal justice , we would have become the 51st state of America . ""
Several other high - profile cases were awaiting today 's decision , although the case could yet go to the House of Lords .
Enron collapsed in 2001 after it emerged that it had inflated its profits and filed false accounts to hide debts .
Enron 's founder , Kenneth Lay , and the former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling are currently on trial in Houston , Texas , charged with several counts of fraud and conspiracy .
If convicted , they could spend the rest of their lives in jail ."
2006-02-21,"An extradition case over three British bankers in connection with the Enron scandal in the US today erupted into a full - scale political row .
The former NatWest executives David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , who face charges in the US , failed to overturn an order made under the controversial 2003 Extradition Act .
Mr Bermingham said the British government had failed in its first duty , which he said was to protect its citizens , and the three were being used as "" political currency "" to "" curry favour "" with another government . ""
This case is going to have a profound impact , not just on us , but many , many people , some who are already in the system , "" he said .
He added : "" I can honestly say for the first time in my life today : I 'm ashamed to be British . ""
Mr Bermingham 's MP , Boris Johnson , said there was "" a serious imbalance and asymmetry "" in the UK 's extradition arrangements with the US .
He told BBC Radio 4 's World at One : "" They [ the US ] can , under the 2003 Extradition Act , Hoover over to America , as if by some electromagnetic power , people against whom they are not obliged to produce any prima facie evidence - whereas we have absolutely no such corresponding right to extradite to Britain suspects that we want to . ""
Referring to Mr Bermingham , he said : "" Insofar as he has done anything , he did it in Britain against British interests - against the NatWest bank - and he is a UK citizen , so why are sending him over to America ? ""
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said the decision was "" nothing short of a disgrace "" and the trio were being traded like "" sacks of parrots "" .
The three men , all aged 43 , are now expected to ask the House of Lords , the highest court in the land , for a final ruling .
Their case is being seen as the first major test on whether those accused of white collar crime in the UK can lawfully be extradited to the US to face trial under new provisions of the Act , which the government largely justified on grounds of anti - terrorism .
Several other high - profile cases are awaiting the outcome .
The government denied there was a "" serious imbalance "" in its extradition arrangements with the US .
Home Office minister Andy Burnham claimed Mr Johnson was wrong to suggest people were "" simply plucked out or hoovered out of the country "" .
He said the 2003 act brought the relationship with the US into line with existing agreements with European countries . ""
The relationship we have now with the United States is now far more balanced .
Before it took much longer for us to extradite to the US than the other way , "" he told the BBC .
US prosecutors allege that the men advised NatWest in 2000 to sell part of an Enron business it owned for less than the stake it was worth .
They then left NatWest , bought into the firm themselves and sold it for a much higher price , pocketing about $ 2.7 m each in the process .
Today the high court dismissed the defence 's argument that the Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) , not the US , should investigate and that any trial should take place in the UK and secondly that putting them on trial in the US was unjust and incompatible with European and UK human rights law .
But an SFO spokesperson said : "" We welcome today 's judgement .
It is a complete and unambiguous rejection of the argument by the appellants that the SFO should open a criminal investigation in the UK into their involvement in the Enron case , which is subject to legal proceedings in the USA . ""
The three men were ordered to pay legal costs , including £ 44,000 to the US government .
Other costs have yet to be assessed .
The extradition order , confirmed by the home secretary , Charles Clarke , had caused widespread concern in parliament as well as anger among the British business community over the perceived unfairness of the 2003 act .
The employers ' organisation , the CBI , has accused the government and the US of abusing anti - terrorism legislation to extradite British executives to the US .
Under the 2003 law , the US does not need to put a prima facie case before a judge in a British court , and is instead able to extradite suspects to America and keep them on remand before a trial .

2006-02-22,"Three British bankers accused of conspiring with senior Enron executives in a $ 20 m ( £ 11.5 m ) profit skimming fraud have failed to overturn an extradition order made under Britain 's controversial extradition arrangements with the US .
Gary Mulgrew , Giles Darby and David Bermingham , formerly bankers at the investment arm of NatWest , immediately said they would seek to take their case to the House of Lords .
It is supported by campaign groups , including Liberty and Justice , fighting against fast - track extradition arrangements with the US .
New arrangements deny British - based defendants the opportunity to challenge evidence in a UK court .
The three British bankers had attempted to challenge the home secretary 's extradition order against them arguing the alleged offence - which they deny - should be a matter for the British justice system .
Related events largely took place in the UK , their lawyers argued , and allegedly defrauded NatWest , a British bank .
The bankers have been advised that , having contested extradition , they will face two years in a Texan jail preparing their case .
They believe they could face a sentence of 28 years and legal costs of $ 1.5 m each .
Outside court , Mr Bermingham said : "" We have effectively been subjected to a two - year sentence of imprisonment and bankruptcy even before we have had the chance to challenge the evidence against us ...
Regrettably it seems that this government is quite content to use its own citizens as political currency to curry favour with another government . ""
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti added : "" This is yet another supine step in the so - called special relationship .
The Extradition Act 2003 seems to allow people to be sent like sacks of carrots from where they live , where they have their support , their family , to the other side of the world without even the need for the barest minimum of a case to be shown here in the UK ...
This is all about politics , not about justice . ""
US prosecutors indicted the three on seven counts of wire fraud relating to a conspiracy they are said to have entered into with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and his righthand man Michael Kopper .
They allegedly duped NatWest , a partner on an Enron deal , of $ 20 m in 2000 , allegedly sharing proceeds of $ 7.3 m ( £ 4.2 m ) .
The bankers say they were whistleblowers who approached City regulators after the US securities and exchange commission began investigating the 2001 collapse of Enron , once America 's seventh largest company .
They maintain they were unwittingly involved in fraud orchestrated by Fastow and Kopper .
Since coming forward , evidence they provided was passed to the US authorities and was instrumental in securing guilty pleas from the two Enron executives .
This led Fastow and Kopper to sign cooperation deals promising to testify as prosecution witnesses in the trial of former Enron chairman Ken Lay and his chief executive Jeff Skilling .
In an unorthodox move , lawyers for the British bankers sought a judicial review of the decision by the Serious Fraud Office not to pursue a prosecution in Britain , suggesting the SFO had inappropriately yielded to its US counterpart .
Dismissing this argument , Lord Justice Laws yesterday told the high court in London that the activities alleged had "" substantial connections "" to the US . ""
The US dimension does not arise from the contingency that a telephone call or an email happened to be received in that jurisdiction .
It arises from the close and critical involvement "" of Fastow and Kopper .
The judge pointed out there was no legal grounds , under the current extradition arrangements , for the courts or the home secretary to rule on where a trial ought to take place .
Defending these arrangements , home office minister Andy Burnham told BBC Radio 4 's World
At One : "" There is no special relationship in place for the United States of America .
The Extradition Act 2003 put into place a relationship with the US broadly comparable to the one we have enjoyed with our European partners previously .
That relationship now is much more balanced than it was previously .
There is no exact reciprocity between any two legal systems .
Around the world countries operate different legal systems and the extradition law has to recognise that . """
2006-03-08,"Former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow yesterday offered potentially damaging testimony against his former boss , Jeffrey Skilling , as the trial of the energy firm 's two highest - ranking executives reached a critical stage .
He also broke down at one point while recounting the events that led to his wife , Lea , being sent to prison for a year .
Mr Fastow , 44 , was speaking publicly for the first time since pleading guilty to fraud charges in January 2004 , offering a rare first - hand glimpse of what went on behind closed doors at one of the most notorious corporate collapses in history .
He told jurors in a Houston court that Mr Skilling had urged him to "" get me as much of that juice as you can "" when he had proposed setting up a second secretive off - balance - sheet entity to help hide Enron 's debts and inflate profits .
Asked by the prosecution what that meant , Mr Fastow said : "" Juice the earnings so we could report the numbers we wanted to report . ""
Enron , once the United States ' seventh - largest firm , filed for bankruptcy in 2001 , leaving thousands out of work and investors facing billions of dollars of losses .
Mr Fastow is a key government witness against Mr Skilling and Kenneth Lay , who both held the chief executive job at Enron .
The pair face dozens of charges of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading in a trial that has already lasted five weeks .
Dressed in a grey suit , checked tie and white shirt , and speaking in a southern drawl punctured by a whistle on every "" s "" , Mr Fastow described how the company had set up its off - balance - sheet entities - subsidiary companies not shown on the balance sheet .
The first , called LJM1 , was set up in 1999 to help Enron "" solve a problem "" - that it was facing possible losses on a small investment .
Mr Fastow said he had broken the Enron code of conduct by running the off - balance - sheet partnerships and exposing himself to conflicts of interest .
But he said his dual role had been approved by the office of the chairman .
He detailed some of the deals made through LJM2 , a second vehicle .
In one case it bought a Polish power plant from Enron to allow it to book the profits in the final quarter of 1999 and meet its earnings targets .
He catalogued the deals in what he called a "" global galactic list "" , initialled by Enron 's chief accounting officer Richard Causey .
Mr Fastow said Mr Causey had shown the list to Mr Skilling .
Mr Causey has also pleaded guilty to fraud .
Mr Fastow recalled board meetings where the vehicles ' risks were discussed .
He said Mr Skilling was concerned how much about LJM2 should be disclosed to analysts "" because it would attract attention , and if dissected , people would see what the purpose of the partnership was , which was to mask potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of losses "" .
"" The biggest risk was the Wall Street Journal risk , "" he said .
"" The risk that it got picked up ...
It would look terrible and bring Enron under a lot of scrutiny . ""
The defence hopes to prove that any criminal activity at Enron was limited to Mr Fastow .
He has been labelled a liar and a thief by the defence .
It contends that Mr Fastow is pointing the finger at his former bosses in return for a relatively light sentence - he will serve 10 years .
Asked yesterday why he had pleaded guilty , he replied : "" I pleaded guilty because I am guilty and I felt the decision would be in the best interests of my family . ""
As part of its case the prosecution went on to relate how Mr Fastow used his family in the subterfuge , with cheques made out to his wife and son used to receive proceeds from one of his off - balance - sheet vehicles .
In one of these cases Mr Fastow said he received money but told his wife it was a gift and could be reported as such on their income tax return .
Lea Fastow was subsequently jailed for a year for filing a false return .
Mr Fastow became tearful and said : "" She did not conspire , I conspired . ""
The trial continues today ."
2006-03-09,"The disgraced former chief financial officer of Enron yesterday admitted to being "" extremely greedy "" , siphoning millions of dollars from the collapsed energy trader , but stressed there was a "" culture of corruption "" within the business .
In a cross - examination worthy of an American TV drama , Andrew Fastow , the prosecution 's star witness in the trial of Enron 's former bosses Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay , was attacked by their defence lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli .
After a repeated attack on Mr Fastow 's decision to involve his wife and young sons in his deception , Mr Petrocelli demanded "" You must be consumed with insatiable greed . ""
"" I believe I was extremely greedy , "" admitted the former finance chief .
"" I lost my moral compass and I have done terrible things that I very much regret . ""
"" When we get right down to it , "" countered Mr Petrocelli .
"" We are talking about greed , greed , greed , greed for money , that 's what drove you . ""
The defence team is hoping to single Mr Fastow out as the architect and chief mover of any criminal activity at Enron who is trying to ensnare other former executives in the web of side deals and complex off - balance sheet vehicles that he built in return for a lighter sentence .
Mr Petrocelli , who stalked up and down in front of the jury when he was not eyeballing his witness , began his cross - examination by picking up on a statement made by Mr Fastow during his testimony for the prosecution , that he had considered himself a "" hero "" to Enron because of the deals he did to keep potential losses off the company 's books and ensure it made its earnings forecasts .
"" Were you a hero for Enron when you stole from Enron ? "" he asked . ""
That 's what I believed I was being within the culture of corruption that Enron had , the culture that rewarded financial reporting as opposed to rewarding economic value , "" Mr Fastow replied .
"" I believed I was being a hero , I was not , it was not a good thing , that 's why I came here today . ""
Mr Petrocelli spent much of the morning session in court detailing the events that led to Mr Fastow 's decision to work with federal investigators , including his decision not testify at his own wife 's trial .
"" You could have volunteered to testify for her to exonerate her .
Correct ? ""
he asked .
"" Yes , "" came the weak reply from Mr Fastow , who looked shamefaced and often stared at the floor . ""
But you chose not to because it would incriminate you .
Correct ? "" .
Again Mr Fastow meekly admitted that was true .
His wife served a year in jail .
Mr Fastow , however , explained that "" my wife and I made a decision that was a very difficult decision that was in the best interests of our family . ""
Earlier in the day Mr Fastow concluded his testimony with details of the events in mid-2001 , when the company 's off - balance sheet vehicles were unravelling , massive potential write - downs in the value of its international businesses were looming , its businesses were underperforming and earnings were being propped up with the company 's own reserves .
He told the court that on August 20 a meeting of senior executives including then boss Kenneth Lay was told there was a "" pretty big hole "" in the company 's earnings .
The company , however , did not warn investors .
The trial continues ."
2006-03-10,"The former finance director of Enron , who built the complex financial vehicles that helped the failed energy group manipulate earnings , yesterday admitted he has no written evidence that ties former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling to his actions .
In his third day of testimony Andrew Fastow , the star witness in the prosecution of Mr Skilling and ex - chairman Kenneth Lay for conspiracy , came under sustained attack from the defence over his three - page "" Global Galactic list "" , a key piece of evidence against Mr Skilling .
The list , unveiled by the prosecution on Tuesday , details all the deals done by Mr Fastow 's vehicles and the illegal understandings that he claims he had with Mr Skilling about them .
The list , however , was never seen by Mr Skilling , only by former chief accounting officer Richard Causey who assured him that Mr Skilling was "" on board "" with it .
Mr Skilling 's lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , who continued his tactic of prowling the courtroom , pointed out that Mr Fastow could just have walked from his office , across the 50th floor of the Enron building , and popped into Mr Skilling 's office with the list and got him to initial it . ""
It never dawned on me that it would be necessary to do so , "" said Mr Fastow , who is due to serve 10 years for fraud after reaching a deal with Enron 's investigators .
Mr Petrocelli also asked Mr Fastow whether he had "" any piece of paper , any email or notes written on the back of a business card "" tying Mr Skilling to his deals .
Mr Fastow admitted he could not recall any such evidence .
Mr Petrocelli also homed in on the discovery of a copy of the Global Galactic list -
Mr Fastow maintains he destroyed the original in 2001 - in his family 's safe deposit box in April 2004 .
"" What 's going on - a document surfaces for the very first time in April 2004 at a time when it is really important to provide some ' ammo ' to the Enron Task Force , "" said Mr Petrocelli .
"" You think these three pages are a smoking gun . "" "" I thought they were important , "" Mr Fastow replied .
"" You think that these three pages of paper not only incriminate you , you think they incriminate Jeffrey Skilling , "" shot back Mr Petrocelli .
"" I know they incriminate me , "" admitted Mr Fastow . ""
And I believe they incriminate others . ""
The trial continues ."
2006-03-14,"A lawyer representing Kenneth Lay , former boss of Enron , yesterday sought to show that his client did not attempt to cover up the US energy firm 's financial position in the months up to its collapse .
Defence attorney Michael Ramsey made a robust attack on the integrity of the prosecution 's star witness , Andrew Fastow , formerly Enron 's chief financial officer .
Last week , Mr Fastow testified he had discussed Enron 's parlous financial position with Mr Lay on the day after the Enron chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , quit the business in August 2001 .
Mr Lay , however , went on to make several public statements trumpeting Enron 's rude health .
Mr Ramsey told the court Mr Fastow , enduring his fourth day on the stand , was unable to produce any evidence about what was said at this meeting ; having admitted to stealing millions of dollars from the firm , he was trying to convince the jury of a "" vast , overarching conspiracy at Enron that everyone was involved in "" .
"" I have not characterised anything as a conspiracy here , "" Mr Fastow responded .
In the morning , Mr Skilling 's lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , concluded his crossexamination of Mr Fastow , returning to the subject of the handwritten "" Global Galactic "" list of alleged understandings between Mr Skilling and Mr Fastow , and the fortuitous appearance of a copy of the list in 2004 , three years after Mr Fastow destroyed the original . ""
Is there some possibility , sir , that later on , having perhaps lost or tossed out the original , you went back and recreated or reconstructed the list ?
"" he asked . ""
No , sir , ""
Mr Fastow replied .
The trial continues ."
2006-03-16,"The woman who blew the whistle on the accounting scandal that brought down Enron spoke yesterday about how she tried to get out of the firm when she discovered the extent of its dodgy accounting .
Sherron Watkins , who has since written a book and gives lectures , also told the trial of the former Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling that she was shocked when she discovered two years after the collapse that managers had considered sacking her when she spoke up .
Ms Watkins is famous for writing an anonymous memo to Mr Lay , which was read out in court yesterday , warning : "" I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals . ""
From June 2001 , Ms Watkins , who joined Enron in 1993 , worked for Andrew Fastow , the disgraced former chief financial officer .
She soon discovered a series of off - balance sheet transactions so "" the math on the spreadsheet just did not add up "" .
She said she found not just "" aggressive accounting but possibly fraudulent accounting ...
I wanted to get out .
"" She was spurred into action by the departure of Mr Skilling from Enron in August 2001 . ""
He 's a smart man , "" she said yesterday .
"" He knows it 's bad . ""
His departure "" confirmed to me that what I was looking at ... was the tip of the iceberg "" . ""
When the captain of the ship has abandoned the ship then it was even more problematic than I had thought , "" she said .
And did she believe that Mr Lay knew of these problems , asked the prosecutor , John Hueston .
"" I do n't think he knew that we 'd got a hole in the ship
and we were going to sink , "" she replied .
In contrast with the prosecution 's other star witness , Mr Fastow , Ms Watkins held her head high , frequently addressing the predominantly female jury directly .
In August 2001 she sent an anonymous memo but admitted writing it after Mr Lay told staff that they could talk to him about any problems .
She said she wanted to warn him of Enron 's "" impending doom "" .
Mr Lay went through the memos with her .
She said : "" He winced when he ran across one line . ""
This was in a memo in which she quoted a manager in Enron 's main investment group saying : "" I know it would be devastating ...
but I wish we 'd get caught .
We 're such a crooked company .
"" On the threat of being sacked , Ms Watkins said : "" I went to Ken Lay specifically because I did not think he would try to fire or dump me on the street .
And that memo is basically saying , ' what is the risk of us dumping her on the street ? ' .
"" The case continues ."
2006-04-10,"Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's former chief executive , yesterday made an impassioned vow to fight the criminal fraud charges levelled against him "" until the day I die "" .
Mr Skilling , 52 , took the witness stand for the first time at a court in Houston , Texas , to defend himself in one of the most infamous cases of corporate chicanery ever to come to light .
It has taken United States prosecutors more than four years to reach this stage .
According to reporters in the courtroom , Mr Skilling looked visibly anxious , but defiant as he spoke directly to the jury .
"" I 'm absolutely innocent , "" he said .
"" It 's not in my nature not to fight something like this .
The charges against me are wrong .
I will fight those charges until the day I die . ""
In a sideswipe at some of his former colleagues , he said he had "" never ... not once considered making a deal with prosecutors the way more than a dozen other Enron executives did "" .
The case against him and his co - defendant , Kenneth Lay , was made significantly more onerous when the former top accountant at Enron , Richard Causey , who had been due to stand alongside the pair , agreed a late - stage plea deal .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 after a campaign to conceal debts and produce fake earnings through false accounting finally fell apart .
Mr Skilling faces 28 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading .
Mr Lay , 63 , who also served as chief executive , faces six counts of conspiracy and fraud .
He is expected to take the stand later in the trial .
The government contends that Mr Skilling spearheaded the scheme .
He had worked at Enron since 1990 and took over as chief executive in February 2001 only to resign abruptly that same August .
Mr Skilling attempted to explain his sudden departure , interpreted by prosecutors as a sign of guilt .
He said he was emotionally exhausted and had become "" obsessed with Enron "" to the detriment of his family . ""
Every day was intense and I had not spent the time I should have with my family . ""
He claimed to have been unsettled by the company 's mounting critics and Enron 's falling share price .
He recalled an extraordinary outburst during a conference call , in which he called an analyst an "" asshole "" .
"" The short - sellers were all over the stock and I was having a hard time explaining why Enron was a strong company , "" he told the court .
"" I had lost credibility with the Street , meaning Wall Street .
The now infamous asshole quote , sorry , was used as an example of , I do n't know , arrogance or something .
It was n't meant that way .
I was looking at the business in dark - coloured glasses in some ways .
I felt my leaving would re - establish credibility for the company ...
The reason I left was because I was ready to go ...
my head was n't in it anymore . ""
Andrew Fastow , the former Enron finance chief , has pleaded guilty to fraud charges .
Mr Skilling and Mr Lay have blamed Mr Fastow for the misdeeds that tilted Enron into bankruptcy and argued that he turned on them only to secure a lighter sentence for himself .
"" It 's daunting , but it 's critical to get the story out , "" Mr Skilling said .
Answering questions from his lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , he admitted to feeling anxious . ""
In some ways my life is on the line , so I 'm a little nervous , "" he said .
The cross - examination is not expected until mid - week or even later ."
2006-04-11,"The former chief executive of Enron became so wealthy at the height of the energy company 's fortunes that he surrendered nearly $ 50 m in pay to show he had shareholders ' interests at heart .
Jeffrey Skilling told a jury yesterday that he accepted just $ 21.5 m out of his contractual entitlement of $ 70 m in a share "" cash - out "" shortly after he was appointed president of Enron in 1999 .
He said it was to make clear that personal enrichment was "" secondary "" in his priorities to expanding the business , although he did indulge in a car number plate reading WLEC - for world 's largest energy company .
"" I wanted the board of directors to have a very clear understanding that my interest was Enron Corporation .
It was not personal financial gain , "" he said .
Mr Skilling faces 28 charges of fraud , conspiracy and insider trading over the collapse of Enron in 2001 , which left 5,000 people jobless and became one of America 's biggest accounting scandals .
His former colleague , Ken Lay , faces six charges .
In his second day on the stand , Mr Skilling , 52 , presented himself as a hands - off director who relied on advisers and devoted little time to detail .
"" I was good at directing the company - the strategy of the company , "" he said .
"" I was not so good at day - to - day administration , "" he said .
Under questioning from his defence counsel Dan Petrocelli , Mr Skilling said he did not always thoroughly read filings to the Wall Street regulator , which he is accused of falsifying .
On one occasion in which he is accused of ordering earnings to be manipulated , he said he was on holiday in Africa when the data was prepared .
In a self - assured performance , Mr Petrocelli asked : "" You 're a smart guy , are n't you . ""
Mr Skilling replied : "" Yes . ""
Mr Petrocelli continued : "" Are you smart enough to mastermind this type of conspiracy and pull it off for years without getting caught ? ""
Mr Skilling answered : "" I do n't think so . ""
"" Did you have a lust for money ? ""
"" No , "" replied Mr Skilling .
"" Are you consumed by greed ? ""
"" I 'm not that kind of ... no . ""
The exchange was watched from the packed public gallery by Mr Skilling 's wife and sons , aged 15 and 19 , who had heard him recount on Monday that Enron 's collapse led him to alcohol and depression ."
2006-04-12,"The former Enron chief Jeffrey Skilling has denied all knowledge of secret "" side deals "" that accelerated the energy trading company 's freefall into bankruptcy .
In his third day of testimony to a Houston court , Mr Skilling repeatedly insisted he was unaware of any difficulties with the company 's controversial accounting structure .
He said when he stepped down from the company in August 2001 he knew of nothing wrong .
Just four months later , Enron declared itself to be bust .
Recounting his departure as chief executive , he said that when he initially told Enron 's chairman , Ken Lay , that he wanted to resign he agreed to "" sleep on it "" over a weekend .
The following Monday , he said Mr Lay approached him and told him he had "" spoken to a number of directors and the first question they 'd asked was ' does he know something we do n't know ? ' ""
Mr Skilling said the question made him concerned about a series of deals known as the Raptor transactions , which were intended to hedge against trading losses - so he checked and there was no liability .
He testified that he was unaware that the Raptor deals included secret side transactions involving Enron 's then chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , until newspapers published a "" whistle - blower "" memo in 2002 written by an Enron accountant , Sherron Watkins .
"" I was aware of no illegal activity occurring at Enron , "" said Mr Skilling , who is fighting 28 charges of fraud , conspiracy and insider trading .
He added that all of Enron 's controversial off - balance sheet ventures had been signed off by Arthur Andersen and by the company 's audit committee , which included the former energy minister Lord Wakeham .
Defence counsel Daniel Petrocelli asked him what he would have done if he had uncovered any illegality .
"" I would have called the FBI , "" replied Mr Skilling adding , to laughter , "" I might have a little hesitation now about doing that .
"" The case has continued with a detailed forensic analysis of all of the transactions involved in charges facing Mr Skilling and Mr Lay .
Mr Skilling took the jury through Enron 's trading activities by drawing diagrams on a white board .
Several jury members had difficulty following the details - one rested her head for long periods on her chest and others studied the ceiling in the courtroom ."
2006-04-13,"Enron 's former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , has accused a Wall Street analyst of being part of a short - selling ring , which spread rumours and disinformation to talk down the energy company 's stock .
In an infamous conference call before Enron went bust in 2001 , Mr Skilling lost patience with questioning about Enron 's balance sheet and called Richard Grubman , a Highfields Capital analyst , an "" asshole "" .
Mr Skilling told the court yesterday that Mr Grubman had used a "" typical short - seller trick "" to make a quick buck .
"" It 's absolutely standard practice .
You take a short position in a stock , then send someone to an analyst conference to ask a question in a way which suggests we 're hiding something , "" said Mr Skilling .
The ex - Enron boss is fighting 28 counts of fraud , conspiracy and insider trading over the collapse of Enron , which was once the seventh - largest firm in the US , with a value of $ 70bn ( £ 40bn ) .
Enron 's former chairman , Ken Lay , faces six charges .
Mr Skilling said that in the months before Enron 's implosion , there were people "" working together ... as a group to purposely attack the stock "" .
He had lost his temper when Mr Grubman asked why Enron had not provided a balance sheet with its quarterly income statement in April 2001 - eight months before it went bust . ""
If somebody wants to take a short position , let them , "" said Mr Skilling yesterday .
"" But if they go out and start spreading rumours to make money , that 's inappropriate .
He was trying to spread disinformation and insinuate things . ""
Mr Skilling has spent a week being questioned by his lawyer , Dan Petrocelli .
He will be cross - examined on Monday by prosecutors , who are likely to try to provoke his notoriously volatile temper .
The case continues ."
2006-04-13,"Alan Greenspan , the former head of the US Federal Reserve , is having second thoughts about the Sarbanes - Oxley law , which was introduced after the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
Sarbanes - Oxley , passed in 2002 , gave company executives , boards and auditors new obligations , particularly on what they were required to disclose .
It aimed to make businesses more accountable and transparent , and to restore investor confidence .
American executives have been grumbling about Sarbanes - Oxley for some time , complaining of the extra time and effort needed to meet its compliance requirements .
Now they have an important ally in the former Fed chairman .
Mr Greenspan was initially in favour of Sarbanes - Oxley , but at a conference in Seoul organised by the Financial Times , he said he was "" alarmed "" that companies were choosing to list themselves in London rather than New York to avoid the tougher regime .
The figures do tell the story .
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers , more companies decided to float in Europe than in the US for the first time last year .
The money raised from initial public offerings in Europe almost doubled to € 50bn ( £ 34.5bn ) in 2005 , while US listings fell to just € 27bn , according to PwC. "" The standards of documentation and process under Sarbanes - Oxley are more intensive and onerous , "" said Richard Weaver , a partner at PwC.
"" But Sarbanes - Oxley is not the only factor .
Once companies had established a route to other markets ( for flotations ) others followed . ""
Now even smaller US companies are making their way to European bourses , such as London 's Alternative Investment Market .
The increasing popularity of Europe is behind much of the intense takeover interest in the London Stock Exchange .
The LSE has been wooed by some of its European rivals , Euronext and Deutsche Börse ; the Australian investment bank Macquarie ; and Nasdaq in the US .
In the latest twist to the saga , Nasdaq , where Microsoft is listed , this week snapped up a 14.99 % stake in the London exchange , which has proven particularly popular with Russian and Chinese companies .
When Sarbanes - Oxley was introduced , corporate governance experts in the UK predicted that Britain would have to tighten compliance rules as well , although it would take a less legalistic approach than the US - the light touch that Patricia Hewitt advocated at the Department of Trade and Industry .
The more pragmatic British style appears to have paid off ."
2006-04-15,"Documents disclosed by prosecutors in the Enron fraud trial have shed new light on the conduct of the former Conservative minister Lord Wakeham , who was a director of the energy company when it collapsed in one of America 's biggest ever accounting scandals .
Handwritten minutes of a boardroom meeting show that Lord Wakeham brushed aside the warnings of a whistleblower as ill - informed just two months before Enron abruptly plunged into bankruptcy .
Shortly before Enron 's descent into crisis , an Enron vice - president , Sherron Watkins , raised concerns about the company 's complex finances in a now infamous memo that warned : "" I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals . ""
Her memo , which dwelt on the probity of more than $ 500 m ( £ 285 m ) in off - balance sheet transactions , was discussed by Enron 's audit committee in October 2001 .
Handwritten minutes of the meeting released by the US government reveal that Lord Wakeham was fully supportive of a decision to reject her concerns .
The politician , who served in both the Thatcher and Major administrations , interjected in a discussion of Ms Watkins 's allegations to ask : "" Is she aware she did not have all the facts ? ""
Directors at the meeting rejected Ms Watkins 's request that one of the "" big six "" accountancy firms be hired to investigate the transactions and clean up Enron 's books .
Lord Wakeham went along with this decision , saying he was happy to "" proceed as planned "" , adding the board should "" keep Jaedicke as backup "" - a reference to a proposal for audit committee chairman Robert Jaedicke to talk to Ms Watkins if she could not be pacified .
At the meeting , Lord Wakeham added that there was a "" need to satisfy the employee [ Watkins ] "" that her allegations have been discussed and considered .
Two months after the discussion , Enron filed for bankruptcy .
Lord Wakeham , 63 , served as energy secretary in the Thatcher and Major administrations .
He joined the board of Enron in 1994 and was paid £ 80,000 a year as a non - executive director over a period when the company became America 's seventh largest company with a market value of $ 70bn .
The controversy surrounding Enron 's collapse prompted him to quit several other jobs including his role as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission .
The life peer is under investigation by the accountancy profession 's joint disciplinary committee scheme over his conduct at Enron .
The disciplinary body is awaiting the results of an inquiry into the role of Enron directors by the US Securities and Exchange Commission .
Minutes from several of Enron 's boardroom meetings are prosecution exhibits in the trial of Enron 's former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , and chairman , Ken Lay , who face 34 counts between them of fraud , conspiracy and insider trading .
An analysis of the minutes suggests that Lord Wakeham 's contributions to meetings were relatively infrequent , although at one point he did recommend that two 72-year - old directors be allowed to continue beyond retirement age .
In court last week , Mr Skilling gave evidence that Enron 's now notorious off - balance sheet transactions , which he says were legitimate tools to hedge against drops in the value of investments , were approved by the company 's audit committee .
The transactions involved transferring Enron investments to a Cayman Islands entity of which Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , was general manager .
Mr Fastow has since admitted to making fraudulent gains from these transactions , although Mr Skilling and Mr Lay say they were unaware that he was doing so .
Mr Skilling has told the court that Enron 's non - executive directors , of which Lord Wakeham was one , used an insurance policy to protect themselves from litigation by Enron 's shareholders .
Mr Skilling said he and Mr Lay were not given such cover .
The trial continues ."
2006-04-18,"Enron 's former boss Jeffrey Skilling failed to disclose to his boardroom colleagues that the energy company was doing $ 450,000 ( £ 257,000 ) of business with a tiny company run by his ex - girlfriend , it emerged yesterday .
In a surprise twist to the scandal surrounding Enron 's demise , Mr Skilling reluctantly admitted on the witness stand that he had owned $ 180,000 of shares in Photofete , a firm with three staff which hosted pictures on the internet .
Enron was in effect supporting Photofete , which later failed .
The revelation emerged as Enron 's former chief executive faced his first day of cross - examination .
Mr Skilling and its former chairman , Ken Lay , face a total of 34 counts of fraud , conspiracy and insider dealing over the demise of the Texan energy corporation which was briefly America 's seventh largest company with a market value of $ 70bn .
The head of the US government 's Enron taskforce , Sean Berkowitz , set about chipping away at Mr Skilling 's credibility by dwelling on the huge number of shares sold by him and his family ahead of the company 's implosion in December 2001 .
Mr Berkowitz asked : "" You 've got a lot to lose in this trial , have n't you ? ""
Mr Skilling replied : "" Yes . ""
Referring to the lengthy prison sentence which could follow a guilty verdict , Mr Berkowitz asked : "" You 've talked about being on trial ultimately for your life ? ""
Mr Skilling replied : "" Yes . ""
The prosecution 's case is that Enron was riddled with conflicts of interest and illegal side deals which hid losses and allowed directors to enrich themselves .
Mr Berkowitz asked Mr Skilling about his interest in Photofete .
Mr Skilling initially replied that he had bought $ 30,000 of shares and its business with Enron was $ 3,000 .
"" I did n't disclose it [ to the board ] because it was n't that big , "" he said .
In a dramatic flourish , the prosecution then produced cheque book stubs showing that Mr Skilling had pumped $ 180,000 into the venture in 2000 and 2001 - and that Enron 's contract with Photofete was worth $ 450,000 .
Mr Berkowitz asked Mr Skilling about his relationship with Jennifer Binder , the businesswoman behind Photofete .
"" It was primarily this ... as a professional relationship , "" replied a clearly uncomfortable Mr Skilling .
"" I had dated her prior to this - in 1998 or 1999 . ""
The eagerly awaited confrontation between Mr Skilling and prosecutors came in the 11th week of the trial .
The Houston courtroom was packed by 7.30am .
Mr Skilling , who had a pugnacious reputation in office , became flushed under questioning .
He admitted he had taken advice from a jury consultant who teaches how to project a confident , persuasive manner .
Most of the day revolved around Mr Skilling 's share dealings .
The 52-year - old businessman agreed that he had grown rich beyond his wildest dreams at Enron - his personal wealth reached $ 100 m .
The jury heard that Mr Skilling sold more than $ 22 m of shares over the 18 months before Enron 's collapse .
His ex - wife , Sue , and then fiancee , Rebecca Carter , were doing likewise - selling stock for $ 15 m between them - although Mr Skilling insisted he did not know this .
Mr Berkowitz asked : "" It 's a coincidence that you , your ex - wife and the woman you were having a relationship with were selling at this time ? ""
Mr Skilling replied : "" Yes . ""
Mr Skilling acknowledged that he kept few notes - he worked off "" to do "" lists which were thrown away and was a technophobe who rarely used email .
Mr Berkowitz put it to him that he had had two years to prepare for the trial .
"" I have nothing to hide , Mr Berkowitz , so I do n't think it 's a question of tailoring your testimony , "" replied Mr Skilling .
"" I will respond to your questions to the best of my ability . """
2006-04-19,"When power , money and status combine to produce a real - life courtroom drama , it can seem as if a whole way of life and behaviour is on trial .
It has been that way last week and this as Enron 's chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , has taken the stand in Houston in the biggest conspiracy , fraud and insider - dealing trial in modern American history .
"" You 're a smart guy , are n't you ? ""
Skilling 's defence lawyer Dan Petrocelli asked him last week . ""
Yes , "" proudly acknowledged the man who built Enron into the giant it once was . ""
Are you consumed by greed ?
"" the lawyer continued .
"" I was consumed by this company , "" Skilling countered .
"" I wanted to build this company to be an institution .
We thought there was a chance Enron could become the energy company , and later the company , of the 21st century . ""
A lot of the fascination of the Enron saga is there in that one short exchange : the pride , ambition , obsession - and vulnerability .
Courtroom drama is the right phrase for it .
It sounds like a scene from a play .
In fact it sounds like a scene from a particular and remarkable play .
Harley Granville Barker 's The Voysey Inheritance is about an English family solicitors ' firm at the start of the last century .
Upper - middle - class Edwardian Lincoln 's Inn and Kent are a far cry from the American energy - trading world now under the spotlight in Houston .
But the worm in the Voysey bud is first cousin to the worm in Enron 's .
In both cases , the outward respectability of the company masks a sustained conspiracy to take money from investors and clients .
Barker wrote The Voysey Inheritance in 1905 .
It was an immediate success .
George Bernard Shaw said it showed "" a mastery that threatens to put us all on the shelf "" .
Well , Shaw may be out of fashion these days , but Barker has been no more fortunate .
This is a pity because this is not just a fine play , but one that in certain respects could have been written at the start of this century , not the last .
At a time when corruption and scandal are so salient in public life , The Voysey Inheritance is at one level a reminder that there is nothing new under the sun .
The Voysey family 's dirty secret - that they have been dipping into their clients ' investments for generations - echoes the career of the Victorian fraudster Jabez Balfour .
But it also looks forward to the Maxwell scandal nearly a century later , to Nick Leeson 's audacious plunderings at Barings and to the industrial - strength pilfering practised by Joyti De - Laurey at Goldman Sachs .
The Voysey Inheritance , though , is not a political tract .
It would be a boring play if it was .
In fact it is a play of resource and strength with echoes of both Ibsen and Chekhov .
In Barker 's play there is a crime going on right from the start , but it is a very respectable crime , even in some ways a necessary crime .
The play works because Barker 's characters spend much of the evening trying to negotiate their way through eternal issues such as risk , guilt and honour .
The easy conclusion is that this is all very modern and that The Voysey Inheritance is remarkably resonant - which is true .
But it is a funny modern play that has so few modern counterparts .
We have plenty of self - acknowledged political playwrights today , yet not many of them write penetratingly or with confidence about money and what it does to ( and for ) people .
Fraud and corruption may generate a courtroom drama in Houston .
But they do n't often inspire playwrights to write drama for the theatre or television .
This is a hole in modern culture - and it is disturbing that it should take a play from a century ago to make one ask why . ""
Ask why ?
"" , incidentally , was the company motto of Enron . ·
The Voysey Inheritance opened this week at the National Theatre nationaltheatre.org.uk .

2006-04-24,"Kenneth Lay , the former Enron chief , yesterday told a courtroom that his pursuit of the American dream had ended in an "" American nightmare "" after the business collapsed amid allegations of fraud in 2001 .
Taking the witness stand for the first time as his trial on fraud charges moved into its 13th week , Mr Lay said he was eager to set the record straight .
"" I 've been very anxious to tell what I believe is the truth about Enron , "" he said .
"" We 've seen a lot of interesting testimony , a lot of interesting people , a lot of lies , a lot of misinformation and some truth . ""
Mr Lay described claims that a conspiracy existed at the top of Enron as "" ludicrous "" .
He said that Andrew Fastow , the former finance chief , who has already pleaded guilty to fraud charges , did a "" tremendously brilliant "" job of hiding his crimes from fellow executives .
Mr Lay , who founded Enron in 1985 , helped build the business into the seventh largest in the United States , before it imploded in late 2001 .
He is on trial alongside Jeffrey Skilling , another former Enron chief executive .
Prosecutors have accused Mr Skilling of spearheading the alleged financial fraud .
Mr Lay has been accused of perpetuating the scam when he resumed control after Mr Skilling abruptly quit just five months before the firm filed for bankruptcy .
Both men have pleaded not guilty .
Asked by his own lawyer if he had committed fraud , Mr Lay responded firmly : "" I did not . ""
Mr Lay , who rose from rural poverty to a life attending parties and mingling with the Bush family , told how he had enjoyed more success than he could have imagined .
Between 1998 and 2001 , the focus of the trial , Mr Lay was paid $ 19 m ( £ 10.6 m ) and banked more than $ 200 m ( £ 112 m ) from selling shares .
"" I would never have thought ever that I would be in criminal court defending charges , "" he said .
"" I guess you could say in the last few years I 've achieved the American nightmare "" .
Once a popular figure in Houston , where the company was based , Mr Lay is a gentler character than Mr Skilling and legal experts have predicted he might be more difficult to convict .
Mr Lay , 64 , said he had been looking forward to retirement when Mr Skilling resigned .
"" I was just a couple of months away from being 60 .
I was looking forward to a somewhat more normal life , a more relaxed life , "" he said ."
2006-04-28,"There should be a gold statue of Bethany McLean outside every journalism school in the world .
She is the magnificently persistent reporter who in 2001 , in the face of sneering from the American business boys ' club , wrote an article in Fortune magazine suggesting that Enron , the gigantic US energy corporation , was "" overvalued "" .
It was the first jab in an investigation revealing the biggest and most grotesque scam of modern times .
Thanks to McLean , the public discovered that Enron was a fraud , inflated by mendacious accounting , the manipulation of public utilities and Maxwell - style raiding of pension funds .
Her story is brilliantly told in this cracking documentary directed by Alex Gibney , based on the subsequent book that McLean co - wrote about the Enron scandal .
Sadly , though , there is no mention of one British participant in this sorry story : Tory peer John Wakeham , who in the 1990s pulled down a juicy £ 80,000 per year serving as non - executive director for Enron and brushed aside warnings that his employer was dodgy .
When the truth came out , Lord Wakeham surrendered this sinecure and one other : chairman of the Press Complaints Commission .
McLean 's triumph lay in her forensic rigour .
She assessed Enron not on the basis of its ongoing success , not on the basis of the conspicuous wealth and prestige of its executive officers , not on the basis of its glossy brochures and glitzy premises - but purely and simply on the numbers .
She read the accounts , and doggedly ignored the spin .
The Enron catastrophe emerges from this film as a fascinating story of crookedness that grew out of business practices , which , though audacious , were just about on the right side of the law .
Enron 's chairman and chief executive officer were Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , two supremely arrogant and belligerent men who believed they were the "" smartest guys in the room "" : that through sheer cleverness and creativity - an unfortunate concept in connection with accounting - they had brought into being the most innovative corporation in the US .
Enron brokered the buying and selling of energy futures whose values they were allowed to include as part of their own assets , like the owner of an armoured car who believes he owns the gold bullion while it is being carried inside , and , incredibly , were permitted to consider the hypothetical future value of anything they owned as a current reality .
They marketed derivative financial products based on everything from internet bandwidth to , unbelievably , the weather .
A credulous business media bought into the myth of Enron 's new ways of magicking profits out of thin air and so did the merchant banking community .
This modern - day South Sea Bubble grew and grew and grew .
When California deregulated its energy markets , Enron was allowed to shut down production here and there to pump up the price of electricity .
California suffered power cuts like a developing world country or 1970s Britain , and this was blamed on its hapless governor , Gray Davis , who was to be booted out of office in favour of Arnold Schwarzenegger .
So Enron is even guilty of creating the Governator .
My only quarrel with the movie is its apparent sympathy with David - who should have been taking tougher action , or making a louder complaint , against the Enron swindlers .
Gibney 's movie shows how the top brass at Enron realised what was happening , but like a mad and dysfunctional cult , everyone carried on .
Nobody wanted to be wimpy or disloyal enough to question what was happening . ""
Ask why "" was the company 's supremely conceited , brainiac motto .
In reality , asking why would get you fired .
Eventually , the smartest guys in the room , sycophantically praised by the political and business elites - including Bush Sr and Jr - wound up being taken to the police station in handcuffs .
Another Enron executive killed himself .
One other , a gentleman with a passion for lapdancers , emerged unscathed from the debacle .
The awful truth is that our society has a need to believe , unquestioningly , in rich people .
Dickens and Trollope , who created the phoney billionaires Mr Merdle and Mr Melmotte , would have appreciated Lay and Skilling ; they understood the fatal , dizzying attraction of plutocrats who appear to be heading for the stars .
Perhaps the big mistake that Lay and Skilling made was not buying a few newspapers or TV stations .
Then they could have counted on even more deference from the press - enough , perhaps , to have tided them over .
Which brings us back to Bethany McLean herself .
Her triumph was not simply in her investigative toughness and nose for a story .
It was in showing a quality desperately needed in all sorts of journalism : simply , a refusal to take people at their own estimation of themselves .
The movie has disquieting resonances about our own Enronised prosperity .
Middle - class Brits are borrowing more , spending more and unconcerned about the future because ever - increasing property prices will buy us out of trouble .
Meanwhile in the US , the company 's pauperised pensioners are still looking for ways to make ends meet .
Maybe John Wakeham would care to make a donation ."

He left Enron with enough of the latter to become the biggest landowner in Colorado .
There 's also a mysterious ' M Yass ' , to whom large sums were paid ; the movie suggests it stands for ' My Ass ' .
The week 's other two documentaries are less interesting .
Tómas Gislason 's Overcoming is an impressionistic account of a former Danish Tour de France winner training his international team for the 2004 event and then of the race seen from his perspective .
It has more to do with pain , motivation and esprit de corps than with racing , the grace of sport and the tour as spectacle .
Metal :
A Headbanger 's Journey is a history of heavy metal music by a lifelong Canadian fan , Sam Dunn , who grew up to become an anthropologist .
The musical is thunderous , the audiences frenetic and most of the musicians , the notorious Alice Cooper among them , appear to be pussycats posing as ferocious tigers .
The scariest section looks at the truly dangerous Norwegian school , whose members are genuinely Satanic and have burnt down some beautiful country churches as a protest against Christianity .
A frequent plot of Hollywood thrillers and westerns is that of a law officer escorting a prisoner or key witness across dangerous terrain , The Narrow Margin and 3.10 to Yuma are classic examples .
But the one that Richard Donner 's 16 Blocks most resembles is The Gauntlet , in which mob - connected policemen attempt to kill the gangster 's moll that a jaded Clint Eastwood is taking to testify at a crucial trial .
In Donner 's brisk movie , Bruce Willis is a taciturn , hard - drinking cop who finds redemption while escorting a motor - mouthed , black petty criminal ( hip hop star Mos Def ) along the eponymous 16 blocks of downtown Manhattan from jail to courthouse .
He 's going to appear before a grand jury as a witness to police corruption and Willis 's colleagues are out to kill him .
It takes place in what is almost real - time on a weekday morning in summer and the action is cleverly sustained .
Willis has been playing slight variations on this role for years now , and though the films do n't get better , his performances do .
David Morse is very good as a cynical old friend attempting to talk Willis out of his newfound chivalry .
Taking place a few miles across the Hudson River from 16 Blocks , Freedomland is also a police thriller , but less straightforward , more pretentious and much inferior .
Samuel L Jackson plays a plainclothes cop with the colourful name of Lorenzo Council .
He 's trying to keep the peace at a point where white and black neighbourhoods abut each other in a decaying New Jersey town .
A white woman ( Julianne Moore ) claims that a black thief has stolen her car with her four - year - old child in the back seat .
Jackson is dubious about this ex - junkie 's story , racial tensions mount ( exacerbated by Moore 's racist brother - inlaw , also a cop ) , and riots loom .
Moore , no stranger to neurotic roles , gets away with a five - minute monologue delivered under interrogation .
The deeply disappointing Do n't Come Knocking reunites playwright Sam Shepard and director Wim Wenders for the first time since their triumphant collaboration on Paris , Texas ,
Palme d'Or winner at Cannes in 1984 .
This time , in addition to writing the script , Shepard plays a washed - up Hollywood actor , a womanising , drug - taking alcoholic who 's fallen from star to supporting actor .
One morning , in a spirit of selfdisgust , he rides off the set of an unlikely western being made in Utah , takes the bus to see ( for the first time in 30 years ) his elderly mother in Nevada and proceeds to look up a former lover ( Jessica Lange ) in Montana and the grown - up son he 's never met .
It 's a flat , rambling affair , revisiting themes that recur in Shepard 's work ( loneliness , the drifting life , broken families , fathers who 've deserted their children ) .
What it most resembles is Sydney Pollack 's characteristically efficient and pointed The Electric Horseman and suffers dreadfully in the comparison .
It even has an unsmiling pursuer in rimless , Gestapo - style glasses ( a bounty hunter played by Tim Roth ) , who 's a dead ringer for the corporation boss who masterminds the pursuit of the fugitive Robert Redford in Pollack 's film .
The saving grace of Do n't Come Knocking is the western landscape and the use of Butte , Montana , a rundown mining town that retains a sad , faded grandeur .
This place of notorious conflict was the model for Poisonville in Hammett 's Red Harvest .
The Moguls is an embarrassing addition to the cycle of comedies about nice people doing transgressive things in a good cause .
After unemployed steelworkers becoming strippers in The Full Monty and members of the Women 's Institute posing nude in Calendar Girls , we now have some well - meaning dimwits in a dull American town making an amateur porn movie to raise money and brighten up their drab lives .
Naïve and shy - making rather than tasteless or shocking
, it wastes an ill - directed cast led by Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson .
James Gunn 's Slither is a comic salute to the horror movies of the Fifties and Sixties , beginning , like The Blob , with a meteorite bringing a voracious creature from outer space .
It then turns into something like Night of the Living Dead as the beast transforms the inhabitants of a South Carolina township into flesh - eating zombies .
Gunn learnt his art working for the gorefest B - movie company Troma on pictures like The Toxic Avenger and the cult horror flick , Tromeo and Juliet .
The film brought me little pleasure , but it revived happy memories of a laidback caper movie also called Slither , starring Peter Boyle and James Caan , made in 1973 .
Finally , two Argentinian movies .
Lost Embrace is an engaging tale of a Jewish divorcée running a small lingerie store in a Buenos Aires arcade , assisted by her younger son who wants to go to Europe and discover his Polish roots .
It celebrates eccentricity and friendship across ethnic barriers .
Daniel Burman , director of Lost Embrace , is the producer of the grim A Year
Without Love , in which a gay Argentinian poet keeps a diary about living with Aids and trying to stick to safe sex while going hell for leather with some unsavoury sado - masochists .
Not surprisingly , his father and aunt do n't like the diary when it 's published as a novel ."
2006-05-02,"Enron 's founder , Kenneth Lay , yesterday ended six days of trial evidence claiming he had done all he could to avoid the company 's collapse , an event he described as the "" most painful thing "" in his life .
In the last of a series of bruising exchanges the federal prosecutor , John Hueston , at the court in Houston , in the US , attacked Mr Lay 's refusal during his evidence to accept the blame for what had happened to the company . ""
Sir , you have a long list of people to blame for Enron 's collapse , and it gets longer and longer as you testify .
And your list of people to blame and events to blame did not include yourself , did it , sir ? ""
Mr Lay responded : "" I did everything I could humanly do [ at ] this time .
Did I make mistakes ?
I 'm sure I did ...
I had to make real - time decisions based on information I had at the time . ""
Questioned by the defence lawyer , George Mcall Secrest , Mr Lay , 64 , denied keeping Enron 's holding in Wessex Water at a fraudulently high value on the books .
Enron believed the stake was worth keeping and would provide a return , he said .
Mr Lay and the former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling are accused of repeatedly lying to investors and employees about Enron 's success when allegedly they knew that that record was based on accounting practices which inflated profits and hid bad news .
Enron went bankrupt in December 2001 .
Mr Skilling , 52 , faces 28 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and lying to auditors .
Mr Lay faces six charges of fraud and conspiracy .
They deny the charges and blame Enron 's bankruptcy on bad publicity and market loss of confidence ."
2006-05-03,"As a derivatives trader , I have to say I found this a very biased film .
Yes , Enron was deeply flawed , and no doubt the courts will soon prove this once and for all , but not everything they ever did was a bottomless act .
People laughed when we discovered that Enron considered trading on the weather , but there are serious arguments behind even that .
Weather is a massive factor in agriculture , and affects the outcome of crops , which is something that has long been traded on .
Those who laugh at brave ideas probably would n't get far in this business .
Similarly , there 's the fact that Enron chose to trade in natural gas when everyone else was looking at fossil fuels : again , the brokers went on to commit atrocities , but the idea was flawless .
It 's ideas like this we need more of in this country .
American traders are more open to blue - sky thinking .
And as for the film going off down the tangent of one executive leaving his wife for a pregnant stripper - is that really relevant ?
With Rogue Trader , the film about Nick Leeson , and now this , the cinema has given people a murky view of derivatives and risk - hedging .
The general public has enough trouble understanding my area of finance .
My daughter just tells her friends daddy works in a bank .
That Eddie Murphy film Trading Places at least showed the excitement of the dealing pit .
Could such a company have originated in this country ?
Of course not .
British politics does n't give business such a long leash .
And having the Bush dynasty on your side means you can get away with almost anything - we do n't have such charisma - led politics here , and I suppose we should be thankful .
But then would we have investigative journalists like Bethany McLean who brought the company down ?
I do n't think we would .
From what I see in the newspapers these days , it 's all columnists and celebrity frocks ."
2006-05-06,"Those of a timorous disposition may want to avoid Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room .
Most Hollywood horror is ultimately comforting , since you can tell yourself it never happened .
Not so the events recounted in this blood - curdling , neatly constructed documentary on the rise and fall of the notorious Houston energy giant , culminating in the world 's biggest bankruptcy .
As the film progressively reveals , principally through the mouths of the protagonists , they really were as bad as they seemed .
We see the hubris ( one of the shell companies set up to shelter the firm 's mounting losses was called M. Yass - OK , move the full stop to the right ) , the self - serving and the rampaging greed .
In retrospect , though , what should send shivers up every spine is that if Enron and Arthur Andersen were business 's Twin Towers ( 40,000 jobs and $ 100bn of capital were lost between them ) , the fundamentalism that brought them crashing down was not some external malevolence : the enemy was , and is , within .
At one level , Enron was a microcosm of the dotcom extravaganza , a one - company bubble of its own .
All the ingredients were present : within the firm , leaders who believed they could outsmart anyone or anything , and products that became increasingly disembodied from reality ( from energy to futures and markets : at one stage it planned to sell weather ) ; outside the firm , political support and willing believers - ' useful idiots ' in both academic and financial worlds who took at face value everything the firm told them and eagerly talked it up .
Once the bandwagon started to roll , Enron became a model of self - sustaining momentum .
Everyone was dazzled by the honeypot .
Investors scrambled over each other to pile in .
The top US investment banks , Wall Street 's crème de la crème , enthusiastically subscribed to the loss - hiding schemes , no questions asked .
Laxer accounting rules ?
Regulators , perhaps mindful of chairman ' Kenny Boy ' Lay 's political connections , were happy to oblige .
Lawyers and auditors - the latter well enough aware of what was happening to shred the offending documents in panic when the balloon burst - were far too dependent on the gravy train to even attempt to apply the brakes .
Enron was a bubble in another sense .
Disconnected from reality by both its conviction of invincibility and its fantasy accounting , and unchecked by guidance from the top , Enron employees behaved as if they were in a world of their own .
Just how perverse this world had become is shown in one of the film 's most disquieting sequences where Enron traders are overheard laughing and boasting about their efforts to disrupt California 's energy supplies in 2000 .
The famous blackouts that year were not caused by shortage of capacity or poor regulation - they were caused by Enron , which drove prices ( and profits ) up by as much as nine times by shutting down power stations and creating artificial shortages .
Caught on tape , one trader exults at the forest fires sweeping over the state , crowing ' Burn , baby , burn ! '
It may be significant that it took two women to make the first small punctures in this testosterone - inflated balloon - Fortune reporter Bethany McLean ( one up for journalism here ) , who mildly asked if the company 's stock was overpriced , and Sherron Watkins , the Enron employee who undertook the dangerous job of informing the company emperors that they were n't wearing any clothes .
Although Enron bosses used considerable ingenuity in their attempts to disguise the true state of the figures , in retrospect the most striking thing about their drive to auto - destruction is its utter pumped - up , fanatical single - mindedness : business as extreme sport .
Enron was the most extreme corporate monument to shareholder value ever erected .
The entire system was geared to keeping the share price up .
On the carrot side , the incentives for doing so were vast : even in the last months executives were collecting bonuses of tens of millions and cashing options for hundreds , even as they exhorted lowlier employees to invest their retirement savings in company stock ( which was later pillaged in a desperate attempt to buy time ) .
On the stick side , the system was ' rank and yank ' : every year all employees were graded one to five , and all the fives were fired .
Fifteen per cent had to be fives .
In a culture formed by the sack on one side and a pot of gold on the other , it 's scarcely surprising that employees stopped at nothing , including shutting down California ( which is now suing for $ 6bn compensation ) , to keep the quarterly numbers moving up .
After all , their own greed could be , and was , justified because it was all for the shareholders .
But we should know that .
In systems where incentives are sharp enough and the moral compass deliberately disabled - what 's good for shareholders is good for the company is good for me - that 's what happens .
In that sense , to get where Enron ended up did n't require management to be deliberately evil ; it just required it to take what most MBAs learn at business school and pursue it to its logical conclusion . simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk"
2006-05-12,"If you thought the Walton family were those nice , dungaree - wearing folks who go to sleep at night singing out "" G'night , John - Boy "" etc , then you 've got another thing coming .
They are the super - rich , hyper - greedy founders of corporate behemoth Wal - Mart , the US mega - retailer denounced in this documentary by Robert Greenwald - relentlessly , convincingly , but without the wit and comedy of a Michael Moore or a Morgan Spurlock , without the top - level inside gossip offered in the recent Enron documentary and , as it happens , without the journalistic convention of putting its case to the defendants for their comments .
Wal - Mart is already notorious for sucking the lifeblood out of every community that admits this vampire to its midst .
It undercuts mom - and - pop stores by using sweatshop - made goods from China and Bangladesh ; it underpays its staff to breadline levels ; it gets vast tax breaks from the government , but sneakily relocates its stores outside city limits to avoid local taxes ; it uses CCTV to spy on union organisers but ignores violent crime in its vast , unsupervised car parks .
Wal - Mart pretty much does everything but drown puppies and slaughter the first - born .
Judging from the revivalist atmosphere at their annual company jamboree , there is the same massive conceit we saw at Enron : a creepy compulsion to get bigger and bigger and more and more profitable .
Does this sorry story affect us in Europe ?
Well , employees at Wal - Mart 's German subsidiaries are protected by unions of the sort that have become unfashionable in the UK .
The building of a new Asda store in London - Asda being owned by Wal - Mart - has already threatened a local market .
What can nice
Sharon Osbourne , the face of Asda 's ads , have to say about it all ?
The case against these ugly faceless giants looks pretty overwhelming .
Can a film about Tesco be far behind ?"
2006-05-18,"The Houston jury in the Enron trial began its deliberations yesterday over whether Kenneth Lay , the firm 's founder , and Jeffrey Skilling , former chief executive , were guilty of fraud .
The jurors must decide on 28 criminal counts against Mr Skilling and six against Mr Lay with both facing prison terms if convicted .
The government is attempting to blame Mr Lay and Mr Skilling for the company 's collapse in 2001 after millions of dollars of debt were hidden in suspect accounting schemes and profits were artificially inflated .
The trial , now in its 16th week , followed a four and a half year investigation ."
2006-05-25,"A jury today found Kenneth Lay , the founder of Enron , guilty on all six counts of fraud and conspiracy in one of the biggest financial scandals in US history .
The jury of eight women and four men also found the company 's former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , guilty of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud .
"" Obviously , I 'm disappointed , but that 's the way the system works , "" Skilling said in a brief comment to reporters .
Enron 's collapse came to symbolise the excesses of the dotcom era .
Together with subsequent Wall Street scandals - encompassing the even bigger collapse of WorldCom - the Enron case paved the way for legislation on tighter corporate governance and accounting rules .
However , the Sarbanes - Oxley bill , which followed the scandal , has led to complaints of too much red tape from US companies .
The legislation has been cited as the reason for many foreign companies preferring to list on the London Stock Exchange instead of in New York .
The defendants awaited today 's verdict outcome away from the federal courthouse in Houston - Lay at his nearby office and Skilling in his legal team 's "" war room "" across the street .
Both were accused of repeatedly lying to investors and employees about Enron 's health before its collapse in December 2001 .
Prosecutors said the two knew of the various accounting subterfuges used to mask debts and failing ventures .
The defendants denied any wrongdoing , attributing the company 's failure to bad publicity and a loss of market confidence .
Skilling faced 28 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and lying to auditors , with a maximum sentence of 275 years in prison if convicted on all counts .
Lay faced six counts of fraud and conspiracy , with a combined maximum punishment of 45 years .
During cross - examination , Lay claimed he had done all he could to avoid the company 's collapse , which he described as the "" most painful thing "" in his life .
In the last of a series of bruising exchanges , the federal prosecutor , John Hueston , attacked Lay 's refusal during his evidence to accept the blame for what had happened to the company . ""
Sir , you have a long list of people to blame for Enron 's collapse , and it gets longer and longer as you testify .
And your list of people to blame and events to blame did not include yourself , did it , sir ? ""
Lay responded : "" I did everything I could humanly do [ at ] this time .
Did I make mistakes ?
I 'm sure I did ...
I had to make real - time decisions based on information I had at the time . ""
Questioned by the defence lawyer , George McCall Secrest , 64-year - old Lay denied keeping Enron 's holding in Wessex Water at a fraudulently high value on the books .
He said Enron believed the stake was worth keeping and would provide a return .
Enron began life as a regional natural gas pipeline company , the result of a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth in 1985 .
Lay , its former chairman , transformed it into the world 's largest energy trading company and the seventh - biggest corporation in the US ."
2006-05-25,"The jury has just thrown the book at the two men who led Enron to its rise and fall .
The energy company 's founder , Kenneth Lay , and its former chief executive , Jeffrey Skilling , have both been found guilty of fraud and conspiracy .
They could spend the rest of their years in prison .
At its zenith , Enron , which began life as a humble regional gas pipeline company , won praise from Wall Street analysts for its "" innovative "" approach in marrying hi - tech and complex finance to the dull business of supplying energy .
Under Lay , Enron became the world 's largest energy company and America 's seventh largest corporation .
But it was all sleight of hand .
The financial wizardry that so bedazzled Wall Street consisted of creating "" special entities "" to hide the company 's huge debts .
When the gig was up , Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 , in what was then the biggest financial collapse in US history , a dubious distinction that was subsequently transferred to WorldCom and its cowboy boots - wearing boss Bernie Ebbers .
In the Enron collapse , lots of investors lost their shirts , and many of Enron 's 19,000 employees lost their savings because they belonged to retirement plans based on Enron shares .
The consequences of Enron are still with us .
Enron , WorldCom and other Wall Street scandals moved Congress to introduce legislation to tighten up corporate governance and accounting rules .
The Sarbanes - Oxley bill , a direct legacy of Enron , is a bane of US companies .
They complain about the pendulum going too far the other way to ensure against scandal and about too much red tape .
Many foreign companies cite the rigours of Sarbanes - Oxley for their reason to list on the London Stock Exchange rather than New York .
Perhaps America 's lawmakers overreacted , but they had to respond to public pressure to clean up Wall Street .
In all this , one lesson stands out .
Scandal is the inevitable handmaiden of a bull market .
In the 1980s , Wall Street also saw shares rise to giddy heights .
That bull market also gave us Michael Milken , usually referred to as "" the junk bond king "" .
Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling now rank alongside Milken and Ebbers in notoriety ."
2006-05-25,"Enron looked like a classic American story of rags to riches : a worthy but dull gas utility that grew in the space of a decade to become one of the largest corporations in the country .
It transformed itself into a pioneering company at the cutting edge , creating new markets using complex financial instruments where none had previously existed .
As a result Enron was lauded in the same terms as the brash internet start - ups that blossomed during the dotcom boom .
But just as that boom went bust , so Enron 's profits and reputation were built on hype and hot air .
The company under its executives Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling wove a lattice of 3,000 separate subsidiaries and proxies to artificially boost profits and hide liabilities .
A whistle - blower eventually revealed the massive systemic deception , which caused the company to collapse , and yesterday a jury found Lay and Skilling guilty of fraud and conspiracy .
The temptation now will be for some in the US and in this country to say that the case proves that the system "" works "" - that the bad apples were exposed .
But it it would be wildly optimistic to think Enron was an exception : Enron was not even the largest corporate collapse of its era .
That title belongs to the telecoms company Worldcom .
And regulators were lucky that not only was there a whistle - blower , but also that another Enron executive pleaded guilty and testified .
Enron is emblematic because its political links and ability to evade regulations - nodded along benignly by its accountants Arthur Andersen , which was itself destroyed by its involvement - allowed it to get away with audacious fraud for so long .
Some were suspicious of Enron 's activities well before its collapse .
Yet the checks and balances supposedly built into a modern listed company , where ownership through shareholding and management are separated , failed to work .
The response since then has been tighter regulation and greater disclosure by publicly - owned companies in order to protect shareholders , including the thousands of innocent Enron employees encouraged to buy stakes in the company .
But that may not solve the problem .
What drove Skilling and Lay appears to have been the increasingly lavish distribution of cash and share options to managers since the early 1990s .
Enron 's senior managers are estimated to have paid themselves more than $ 1bn .
Rewards on such a scale mean the likes of Skilling and Lay will always be tempted .
That is why governments have to protect markets from the Enrons that would destroy them ."
2006-05-26,"There was a sense of inevitability about the judgment handed out yesterday , with Enron 's former executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling found guilty of conspiracy , fraud , insider trading and misrepresentation .
Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the trial was that Lay and Skilling thought their case was worth fighting .
But once Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow and chief accounting officer Richard Causey had pleaded guilty , neither Lay nor Skilling had a leg to stand on .
Their defence was laughable : it was all the media 's fault .
The mystery is why neither - Lay especially - did n't make a guilty plea in the expectation of a lighter sentence .
Yesterday 's ruling means both could well spend the rest of their lives in prison .
The potential maximum sentence for Skilling is 165 years .
The script went according to plan , and the bad guys got sent down .
But as the brilliant Rebecca Smith points out in the Wall Street Journal [ subscription ] today , the weakness of Lay and Skilling 's defence meant that the trial itself did n't reveal anything new about Enron , and no "" smoking gun "" pointing to Enron 's more controversial activities .
We still do n't know how much money Enron made or lost from its "" innovative "" trading in energy , or how it manipulated the California electricity market and to what extent it was responsible for the crisis that blacked out parts of the state in 2000 . ""
Indeed , more than four years after the Enron scandal began , it is still impossible to say what was real at Enron and what was smoke and mirrors , "" writes Smith , one of the journalists who in 2001 broke open the story that led to the company 's exposure and collapse .
That means , as an example of regulatory failure or otherwise , it is hard to draw solid conclusions from Enron and its demise .
And there is still more to learn about the company 's complex and mutually beneficial relationship with regulators and government , especially given Ken Lay 's close associations with the Texas Republican party and the state 's former governor George Bush .
Enron was , of course , based in Houston , whose suburbs were also home to the disgraced former Republican majority leader Tom DeLay .
The Washington Post has reported that in May 2001 Enron 's lobbyists in Washington DC told Ken Lay that DeLay wanted a donation of $ 100,000 to be spent in part on "" the redistricting effort "" in Texas .
It was this "" effort "" , and DeLay 's funnelling of corporate donations to his political ends , that eventually led to DeLay 's resignation from Congress .
Central to Enron 's early success was its ability not only to evade taxes but also to create elaborate tax shelters , which it then defended with the aid of its political allies in Congress and high - profile lobbying of its own .
Enron was a terrific help to Dick Cheney 's energy taskforce , and there are allegations that Lay threatened to have the head of the US Federal Energy Regulation Commission fired - as he was shortly afterwards , replaced by a new chairman personally recommended by Lay .
So , satisfying though the trial result may have been , it leaves so many unanswered questions that only a full government inquiry will be able to answer them .
That will have to wait until November , assuming the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives ( likely ) or Senate ( less likely ) , to start the process .
But it will be worth the wait ."
2006-05-26,"The former Enron bosses Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling were yesterday convicted on fraud charges stemming from one of the most infamous scandals in corporate history .
Jurors in the trial returned their verdict after just five days and two hours of deliberations , despite dozens of charges and often complex financial detail during the four - month trial .
Both men now face the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in prison .
The convictions are a resounding victory for the US government , which was under pressure to hold individuals to account for the collapse of what was once America 's seventh - largest company .
Thousands of people lost jobs and life savings when Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 , the beginning of a turbulent period for corporate America as scandal followed scandal .
It took more than four years for the Enron case to reach trial .
As he emerged from the court with his lawyer , Skilling looked pale with shock .
Asked whether he would ever accept his guilt , he shrugged and answered no . ""
We have fought the good fight , "" he said .
"" Some things work and some things do n't .
Obviously I am disappointed but that is the way the system works . ""
His lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , added : "" Obviously the trial did not come out the way we had hoped .
It certainly does not change our view of Mr Skilling 's innocence .
It is obviously a very difficult time for Mr Skilling , his children and his family
but we are going to stand behind him .
We have just begun the fight . ""
Skilling , 52 , was found guilty on 19 of the 28 counts against him of conspiracy , fraud , making false statements and insider trading .
Lay , 64 , a former friend of President George Bush , was found guilty on all six charges that were filed against him of conspiracy and fraud .
Both men stood motionless as the verdicts were read out .
Lay was also convicted of bank fraud and making false statements in a separate trial related to his personal banking .
Lay had entered the court alone , without his wife Linda , for the first time during the trial .
As he emerged from the lift he was heard to say : "" I hate to go into court without my wife - it 's as much her life as mine . ""
Sentencing was set for September 11 .
Technically , Lay had been open to 165 years in prison and Skilling 275 years .
But they are likely to be given jail terms of between 20 and 30 years .
The two men are free on $ 5 m bail until the sentencing date .
The Enron bosses had been accused of a vast conspiracy to give the impression that the Houston - based energy company was in better financial shape than it actually was .
The accounting tricks finally unravelled in late 2001 .
Investors fled in panic and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy .
The breakthrough for prosecutors came in early 2004 when they secured a guilty plea from the former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow , who testified against his former bosses in return for a relatively short jail term of 10 years .
He provided testimony during the trial that suggested both Lay and Skilling had encouraged him to commit fraud and lied to investors about the financial health of Enron .
Both Lay and Skilling resolutely maintained their innocence and said Fastow was solely to blame .
The convictions provide a bookend for a period that Wall Street would rather forget .
Allegations of fraud against some of the biggest names in US business rapidly followed at the likes of the telecoms firm WorldCom , the cable company Adelphia , the conglomerate Tyco and by the TV celebrity Martha Stewart .
The jury 's deliberations had been expected to take at least another week , although there had been speculation that , with the Memorial Day holiday weekend looming , the jury would want to be free sooner .
In suburban Houston , where many former Enron employees live , the news was only slowly sinking in .
Werner Thurau said : "" I was surprised at the speed with which they reached their decision , but not surprised at the decision itself .
I think it was fair on the evidence . """
2006-05-26,"In the dock were two men once worth hundreds of millions of dollars who had rubbed shoulders with presidents .
In the jury , eight men and four women , including a teacher , a dairy farmer , a dental hygienist , a real estate agent , a ship inspector and a roofing salesman .
There were many reasons why the trial of former Enron bosses Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling resonated around the world .
The collapse of Enron in December 2001 came to represent the implosion of the so - called new economy .
There was the political intrigue ; Mr Lay had been a friend of the Bush family .
Enron 's demise also marked the beginning of a period of lurid scandals among some of America 's biggest corporations .
For those most deeply affected by Enron 's bankruptcy though - the thousands who lost their jobs and their life savings that had been invested in company shares - it represented something else entirely .
The Enron story had exposed a faultline crossing modern America , the widening gulf between the country 's super - rich and the ordinary people who struggle to get by .
For much of America it was difficult to view the case through any other prism .
The jury returned its verdict yesterday after just over five days of deliberations .
Skilling and Lay were convicted on almost all of the charges against them and are likely to spend the rest of their lives in prison .
The company had its headquarters in Houston , and it was the venue for the trial .
On the Kroger shopping mall on South Voss in the city , Maribeth Sterling said she was glad to hear the verdict : "" I am glad they 've got what 's coming to them , "" she said .
"" I never thought they 'd find them guilty though . ""
In a final flourish of theatrics during closing arguments that appealed to the class divide , the government prosecutor Sean Berkowitz had produced a large monochrome cardboard display with the word "" truth "" emblazoned on one side and "" lies "" on the other . '
You ca n't buy justice ' "" You get to decide whether they told truth or lies , black and white , "" he told the jury . ""
Do n't let the defendants , with their high - paid experts and their lawyers , buy their way out of this , "" he said .
"" I 'm asking you to send them a message that it 's not all right .
You ca n't buy justice ; you have to earn it . ""
According to the defence , the trial was as cynical a piece of demagoguery as any since the Salem witch trials .
Everything about the Enron trial was outsized .
There were big personalities ; big numbers ( Lay banked $ 200 m - about £ 107 m at today 's exchange rates - from selling shares between 1998 and 2001 ) ; a giant fall from grace ( Enron had once been America 's seventh largest corporation ) ; and large - scale alleged crimes .
The trial was also of huge importance .
Shortly before it began , Skilling 's lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , had described it as the "" most important , most high - profile , most must - win case the United States government has ever prosecuted "" .
It had taken prosecutors more than four years to bring Skilling and Lay to trial .
In the meantime , other scandals had erupted at companies including WorldCom , Tyco and Adelphia and executives either cleared or sent to prison .
Martha Stewart , for example , has been accused , tried , imprisoned , released and resumed her television career in the intervening years .
Enron was created through the merger of two businesses in 1985 and was a supplier of natural gas .
In the 1990s it began its transformation into an energy trader , buying and selling gas and power .
Skilling had faced 28 charges and Lay , the son of a baptist minister , six .
The government contended that Enron was experiencing mounting difficulties in the late 1990s and that the two men conspired with others to give the impression that the company was in rude health , through "" accounting tricks , fiction , hocus - pocus "" and "" outright lies "" .
Skilling , 52 , had been at the firm since 1990 and took over as chief executive in February 2001 only to resign abruptly six months later .
He was accused of spearheading the scheme .
Lay , 64 , who founded the company , resumed the top job after Skilling quit and was accused of keeping up the facade .
There is no doubt that financial fraud was committed , the issue was by whom ?
The scam centred on the creation of off - balance sheet companies that were used to hide debt and inflate profits .
According to an independent report , Enron had booked $ 352 m in profits in 2000 from the sale of assets to what were in effect its own subsidiaries .
Its debt that year was reported as $ 10bn when it should have been $ 22bn .
The company began to unravel shortly after Skilling quit .
The trial pitted former colleagues against one another .
The government had secured plea deals with , among others , the former finance chief Andrew Fastow , who will serve a slimmed down sentence of 10 years in prison after admitting that he helped orchestrate the fraud , skimming off $ 45 m for himself in the process .
Among the government 's other star witnesses was Sherron Watkins , the mid - ranking accountant whose warnings internally had been ignored , and the former head of investor relations , Mark Koenig .
They each said Lay and Skilling had either been involved in the manipulation of earnings , or were aware of it .
There was little hard evidence to implicate either man , no paper or electronic trail .
After 16 weeks in the courtroom , countless documents , often labyrinthine financial detail and more than 50 witnesses , it boiled down simply to which side the jury believed .
Skilling and Lay each spent a week on the witness stand proclaiming their innocence .
They both displayed flashes of indignation and hostility during questioning .
Lay said they were victims of "" political and public "" hysteria .
Eight former Enron executives testified for the government after pleading guilty and the defence contended that they did so only after being bullied into submission by prosecutors threatening them with long prison sentences .
Petrocelli said they had been "" robbed of their will "" by the strong - arm tactics of the government .
Crisis of confidence
Instead , the defence argued , there had been only a relatively small - scale fraud and one that was confined to Fastow and a small number of subordinates .
Lay maintained that Enron was a great company that crashed only because of a "" crisis of confidence "" among investors .
Juror Freddie Delgado , a teacher , said after the trial that one of the best witnesses had been the former Enron treasurer , Ben Glisan .
"" We kept going back to his testimony to corroborate things , "" he said .
Glisan testified that Enron 's financial condition was "" weak "" when Skilling resigned and that both of his former bosses were aware of the problems .
The jury then heard a tape of Lay and Skilling telling investors that Enron was in good shape .
The prosecution presented Lay and Skilling as sinking further into their own lies .
Berkowitz said that neither man had deliberately tried to ruin the company .
But they needed the share price to stay high and believed that if "" they could just hold on , they felt if they could just lie a little longer and get to the next quarter and the next quarter , everything will be fine "" .
Enron leaves a legacy .
The company has become shorthand for corporate wrongdoing .
Corporate governance laws in the US were tightened as a result of Enron and the ensuing scandals , some now say too far .
Enron 's auditor Arthur Andersen was driven out of business .
Wall Street banks have paid billions in restitution and charges have been brought against - at last count - 34 others involved with Enron .
For the likes of Enron 's former employees , that matters little .
· Profiles : The guilty men and the whistleblower Kenneth Lay Lay , who became chief executive when Enron was formed in 1985 , was raised in rural poverty in Missouri and built a fortune worth some $ 400 m ( £ 214 m ) .
He was dubbed "" Kenny Boy "" by President Bush and had widely been tipped to become energy secretary in the Bush administration .
He maintained his innocence on the stand , saying it was "" ludicrous "" to suggest there had been a conspiracy at the top of Enron and that the former finance chief , Andrew Fastow , had done a "" tremendously brilliant "" job of hiding his crimes from fellow executives .
Lay said he had been devastated by Enron 's collapse .
"" I guess you could say in the last few years I 've achieved the American nightmare , "" he told the court .
Andrew Fastow
The former finance chief pleaded guilty in January 2004 to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for a relatively lenient 10-year sentence .
On the witness stand he implicated both of his former bosses .
Fastow , 44 , said he ran off - the - books companies that helped conceal Enron 's debt and boost earnings with the encouragement of Jeffrey Skilling , who allegedly enjoined him to "" get me as much of that juice as you can "" .
He also said that Kenneth Lay had known of Enron 's problems even as he gave an interview saying the company was in its "" best shape ever "" .
Fastow said that "" within the culture of corruption that Enron had , that valued financial reporting rather than economic value , I believed I was being a hero "" .
Jeffrey Skilling Skilling was regarded as the brains at Enron .
He had been with the company since 1990 and was made chief executive in February 2001 .
He quit just six months later , raising questions about whether he knew Enron was on the skids .
Skilling has steadfastly maintained his innocence and berated former colleagues who accepted plea deals and testified against him .
He told the jury that he had quit because he was emotionally exhausted and had become "" obsessed with Enron "" to the detriment of his family life .
Skilling sold more than $ 22 m of shares in the 18 months before Enron 's collapse .
Sherron Watkins Watkins , a finance executive , was the whistleblower who wrote a memo to Jeffrey Skilling warning that dubious bookkeeping could cause Enron to "" implode in a wave of accounting scandals "" .
She testified that she met Mr Skilling to discuss her concerns about what she believed to be fraudulent accounting .
The firm conducted a bogus investigation of her claims , using its regular auditors , she said .
Referring to defence allegations that Enron 's accounting was simply creative , she replied : "" Accounting just does n't get that creative . ""
She has since written a bestselling book and regularly appears on the lecture circuit ."
2006-05-26,"Now it can be stated unequivocally .
Enron , the company that six years ago was America 's seventh largest , was led by fraudsters and conspirators .
Yesterday 's guilty verdicts on Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling are the final proof of how far greed and corruption infiltrated US corporate life during the dotcom years .
But the trial also illustrated another aspect of the American way : over there , they clean their corporate messes very quickly .
Imagine Enron , which finally collapsed in December 2001 , had been British .
On past form - like BCCI - we would probably still be waiting for the Serious Fraud Office to bring charges .
The Department of Trade and Industry would be threatening an inquiry , but would be too timid to step on the toes of the SFO .
The difference in America is the use of plea - bargaining .
The star witness in the Enron trial was the company 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , who accepted 10 years for his role in the fraud and agreed to give testimony .
Inevitably , Fastow and other plea - bargainers were painted by the defence as flawed characters forced to plead guilty to save their own skins and those of their families . ""
These witnesses were radioactive .
They glowed in the dark , "" said one of Lay 's lawyers .
The jury was not deterred one iota - plea - bargaining is well understood over there .
In the usual American way , individual jurors may now be interviewed on television to discuss why they reached their verdict .
That , too , will sound odd to British ears , but such willingness to talk openly is best seen as part of the same legal system that puts an emphasis on establishing facts speedily and practically .
The net result is that convictions have achieved in most of the big turn - of - the - century US corporate scandals .
Executives from Tyco , WorldCom , Adelphi and Enron are behind bars , or soon will be .
It is quite impressive .
Sir Ken 's title
It took Sir Ken Morrison until 2004 to catch up with the innovation called non - executive directors , so we should not be surprised that he plans to wear a bauble from another corporate era - the title "" life president "" .
It is hard to think of any corporate titan whose reputation has been enhanced by such a non - job .
Sir Chris Gent at Vodafone , despite his credible protestations that the role merely involved showing up at a few parties , found himself the object of such external suspicion that he was obliged to give up the post .
Poor Lord Weinstock at Marconi sat in frustration in his old office - his heart broken , said his friend Lord Hanson - as his successors destroyed his life 's work .
Lord Kalms at Dixons , as it used to be , is perhaps the closest to a success .
His advantage was perhaps that he worked closely with his successor , John Clare , for years .
That will not be the case at Wm Morrison .
Will Sir Ken be able to stop himself from fiddling , or worse ?
When you and your family own 18 % of the shares it 's hard to be uninterested , and you are certainly not disinterested .
The stylish thing would have been to reject the post .
Failing that - and given the proximity of the Gent affair - Sir Ken ought to have made a clear statement that he will not keep an office at Morrison 's headquarters .
It would be a tragedy if , after 50 years at the helm , the founder 's son had to be dragged from the building by outside shareholders .
The sad part is , if Sir Ken pushes things too far , they may just do it .
OFT spells adios
The ultimate poison pill was one verdict on the Office of Fair Trading 's intervention into the battle for BAA .
It 's hard to disagree .
It is now next to impossible for Ferrovial to know with reasonable clarity what it would be buying .
BAA 's shareholders would have preferred to see a full - blooded fight , but a competition inquiry , if that 's what we get , is not such a bad outcome for them .
The company 's dividend will still have to be cranked up by 50 % , and a break - up of BAA ( though still odds against ) may enhance value .
The chief mechanism by which Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted would be encouraged to compete against each other is landing charges .
But the regulator has kept charges down to the point where Heathrow is actually one of the cheaper places in Europe to land a passenger airplane .
Given the congestion across the skies of the south - east , landing charges in a deregulated world may rise not fall .
Yet it is very odd that one company should be allowed such a monopoly .
It 's a shame for Ferrovial , but an inquiry is justified .

2006-05-28,"After listening to 56 witnesses over 15 weeks of trial , eight men and four women on a jury in Houston , Texas , decided unanimously that the two former chief executives of Enron were guilty on several counts of fraud and conspiracy .
They had spent nearly six days of deliberations to reach their verdicts , and followed it up with a press conference to explain their reasons .
From what they said , it was clear that Enron was an example of a jury trial at its best .
Yet this is precisely the kind of case which our government wishes to remove from juries in England and Wales .
So far , the plan to do away with jury trial for certain complex or lengthy fraud cases has been thwarted by stiff parliamentary opposition , but the government intends trying again .
It should reconsider , and look to the Enron case for the reason why jury trials for fraud should remain .
What emerged from the jurors ' press conference was ample proof that even what seemed on the surface to be a complicated fraud can be reduced to a simple question , well within a juror 's capacity to answer .
The issue - in England and the US - is almost always whether or not the accused has been dishonest . ""
It 's hard to believe , "" said the Enron jury 's forewoman , "" that someone , such a hands - on individual , could not possibly know the things that were going on within the company .
"" Others said much the same .
Almost all the English judges and lawyers I 've spoken to on the subject agree that the main reason for expensive fraud trials collapsing or "" going wrong "" - resulting in unwarranted acquittals - is not the jury 's fault but that of the prosecution not putting the case comprehensibly coupled with a judge 's laxity or incompetence .
There is no reason for a well - prosecuted and tightly managed fraud trial to be excessively long or beyond a jury 's comprehension .
Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , argues that some fraud trials will need to be lengthy and require much evidence to be given , to reflect the breadth and seriousness of the criminal conduct alleged .
Finding jurors who have the time to spend several months on a case would lead to the jury not being chosen at random , and therefore not reflecting the community , quite apart from the burden on individual jurors .
But there will not be many such trials , and the difficulty of finding capable jurors has been greatly exaggerated .
There remains the suspicion that the government 's real motive in wanting to curtail jury trials is to save costs .
What the government proposes is unnecessary and based on unconvincing arguments .
What problems exist can be solved .
Or does the government believe that what 12 Texans can do excellently is beyond an English jury ?"
2006-06-23,"Kevin Spacey has revealed that convicted Enron chief Kenneth Lay served as the model for his icy , megalomaniacal portrayal of Lex Luthor in the upcoming Superman Returns . ""
Bryan [ Singer , the director ] from the very beginning when we first started talking about it said to me he wanted this Lex Luthor to be a much more bitter , much more angry , much more evil nemesis for Superman , "" Spacey told The Tonight Show host Jay Leno last night , adding , "" I had a ball doing it ; it was such an iconic part . ""
The two - time Oscar winner and artistic director of London 's Old Vic theatre last worked with Singer on the 1995 ensemble thriller The Usual Suspects , which earned him an Academy Award for best supporting actor .
Spacey , who worked on Superman Returns for six weeks in Sydney , also revealed that he had a rather interesting team - building strategy - to inject spice into proceedings , he would drive around the set on a golf cart , brandishing a bullhorn shouting , "" Superman must die ! ""
Superman Returns has already drawn rave advance reviews from American critics - it opens in the US on June 28 , in the UK on July 14 ."
2006-06-27,"Three UK bankers today exhausted their efforts to avoid extradition to the US where they face fraud charges in connection with the Enron scandal .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are likely to be flown to the US next month after the European court of human rights ( ECHR ) in Strasbourg rejected their request for a delay in their extradition .
The former NatWest bankers , who have said they are innocent and should be tried in Britain , now face trial in Houston , Texas where the bankrupt US energy firm was headquartered .
In a letter to the London law firm Jeffrey Green Russell , the ECHR said it saw no immediate cause to overturn the decision of the British courts to send the trio for trial in the US .
A court official wrote that it had been decided "" in the circumstances , not to indicate to the government of the United Kingdom ...
the interim measure you are seeking "" .
Today 's setback for the trio came after the House of Lords last week threw out their request to appeal against an earlier verdict from the high court which said the men could be tried in the US .
"" We have now done everything possible to establish the rights of three UK citizens to be investigated and , if appropriate , prosecuted in the UK but all we have established is that UK citizens have no such rights against an extradition request made by the US , "" said the men 's lawyer , Mark Spragg .
The case has sparked anger and concern among British business leaders and human rights campaigners , who have criticised the use of a new extradition treaty originally designed to target terrorist suspects after September 11 .
They have also criticised the unsymmetrical nature of the treaty .
Under the treaty , the US is able to demand a Briton 's extradition without having to show there is a case to answer based on available evidence .
In contrast , Britain has to prove its case in a US court to extradite US citizens to the UK .
The US has still not ratified the treaty .
Commenting in light of the ECHR ruling on the Natwest 3 , Sir Digby Jones , director - general of the CBI , said : "" There is no prima facie case against these three men .
They represent no threat to society yet they will still be banged up in a US prison with rapists and drug addicts , deprived of their liberty for up to two years , even while a case is compiled against them .
If targeted in Britain for the same offence they would remain on bail and keep their liberty up to and during the trial . ""
This is not about going soft on white - collar crime .
If these three are guilty , they should be treated just as those responsible for any other crime .
But guilty or not , they should be treated fairly . ""
The prime minister told the Commons in March this year that the he did not accept the rights of British citizens were subject to unfairness through this treaty , but it is manifestly the case .
I urge Tony Blair to intervene to defend the human rights of British citizens that are being abused by a country which is supposedly our greatest ally . ""
The three bankers who worked for NatWest Bank , now part of Royal Bank of Scotland , are alleged to have conspired with Enron executives , including Enron 's former finance director , Andrew Fastow , over the sale of a stake in an Enron entity in 2000 for less than it was worth , which made them $ 7.3 m ( £ 4 m ) .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after revealing that it inflated its profits and filed false accounts to hide debts ."
2006-06-27,"A rash of corporate governance regulations , following the collapse of Enron , helped Britain 's top accounting firms to increase revenues by £ 1bn last year , figures published later this week will reveal .
The 14 % rise in fee income , up from £ 6.7bn in 2004 to £ 7.7bn last year , was fuelled by growing demand for advice on how to comply with rules , including US regulations that affect British companies listed in New York .
Accountants were widely criticised for auditing errors in a series of high - profile corporate frauds , including Enron and Worldcom .
Arthur Andersen , auditor for both companies , collapsed under the weight of legal actions and regulatory investigations .
Tighter rules on both sides of the Atlantic to prevent further corporate collapses hit profits .
Auditors were forced to bid for lucrative consultancy contracts , bringing greater competition and putting downward pressure on margins .
The US Congress responded to the crisis with the Sarbanes - Oxley rules , which brought in a long list of corporate governance checks .
Separately , a programme to introduce global accounting standards also increased demand for accounting services .
Profits soared and the fees per partner - one of the key measures of profitability in the industry - increased by 13 % .
The Big Four firm KPMG saw the biggest rise in income with a jump of 20 % to £ 1.3bn .
Partners commonly earn more than £ 500,000 a year and staff bonuses and a profit share increased by 57 % a head on the previous year .
Accountancy magazine , which compiled figures on the finances of the top 60 accountancy firms , said 2005 proved to be a bumper year .
The editor , Chris Quick , said : "" Partners of accountancy firms will be toasting a mixed bunch for their success .
Messrs Sarbanes and Oxley for their lucrative legislation ; Brussels bureaucrats for introducing International Financial Reporting Standards ; and , of course , former Enron chiefs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay for starting the crisis that led to such a backlash .
But they have n't had much time to celebrate .
More business means a bigger workload , and a tight recruitment market means fewer people to share it with .
"" The question now for big firms is how they maintain their fee income levels now that Sarbanes - Oxley and IFRS changes are starting to bed - down inside companies .
PricewaterhouseCoopers said that Sarbanes - Oxley had turned a good year "" into a very good year "" but there were other factors , including a rise in corporate activity and advisory work in areas such as pensions .
KPMG said the firm 's most successful year on record was partly due to a 48 % rise in income from advising companies on corporate governance and other regulatory work , coupled with a 38 % rise in income from stock market and private equity transactions ."
2006-06-27,"Three former NatWest bankers , wanted in the United States in connection with the Enron scandal , face extradition after their last ditch appeal to the European Court of Human Rights failed .
The court decided yesterday not to grant an interim stay of extradition .
It will examine the merits of the case but will not stop the removal of the so - called NatWest Three to the US .
With the failure of their last possible legal challenge , David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby can be extradited to the US immediately and are expected to be tried in Houston , Texas .
They are accused of conspiring with senior Enron executives in a $ 20 m ( £ 11.5 m ) profit - skimming fraud .
In February , the High Court rejected their lawyers ' argument that the offences were not extraditable .
Last week , the law lords also rejected an appeal .
If convicted , the three could face a sentence of 28 years and legal costs of $ 1.5 m each .
Their appeal to the European Court of Human Rights centred on a challenge to Britain 's "" fast - track "" extradition procedure to the US .
Under the procedure - introduced in 2003 to deal with terrorist suspects - the US is not required to produce evidence in an application for extradition from the UK .
It has been criticised by both business , and by civil liberties campaigners as one - sided . ""
Remarkably , the UK has made a treaty which allows the US to obtain the return of suspects from Britain without producing any evidence of guilt but requires such evidence to be produced to a US court before an American suspect can be extradited to Britain , "" said Michael Birnbaum QC , a barrister specialising in extradition cases .
Business leaders , including CBI chairman Sir Digby Jones , will march through London tomorrow in protest against the extradition procedure .
Mr Jones said the three men "" represent no threat to society , yet they will still be banged up in a US prison with rapists and drug addicts , deprived of their liberty for up to two years even while a case is compiled "" .
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said : "" I can not think of a better case of ' first they came for the white collar worker , then they came for me ' . """
2006-07-04,"Sir Menzies Campbell today stepped up the campaign to halt the extradition of three former Natwest bankers to the United States saying emergency legislation should be rushed through parliament to prevent them leaving Britain .
The Liberal Democrat leader described the plight of the ' Natwest Three ' as a "" constitutional disgrace "" because the extradition treaty under which the men are being sent to America has not itself been ratified by the US .
Accused of an Enron - related fraud , David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are expected to be sent to the US this month after losing legal appeals against the move .
The three men deny any criminal conduct and have always insisted that if there is a case against them , it should be tried in England because that is where , at least in part , the alleged offences occurred .
Sir Menzies today became the latest high - profile supporter of their campaign to be tried in Britain following demands by Richard Lambert , the new director of the Confederation of British Industry , and Tory MPs for the home secretary to intervene .
Last week 100 pinstriped protestors marched from Pall Mall to the Home Office to hand in a letter of protest at their extradition to John Reid .
This morning , Sir Menzies said the department should act to put right an injustice caused by "" a piece of ineptitude "" by the government .
Under the treaty - ratified by London but not Washington - no prima facie evidence has to be produced and it does not matter that the alleged offence happened in the UK and is not being pursued by British authorities .
Sir Menzies demanded action to halt the extradition .
"" What they could do is put an Act of Parliament quickly through , suspending any obligations under the treaty until such time as the United States Senate - which has the constitutional responsibility in America - ratifies the treaty , "" he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
"" We have this extraordinary situation in which we essentially have a unilateral treaty .
Both countries signed this treaty .
Britain has ratified it .
We 've changed our domestic legislation so it conforms to the treaty . ""
But in the United States the Senate - largely under the influence of the Irish lobby , which is determined to prevent any question of suspected IRA terrorists being extradited back to the United Kingdom - simply refuses to sign .
"" It 's a piece of ineptitude on the part of the Government , and particularly the Home Office , which has got to be put right .
"" There are indications that Home Secretary John Reid is coming under pressure from senior colleagues to act , he said .
And it is vital he does , despite facing other serious challenges , he added .
"" This is a constitutional disgrace and the Government should be willing to put it right , "" he said .
A Conservative MP , James Brokenshire , has added to the pressure on the government by tabling a parliamentary question to Gordon Brown asking whether the chancellor has made any representations to the home secretary regarding changes to the Extradition Act 2003 , the law under which the men are being sent to the US ."
2006-07-05,"Kenneth Lay , the man at the centre of one of the biggest business scandals in US history , has died , his family said today .
The 64-year - old , who founded Enron , died at his holiday home in Aspen , Colorado following a "" massive heart attack "" , according to US press reports .
Police officers and an ambulance were sent to the holiday home in Old Snowmass early this morning , and transported Lay to Aspen Valley hospital , where he was later pronounced dead . ""
A coroner 's autopsy is pending .
There will be no further information or press release from this office until autopsy results are available later this week , "" the county said in a statement .
Lay was awaiting sentencing for his convictions following the collapse of Enron , the energy company he had built up , in December 2001 .
In May , Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's former chief executive were convicted on fraud charges after a four - month trial .
Lay was expected to have faced the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison , and sentencing was set for September 11 .
At their trial in Houston , where Enron had its headquarters , both men were accused of repeatedly lying to investors and employees about the company 's financial state before its collapse .
Prosecutors said the two knew of the various accounting subterfuges used to mask debts and failing ventures .
The accounting tricks finally came to light in late 2001 .
Investors fled in panic , and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy .
Lay and Skilling denied any wrongdoing , blaming the company 's failure on bad publicity and a loss of market confidence .
Lay was found guilty on all six counts of fraud and conspiracy , with a combined maximum punishment of 45 years .
During cross - examination , Lay claimed he had done all he could to avoid Enron 's collapse , which he described as the "" most painful thing "" in his life .
The collapse was the first in a series of scandals that rocked Wall Street at the end of the internet boom .
Allegations of fraud against some of the biggest names in US business - including the telecoms firm WorldCom and the cable company Adelphia - rapidly followed ."
2006-07-05,"Shortly before his death , at the age of 64 following a heart attack , the former Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay lamented that he had lived both the American dream and the American nightmare .
Born into rural poverty , he had built an immense fortune at Enron , the Houston energy firm .
He shaped himself as a leading light among the oil barons of Texas ; he was famously dubbed "" Kenny boy "" by George Bush , and at one point was tipped to enter the administration .
Then five years ago , he lost it all .
Nightmare was an apposite description , although few extended much sympathy for his plight .
Enron was engulfed by scandal and Lay 's reputation shattered .
Thousands of people lost their jobs and life savings as the company filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 .
Lay and Enron became shorthand for corporate fraud and late - night comics looking for an easy laugh .
Lay testified in court that he was $ 100 m in debt .
He was finally convicted in May on six charges of fraud and conspiracy .
He was due to be sentenced in September , and had been expected to be jailed for between 20 and 30 years .
He maintained his innocence til the end .
Lay was born in Tyrone , Missouri .
His father , Omer , was a Baptist minister who made money from selling farm equipment and working at a department store .
His parents had little formal educaton .
Lay did what he could to suplement the family income , delivering newspapers and moving lawns .
"" I spent a lot of time on a tractor and had a lot of time to think , "" he once told the Houston Chronicle .
"" I was enamoured with business and industry .
It was so different from the world in which I was living . ""
He took an economics MA at the University of Missouri and , in 1970 , a doctorate at the University of Houston .
Lay began his career at the oil major Exxon in 1965 as an economist .
After a spell in the US navy , he had his first brush with government , serving as under - secretary for energy ( 1972 - 74 ) .
For the next eight years , he held various executive positions in the oil industry , including , fatefully , at Houston Natural Gas .
In 1985 , the company merged with a rival , InterNorth , and was renamed Enron .
Lay became chief executive .
He refashioned the business from a natural gas pipeline company into the biggest name in energy trading .
At the height of its hubris , Enron set up a business designed to trade broadband capacity as a commodity .
For many observers , Lay 's rise and fall could be viewed through the prism of the "" new economy "" boom and bust .
Enron became , fleetingly , the seventh largest company in America , and Lay was lionised on magazine covers .
At his peak , he was said to be worth $ 400 m .
He and his wife , Linda , became a fixture in Houston , where Lay , widely regarded as an affable character , enjoyed great popularity and hosted countless charity events .
He supported the arts , helped create the Houston Holocaust museum and financed the professional baseball park .
He regularly attended his downtown church , where , according to local reports , the congregation remained supportive throughout , despite members losing large sums in the Enron collapse .
Lay continued as Enron chief executive until February 2001 , when he moved to the chairman 's office and made way for his ambitious protege , Jeffrey Skilling .
But the cracks were beginning to show in Enron 's facade .
Skilling resigned six months later , and Lay stepped back into the chief executive role .
Things rapidly began to unravel .
In October 2001 , the company spooked Wall Street by reporting losses of $ 1bn .
Investors fled in panic and in December it filed for what was then the biggest ever bankruptcy .
The Enron collapse began a sordid period in American corporate history as a welter of financial fraud was uncovered at big name companies .
Lay and Skilling were accused of a vast conspiracy designed to give the impression that the company was in better financial shape than it actually was .
They were convicted of using accounting trickery to fudge the numbers , and off - shore vehicles to hide debts and inflate revenues .
Skilling was regarded as the chief architect of the fraud ; the lesser charges against Lay suggested he had carried on the deception after resuming the top job .
Lay endured four years of uncertainty before the government brought his case to trial this year .
He had refused to be cowed , although he and Linda made fewer public appearances .
Last December he risked jeers by taking to the podium at the Houston Forum to rail against his persecution in front of a gathering of businessmen and women , claiming he had been a victim of "" political and public hysteria "" .
The breakthrough for prosecutors had come in early 2004 , when they secured a guilty plea from former finance chief Andrew Fastow .
Both Lay and Skilling contended that Fastow alone was to blame .
When he finally appeared on the stand , Lay rued the fact that he had taken the chief executive job back after Skilling 's departure .
"" I was just a couple of months away from being 60 , "" he said .
"" I was looking forward to a somewhat more normal life , a more relaxed life . ""
He is survived by Linda , whom he married in 1982 , and five children .

Had he lived Lay faced spending the rest of his life in prison .
It would have been an ignominious end for an executive who once was the toast of Wall Street , his company praised for its "" innovative "" approach to finance .
It turns out that Enron cooked the books by concealing its huge debts to give investors a completely false image of the company .
When it went bust in December 2001 , lots of Enron employees and investors in the company were left with shares worth nothing .
To the end Lay protested his innocence , blaming the collapse of the firm that he had built up from a regional natural gas pipeline company .
Through a series of takeovers Enron became America 's eighth largest company .

2006-07-05,"Leading City figures called on the government yesterday to suspend Britain 's "" manifestly unfair "" extradition treaty with the United States and stop the removal of three former NatWest executives to face trial in Texas on Enron - related fraud charges .

Under the fast - track extradition procedure introduced in 2003 , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie evidence when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain .
In the case of the NatWest Three , however , evidence has been provided in court .
A Home Office spokesperson said it was for the prosecuting authorities , not the home secretary , to decide whether the NatWest Three should be tried in Britain instead of the US .
No criminal proceedings have been brought in Britain against the three men .
Mr Spragg said he had asked the Serious Fraud Office , the Financial Services Authority and the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate the case but all had declined .
He said that while his clients hoped the treaty would be revoked , it was now probably too late to stop their extradition .
Tony Blair also acknowledged the growing pressure over the extradition treaty yesterday .
Pressed on the issue at prime minister 's questions by the Liberal Democrat leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , Mr Blair dismissed opposition calls to suspend the treaty but said he had asked officials to "" see whether there is support or assurances we can give so if [ the NatWest Three ] are extradited they are given the opportunity to be bailed . ""
Mr Spragg said it was important that his clients were set bail conditions under which they would be allowed to return to Britain to work , be with their families and prepare their case .
Otherwise , he said , it would be "" just a cosier prison cell "" .
A Downing Street spokesman said : "" We are not seeking to interfere in the legal process but we recognise there is legitimate concern about the bail conditions .
Britain will be putting this point of view to the Americans via our legal channels . """
2006-07-06,"What is the latest development with Enron ?
Kenneth Lay , the Enron founder , died of a "" massive "" heart attack on July 5 at his holiday home in Aspen , the exclusive Colorado ski resort .
He was 64 .
In May , Lay was found guilty of six counts of fraud and conspiracy and was due to be sentenced in September .
He expected to spend the rest of his life in prison .
Lay is the second top Enron executive to die since the company collapsed .
In 2002 , Clifford Baxter was found dead after shooting himself in a Houston suburb .
What took place at the trial ?
The trial in January of Lay and Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's former chief executive , was one of the most eagerly anticipated in the corporate world .
Both men denied 42 charges relating to their role in the accounting scandal .
The former Enron finance director , Andy Fastow , testified against his former bosses in exchange for a maximum jail sentence of 10 years .
The jury found Skilling and Lay guilty .
What happened to Enron ?
The Texan energy company filed for bankruptcy in 2001 - at that time the biggest corporate collapse in US history .
Named "" America 's most innovative company "" by Fortune magazine for six years running , the firm unravelled after it was alleged that the concealment of huge debts had given investors a completely false image of the company .
Enron went from being a company claiming assets worth almost £ 62bn to declaring bankruptcy within a period of three months .
Share prices collapsed from about $ 95 to $ 1 .
Enron emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 .
Its current operations involve handling key assets and preparing the sale of its remaining businesses .
What kind of company was it ?
Enron started life as a regional natural gas pipeline company , the result of a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth in 1985 .
Lay was credited with transforming Enron into the world 's largest energy trading company and America 's seventh - biggest corporation .
How did the corporation become so successful ?
Enron was quick to exploit opportunities when deregulation in the late 1980s allowed users to buy gas or electricity from different producers .
It specialised in contracts to deliver natural gas , electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities at future dates .
It also sold financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices .
What was Wall Street 's attitude towards Enron ?
Enron soon became a darling on Wall Street as analysts lauded the company for bringing hi - tech and complex finance to the dull business of supplying energy .
Enron also cashed in on dotcom mania with Enrononline , a web - based trading service .
When did the company start to unravel ?
The rot began in August 2001 with the abrupt resignation of Skilling , who cited "" entirely personal reasons "" .
At the time , Lay denied there were any problems but Skilling 's hasty exit set off alarm bells and Enron 's shares started to drift downwards .
What precipitated its collapse ?
The situation deteriorated dramatically in October 2001 , when Enron had to set aside $ 35 m ( £ 24 m ) to reflect losses in two complex partnerships that had been set up in 1999 to conceal its large debt .
Enron was also forced to knock $ 1.2bn off shareholder equity at the time , a move that sent its share price into freefall .
Why did the collapse make waves politically ?
It emerged that Lay had conversations with Paul O'Neill , the treasury secretary , and Donald Evans , the commerce secretary , just weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy .
Lay asked for help to stop a private credit rating agency downgrading Enron 's debt .
Officials deny any intervention but questions persist because of Enron 's close connections with the Bush administration .
How close was Enron to the Bush administration ?
Lay was an old friend of the president and Enron executives contributed more than $ 500,000 to George Bush 's various campaigns .
More specifically , the White House faced questions about six meetings between Enron executives and the vice - president , Dick Cheney , or his staff that took place in 2001 when the Bush administration was formulating US energy policy .
Did the firm 's collapse lead to any changes ?
In July 2002 , the president signed into law harsh penalties for anyone found guilty of corporate wrongdoing .
Congress subsequently passed the Sarbanes - Oxley legislation , which tightened compliance for US companies .
But that was small consolation for those who lost money through Enron .
Investors lost their shirts and many of Enron 's 19,000 employees lost their savings because they belonged to retirement plans based on Enron shares .
Yet top executives were able to sell their Enron shares before they became worthless .
How did Enron 's finances escape scrutiny ?
Arthur Andersen , Enron 's auditor , was convicted of obstructing justice by destroying a "" significant "" number of documents relating to the Enron case in June 2002 .
Once one of the "" Big Five "" accounting firms , the company voluntarily surrendered its licences to practise as a certified public accountant in the US in August 2002 .
Andersen closed down in the US and agreed to pay $ 60 m ( £ 32 m ) to settle legal claims over its role in Enron 's collapse .
In May 2005 , the US supreme court overturned the conviction , saying jury instructions had been "" flawed "" , but Andersen is unlikely to return to business .
Did Enron operate outside the US ?
By 1999 , Enron was involved in a quarter of all electricity and natural gas deals in the world and had major operations in Brazil and India .
Enron was particularly disliked in the developing world after the company became embroiled in one of India 's biggest corruption scandals , in which large sums were paid to politicians involved in the privatisation of electricity firms .
Did it have assets in the UK ?
Four thousand people worked for Enron or companies it owned in the UK .
Enron owned Wessex Water , which employs 1,400 workers , and power stations on Teeside .
Wessex Water was sold to the Malaysian utility YTL Power in May.
The Enron jinx struck Wessex Water when its boss , Colin Skellett , was accused of accepting a £ 1 m bribe during the sale .
He was cleared of the charges five months after being arrested by the police .
How was Lord Wakeham involved ?
Lord Wakeham was the first British political victim of the Enron debacle .
The former Conservative cabinet member stepped down as the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission "" as a matter of honour "" while his links to Enron were examined by US investigators .
How was he linked to Enron ?
Lord Wakeham joined Enron as a non - executive director in 1994 after serving as energy minister under Lady Thatcher , when he approved Enron 's purchase of a big gas power station in 1989 .
He also sat on Enron 's audit and compliance committee , which was supposed to scrutinise the complex transactions between Enron and its controversial partnerships .
The company paid him a reported £ 80,000 a year ."
2006-07-06,"The former Enron chairman whose name became a byword for boardroom deceit and corruption , Ken Lay , died in an exclusive ski resort yesterday while awaiting sentence for his involvement in America 's biggest ever corporate fraud .
Police were called to Lay 's holiday home near Aspen , Colorado , in the early hours of the morning .
The 64-year - old was rushed to the casualty department of a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead by doctors .
There was no official confirmation of the cause of his death but a family friend , pastor Steve Wende of Houston 's First United Methodist Church , said Lay had suffered a massive coronary : "" His death was totally unexpected .
Apparently , his heart simply gave out . ""
The Colorado authorities said the reason for his collapse would be determined by an autopsy .
The death of Lay , who protested his innocence to his final days , shocked his supporters and critics alike .
It happened just six weeks after his criminal conviction on six counts of conspiracy , wire fraud and securities fraud over the collapse of the energy trading multinational .
A jury found he had been instrumental in billions of dollars worth of accounting irregularities which prompted the collapse of Enron , once America 's seventh largest company with more than $ 100bn ( £ 54bn ) in annual revenue .
Each of Lay 's convictions carried terms of between five and 10 years and he was expected to spend the rest of his life in prison .
A family spokeswoman , Kelly Kimberley , said Lay 's five children and 12 grandchildren were being informed of his passing : "" The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate and out of respect for the family we will release further details at a later time .
"" The son of a preacher from a small town in Missouri , Lay enjoyed a meteoric rise to the heights of American society .
He was nicknamed "" Kenny boy "" by President Bush and lived a lavish lifestyle with more than a dozen homes and a personal wealth of more than $ 400 m .
The company 's collapse left 21,000 people jobless and Lay became the butt of hatred and of jokes - one ex - employee did a roaring trade in t - shirts with slogans such as "" I got Lay'd by Enron "" .
Former employees yesterday suggested there was some irony in the venue of Lay 's death - a luxurious chalet in one of America 's most expensive resorts .
In Houston , callers to radio stations expressed outrage that he had been allowed to continue enjoying such conditions .
Mimi Schwartz , co - author of Power Failure , a book about the demise of Enron , said there was still a great deal of anger in Houston : "" People wanted to see the end of the story .
The narrative people were buying into was that the story would end with Ken Lay being led away in handcuffs and shackles . ""
But she added that he would also be remembered as a philanthropist who gave a lot of money to Texan charities .
Although Lay often looked pale and strained in court , he was not known to be suffering any serious health problems .
Short , with grey hair and an easy smile , Lay was regarded as a relatively sympathetic character in comparison with his co - defendant , former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling , who has a reputation for being abrasive .
Lay is the second top Enron executive to die since the company 's collapse .
In 2002 , Enron 's former vice chairman and head of strategy , Cliff Baxter , committed suicide in a Houston suburb , leaving a note saying : "" Once there was great pride , now it 's gone ... the pain is overwhelming . ""
Throughout his trial , Lay blamed financial wrongdoing on Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and claimed he was personally in the dark about it .
Lay maintained that the company 's collapse was down to a sudden loss of confidence among customers and investors , effectively a "" run on the bank "" prompted by opportunistic short - sellers on the stock market .
But prosecutors said the company was financially a house of cards with largely illusory profits , kept standing by increasingly elaborate accounting tricks dreamed up by Lay , Skilling and their senior colleagues .
Lay 's refusal to accept responsibility and his apparent lack of remorse enraged many of those who lost their livelihoods at Enron .
Even when he was convicted , he remained aloof , declaring : "" I firmly believe that I am innocent of the charges against me , as I have said from day one .
I still firmly believe that to this day .

2006-07-07,"Merrill Lynch yesterday agreed to pay $ 29.5 m ( £ 16 m ) to settle claims that it helped the failed energy company Enron to commit fraud .
The Wall Street bank will also give up almost $ 74 m of claims on the Enron estate , but is not admitting wrongdoing and could still receive about $ 10 m from claims against Enron outside the settlement .
Merrill is the seventh bank to settle in the litigation in which Enron accused the banks of helping previous management hide debt and inflate results .
Among those that had already settled , JP Morgan Chase last year agreed to pay Enron $ 350 m ."
2006-07-07,"The Enron fraudster Ken Lay is to be cremated at a private service in Colorado tomorrow and will have his ashes buried in Aspen - the luxury ski resort where he died on Wednesday .
Lay 's family said a memorial service will be held in Houston next week .
Lay , who was chairman of Enron , was awaiting sentencing for his role in the energy firm 's implosion and was expected to spend the rest of his life in prison .
His lawyers intend to argue for his convictions to be struck out because his death , caused by a massive heart attack , means he will have no opportunity to appeal ."
2006-07-08,"The strange story of Kenneth L Lay came to an abrupt end last week when , seven weeks after being convicted for his part in the Enron scandal , he suffered a heart attack and died at his Colorado mountain home .
Nearly five years since Enron collapsed , there is common agreement over what the firm symbolises - greedy behaviour , shady accounting and the absolute brazenness of US corporate corruption in the Nineties .
But obituary writers and business commentators remain in conflict over what exactly Lay , the chairman who founded the firm and later presided over its spectacular collapse , stood for .
He may have been convicted for his role in the Enron scandal but he was also a deeply religious man and a considerable benefactor of charity .
The day after Lay 's death , at 64 , the New York Post had no doubts , offering readers a mugshot of the executive adjacent to a picture of a wooden coffin .
The accompanying headline read : ' Make sure he 's in it ' .
But less shrill voices in the press have suggested that Lay was more of a tragic fool .
The judgment is significant because Lay played a pivotal role in shaping US business in the Nineties and , in the aftermath of Enron 's collapse , its highly regulated future .
During Enron 's rise , he was celebrated for inventing a new kind of company , a trading operation that thwarted convention and dealt in everything .
After the fall , Lay was seen as a villain who symbolised an era of corporate chicanery .
But a true villain tends to know the extent of his wrongdoing .
Lay , it seems , had only limited capacity to understand his error . '
In the end , it was his desire to see things as he wished them to be , not as they were , that was his fatal flaw , ' said New York Times columnist Joe Nocera .
People close to Lay say he could not really understand what the jury meant by convicting him .
Lay 's defence was to maintain that he had done nothing wrong .
This was partially true - many of the fraudulent methods Enron used were arguably legal .
He was not convicted of masterminding the massive fraud at Enron -
that fell to CFO Andrew Fastow - but in making misleading statements between August and November 2001 when the firm was already collapsing .
Even CEO Jeffrey Skilling , convicted with Lay , maintained his boss ' just did n't get it ' and his statement after the verdict bolstered his image as corporate martyr : ' My family and I believe that God is in control and , indeed , He does work all things for good for those who love the Lord . '
In death , he may get his way .
Had he lived , he was planning to launch a vigorous appeal but he will now have his conviction erased anyway .
Under prior decisions by the regional US Court of Appeal that covers Houston , a person who dies before his appeal is completed is n't considered convicted .
Since he may no longer be considered guilty of felony , efforts to seize Lay 's remaining assets will also come to an end .
In the end , Lay 's greatest error was his failure to judge character .
It was Lay who allowed Fastow to set up asset partnerships with firms controlled by members of the board .
Lay , it seems certain , thought that Fastow was doing the company a favour .
Was it lying or wishful thinking ?
Who knows ?
Cardiologists last week said a fatal heart attack would not be surprising in a man who had watched his reputation collapse and who faced incarceration .
In September Lay was due to be sentenced to 20 years in prison ."
2006-07-08,"John Reid faces an embarrassing defeat in the House of Lords this week over controversial laws governing the extradition of Britons to the United States following the case of the so - called NatWest Three .
The trio of former bank executives is due to be put on a plane this week to face possible charges in connection with the Enron fraud allegations , with ministers insisting last night there would be no last - minute clemency despite pleas from the men 's families , opposition politicians and civil liberties groups .
Now a cross - party coalition of peers is expected to back rebel amendments to the new Police and Justice Bill which would overturn a law passed in 2003 under which their extradition is being sought , making it far harder for the US to extract Britons in future .
The peers say the Lords voted for the original measure thinking it would be used in the war on terrorism , and it was unclear how widely it would be invoked for other offences . '
We hope it will make the government pause and think about this , ' said a Conservative party source in the Lords . '
We have support from the Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers . '
A defeat will not save the NatWest Three , however , and is likely to be overturned in the Commons .
Ministers yesterday rejected calls to spare David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew , and Giles Darby , who are accused over an £ 11 m fraud in which the bank was allegedly advised to sell off part of an Enron firm for less than its market value .
Attorney - General Lord Goldsmith said in a letter to his Conservative shadow Dominic Grieve that ' where allegedly criminal conduct occurs in more than one country , as will often be the case with fraud ' the rule was for the prosecution to take place in the country where proceedings began .
But critics argue that the men could spend years in American jails awaiting trial and that if any part of a fraud was committed in the UK it should be tried in this country .
The Lords amendments would require the US to produce prima facie evidence of wrongdoing before seeking extradition , more stringent than the current requirement to show probable cause - roughly the standard of proof needed for UK police to make an initial arrest .
A Home Office spokesman said the extradition laws had never been intended simply to cover terrorism and that the 2003 act merely brought America into the same category as 47 other countries with which Britain has extradition agreements .
The Home Secretary will seek to overturn the rebel amendments in the Commons if he is defeated in the Lords ."
2006-07-08,"The increasingly noisy campaign for Tony Blair to intervene and prevent the so - called ' NatWest Three ' from being extradited to the United States misses the point .
The three men - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - face charges related to the collapse of US energy giant Enron in 2001 when they worked for NatWest , which is now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland .
Business luminaries such as Sir Christopher Gent , the former Vodafone boss , and Philip Green , the retail entrepreneur , claim the extradition treaty is one - sided because the Americans have refused to grant reciprocal powers for Britain to extradite US citizens .
I do not disagree with their argument .
My complaint is that no one is owning up to what really lies behind all the hullabaloo .
If these individuals go down , they will be banged up for heaven knows
how many years in a state institution because there is a witch hunt in the US for those involved in corporate scandals .
Certainly , the trial will not be like a high - profile fraud case in Britain , which usually ends with the culprits serving six months in Ford open prison and being allowed home at weekends .
What the NatWest Three 's supporters really want , quite understandably , is for the trio to face British , not US , justice .
But why do n't they tell it like it is ?
Matalan manoeuvres hang faithful out to dry The farce continues at discount clothes retailer Matalan , where chairman and founder John Hargreaves is attempting to take the company private .
Do n't expect Hargreaves to be generous : the market expects a low - ball bid of 180p a share , which means that it will be pitched roughly where the stock price closed on Friday .
In normal circumstances , companies can expect a 30 per cent takeover premium , but the Matalan situation is anything but normal .
Hargreaves and his family hold 53 per cent of the equity , so accepted standards of corporate governance fly out of the window .
There is a clear conflict of interest if Hargreaves wants to buy the company as he will want to pay the minimum , while the other shareholders - City pension and insurance funds - will want to get the best deal possible .
But minority shareholders should n't feel too peeved : they must have known what they were taking on when Matalan floated and Hargreaves kept a large chunk of the equity .
If there is a lesson here , it is that companies led by entrepreneurs who are also big shareholders can be risky investments .
That said , Hargreaves 's threat to push for a dividend cut was an aggressive tactic that had the effect of softening the share price and making Matalan cheaper to buy .
How convenient for Hargreaves .
And here 's another thing :
Matalan is far from a spent force .
Oriel Securities has a price target of 270p a share , or £ 1 above the current value .
Matalan has had a tough couple of years but Oriel reckons the worst is over .
But who is going to reap the benefits ?
Hargreaves and his private equity backers , assuming they can borrow enough cash to fund an £ 800 m bid .
The losers will be those shareholders who stayed with the company , banking on a recovery .
They must be kicking themselves now .
BP 's loss of face is a drama , not a crisis What is happening at BP ?
It seems to roll from one crisis to another .
The latest embarrassment concerns allegations of price - fixing by US staff who trade in the propane gas market out of Houston .
Elsewhere , BP risks reputational damage following an explosion at its Texas City refinery , which killed 15 and injured 500 .
The accident has prompted a grand jury investigation .
Then there is the possibility of a criminal prosecution after 270,000 gallons of crude leaked into Prudhoe Bay , Alaska .
I hear that chief executive Lord Browne 's phone has n't stopped ringing as public relations people vie to revive the group 's reputation .
Browne must also fear that BP and the other oil majors will be landed with a windfall tax when Gordon Brown takes over at Number 10 .
After building up BP into one of Britain 's biggest industrial success stories , is it possible that Browne will leave under a cloud ?
As we report on the opposite page , Browne 's halo does seem to have slipped lately , and some shareholders are reluctant to let him have too much say over nominating his successor when he retires in 2008 .
But lets not forget that BP commands a stock market value of £ 126bn , making it the biggest company in Britain .
It produces 1.5bn barrels of oil per year and in 2005 it recorded profits of $ 22bn , up from $ 17bn a year earlier .
The US courts are fiendishly unpredictable , but a company of BP 's size should be able to withstand even a quite sizeable fine , if it comes to that .
Production has been interrupted , not least because of Hurricane Katrina , but repairs are ahead of schedule and additional supply will shortly come on stream from Angola .
The really big question for BP and its peer group is whether the oil price stays at around $ 70 a barrel or slips back to $ 30 or less .
But for the price of oil to drop , demand from countries such as India and China would have to fall away quite dramatically , and there is no sign of that happening , at least in the near term .
My view is that we are not even halfway through the bull run in commodities in a world where natural resources are becoming ever more scarce .
As for BP , the raw financial truth is that it is throwing off cash - so much so that over the next three years , it will spend £ 50bn returning money to shareholders via special dividends and share buybacks .
BP may have an image problem , but it hardly feels like a company heading for a fall ."
2006-07-10,"The government was today seeking to deflect anger over the case of the so - called NatWest Three bankers by stepping up efforts to persuade the US Senate to ratify an extradition treaty .
The British bankers are preparing to be flown to the US on Thursday , according to their solicitor .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are accused of an £ 11 m fraud in which their former employer NatWest was allegedly advised to sell part of an Enron company for less than it was worth .
Baroness Scotland , the Home Office Minister in the House of Lords , will travel to Washington to deliver the message that Senate ratification is now essential .
The move comes as opposition peers in the Lords this week seek to implement legislation that would immediately stop fast - track extradition to the US .
However , Baroness Scotland , writing in the Financial Times , urged them the peers to delay the move until she had at least had the chance to make the case to the US . ""
If this was to pass , British courts would require less information to surrender a UK citizen to the legal systems of Azerbaijan or Albania than to the US , "" she said .
"" I want to have the opportunity to explain , face to face , our frustration at the Senate 's delay without having to defend a spurious and wrong - headed amendment designed to score an anti - American party political point . ""
The case of the NatWest Three has sparked anger in the British business community and the Lords , because Congress has yet to ratify the treaty that would put in place reciprocal arrangements for the extradition of US nationals to the UK .
A cross - party coalition of peers is expected to back rebel amendments to the new police and justice bill which would overturn a law passed in 2003 under which the extradition of the bankers is being sought .
The Lords amendments would require the US to produce prima facie evidence of wrongdoing before seeking extradition - more stringent than the current requirement to show probable cause , which is roughly the standard of proof needed for UK police to make an initial arrest .
Under the fast - track extradition procedure introduced in 2003 , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie evidence when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain .
In the case of the NatWest Three , however , evidence has been provided in court .
Peers also say the Lords voted for the original measure on the basis it would be used in the "" war on terror "" , and it was unclear how widely it would be invoked for other offences .
A Home Office spokesman said it was for the prosecuting authorities , not the home secretary , to decide whether the British bankers should be tried in Britain instead of the US .
No criminal proceedings have been brought against the three men in the UK .
They want to be tried in England because it is their home country and is where they say the alleged offence took place .
However the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , has said there is "" no basis "" for looking again at the Serious Fraud Office 's decision to leave the matter to the US authorities ."
2006-07-11,"The three former NatWest bankers accused of conspiring with Enron executives on a multimillion dollar fraud are due to be extradited to the US on Thursday and are likely to face a bail hearing in a Houston court the next day .
But although the prime minister said last week that he would ask British officials to help the so - called NatWest Three get bail , their lawyer , Mark Spragg , said American authorities ' attitudes have "" hardened "" in the last few days .
"" It 's looking more and more difficult , "" he said .
The three former NatWest bankers , David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , are accused of conspiring with senior Enron executives in a $ 20 m ( £ 11.5 m ) profit - skimming fraud .
If convicted , the three could face a sentence of 28 years and legal costs of $ 1.5 m each .
Mr Spragg said he still hoped the British government would co - operate with the US to allow them to be bailed in the UK , if necessary by electronically tagging them .
Home office minister Baroness Scotland will fly to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials about the case .
If the US Justice Department opposes bail , a judge will determine the issue based on two issues - whether they pose a danger to the public and whether they represent a flight risk .
Even if they are granted bail , however , Mr Spragg said he feared the costs could cripple them , effectively forcing them to plead guilty .
Bonds in high - profile American cases routinely run into six or even seven figures .
The three defendants are expected to be flown from Gatwick to Houston 's George Bush Intercontinental airport on Thursday .
They will be held overnight at a downtown detention centre and are expected to face a bail hearing the next day at the courthouse which recently served as the venue for the trial of Enron fraudsters the late Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling .
The NatWest Three are being extradited under the UK 's new "" fast - track "" treaty , which was signed in 2003 but has not yet been ratified by the US .
It has been criticised as "" one - sided "" by business leaders and civil liberties campaigners in the UK .
Margaret Beckett , the foreign secretary , who was in Washington yesterday , said she would raise the issue of the extradition treaty with secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Senator Richard Lugar , chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee , but would not intervene with American officials on behalf of the NatWest Three .
"" Our concern , as a foreign policy issue , is to urge the US to ratify the treaty , "" she said .
In a sign of British anger at the handling of the issue , it is expected that the House of Lords will today vote to remove the US from the list of 50 countries with which Britain has fast track extradition arrangements .
A motion will be tabled by the Liberal Democrats as part of the debate over the Police and Justice Bill ."
2006-07-12,"Enron was one of the biggest corporate frauds in history - the genuinely ugly face of capitalism .
The Bush administration , however reluctantly , and the US courts have combined to ensure that those involved have paid a heavy price ; former chair Ken Lay , had he lived , would have faced the rest of his life behind bars .
Every American chief executive and chair is aware of the new high penalties for corporate fraud .
It is a welcome development .
Britain has always been more relaxed .
The story is that we do n't get up to the same high jinks , and that the City is cleaner than Wall Street .
Nor is there any comparable appetite to sully the City 's reputation with being too activist about exposing and chasing fraudsters .
Best , in the time honoured way , keep mum .
We should not be surprised therefore at the reluctance to get involved in exposing to what degree Britain aided and abetted the schemes that Enron devised .
Let sleeping dogs lie .
But to turn the NatWest three , now extradited to be tried in an Enron related case in the US , into heroes of the hour because of their resistance to what is described as an unfair extradition treaty does seem to be stretching a point .
If they are innocent , they have nothing to worry about .
If they are guilty , then we have to accept that a US court was right to want to try them - and that it was right that Britain should allow them to be extradited .
The Americans collaborate with us ; we collaborate with them .
Is there a lower level of proof when British citizens get extradited , than the other way round ?
Is this American extending its law to our citizens , but not reciprocating ?
A bit , perhaps , but not so much that the NatWest three should be offered protection once due legal process is exhausted .
The whole case reeks of double standards .
If any of the NatWest three , like solicitor David Mills in an analagous situation , were married to a British cabinet minister the assumption would be that they were guilty as hell .
Every aspect of the prosecution case would be leaked even if unproven , and there would be calls for the cabinet minister 's resignation .
Instead they are tribunes of liberty .
Lets see what the case brings , and then make our judgement ."
2006-07-12,"Neil Coulbeck , a former head of group treasury at the Royal Bank of Scotland , had reportedly been questioned by the FBI over the NatWest Three case .
Mr Coulbeck , whose body was found in a park at Woodford Green , east London , yesterday , worked in the US as the RBS head of financial markets for North America until 2001 , the year in which the energy firm Enron collapsed .
That year , he returned to London to become the head of group treasury at RBS .
In addition to his work , Mr Coulbeck wrote a number of books , including Lending Packages for Small and Medium - Sized Companies in 1983 and The Multinational Banking Industry in 1984 .
He was reportedly the man who approved the deal at the heart of allegations against the NatWest Three , who are being extradited to the US tomorrow on Enron - related charges .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are to stand trial in Texas under the terms of a controversial fast - track extradition agreement between Britain and the US .
Opponents argue the treaty is one - sided .
US prosecutors allege that , in 2000 , the men persuaded NatWest to sell a stake in a Cayman Islands - based company called SwapSub to executives at Enron for less than its true value .
It is alleged they bought a share in the company for themselves before selling it on and pocketing the profits - around £ 1.5 m each - to the detriment of NatWest .
The men deny all the charges .
RBS subsequently took over NatWest following a £ 23bn battle with Bank of Scotland .
Mr Bermingham , speaking at his Berkshire mansion minutes after hearing about Mr Coulbeck 's death , described him as "" a superstar ... a thoroughly decent , honest professional guy and a very experienced banker "" . ""
He was one of a number of NatWest people who made short witness statements that were included in our extradition pack , "" he said .
"" They were not statements as to matters of evidence , they were merely identifying themselves and their roles in the company .
Neil 's statement was no more than a page and a half saying who he was and his role . ""
Mr Bermingham said it was important to remember that Mr Coulbeck 's apparent suicide might have had nothing to do with the extradition proceedings or the NatWest case .
"" It is more than possible that there is no connection whatever between his death and our case , "" he said .
"" It 's very dangerous to draw assumptions . ""
Whatever the circumstances surrounding his death and the reason for it , it does n't diminish from the fact that a man has died today and his poor family must be going through hell . ""
Police said they were treating Mr Coulbeck 's death as "" unexplained "" ."
2006-07-13,"For a fraudster convicted of stealing millions from the American public , it was quite a send - off .
A memorial service for Enron 's Ken Lay yesterday attracted a roll - call of the Texan establishment led by the former president , George Bush Sr .
Under the glare of the Houston sun , a seemingly endless procession of black sports utility vehicles swept up outside the city 's heavily guarded First Methodist Church as the Lone Star state defiantly bade farewell to one of its own .
Mr Bush and his wife chatted with mourners as they queued to get into the 1,500-seat church .
His administration 's secretary of state , James Baker , and commerce secretary , Robert Mosbacher , joined the throng alongside the Houston Astros ' owner , Drayton McLane .
Known as "" Kenny boy "" to the current president , Lay died last week in the ski resort of Aspen while awaiting sentence on six counts of conspiracy and fraud .
To his critics , the former Enron chairman was responsible for the loss of 21,000 livelihoods and was deserving of his expected fate of prison for the rest of his life .
Even on his last night alive , Lay was reportedly heckled by diners at an Italian restaurant in Colorado , prompting him to finish his chicken parmesan and leave hurriedly with his wife , Linda .
His memorial service was not without incident : its start was delayed when a former mayor of Houston , Bob Lanier , collapsed with a suspected heart attack and was rushed to hospital .
Lanier , 80 , was a character witness at Lay 's trial , describing him as "" a visionary for Enron , a visionary for the city "" .
The church is only a hundred yards from the silver skyscraper that once housed Enron .
Some of those outside were forgiving .
Jim Courville , a catering worker who worked at parties in Lay 's penthouse , said : "" I found him a very kind man .
Him and Linda were always very gracious to me when they spoke .
"" There 's a real mixture here in Houston of sadness at the loss of a father and grandfather and some resentment about what happened at Enron . ""
Until the end , Lay maintained that the fraud in Enron was perpetrated behind his back .
His death may thwart US government efforts to seize the remnants of his $ 400 m ( £ 215 m ) fortune .
But critics say that even if he was oblivious he did little to help those who lost everything .
Damon Silvers , senior associate counsel at the AFL - CIO unions federation , said Lay could have doubled the $ 35 m compensation fund raised for victims "" out of his checking account "" .
He compared Lay 's send - off to the plight of Lewis Allen , a man who looked after Enron 's vehicle fleet .
Allen lost his job , his home , his healthcare and his pension in the Enron collapse .
With his young daughter , he moved in with his mother and relied on her salary as a supermarket cashier .
A year after Enron 's collapse , he died of a sudden stroke at the age of 43 .
"" I just think about what it would be like to be Lewis Allen 's mother , looking up at Lay 's penthouse , "" said Silvers .
"" I knew Ken Lay .
I also knew Lewis Allen
and I know he was a much better man . """
2006-07-13,"They are characterised by friends as middle - ranking career bankers dragged into an American scandal on a technicality .
However , the NatWest three face awkward questions over how $ 7.3 m ( £ 4 m ) went from Houston to the Cayman Islands , then into their personal bank accounts .
The charges facing David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew go to the heart of the fall of Enron , in which a small number of senior executives were able to hang on to fortunes despite 21,000 people losing their jobs .
When it began facing financial difficulties , Enron established a series of off - balance sheet ventures to raise investment and hide losses .
NatWest invested in one of these , LJM Cayman .
The NatWest three , who worked in the bank 's structured finance division , are accused of recommending NatWest sell its stake for $ 1 m - allegedly for far less than it was worth .
The buyer was a partnership , Southampton LP , which made a huge gain shortly afterwards by selling the stake on .
The British trio , according to the FBI 's indictment , were investors in Southampton LP along with Enron 's global finance manager , Michael Kopper , who has since pleaded guilty to multiple money laundering and awaits sentence .
When Southampton made its profit , Kopper wired $ 7.3 m from Houston to an account established by Mr Bermingham at a Cayman Islands branch of the Bank of Bermuda .
Mr Bermingham divided the money up , wiring $ 2.38 m each into the personal accounts of Mr Darby and Mr Mulgrew and kept the rest himself .
They allegedly received the money a week after resigning from NatWest .
The trio argue that , although highly unusual , the transaction was entirely legal .
They believed NatWest was selling for a fair price and their interest in Southampton LP was disclosed to their employer .
The Royal Bank of Scotland , which owns NatWest , has declined to comment .
Insiders say the bank is reserving its rights over legal action .
The FBI has seized a series of alleged emails between the trio discussing how they were , in Mr Darby 's words , "" going to get rich "" .
Mr Bermingham emailed his colleagues apparently discussing the need to keep the deal under wraps : "" This is an attempt to head the obvious off at the pass and keep the lid on the thing .
Large numbers of people are asking what we are up to .
I hate lies .
""
A further alleged email , a month before NatWest sold its stake , predicts a return for "" Cayco "" of "" $ 7 m minimum profit "" .
Mr Mulgrew observes : "" Its so much easier to focus when it 's your own dough . ""
The FBI maintains that NatWest 's relationship manager with Enron , who was responsible for approving the transaction , was unaware that the trio had a personal interest in the deal .
It is unclear whether any NatWest or Royal Bank of Scotland employees are lined up to give evidence : the US department of justice has declined to give the names of its prosecution witnesses on the grounds that their security needs to be protected .
The NatWest three face seven counts of fraud , which each carry maximum penalties of five years ' jail .
Damon Silvers , associate general counsel at America 's federation of unions , the AFL - CIO , insisted that accusations of white - collar fraud should be treated seriously - irrespective of where they are tried : "" In the global economy , that 's how people commit crimes and hurt other people - by sitting thousands of miles away at a computer screen .

2006-07-13,"What are the three supposed to have done ?
The NatWest Three - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - have been indicted on fraud charges by federal prosecutors in Texas because of a scheme involving the bankrupt US energy company , Enron .
The three say they are innocent .
Why has their extradition caused such a stir ?
The NatWest Three are being sent to the US under a fast - track extradition procedure introduced in 2003 .
Under the new procedure , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie ( preliminary ) evidence when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain .
What was the alleged scheme ?
US prosecutors allege that the three Britons defrauded their former employer , Greenwich NatWest , with the help of Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer .
The FBI says the three cheated Greenwich NatWest - an arm of NatWest ( now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland ) based in Connecticut - by recommending the sale of a stake it owned in an Enron partnership , LJM SwapSub , controlled by Mr Fastow .
What happened next ?
Shortly after the sale , Mr Fastow allegedly returned the ownership rights for that stake to the three men for $ 250,000 ( £ 135,956 ) .
A few weeks later , they sold that interest for $ 7.3 m , giving them a huge profit , according to prosecutors .
"" The accusation is that we persuaded NatWest to sell an asset at an undervalue into which we were subsequently to buy ourselves and realise the profits , "" Mr Bermingham told the Guardian in a recent interview .
"" It is , if you wish , a classic insider dealing trade . ""
On what is the FBI basing its case ?
The FBI is relying on partnership documents , bank records , hotel and telephone records , transcripts of tape - recorded statements as well as a series of emails between the British bankers .
Ironically , some of the evidence comes from paperwork the trio provided to the City watchdog , the Financial Services Authority .
As soon as Enron collapsed in 2001 , they disclosed their deal LJM SwapSub to the FSA .
Where does the problem lie ?
First , the new extradition treaty which came into force in January 2004 was supposed to deal mostly with terrorist suspects after the September 11 attacks .
That the treaty is being used to target white - collar suspects has angered not just the business community but civil libertarians .
What about the charge of one - sidedness ?
The second concern arises over its lopsided nature .
Although the US is no longer required to provide prima facie evidence when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain , the UK has to prove its case in a US court in order to extradite US citizens to the UK .
However , in the case of the NatWest Three , evidence has been provided in court .
Another problem lies in the fact that the US Senate has yet to ratify the new extradition treaty .
Is the NatWest Three case an isolated one ?
No .
Other high profile cases exist , including that of Ian Norris , the former chief executive of Morgan Crucible .
But the NatWest Three have garnered the most publicity , thanks to a successful PR campaign helped by some well - placed connections ( such as Bermingham 's neighbour Boris Johnson ) .
Their case has also been taken up by an unlikely coalition of Lib Dems , Labour backbenchers , the former Tory leader , Michael Howard and George Galloway from the Respect party .
In a symbolic protest vote , MPs voted 246 - 4 yesterday to adjourn the house early .
How does the government defend the treaty ?
Tony Blair has rejected opposition calls to suspend the 2003 agreement and revert to previous , much tougher extradition requirements .
"" I do not believe it would be right if we ended up applying a higher standard and burden of proof to America than we do to other countries , "" he said .
The solicitor general Mike O'Brien has defended the agreement as "" the nearest rough - and - ready parity that we are reasonably likely to be able to achieve .
"" Why are n't the men being tried in the UK ?
The Serious Fraud Office argues that there is no public interest in a case that "" had already been investigated in the wider Enron context for some time by the US authorities "" .
In his interview with the Guardian , Mr Bermingham said : "" The home secretary could step in at any stage and prosecute this case here .
We 're not trying to evade justice , but we 've always said defending this case from Texas presents us with almost insurmountable obstacles .
"" What happens to the three now ?
They are due to appear at a court hearing tomorrow .
They will seek bail so they can return to the UK to prepare their defence .
Their supporters say if the court offered bail terms that required them to stay in the US or ask them to raise large amounts of money , the conditions would be too onerous .
Theoretically , they could be thrown into jail for up to two years until their case comes to court .
But the US department of justice has informed the attorney - general Lord Goldsmith that US prosecutors will not oppose bail ."

2006-07-13,"The three British bankers at the centre of an extradition row today were heading to Texas after surrendering to US marshals at a south London police station .
The so - called NatWest Three - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - are flying to Houston , where they will face fraud charges in connection to the collapsed energy company Enron .
They are scheduled to appear at a court hearing tomorrow , at which they will apply for bail to allow them to return to Britain to prepare their case .
The extradition of the trio under a new extradition treaty - yet to be ratified by the US Senate - has sparked a political furore that has embarrassed Tony Blair 's government .
The first high - profile case under the treaty , which has been in force since January 2004 , it has sparked anger and concern among British business leaders and human rights campaigners .
They have criticised the use of legislation originally designed to target terrorist suspects after the September 11 attacks on the US , and condemned its unsymmetrical nature .
"" Whatever the guilt or innocence of the NatWest Three , the current extradition arrangements are an affront to natural justice , "" the CBI director general , Richard Lambert , said .
"" If the government does nothing to correct the current imbalance , it risks damaging the UK 's position as a leading financial capital market .
Already , UK firms are examining their US links with a view to minimising their risk exposure . ""
Earlier today , the men arrived separately at Croydon police station before being taken to Gatwick airport .
Mr Bermingham said they were hopeful about their prospects of getting bail at tomorrow 's hearing .
"" We are optimistic , "" he added .
Outside the police station , Mark Spragg , the trio 's solicitor , hit out at their extradition .
"" It 's all so unnecessary - that 's the real problem here , "" he said .
"" This could easily have been tried in the UK . ""
That 's where the victim is , that 's where all the witnesses are -
but no , the government insisted on them being extradited on a very unfair , one - sided treaty . ""
The three men are accused of an £ 11 m fraud in which NatWest , their former employer , was advised to sell part of LJM SwapSub , a company owned by Enron , for less than it was worth .
The extradition comes a day after a banker who gave evidence to US authorities investigating the case was found dead .
The Royal Bank of Scotland , which acquired NatWest in 2000 , identified the man as 53-year - old Neil Coulbeck , and said he had no role in approving the transaction at the heart of the US case .
Police believe Mr Coulbeck , whose body was found in a park in east London , committed suicide .
It is understood the FBI last interviewed him in 2002 , and he signed a witness statement in November 2003 .
His statement was a three - paragraph explanation of his role at RBS and at NatWest before the Scottish bank took it over in 2000 .
Mr Coulbeck had been at Natwest and RBS since 1983 , working at the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary in the US between 1998 and 2000 .
Under the new fast - track extradition procedure , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie ( preliminary ) evidence when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain .
In contrast , the UK has to prove its case in a US court in order to extradite US citizens to the UK .
However , in the case of the NatWest Three , evidence has been provided in court .
The government is sending Baroness Scotland , the Home Office Minister in the House of Lords , to Washington to deliver the message that Senate ratification of the treaty is now essential .
On Tuesday , the House of Lords voted 218 - 116 to suspend the legislation ."
2006-07-15,"Last week three bankers - the NatWest Three - became almost national heroes , resisting the long arm of American law which required them to face trial in the US over an alleged offence related to the Enron scandal .
The extradition treaty under which they were being removed from Britain had not even been ratified by the Americans , it was said ; the burden of proof there was lower ; and not even their own British bank was pressing charges .
The plane left Gatwick for Houston carrying these tribunes of liberty to a manacled future ; businessmen demonstrated ; there was a special debate in the House of Commons .
A delegation is to be sent to Washington to press the Americans to ratify the treaty .
You have to blink at the craziness .
Only towards the end of the week did sanity emerge .
The affidavit from the FBI agent in the bail hearings disclosed the email exchanges between the three , and the extent of their involvement in a series of offshore transactions apparently set up to throw up personal profits . '
We 're going to get rich , ' wrote one .
The NatWest Three declare their innocence in the transactions , but there are questions to answer .
It is unusual for the British to witness fraud being taken seriously so long after the event and with such intent by the prosecuting authorities .
This is the rule of law at work .
The principle is surely right ?
If any government believes that British nationals may have been party to fraud against organisations under their jurisdiction then it should collaborate to see justice done .
And if we do n't want to prosecute , then we must stand aside and let others do it .
The principle at stake is justice - and whether we want to ring - fence the City of London so that , in effect , anything goes .
Begin with Enron .
Essentially this company created fictitious profits through myriad dodgy schemes ( like the one created by NatWest ) , enriching a narrow coterie of directors at the top even while it was feted on all sides for its innovation .
When the company collapsed tens of thousands of employees lost their pensions which had been invested in Enron stock .
Enron became emblematic of the freewheeling capitalism of the 1990s .
The US , even under Bush , has reacted ferociously .
The Sarbanes - Oxley Act made chief executives personally responsible for the integrity of their annual accounts with no excuses .
Meanwhile , former Enron executives involved have been relentlessly and successfully pursued in the courts .
The week before last , Ken Lay , Enron 's founder , died before being sentenced ; he would have faced prison without any prospect of release .
I can not remember a successful fraud prosecution in Britain in such a high - profile case or such vigorous action - Guinness excepted .
The record is a chapter of disasters , of failed prosecutions and , in the few occasions when we do succeed , forgiving sentences .
Britain , it is said , is just less corrupt .
I 'm not so sure .
A significant part of the City 's so - called ' financial services ' are precisely about setting up offshore companies advantageously to manage tax , cash flow and profits which are frequently on the cusp of legality .
Few acknowledge it ; everyone knows it .
And juries are said to get confused , hence fewer convictions .
The reality is that weaker British regulation delivers a weaker flow of high quality evidence which an uncombative and under - resourced public prosecution service can not make stick against their well - financed defendants .
The real explanation of our track record is a lack of willingness to grasp the fraud nettle .
In part , this is a rational if unedifying desire to keep our dirty linen hidden , but the reaction of some of the business community betrays another less laudable instinct .
Business and the rich should not be subject to the rule of law as a matter of principle ; it is an interference in ' wealth generation ' .
And the more private wealth has grown in Britain , the more our wealthy believe that the law should be different for them .
Some strands in American business think the same , but they are overwhelmed by the strong American belief that the US is a republic of laws where every citizen can and should be held to account .
There are elected officials , such as the formidable New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who has made his name by being a fraud buster .
Here you make your name by not rocking the boat .
The US has the more vigorous democratic tradition and institutions .
American businesspeople are held to account for their actions , and it makes their businesses stronger .
Accountability is good , not bad , for business .
The US has a long history of taming business , which springs from republican institutions ... imposing competition , imprisoning fraudsters and breaking up monopolies .
Arguably , its economic dynamism comes from this tension between markets and democracy - rather than the usual story that it is a free - market paradise .
One of the worst aspects of last week was the crude anti - Americanism .
Where the US gets it wrong - over climate change or Iraq - the criticism should be tough .
But over this the US is in the right , as is becoming obvious .
Cold American legal steel going after crime in the City because Britain is too limp - wristed is good news .
There is a collective shiver going down the spine of every London financier .
It is long overdue ."
2006-07-17,"The US government will seek a jail sentence of between seven and nine years if the so - called NatWest Three are convicted - a far shorter period than the draconian term cited by the bankers ' supporters as an argument for them to be kept in Britain .
A new prosecution memo seen by the Guardian reveals details of the US authorities ' position on David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew , who are accused of embezzling $ 7.3 m ( about £ 3.98 m ) in an Enron - related fraud .
The three former NatWest bankers , who spent the weekend on bail at the Houston home of their defence attorney , each face seven charges of obtaining money through an elaborate fraud .
Bail terms allow them outside only for religious services , meetings with counsel , medical care and food shopping .
Campaigners have repeatedly claimed that under sentencing guidelines , they face 23 years without parole if convicted , far longer than they could expect in Britain .
However , the prosecution memo , lodged on Friday at Houston 's federal court , says that based on the size of the alleged fraud , "" the defendants , if convicted , face a potential sentencing range under the US sentencing guidelines of seven to nine years ' incarceration "" .
It also discloses that two corrupt executives at the top of Enron have turned supergrass and provided sworn statements saying the three Britons knowingly colluded in the financial wrongdoing which surrounded the now defunct energy trading empire .
The vigour of the trio 's publicity campaign has taken US officials by surprise and Texan authorities are making efforts to treat them well .
It has emerged that the three were accommodated in a hotel when they arrived in America last week , rather than being taken to jail .
But the strength of the case against them has become clearer with confirmation that Enron 's former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and global finance managing director , Michael Kopper , are giving evidence .
Both have admitted their own guilt and are helping the authorities in a plea bargain . ""
The Enron participants have already pled guilty to the very scheme with which these defendants are charged , "" says the memo .
""
In addition , the Enron participants have given sworn factual statements that describe the defendants ' involvement in the charged scheme .
"" It was evidence from Mr Fastow which secured the conviction of Enron 's top two bosses , Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling .
Mr Fastow is expected to spend 10 years in jail .
The NatWest Three 's solicitor in Britain , Mark Spragg , said he believed Mr Fastow and Mr Kopper are the only prosecution witnesses .
"" They both entered a plea and cooperation agreement , "" he said .
"" The cooperation part is that they will dump down on everybody else . ""
The NatWest Three maintain that a transaction through the Cayman Islands which ended with $ 7.3 m in their personal bank accounts was above board and cleared by their employer .
They will make a final attempt on Friday to persuade a judge to allow them to return to Britain ahead of their trial , which is scheduled for September 11 but is likely to be delayed far beyond that .
Britain has allowed the three to be removed under an extradition treaty which the US has failed to ratify for its own nationals .
Lawrence Barcella , at the Washington law firm Paul Hastings , said the furore could lead to a distinction requiring higher standards of evidence to extradite in non - violent cases than in terrorist investigations .
But any changes would be too late for the NatWest Three , who will stand trial in a city still angry at those responsible for the collapse of Enron , which left 21,000 people jobless , and many others without homes or pensions .
Mr Barcella said : "" The issue they 're going to have at trial is that Houston is not a particularly warm and friendly place to face Enron - related charges . """
2006-07-21,"A US judge today rejected a request from the so - called NatWest Three to return to Britain to await trial on Enron - related fraud charges .
The decision is a major blow for David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , who were extradited to Texas last week in a case that has embarrassed the Blair government .
Lawyers for the trio said they faced financial ruin if forced to stay in the US while they await their trial .
The case is scheduled to start in September , although it will probably be delayed .
The three also maintain that they need to be in Britain in order to work and be with their families .
Federal prosecutors pointed to their lengthy extradition battle as evidence that the three might not come back or launch another protracted extradition fight .
Court papers filed by the trio 's lawyers say that if they are allowed to stay in England , they will waive extradition , wear electronic tagging devices and provide $ 4 m ( £ 2.1 m ) in financial guarantees signed by friends and family .
The case has sparked a furore among business groups and opposition politicians , who have criticised the fast - track extradition process as being weighted unfairly in America 's favour .
But the state department 's chief legal adviser , John Bellinger , told the BBC that such concerns were misplaced and that the three bankers would get a fair trial .
"" This image of the US not being committed to a system of laws is troubling .
It is very important for the British people to understand that an extradition treaty like this is very much in their interests , "" he said .
Under the new rules , the US is no longer required to provide prima facie ( preliminary ) evidence in court when seeking to extradite suspects from Britain , whereas the UK has to prove its case in a US court in order to extradite US citizens to Britain .
In the case of the NatWest Three , however , case evidence was provided in court .
Another issue for human rights groups in the UK is the fact that the US Senate has yet to ratify the new extradition treaty .
"" It is disappointing to us that the Senate has not moved more rapidly .
We 're working very hard to have it ratified , but this is not something that is in the power of the administration alone , "" Mr Bellinger said .
The ratification process began today with a Senate foreign relations committee hearing on the treaty .
The former NatWest bankers each face seven charges of embezzling £ 7.3 m in an Enron - related fraud .
The three say they are innocent .
However , the prosecution will call on two former top Enron figures , the chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and the global finance managing director , Michael Kopper , to give evidence .
The two former executives have provided sworn statements saying that the three knowingly colluded in the financial wrongdoing that surrounded the now defunct energy trading empire .
Both have admitted their own guilt and are helping the authorities with a plea bargain in the NatWest Three case ."
2006-07-21,"These past few weeks , politicians and newspapers and business leaders have been falling over one another to support the NatWest Three , the bankers extradited to the US to stand trial for their alleged part in the Enron collapse .
And as they do , I think : what about north London hacker Gary McKinnon ?
He 's about to be extradited , too .
Why is nobody interested in Gary McKinnon ?
The NatWest Three have secured the services of a PR company ; Gary McKinnon has n't : he can barely afford to pay his phone bill .
People such as Sir Digby Jones , the former director general of the CBI , have been giving speeches about how US - UK business relations are suffering in the wake of the NatWest Three 's extradition ; nobody is giving influential speeches in support of Gary McKinnon .
The only people who seem to care much about him - besides the odd Lib Dem MP - are his fellow stoner UFO nerds .
And who is going to listen to them ?
Finally , though , there seems to be some mainstream interest in Gary 's plight .
This evening he is due to appear on Richard and Judy .
This really is his big - and last - chance to win the support of the nation .
US federal prosecutors want to extradite Gary for perpetrating , in their words , "" the biggest military computer hack of all time .
[ He ] caused damage and impaired the integrity of information ...
The US military district of Washington became inoperable and the cost of repairing [ the shutdown ] was $ 700,000 ...
These [ hacking attacks ] occurred immediately after 9/11 . ""
And so on .
You probably do n't know this , because it only got a few paragraphs , but on July 6 the home secretary , John Reid , ruled that Gary could be extradited .
The next stage is an appeal to the high court , but suddenly the stages are running out .
The prison sentence the US justice department is seeking is up to 70 years .
What Gary was hunting for , as he snooped around Nasa and the Pentagon 's network , was evidence of a UFO cover - up .
I think there 's a bit of a misunderstanding going on , because US federal prosecutors do n't recognise his social type .
Gary McKinnon is a dork .
To fellow dorks such as myself it seems crazy that they are taking him so seriously .
But federal authorities - not really knowing the Nick Hornby - reading , north London geeky stoner type - have lumped him in with the terrorists .
I would suggest some kind of rally , but it seems like a lot of effort , and nothing would come of it anyway .
Perhaps people can support him by watching Richard and Judy tonight .
Gary McKinnon perpetrated his hacking attacks from his former girlfriend 's auntie 's house in Crouch End .
There was a joint in the ashtray at all times .
He spends his days sitting in the pub being terrified .
"" I 'm walking down the road
and I find I ca n't control my own legs , "" he told me when I met him last year . ""
And I 'm sitting up all night thinking about jail and about being arse - fucked .
An American jail .
And remember , according to them I was making Washington inoperable "" immediately after September 11 "" .
You know , everyone thinks this is fun or exciting .
But it is n't exciting to me .
It is fucking terrifying . ""
His actions were never really politically motivated .
He once attended a Noam Chomsky lecture , but that 's as political as he gets .
Yes , he was hacking in the immediate aftermath of September 11 , but only because he wanted to see if there was a conspiracy afoot .
"" Why did the building fall like a controlled series of explosions ? "" he said .
"" I hate conspiracy theories so I thought I 'd find out for myself . ""
"" And did you find a conspiracy ? ""
I asked . ""
No , "" he said .
He told me that the most exciting thing he had found during his late - night hacking escapades was "" a list of officers ' names , under the heading Non - Terrestrial Officers "" .
I looked it up , and it 's nowhere .
It does n't mean little green men .
What I think it means is not Earth - based .
And I found a list of "" fleet - to - fleet transfers "" , and a list of ship names .
I looked them up , too .
They were n't US navy ships .
What I saw made me believe that they have some kind of spaceship , off - planet . ""
"" A secret space ship ? ""
I said .
"" Some kind of other Mir that nobody knows about ? "" "" I guess so , "" said Gary .
"" What were the ship names ? "" I asked .
"" I ca n't remember , "" said Gary .
"" I was smoking a lot of dope at the time .
Not good for the intellect . ""
He strenuously denies the justice department 's charge that he caused the US military district of Washington to become "" inoperable "" .
Well , once , he admitted , but only once , he inadvertently pressed the wrong button and deleted some government files .
"" What did you think when you realised you had done that ? ""
I asked him .
"" I thought , ' Ooh , bloody hell , ' "" he said .
He also started getting "" a bit megalomaniacal .
I ended up talking to people I hacked into . ""
"" Saying ' I 'm a hacker ' ? ""
"" No , "" he said .
"" I 'd instant - message them , using WordPad , with a bit of a political diatribe .
You know , I 'd leave a message on their desktop that read '
Secret government is blah
blah blah ' .
"" I asked him if his fellow hackers see him as some kind of mythical hero now the US government has described him as the biggest military hacker of all time .
He said no : they see him as a complete idiot .
And in some ways , he is indeed a complete idiot .
Well , he is a likable , intelligent , geeky man who did many , many idiotic things .
What he is not , his friends and supporters reckon , is someone who deserves extradition and 70 years in an American jail ."
2006-07-27,"Apparently not .
While some people suspect that the failed energy broker was the real reason for power "" brownouts "" in California between November 2000 and May 2001 ( and it was at least a contributor ) , the state has once more been suffering a shortage of distribution capacity - and this time the crooked company is n't there to blame .
Among the casualties earlier this week was MySpace.com , whose servers in Los Angeles collapsed due to record - breaking temperatures , in turn leading to peak electricity demand overloading the distribution network .
MySpace.com was off the air for half a day .
California set a new record for energy demand earlier this week , consuming 46,561 megawatts in mid - afternoon on Monday .
That left it with 7,000MW of spare capacity - a 15 % margin .
High temperatures in the state led to high power demands for air conditioning , which overwhelmed ageing plant in the distribution network .
Some sections of the transmission network were built in the 1920s and 1930s , and the line - to - home transformers ( which reduce voltages ) are too small to handle the power demands of modern houses .
"" When these transformers were installed , you had neighbourhoods that were n't air - conditioned , homes without two computers and five television sets , "" Ron Deaton , the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , told the Los Angeles Times .
California 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , tried to terminate the excessive use of power by ordering state agencies to turn off unneeded equipment and cut power use by a quarter .
But it has n't been enough .
The state - wide heatwave is the most intense since 1998 and has led to a total demand for electricity 40 % higher than in the 2001 energy crisis .
It 's an exceptional summer .
Some parts of the state are experiencing temperatures that would be expected , on average , only every century , according to Joseph Desmond , deputy secretary for energy at the California Resources Agency .

2006-07-28,"A good spot by blogger Mark Hamilton who points out that an article by Washington Post reporter Frank Ahrens "" is like a road map for reporters in how to extend journalism .
"" It certainly is .

2006-07-28,"One by one , the modern dinosaurs are lined up for a good kicking ( Enron will be along shortly , DVD fans ) .
But the unusual aspect of this exposé of the biggest , richest , meanest US supermarket ( whose British arm is Asda ) is that it ends on a high , like any Hollywood feelgood movie .
A wide range of communities - even Las Vegas - refuse to let in the hugely subsidised retail giant .
It comes as no surprise that the company is anti - union , does n't pay overtime , deliberately understaffs , fiddles employees ' hours and is as environmentally unsound as any Carl Hiaasen villain .
Director Robert Greenwald , who also gave us the Fox news exposé Outfoxed , talks to plenty of disgruntled ex - employees and tours a variety of handed - down family firms that Wal - Mart traditionally displaces .
But this is n't just an American horror story : he talks to Chinese and Honduran employees , and a camera turns up in London 's Queen 's Road market to add a defiant cockney voice from the area near West Ham 's ground which Asda coveted .
( It recently withdrew its development plans ) .
Greenwald chucks shock statistics ( $ 1bn subsidy and a $ 91 m tax cut for the Walton family founders ) at you along with smarmy Wal - Mart commercials .
It 's notable though that the figures are never compared with other supermarkets - instead the giant 's charity donations are contrasted with those of the uniquely philanthropic Bill Gates .
Omissions like that undermine a broadside against capitalist excess which we can all cheer on from the sofa ."
2006-08-08,"The legal difficulties of the so - called NatWest Three have worsened with a subpoena requiring them to give evidence in a class action brought by thousands of Enron shareholders who lost more than $ 40bn ( £ 21bn ) when it collapsed .
It emerged yesterday that David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , who are on bail in Texas awaiting a criminal trial for embezzlement , have been served with papers requiring them to give depositions on September 28 in the civil case .
Mr Bermingham told the Toronto Star the subpoenas were served shortly after the trio were extradited from Britain last month : "" We had been in the country less than 24 hours when lawyers for whoever , the ambulance - chasing lawyers , came out with their subpoenas . ""
The class action , one of many by Enron shareholders , is directed at Royal Bank of Canada , which is accused of helping Enron to inflate its profits through a series of fraudulent off - balance sheet deals .
The British trio joined Canada 's largest financial institution when their employer , Greenwich NatWest , was taken over in 2000 .
The plaintiffs claim they were hired partly because of their relationship with Enron and they became leading figures in the Canadian institution 's dealings with the corrupt Houston company .
The men were ordered last month to remain in Houston under electronic surveillance pending their trial and they have complained this puts them under significant financial hardship , although they have been given permission to work in the US .
The new case will add to their costs .
The court papers allege that the trio helped put together a deal known as the Alberta transaction , in which the Canadian province auctioned 20-year power purchase agreements .
Enron was a successful bidder but used complex accounting to avoid putting it on its balance sheet .
The litigious Enron shareholders say this was "" structured by Royal Bank of Canada as a means for Enron to materially distort its financial statements "" .
Royal Bank of Canada has denied any wrongdoing and insists it was deceived by Enron .
The trio 's extradition was based on criminal charges of fraud , under which the three are accused of dishonestly obtaining $ 7.3 m through a transaction in which money was wired from Houston to the Cayman Islands and into their personal bank accounts ."
2006-09-01,"We 've had investigative documentaries about Wal - Mart , about Enron , about burgers and newspapers and the whole military - industrial can of worms .
So it was high time we had one about the corporate world of Hollywood moviemaking , and that is what Kirby Dick has given us , indirectly , with this extremely watchable study of the Motion Picture Association of America , or MPAA : a bureaucratic creature of the Hollywood studio system which enforces self - regulatory censorship .
Dick reveals it to be a bizarre institution : secretive , cantankerous and paranoid , high - handedly slapping certificates on movies ranging from G - all ages allowed - up to an R ( under-17s need parent or guardian present ) and then an R-17 ( no under-17s allowed at all ) .
This last rating is the equivalent to our 18 certificate , less strict by one year , but still commercial catastrophe for film - makers hoping to get their product out to the all - important youth market .
The MPAA never discusses its reasoning , and never reveals the identities of its "" raters "" or members of its absurdly pompous "" appeals board "" which , in certain cases , will grandly condescend to reconsider its verdict , prior , in the vast majority of cases , to solemnly announcing that the original decision was correct .
Does this affect us here in the UK ?
Well , actually , yes .
The MPAA shapes and guides the content of all Hollywood movies we see : and it 's a deeply conservative , hypocritical institution which comes down on sex like a ton of bricks but waves through all manner of violence because , Kirby suspects , that is what the all - important young male demographic likes to see .
Also : it permits a male taste in eroticism , but is horrified and disgusted by any representation of female sexuality , no matter how obliquely filmed .
Dick interviews film - makers ranging from Kimberly Peirce , the director of Boys Do n't Cry and Trey Parker , co - director of South Park and the magnificent puppet satire Team America : World Police .
Parker reveals that his jaw - dropping puppet sex scene originally included truly bizarre acts , including water sports and coprophilia , simply to give the MPAA something to cut : sacrificial bait to use up all their puritanical energy .
Dick shows these lost scenes and they are , of course , superb .
On a more serious note , Pierce and many other directors complain that depictions of female pleasure , whether straight or gay , and especially scenes showing women having oral sex performed on them , are considered almost blasphemous .
Merely to show the woman 's face is disgusting .
Show a teen boy rogering an apple pie - fine .
Carve up someone with a chainsaw - also fine .
But muff - diving - even if the action is several feet away from what 's on camera - is revolting .
The film includes an illustrative clip from Hal Ashby 's 1978 Vietnam movie Coming Home : a remarkably extended oral - sex scene showing Jane Fonda 's ecstatic face during sex with Jon Voight 's disabled war veteran .
It was an adult movie , in the real sense of the word , but would such a scene pass muster today ?
Some cynics say that the purpose of commercial cinema , like that of the press , is to over - stimulate the public 's infotainment gland , and leave residual unsatisfied desire - so that the advertisers can sell their product .
Jokey laddish sex scenes do this job .
So do action and violence .
Female sexual pleasure does not .
Using a private detective , Dick discovers the identities of the raters , those shadowy moral guardians dedicating to protecting Americans and the rest of the world from certain types of filth .
They are a bunch of people who are not quite the "" parents of young kids "" claimed by the MPAA , but a bunch of biddable time - servers who owe their position , at one or two removes , to the MPAA 's legendary and long - serving chief Jack Valenti , president from 1966 to 2004 , inventor of the MPAA 's ratings system and a former Washington lobbyist .
Dick has a remarkable moment , showing the famous photograph of Lyndon Johnson dramatically taking his oath after the Kennedy assassination : a young Valenti is present among the tense group of aides .
It was his political savvy which kept the Washington political establishment on side and enabled him to impose his own autocratic control on the industry .
Dick has one other remarkable discovery .
Two clergymen are always present on the MPAA appeals board : one Catholic , one Episcopalian .
No other religions are allowed .
The film does n't get bogged down in the old liberal debate about censorship , other than interviewing a lawyer who suggests that state censorship might actually be better than self - regulation : at least political appointees might be subject to accountability .
Like Jonathan Rosenbaum 's book Movie Wars : How Hollywood and the Media Limit
What Movies We Can See - a copy of which should be given to every movie writer in the world - it asks harder questions about the films we watch .
We critics are often very uncritical about this : eating up what 's on our plate every week and regurgitating our reviews .
How earnestly we namecheck the directors , or the screenwriters or art directors , assigning to them a purity of authorial freedom .
But Dick suggests the films are actually being created by a set of industrial imperatives , which exist independently of any creative individual , and these imperatives are enforced by a commercial studio system which is in a position to impose its views on all the independent producers and everyone else .
What a riveting documentary .
When it came to be rated , the MPAA gave it an NC-17 , evidently for the sexually explicit stuff , and our own BBFC gave it an 18 .
Maybe they have a point .
The hypocrisy and humbug on display from the Hollywood watchdogs is X - certificate stuff ."
2006-09-05,"Richard Lambert , the new head of the head of the CBI , Britain 's leading business group , chose the theme of trust for his first major speech today .
Business gets a raw deal from the public , the media and politicians , with even David Cameron , the Tory party leader , distancing himself from big business , he said .
Mr Lambert acknowledged that business has made a rod for its own back with scandals such as Enron .
His larger point was that the lack of trust in business made it harder for the business community to make the argument for the free movement of people , capital and services - globalisation in effect - at a time when protectionist forces in the US and Europe are gathering strength .
It was a thoughtful speech , befitting a former editor of the Financial Times , its tone more measured than that of his pugnacious predecessor , Digby Jones .
Mr Lambert said .
"" Too often , business is presented as a zero sum game .
The impression is given that if an individual , or a company , is making lots of money , it must be at someone else 's expense . ""
That ambivalence emerges most clearly when companies such as BP and HSBC report record profits .
It does mean tax receipts for the government to spend on the NHS and other social services and healthy pension schemes as these funds invest in big companies , but at the same time many people wonder whether HSBC is making such huge profits through high banking charges .
Mr Lambert also mentioned the issue of "" fat cat "" pay .
Globalisation , he said , has helped to push up the pay of senior executives , while those lower down the food chain find themselves competing against workers in developing countries .
Most people expect top executives to be well - rewarded because of the heavy responsibilities they bear .
But what sticks in people 's craws are the legal tax dodges of the ultra - rich .
In July the Guardian traced more than 650 directors of British companies who give their current address as Monaco .
This hardly encourages trust in business .
Mr Lambert also talked about being open to change .
Most people acknowledge the need for change and the need to adapt to new circumstances , but they get rattled when change comes too quickly .
Even the CBI thinks too many eastern European migrant workers have come to Britain since Poland and others joined the EU in 2004 .
It is now calling for a "" pause "" when Bulgaria and Romania join next year .
So , cut down on those big pay awards , acknowledge corporate resistance to change on matters such as the environment and perhaps trust in big business might increase ."
2006-09-11,"Five years ago the energy company Enron was the seventh - largest corporation in America .
Its 20,000 employees prided themselves on working for one of the most vibrant , go - getting firms in the country .
What only a few knew was that Enron 's reputation was built on a big fat fraud .
When the truth came out , and the books had to be uncooked , Enron collapsed in the biggest bankruptcy in American history .
The woman who blew the whistle was an in - house accountant called Sherron Watkins .
She tells Michael Buerk her story in The Choice ( 9 am and repeated , Radio 4 ) .
Things are marginally less murky in the Afternoon Play ( 2.15pm , Radio 4 ) .
Andy and Rebecca are two twentysomethings , thrown together by their best mates Mike and Muriel , who are in love and finding it such a pleasant situation that they want everyone else to experience it .
Unfortunately , Andy and Rebecca ca n't stand each other .
The only thing they have in common is their disapproval of Mike and Muriel 's relationship , and they soon convince themselves that they have every right to break it up .
As their plan takes shape , they find themselves becoming friends - and perhaps something more ...
Billy Boyd and Gabriel Quigley star in Mike and Muriel Are Getting Married ."
2006-09-13,"There are always delicious moments when Michael Buerk is on the radio , most of them unintentional .
On The Choice ( Radio 4 ) , as he interviewed Enron whistle - blower Sherron Watkins , Buerk mentioned that she had been named as one of the 10 most fascinating people in America .
He said "" fascinating "" in a fabulously grumpy harrumph , suggesting that he clearly was n't about to find her so .
This was an oddly flat edition of the programme .
The story it told was gripping enough , but there was absolutely no atmosphere - not even an adversarial one , really - to the encounter .
In fact , a strangeness to the sound quality ( Buerk sounded as if he was speaking from a small , remote cupboard ) hinted that they were n't actually in the same studio .
Or maybe it was just that Buerk seemingly wanted to be elsewhere , and Watkins was n't the warmest interviewee .
For all her whistle - blowing , her story left you thinking of the very many other Enron employees who , unlike Watkins , lost their jobs without a wodge of company shares to flog before its spectacular demise ."
2006-09-13,"In the wake of the Enron collapse , the congressmen Paul Sarbanes and Michael Oxley were regarded as heroes whose tough new rules would clean up corporate America and ensure investors could never again be fleeced by greedy , self - aggrandising executives .
Four years on the view looks rather different .
On Tuesday the US treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , backed a new study to determine how much America is losing out as a result of the stringent Sarbox audit rules , which include a demand that chief executives personally declare their annual figures to be true .
Mr Paulson fears US public markets are losing out to foreign rivals and private markets , ie that companies prefer to list on non - US markets or move into private hands rather than play by US rules .
Only yesterday , the UK vaccines group Acambis said it was to pull its US listing as a result of Sarbox .
Other UK corporates with US listings question the costs of compliance .
One FTSE 100 chief executive recently told the Guardian that its annual Sarbox bill was £ 20 m .
From this side of the pond the results look pretty clear .
The London Stock Exchange has seen a flood of new companies joining the market that otherwise might have preferred Wall St , such as the vast Rosneft and Kazakhmys and the 36 Chinese companies now listed on Aim .
Twice as much foreign equity is now traded in London as in the US .
Little wonder then that the very real possibility of a takeover of the LSE by its 25 % shareholder Nasdaq has caused so many furrowed brows in the City .
Those doing the complaining are not so much concerned with saving the LSE for the nation , much more about whether US regulations will be imported to the UK by the back door as a result .
Yesterday the economic secretary , Ed Balls , took action .
New legislation is to be introduced to allow the Financial Services Authority , which regulates the LSE , to veto "" disproportionate "" rules .
In other words , if Sarbox loomed , the FSA would have the power to stamp on it .
While details are still scant , Mr Balls looks to have found a neat solution for those in the City and among UK firms who feared either draconian new demands or an abrupt halt to the tide of high fee - earning listings that Sarbox has sent London 's way .
Statistical error
There is no surprise that the head of the Office for National Statistics has fired off a letter to the cabinet secretary , Gus O'Donnell , grumbling about Tony Blair blurting out yesterday 's unemployment figures to the TUC on Tuesday .
He made a mockery of the government 's claim that the ONS is at arm 's length and operationally independent .
If that were really the case , senior ministers would have to wait with the rest of us to see market - moving economic data .
Karen Dunnell complained to Mr O'Donnell - himself an economist aware of how sensitive financial markets are to economic data - that Mr Blair 's action contravened the National Statistics code of practice and asked him to hammer the point home at No 10 .
Behind the scenes , she will now be keen to cease the practice of politicians getting their hands on this stuff ahead of time .
Breaking the code
There are many in the City - mostly pointy - headed technical chart analysts - whose daily toil involves looking for patterns in market prices and forecasting future movements .
They employ hundreds of different methods including many fanciful theories that academics class alongside astrology .
Among the most popular of these is the Fibonacci sequence , a series of numbers - for those unacquainted with The Da Vinci Code - formed by adding two numbers to obtain the next in the sequence : eg 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 , 21 , 34 ... and so on to infinity .
It is the work of the 13th - century mathematician Leonardo ' Fibonacci ' da Pisa , whose Book of Calculation , penned in 1202 , helped popularise ( if that is the correct word ) algebra .
As the numbers in his sequence get larger , the ratio of each number to its preceding number converges to 1.618 , or the so - called "" golden ratio "" .
It is this ratio that gets the highly remunerated pointy - heads excited .
They mix it up with Elliott Wave Theory ( do n't ask ) and , hey presto , think they can predict market movements .
Now , though , we have hard evidence that this is a totally rubbish theory .
Professor Roy Batchelor , professor of banking and finance at Cass Business School , has studied all the daily price movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1914 to 2002 and found no greater evidence of the golden ratio at work than would happen by chance .
The Fibonacci rule , he concludes , is "" just an illusion
... wishful thinking ... a mirage "" ,
which like The Da Vinci Code should be confined to holiday reading .
So will the nonsense now stop ?
No chance , he says , because the chart community needs every possible straw to grasp at - even if it is utter cobblers ."
2006-09-14,""" This is not a story of a few bad apples .
It 's about what 's gone wrong in our society , "" is how director and
co - writer Alex Gibney summarises his film in a literate commentary .
It 's a succinct and mostly comprehensible version of the US 's biggest bankruptcy , so far .
The company , which won billions of dollars in subsidies from Bush Sr and was the largest contributor to Bush Jr , thrived in the aftermath of Reagan 's deregulation , both of financial institutions and the energy industry in California .
Boss Ken Lay , who died in July , was an apostle for deregulation and one of Enron 's tricks was to create energy crises , bet that the price would go up and then provide new high - priced energy at the approprate time .
Blackouts in California were one of the side - effects .
Before too long , Enron too came a cropper after years of book - cooking and file - shredding .
This film recalls the claim of another DVD exposé , The Corporation , that big business is set to up to behave in ways that would make an individual a psychopath - it must maximise profits for shareholders , without regard to any other consequences in a world where traders are pronounced exactly the same as "" traitors "" ."
2006-09-22,"The New York Stock Exchange has made a frank admission about the severe impact of tighter and more costly regulations that were introduced in the wake of the Enron scandal on the number of international companies coming to Wall Street .
The figures are contained in a 730-page document filed with regulators in Washington that details the NYSE 's planned $ 10bn takeover of Euronext , the owner of the main stock markets in Paris , Lisbon , Brussels and Amsterdam .
The filing warns among its "" risk factors "" that "" the legal and regulatory environment in the United States "" may make it difficult for the NYSE to compete for listings of foreign companies .
It says that in 2000 , the year before the Enron collapse , 50 % of the proceeds raised by international companies in the US markets was done privately , while between 1996 and 1999 , the NYSE listed an average 48 international companies a year .
In 2005 , after the impact of the Enron - related Sarbanes - Oxley legislation , 94 % of the money raised by international companies in the US was private .
The number of foreign companies listing on the NYSE over the past five years has fallen to an average of 33 .
The filing outlines the structure planned by the NYSE to ringfence the European exchanges owned by Euronext to protect them from the more onerous US regulatory regime .
The company would create a Dutch entity to oversee the European markets and prevent US rules from having any adverse impact .
London Stock Exchange chief , Clara Furse , argued in an editorial this week that London was attracting a greater volume of international listings because of the quality of the London exchange .
She cited figures showing the LSE had attracted 152 international companies in the past 18 months compared to 54 for the NYSE and rival US Nasdaq combined .
Ed Balls , economic secretary to the Treasury last week promised to give the Financial Services Authority , the City regulator , new powers to prevent US regulations being imposed in London in the event of a takeover .
Nasdaq has built a 25.1 % stake in the London exchange and is widely expected to make a full bid for the exchange later this year .
The NYSE merger with Euronext is still dependent on shareholder approval in December .
It faces a rival bid for Euronext from the Frankfurt exchange , Deutsche Börse .
Sources close to the NYSE privately accuse Deutsche Börse of waging a dirty campaign aimed at derailing the NYSE deal .
According to figures circulated by NYSE 's broker , Citigroup , Deutsche Börse has been trying to support its own shares by buying up stock .
It also notes an unusual level of short selling against the NYSE - betting on a fall in the share price - though there is no evidence that it has been driven by the German bourse ."
2006-09-26,"A key figure in the scandal that engulfed the energy company Enron , causing the loss of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in pensions , was sentenced yesterday to six years in prison .
Andrew Fastow , the company 's former chief financial officer , had his sentence reduced from the 10 years he had agreed to serve in a plea bargain in 2004 .
The judge in Houston , Texas , Ken Hoyt , said he had taken into account the help Fastow had given the prosecution and victims attempting to recoup their lost savings .
Evidence provided by Fastow helped secure the convictions for conspiracy and fraud of Enron 's founder , Kenneth Lay , and the former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling .
Lay , who died in July , and Skilling said Fastow had been the instigator of Enron 's demise , through his theft and dishonesty .
But the judge found that he had been only one of a number of people responsible .
Enron became the seventh biggest US company to be made bankrupt , in December 2001 when the state of its finances became public .
It lost $ 60bn ( £ 31.7bn ) in market value and $ 2bn in pension plans .
Judge Hoyt said Fastow had shown remorse about his misdeeds .
The judge decided not to fine him on the grounds that he had paid back $ 24 m in cash and property .
His wife , Lea , has already served a year 's prison sentence for helping him to hide his illegal earnings from the company .
"" What moves the arm of justice is mercy .
You were drunk on the wine of greed ...
you had a double portion , in that your wife shared in that , "" the judge said .
Fastow was originally charged with 78 counts of fraud , conspiracy and money - laundering , with 31 counts added later .
As the sentence was announced in court , Fastow hugged his wife and was immediately taken away by officers .
He will be sent to a low - security prison in Bastrop , Texas .
The judge has recommended that he be given treatment for drugs he has been taking to cope with anxiety .
When he is released he will be under a two - year supervision order ."
2006-10-23,"The former chief executive of Enron , Jeffrey Skilling , faces at least 20 years in jail when he is sentenced today for his role in one of America 's biggest corporate scandals .
Skilling was convicted in May on 19 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and lying to auditors .
His co - defendant , Enron founder Kenneth Lay , died from heart disease on July 5 .
Lay 's convictions on 10 counts of fraud , conspiracy and lying to banks in two separate cases were wiped out with his death .
Lay 's death and the lighter than expected sentence handed last month to Andrew Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer , who testified against his former bosses , can be expected to work against Skilling . ""
In theory , the death of Ken Lay should have no impact on the sentence that Mr Skilling receives .
But it 's hard to ignore the reality that Jeff Skilling is now standing alone as the figurehead who orchestrated Enron 's demise , "" said Robert Mintz , a former federal prosecutor .
"" There will certainly be pressure to make an example of Jeff Skilling and send a message with his sentence . ""
The collapse of Enron , once praised by Fortune magazine as "" America 's most innovative company "" , wiped out thousands of jobs , more than $ 60bn ( £ 32bn ) in market value and more than $ 2bn in pension plans .
Before sentence is handed down in Houston , Texas , Skilling will have to listen to victims of Enron 's 2001 collapse .
At least 10 people were scheduled to speak .
Charles Prestwood , a former pipeline operator for Enron who lost $ 1.3 m in retirement savings with Enron 's bankruptcy , said if it was up to him , Skilling would get 100 years in prison .
"" I think about all the families that man helped destroy and all the hard - working people that believed the top executives , "" he said .
"" He knows he broke the law .
He knows he 's done us wrong .
I 'll always believe until I go to my grave that man knew exactly what he was doing . ""
Daniel Petrocelli , Skilling 's attorney , said : "" The people who have been harmed by the bankruptcy have very strong feelings about the subject .
But that does not shed much light on the reasonableness of the sentence Mr Skilling should receive .
"" Under federal sentencing guidelines , Skilling faces more than 20 years in prison if losses to investors tied to his actions exceed $ 80 m .
Skilling also faces more than $ 18 m in fines for his crimes .
Prosecutors want Skilling to turn over nearly $ 183 m , which they allege he pocketed while participating in fraud .
The US government had divided that amount between Skilling and Lay .
But Lay 's death has left Skilling with the whole amount .
The government says about $ 60 m in Skilling 's cash and property that has been frozen since his indictment could be applied to the total amount they are seeking .
Skilling , 52 , maintained his innocence before , during and even after his trial , insisting no fraud occurred at Enron other than that committed by a few executives skimming millions in secret side deals , and that bad press and poor market confidence combined to sink the company .
Since his indictment , Skilling has had two run - ins with the law for public drunkenness .
The ignominious collapse of Enron was the first in a series of Wall Street scandals that shook public confidence in corporate America .
The after - effects are still being felt today as companies complain that a tightening in regulations following the Sarbanes - Oxley law , under which chief executives are held responsible for the company accounts , has led to foreign companies to list elsewhere - London - instead of New York ."
2006-10-23,"The former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling was sentenced to 24 years and four months in jail yesterday for masterminding the energy company 's web of fraud - riddled financial dealings that collapsed in one of America 's biggest corporate scandals .
Skilling , who led Enron at the height of its corrupt fortunes , was handed one of the toughest - ever penalties for a white - collar crime , a decision greeted with satisfaction by victims of the company 's fall .
The millionaire was put under house arrest and fitted with an electronic tag .
He was told that he will be transferred to a North Carolina prison as soon as the jail is ready to receive him .
He was also ordered to forfeit $ 45 m ( £ 30 m ) , to be distributed to former Enron staff .
At Houston 's federal court , district judge Sim Lake said Skilling 's actions had destroyed the livelihoods of his employees : "" As the many victims have so eloquently testified , his crimes have imposed on hundreds , if not thousands , a life sentence of poverty . ""
Skilling , 52 , was convicted in May by a jury on 19 counts of conspiracy , fraud and insider trading .
His co - defendant , the former Enron chairman Ken Lay , died of a heart attack in July , leaving Skilling to face the wrath of victims alone .
The prosecutor , Sean Berkowitz , said the fraud was "" as large and serious as any fraud in the nation 's history "" , adding : "" This was not a one - time event where someone made a judgment in error .
"" The court found that Skilling was responsible for a web of off - balance sheet ventures used to conceal Enron 's losses .
He enriched himself by selling $ 63 m of shares in the 18 months before the company collapsed .
He has vowed to appeal and he continued to protest his innocence yesterday , insisting he had been in the dark about wrongdoing at the firm . ""
Your honour , I am innocent of these charges , "" he said .
"" We will continue to pursue my constitutional rights . ""
Fighting back tears , Skilling rejected suggestions that he had shown no remorse over Enron 's demise : "" I can tell you that 's just the furthest thing from the truth .
It 's been very hard on me , but probably more importantly , incredibly hard on my family , incredibly hard on employees of Enron , incredibly hard on my friends and incredibly hard on the community . ""
The penalty is the second most severe ever for a white - collar fraud in America , exceeded only by a 25-year sentence handed to the former WorldCom boss Bernie Ebbers last year .
Enron 's demise prompted an estimated 21,000 redundancies .
A handful of people who lost jobs , savings and pensions were permitted to talk about their suffering in court .
Anne Beliveux , who worked as an administrative assistant at Enron , told the court that she lost half a million dollars , after being encouraged by senior executives to invest in the company 's shares . ""
Never in my wildest dreams would I think I would be facing what I 'm facing when I turn 65 , and that is there is no retirement , "" she said , telling Skilling that his actions were motivated by "" greed , nothing but greed , and you should be ashamed of yourself "" .
Another victim called Skilling a "" thief "" and a "" drunk "" , adding : "" My stomach does flips every time I hear your name . ""
The judge ruled that Skilling 's crimes were aggravated through his use of sophisticated means , by his abuse of Enron 's pension funds and because he perjured himself in statements about his share sales .
There was unease in some legal circles about the scale of the penalty .
Sam Buell , a former prosecutor on the Enron case who teaches at Washington University in St Louis , said sentencing guidelines had been lifted in recent decades due to concern that wealthy fraudsters were getting away with their crimes .
"" Maybe the pendulum has swung too far now in the opposite direction , "" he told the Guardian .
"" When you start talking about 24 years for white - collar fraud , there 's not a lot of room above that for violent crime . ""
Skilling was convicted largely thanks to the evidence of Enron 's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , who turned supergrass against his colleagues in return for a more modest sentence of six years ' imprisonment ."
2006-10-24,"The former Enron chief accountant had been scheduled as a co - defendant alongside his former bosses Kenneth lay and Jeffrey Skilling but agreed a last - minute plea deal .
Causey pleaded guilty to a single charge of securities fraud in exchange for a seven - year sentence and agreeing to help the prosecution .
He had originally been charged with 34 counts of fraud , insider trading and other offenses in January 2004 .
Causey had worked at Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm that had audited Enron and which was subsequently destroyed because of that relationship .
He jumped to Enron and eventually became its top accountant .
He was fired in February 2002 after an internal investigation concluded that he had failed to properly review some of the dubious deals with off - the - books entities that had inflated profits and hid debts .
While he was accused of helping to structure some of the fraudulent transactions , he was not accused of profiting from them personally ."
2006-10-24,"Raised in rural poverty in Missouri , Kenneth Lay became one of the most powerful men in corporate America .
He was named Enron chief executive in 1985 , when the company was formed through the merger of two Texas energy firms and built the business into , fleetingly , the seventh largest corporation in the United States .
He was dubbed "" Kenny Boy "" by President George Bush , although the White House later sought to distance itself from the businessman as his fortunes faltered .
Lay made way for his ambitious protege Jeffrey Skilling in February 2001 and resumed the chief executive role just six months later after Skilling quit .
The company filed for bankruptcy that December as it became apparent that Enron was riddled with fraud .
Lay was found guilty in May on six charges of fraud and conspiracy , stemming from his time back at the helm after Skilling had left .
Skilling had been characterised as the architect of the fraud at Enron and Lay had been accused of continuing the deception .
He had faced the likelihood of the rest of his life in prison but died suddenly of a heart attack in July at the age of 64 .
Lay had lowered his profile in Houston , where he had been a leading light , but had maintained that he was innocent .
After his death , the convictions were thrown out because Lay is not able to appeal ."
2006-10-24,"The former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison in September .
Fastow had been a key figure in the conviction of his former bosses , Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling .
After more than two years of apparently fruitless investigation , the government achieved its biggest breakthrough when Fastow pleaded guilty in January 2004 to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for a relatively lenient sentence .
During the trial of his bosses , Fastow admitted running off - the - books partnerships that helped Enron to inflate earnings and conceal its debts .
He skimmed off $ 44 m for himself in the process .
Lay and Skilling pointed the finger of blame solely at Fastow and said he was attempting to implicate others simply to reduce his own spell in prison .
The judge who sentenced him reduced his sentence from the original plea deal of 10 years , noting that Fastow had shown remorse and been of help to prosecutors .
His wife Lea had already served a one year prison sentence for helping him to conceal his illicit earnings from the company ."
2006-10-24,"Leading lawyers have questioned the US 's appetite for condemning white - collar fraudsters to decades behind bars , in a debate ignited by the sentencing of Enron 's former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling .
Skilling 's 24-year sentence did not quite overtake the record 25-year stretch for corporate fraud that was handed down to WorldCom 's boss Bernie Ebbers last year .
Some of those who lost their livelihoods when Enron collapsed have called for Skilling to spend the rest of his life in prison .
Charles Prestwood , a former pipeline employee who lost his job and his pension , told the Houston Chronicle : "" I want him to see life without parole , for all the lies he told us and others . ""
Specialists in white - collar crime say sentences have steadily become more severe in recent years .
Some have suggested that whereas corporate fraudsters were once treated too leniently , they are now being spared any mercy at all .
Lawrence Barcella , of the Washington law firm Paul Hastings , said : "" Over the last 20 years , sentencing guidelines for white - collar offenders have been ratcheted up regularly - not coincidentally , often during election years . ""
He questioned whether decades of imprisonment were necessary for rehabilitation or as a deterrent for other executives : "" There seems to be no correlation between these sentences and what the underlying reasons for punishment are . ""
The death in July of Skilling 's co - defendant , Ken Lay , has left the former chief executive as the "" last man standing "" in the case .
His defence lawyer , Dan Petrocelli , expressed concern that he was bearing the full brunt of public outrage .
"" Ken 's death has put more focus on Jeff Skilling in the public eye but the court must consider what is appropriate for Jeff Skilling in terms of what he is accused of doing , "" Mr Petrocelli said .
Although he has expressed sorrow for the pain of those who suffered in Enron 's collapse , Skilling has portrayed himself as a victim rather than a perpetrator .
To the fury of former employees , he continues to maintain that he was unaware of any fraud at the company and intends to appeal against his conviction next year . ""
He believes what he believes , "" Mr Petrocelli said , "" and he is going to face [ his sentencing ] with courage and conviction , and continue fighting the good fight . ""
The courts have frozen $ 80 m ( £ 43 m ) of assets held by Skilling and prosecutors are seeking repayment of $ 140 m in assets and gains from stock sales .
His fate was sealed by testimony from Enron 's former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , who gave evidence against his one - time colleagues and in return received a relatively modest sentence of six years .
Not quite as smart as he thought Jeffrey Skilling used to drive around Houston in a Mercedes with a number plate reading WLEC - world 's leading energy company .
The 52-year - old was Enron 's key cheerleader
and it was he who masterminded Enron 's strategy of hiding its losses in off - balance sheet ventures .
Born to a middle - class family in Pittsburgh , Skilling has a reputation for arrogance and impatience .
At an interview for Harvard Business School , he was asked whether he was smart and famously responded : "" I 'm fucking smart . ""
A former fraternity house member , he encouraged a macho environment at Enron , taking selected colleagues on high - energy trips motorcycling in Mexico and climbing glaciers in Patagonia .
When an analyst questioned the firm 's progress in one conference call , Skilling dismissed him as an "" asshole "" .
At his trial , Skilling told the jury that Enron 's collapse had prompted him to consider suicide .
In 2004 , he was picked up by police for erratic , threatening behaviour in a New York bar .
He was arrested again last month in Dallas for public intoxication .
Married to his former secretary , Skilling has three children .
He said this year that he believed he could stomach a long prison sentence , provided he had "" something to work on , something to accomplish "" ."
2006-11-01,"High - profile lawsuits at home and in the US today cast a shadow over Germany 's Deutsche Bank , which reported a 25 % leap in third - quarter net earnings to a record 1.2bn ( £ 800 m ) .
Germany 's biggest bank said it was involved in more than 10 suits in the US over its alleged role in the collapse of energy trader Enron in 2001 , including the lead "" class action "" and an action for damages by Enron itself for allegedly helping insiders to commit fraud .
The retrial of Deutsche Bank 's chief executive , Josef Ackermann , for breaches of fiduciary duty by awarding huge pay - outs to former Mannesmann executives after the German group 's takeover by Vodafone began in Düsseldorf last week .
Mr Ackermann , then a Mannesmann supervisory board member , has said he will resign if found guilty .
Deutsche , which has filed its own motion to partially dismiss Enron 's case , won a respite in the lead class action in June when a US court dismissed all claims against it and its affiliates .
But it said the lead plaintiff had asked the court to reconsider its dismissal .
Mr Ackermann , who shocked the Düsseldorf court by disclosing he earned more than 15 m a year , and his co - defendants , deny the charges brought over the 60 m pay - offs .
He is reportedly willing to consider an out - of - court settlement to prevent a prolonged retrial diverting him from the bank 's business .
He has staked his reputation on delivering a 25 % pre - tax return on equity and said today Deutsche had returned one of 32 % in the first nine months on earnings of 6.3bn despite a 100 m slip in third - quarter pre - tax profits to 1.8bn .
He reaffirmed his target of 8.4bn profits in 2008 .
Mr Ackermann said earnings so far this year outstripped those for the whole of 2005 and gave an upbeat forecast for the rest of 2006 , saying : "" The corporate pipeline is strong and global financial markets remain robust . ""
But the bank conceded that revenues in equities trading fell by a third in the quarter to 700 m , the bulk of the decline coming from investments of its own money in the stock market - offset by record 2bn sales in fixed income .
The jump in net earnings was boosted by more than 200 m from an insurance payout for damage in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US and the sale of a stake in industrial gases group Linde .
Analysts compared Deutsche 's performance favourably with that of bigger European rival UBS which yesterday recorded a 21 % slump in third - quarter net profit after wrongly betting that US interest rates would continue to rise .
But some expressed anxiety at the fall in in - house trading revenues .

2006-11-03,"Barclays said today it had agreed to pay $ 144 m ( £ 76 m ) to untangle itself from the collapse of Enron , the US energy trading company that went bankrupt in 2001 .
The bank said it had agreed to pay Enron the sum to settle a lawsuit arising from transactions between Enron and Barclays Capital , its investment banking unit , that were outstanding at the time that Enron sought bankruptcy protection .
Enron claimed that it was owed $ 144 m by Barclays , while it claimed Enron owed it $ 310 m .
Barclays said it had agreed to the settlement in a bankruptcy court in New York because it was "" preferable to the time , expense and unpredictability of litigation "" .
A bankruptcy court will now decide how much , if any , Barclays will receive of the $ 310 m it claims it is owed .
The bank said the terms of the settlement were similar to others between Enron and other creditors , including Royal Bank of Scotland .
It said the amount it had agreed to pay "" reflects Barclays ' lesser role relative to others involved in the litigation surrounding Enron 's bankruptcy "" .
It said that the settlement would have no impact on its earnings in 2006 as the costs had already been included in its annual report .
The lawsuit , which was brought by the Enron estate , is separate from a class action by Enron shareholders currently ongoing in federal court in Houston , Texas .
The shareholders , led by the University of California , who are seeking to recover $ 40bn in losses , alleged that Barclays , along with several other financial institutions , helped Enron create structures - including an off - balance sheet vehicle called Chewco , named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca - to hide the real financial condition of the company .
However , in July , the judge , Melinda Harmon , rejected the claims against Barclays , saying that it was at most "" a culpable aider and abettor "" .
The shareholders have appealed against the decision .
Former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , who has been sentenced to six years in prison for his part in the corporate fraud , said at the conclusion of his trial in September that executives at Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland , Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse were aware of financial transactions in which he had engaged . ""
In many instances the banks primarily devised the financial structures , which contributed to Enron achieving its financial reporting objectives , "" he said in court .
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the role of Barclays and other banks in the Enron debacle .

2006-12-13,"Former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling has been ordered to report to prison today to begin serving a 24-year sentence after a judge denied his request to remain free pending an appeal of his conviction .
Skilling will serve his time at a low - security federal prison in Waseca , Minnesota , about 75 miles south of Minneapolis .
The facility was converted from a college campus in the mid-1990s and Skilling will be housed in a former dorm room , which he will likely be forced to share with three other inmates .
There is a fence but the buildings inside do n't have barred doors and windows .
Skilling was convicted in May on 19 counts of fraud , conspiracy and insider trading and will enter prison almost exactly five years after Enron filed for bankruptcy .
He was convicted alongside the former chairman of the company Kenneth Lay , who has since died of a heart attack .
Enron collapsed amid a web of schemes to hide the former energy company 's debts and inflate its earnings and became a byword for corporate chicanery .
The appellate judge in the appeal case ruled that there were some "" serious frailties "" in Skilling 's conviction .
But he said they were not serious enough .
Skilling , he ruled , "" raises no substantial question that is likely to result in the reversal of his convictions "" and said the former Enron boss should report to prison immediately .
He denied a request for bail and vacated an earlier order staying his prison start date .
Skilling , 53 , maintained that he was innocent throughout the trial and argued that the case should have been heard outside Houston , where thousands lost their jobs when the company collapsed . ·

2006-12-14,"Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's disgraced chief executive , moved from a luxury Houston mansion into his new home yesterday , a bunk bed in a four - man cell at a low security prison in Minnesota .
America 's most notorious corporate criminal , who was convicted on 19 counts of fraud in May , lost a last - gasp application to remain free pending an appeal and was ordered by a panel of three judges to begin his 24-year sentence .
Skilling , 53 , who is generally viewed as the mastermind behind Enron 's corrupt web of businesses , was driven to jail shortly after midday by his brother , Mark , and his wife , Rebecca Carter , in a silver Jeep Liberty .
After exchanging brief hugs with his family , he entered the prison on the outskirts of Waseca - a town of 10,000 people which goes by the slogan "" Waseca : for an hour or a lifetime "" .
A former college campus , the jail has 1,070 inmates - most serving sentences for drug - related offences .
Although low security , it is surrounded by a fence and guarded , unlike open prisons for white - collar criminals in Britain .
A spokeswoman for the federal bureau of prisons told the Guardian that Skilling 's days would be fully occupied : "" All sentenced offenders are required to work , based on the institution 's needs .
Most are assigned jobs in food services , as orderlies or as grounds keepers . ""
The working day varies from seven to 12 hours per day and typical pay rates are between 12 cents ( 6p ) and 40 cents per hour which pales in comparison to the $ 865,000 salary and $ 5.6 m bonus which Skilling received in his last year at Enron .
He could eventually earn up to 54 days out per year for good behaviour .
Yesterday 's ruling did hold some hope for Skilling as the judges said there were "" serious frailties "" in some of his convictions .
But they ruled there was little prospect of all counts being overturned ."

A former college campus , the jail contains 1,070 inmates - most of whom are serving sentences for drug - related offences .
Accommodation is typically in four - bunk cells , which will mark a change in lifestyle for the former chief executive who once resided in a $ 4.7 m mansion in a Houston suburb .
A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons told the Guardian that Skilling 's days would be fully occupied : "" All sentenced offenders are required to work , based on the institution 's needs .
Most are assigned jobs in food services , as orderlies or as groundskeepers .
"" The working day varies from seven to 12 hours and typical prison pay rates in America are between 12c ( 6p ) and 40c an hour - which pales in comparison to the $ 865,000 salary and $ 5.6 m bonus which he received in his last year at Enron .
Yesterday 's court ruling did hold some hope for Skilling as the judge said there were "" serious frailties "" in some of his 19 convictions as a result of a decision to overturn guilty verdicts in another Enron case , the Nigerian barge trial .
However , the judge said there was little prospect of all of his offences being overturned .
Skilling is widely seen as the mastermind behind Enron 's web of corrupt off - balance sheet ventures intended to disguise losses .
The collapse of the fraud - riddled energy company led to 21,000 job losses and , according to Skilling 's trial judge , condemned former employees to "" a life sentence of poverty "" ."
2006-12-14,"The tiny Minnesota town of Waseca has never enjoyed quite so much national attention .
Some 75 miles south of Minnesota , the community of 9,737 people has just welcomed a new resident - the disgraced former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling .
Wearing a dark coat and sunglasses , Skilling turned up at Waseca 's low security federal prison to begin his 24-year sentence for fraud just after midday yesterday .
By early afternoon , grainy photos were circulating on the web of the businessman sharing a farewell hug with his wife , former Enron corporate secretary Rebecca Carter .
Generally viewed as the mastermind behind Enron 's web of corruption , Skilling originally wanted to go to prison in the sunnier climes of North Carolina , rather than in Minnesota .
Clearly , Waseca did not appeal - the down - at - heel place has an average household income of just $ 27,000 ( £ 13,727 ) annually .
Much mirth was made in the media yesterday of Waseca 's town slogan - "" Waseca : for an hour or a lifetime "" .
Local dignitaries were revelling in the attention .
The curiously named mayor , Roy Srp , said : "" There 's a bit of a buzz about him coming , sure ... ""
His story is quite prevalent and he is infamous , so he 's the most infamous person we have out there that the citizens will know about . ""
The Wall Street Journal 's blogger , Ashby Jones , was gleeful , pointing readers to various websites for "" some attractive shots of a lake , barns , trees and - our favourite - a horse - drawn sleigh "" .
Skilling 's hometown paper , the Houston Chronicle , was far from sympathetic .
Its columnist , Loren Steffy , wrote : "" Here , amid the frozen and fallow fields , is a fitting place for Skilling to begin his penance .
This town of almost 10,000 is steeped in the values Skilling long ago traded for the arrogance and greed that dominated his tenure at Enron . ""
Steffy pointed out that unlike Enron 's intangible trading structures , the local industries in Waseca tended be "" real companies producing real products , the sort of asset - laden businesses that Skilling mocked in his days running Enron "" .
At his trial , Skilling at least had the comradeship of a co - defendant to fall back on .
But Enron 's former chairman , Ken Lay , died of a heart attack in July .
One American blogger , Sinfonian , observed : "" Call this the Kenny - Boy Memorial Daily Schadenfreude .
He ought to be in jail , too ...
but I 'm sure he 's a lot warmer where he is now ( and I do n't mean Argentina ) than Skilling will be in Minnesota . ""

2006-12-14,"The US government has attacked the conduct of one of the so - called Natwest Three , accusing the British banker of misleading the court about his financial position and of behaving as if he is considering fleeing the country .
Gary Mulgrew , who was extradited to Texas five months ago alongside two former Natwest colleagues to face Enron - related embezzlement charges , has been accused in court filings of hiding the extent of his wealth and of failing to disclose an American bank account .
Mulgrew was released in July on bail of $ 200,000 .
The bond was lower than the $ 500,000 set for each of his co - defendants , David Bermingham and Giles Darby , because he told the court he was short of money .
The US federal authorities have since discovered an affidavit filed by Mulgrew during divorce proceedings in Britain which culminated in his wife receiving a $ 3.15 m ( £ 1.6 m ) settlement .
In a London family court affidavit , Mulgrew says : "" I have been determined to make sure that my family are financially secure , independent from me . ""
In documents filed at Houston 's federal court last week , US prosecutors accused Mulgrew of transferring money to his adult siblings ahead of his arrest .
They say this could be an escape strategy .
The US government has refused a request from Mulgrew to drop his electronic tagging and says it might seek an increase in his bond .
Prosecutors are angry that Mulgrew successfully petitioned the court to obtain information from his impounded passport on the grounds that he needed to open a US bank account to pay for food and household bills .
The authorities have discovered that he already had an account at Bank of America .
Mulgrew 's lawyer has filed a vigorous defence of his client 's conduct , insisting that his Bank of America account was opened many years ago and that he mistakenly believed it had since been closed .
Defence counsel David Schwarz says Mulgrew 's comments about his assets were made during a "" contentious "" divorce two years ago which culminated in his ex - wife getting 65 % to 70 % of the family 's assets .
Mulgrew admits giving his brother $ 60,000 to buy a house in Australia and to making further loans of $ 16,000 to another brother and a sister .
But his lawyer said : "" The government 's intimation that Mr Mulgrew is a flight risk as a result of these repaid loans and a gift to his brother is offensive . ""
He adds that the US government 's suggestion that Mulgrew could jump bail is "" specious "" ."

Thursday : ignore the above : Cisco says it will sue Apple to protect the iPhone trademark .
Apple did indeed register the "" iPhone "" trademark in the US , and it was granted in September 2006 .
Do n't believe us ?
See this page .
Sure , it 's down for "" Ocean Telecom Services "" , but the description ( not to mention the typography ) are all that Apple gear .

Now , if you look at the results of a search in the US Patent and Trademark Office for "" iPhone "" , you get 9 results , of which 6 have been abandoned .
The only others , besides Apple , are for a hotel internal phone , and Cisco 's , which arguably does n't conflict with the Apple one - the trademark is in a different field , of "" computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks "" , not "" handheld and mobile digital electronic devices for the sending and receiving of telephone calls , faxes , electronic mail , and other digital data ... ""
So Apple might squeak through this one without having to shell out to either of the other trademark holders .
Oh , and it 's worth hearing what Apple thinks the iPhone could do :
handheld and mobile digital electronic devices for the sending and receiving of telephone calls , faxes , electronic mail , and other digital data ; MP3 and other digital format audio players ; handheld computers , personal digital assistants , electronic organizers , electronic notepads ; magnetic data carriers ; telephones , mobile phones , computer gaming machines , videophones , cameras ; prerecorded computer programs for personal information management , database management software , electronic mail and messaging software , paging software , database synchronization software , computer programs for accessing , browsing and searching online databases , computer software and firmware , namely operating system programs , data synchronization programs , and application development tool programs for personal and handheld computers ; electronic handheld units for the wireless receipt and/or transmission of data that enable the user to keep track of or manage personal information ; software for the redirection of messages , Internet e - mail , and/or other data to one or more electronic handheld devices from a data store on or associated with a personal computer or a server ; and software for the synchronization of data between a remote station or device and a fixed or remote station or device ; computer hardware and software for providing integrated telephone communication with computerized global information networks ; hand - held unit for playing electronic games

2007-03-16,"Takafumi Horie , the internet tycoon who took on Japan 's business establishment with his get - rich - quick mantra , was today sentenced to two - and - a - half years in prison for securities fraud .
Horie , 34 , showed no emotion as the judge delivered his ruling at the Tokyo district court , ending the latest stage in a case that some are calling "" Japan 's Enron "" .
The court granted Horie bail while his lawyers lodge an appeal .
Horie , a Tokyo university dropout who in the space of a decade built the internet portal Livedoor into a empire worth $ 6bn ( £ 3.1bn ) at its peak , had pleaded not guilty to making false financial statements in a bid to hide Livedoor 's losses and boost its share price .
Throughout his six - month trial he maintained that he had been targeted by traditional business interests appalled by his near - effortless acquisition of wealth through aggressive buyouts of other firms .
The judge , Toshiyuki Kosaka , said Horie had masterminded the construction of a network of dummy investment partnerships "" for the purpose of evading the law "" .
"" At that point , the prosecution 's case was proven , "" he told a packed courtroom .
Prosecutors said Livedoor had deliberately misled investors in 2004 by reporting a pre - tax profit of about ¥ 5bn ( £ 22 m ) to hide losses of ¥ 310 m .
One such fund , Mr Kosaka said , "" had nothing to do with Livedoor 's main business ...
its purpose was to manipulate Livedoor 's accounts "" .
Horie , dressed in a dark blue suit and tie rather than one of his trademark designer T - shirts , consulted court documents as the judge read out details of the ruling .
In a sign of the impact Horie has had in Japan , Mr Kosaka took the unusual step of offering him words of encouragement .
Citing a letter he had received from the parents of a young disabled woman who had been inspired by Horie to overcome her disability , find a job and spend some of her earnings on Livedoor shares , he said : "" Although you may have been found guilty , it does n't mean that everything about you has been condemned .
"" I want you to make amends for what you did and then start your life anew . ""
But Horie 's lawyer , Yasuyuki Takai , said he feared the ruling would discourage talented young entrepreneurs from attempting to break the mold of Japanese business .
"" People who take up new challenges have no choice but to challenge legal ambiguities , "" he told a news conference .
"" I can not understand why there is a prison sentence .
I regret to say that my disillusionment with the Japanese criminal justice system has only worsened .
"" Horie 's lawyers claimed the prosecution had relied too heavily on ambiguities in the law 's treatment of aggressive takeovers , and on the testimony of Livedoor 's former chief financial officer , Ryoji Miyauchi , who is being tried separately along with three other Livedoor executives .
Mr Miyauchi , who has pleaded guilty to charges of violating the securities law , will learn his fate on March 22 .
Prosecutors had demanded a four - year prison sentence for Horie , an unrepentant hedonist with a penchant for Ferraris and actress girlfriends .
His repeated denials of wrongdoing and his verbal assaults on his accusers could have influenced the decision not to give him a suspended sentence , as many had expected .
Japanese executives accused of white - collar crimes in Japan often plead guilty , apologise , and avoid prison .
His treatment contrasted with that of Yoshiaki Tsutsumi , the former chairman of Seibu Railway - and once the world 's richest man - who received a 30-month suspended sentence and a ¥ 5 m fine in 2005 after pleading guilty to insider trading and falsifying information about shareholders .
Horie 's dramatic fall is a blow to those who saw him as a trailblazer for a more energetic , riskier style of business and a refreshing contrast to the dour , middle - aged executives who dominate corporate Japan .
Once a little - known , slightly geeky figure with an undiluted faith in the potential of the dot.com age , Horie penetrated the public consciousness with bold but unsuccessful bids for a professional baseball team and a television network .
In September 2005 , he made a failed attempt to enter parliament as a reform - minded independent with the personal blessing of the then prime minister , Junichiro Koizumi .
The mainstream media 's adoration for Horie quickly turned to disdain after his arrest in January last year , but some Livedoor investors , who have seen the value of their shares plummet , had expected a more lenient sentence .
"" I was a little surprised as the ruling was harsher than I expected , "" Ichiro Shimizu , said in a TV interview .
"" I think the court carefully judged just how much damage was done to shareholders . ""
The value of Livedoor shares plunged after investigators raided its offices in Tokyo 's Roppongi Hills complex - a magnet for Japan 's nouveau riche - in January last year .
The raid sent Japanese stocks into freefall and forced an embarrassed Tokyo Stock Exchange to close early amid fears that the volume of sell orders would overwhelm its computer system .
Livedoor 's market value plunged by $ 5bn after Horie 's arrest , prompting a separate lawsuit from shareholders .
Shares in the firm were trading at about ¥ 700 each before the raid ; by the time Livedoor was delisted from the TSE last April

2007-04-11,"A Texan energy trader who emerged from Enron 's ashes , John Arnold , has been crowned as the new king of the hedge fund world with personal earnings of close to £ 1bn last year after a spectacularly successful bet on the direction of natural gas prices .
Mr Arnold , the 33-year - old founder of Houston - based Centaurus Energy , correctly predicted that the cost of gas would fall last summer .
His bet netted billions of dollars in profits for Centaurus .
It was precisely the opposite call to that of rival Amaranth , which lost $ 6bn ( £ 3bn ) predicting that prices would rise and became the biggest hedge fund failure in history .
A list compiled by Trader Monthly magazine puts Mr Arnold as top earner in the financial sector alongside James Simons , head of New York 's Renaissance Technologies .
Of the 100 people on the list , 93 are hedge fund managers - underlining the power of the opaque , low - profile sector - and 27 of them are based in London .
They earned an average of £ 120 m , compared with an equivalent average of £ 55 m in 2002 , and five of them took home more than £ 500 m .
Rich Blake , senior editor of Trader Monthly , said : "" The mounds of money have grown that much more mountainous . ""
Few are prepared to talk about their success publicly .
Mr Blake said : "" The stated reason , in some cases , is fear for their lives and their families ' lives .
But beyond that , people just feel that if you 're under the radar , you can succeed more as a trader . ""
Although the top two on the list are in the same estimated income bracket , Mr Blake said he believed the founder of Centaurus had the edge .
Mr Arnold 's success is all the more remarkable given that he began his career as an energy trader at America 's most notorious corporate disaster scene , Enron .
Following Enron 's implosion , Mr Arnold established Centaurus with three employees in 2002 and the fund now has 40 people , including , reportedly , a full - time meteorologist .
Art Gelber , a Houston energy consultant , said Mr Arnold was "" very much the gentleman , "" adding : "" I think he knows the market pretty well .
He 's got skills in his background
and he 's got the kind of positioning and edge to succeed - although I do n't know whether last year was repeatable . ""
Recently married , Mr Arnold owns a home in Houston 's plush River Oaks area and is said to have a keen interest in art .
A spokeswoman for Centaurus declined to comment although she did provide a recent newspaper article highlighting Mr Arnold 's support for a children 's charity called the Knowledge is Power Program .
Of the world 's top 10 earners , all are in the US .
Among them is the legendary oil speculator T Boone Pickens , who is a prominent donor to the Republican party , and Eddie Lampert , who controls the Sears and Kmart retail empires .
In fifth place , Stevie Cohen has faced scrutiny over a lawsuit alleging that his SAC fund disseminated faulty research to drive down the stock of a biotech company .
He lives on a 6-hectare ( 14-acre ) Connecticut estate with an ice - hockey rink and paintings by Monet and Pollock .
Many of the funds run by the top earners are far out of the reach of ordinary investors .
John Mauldin , a Texas - based hedge fund consultant , said many had a minimum investment of $ 10 m : "" Your average millionaire does n't even stand a chance - you need money the size of a pension fund .
These are very sophisticated investors .
It 's not your average mom or pop putting money into these funds . ""
In Britain , the top "" hedgies "" for the second successive year were Noam Gottesman and Pierre Lagrange , joint founders of GLG Partners , who took home between £ 200 m and £ 250 m each .
Mr Gottesman charters a customised Boeing 737 for business trips to the US and is a member of the Royal Opera House 's exclusive First Night Club .
Their fund , which manages £ 9bn , suffered a jolt last year when its star trader , Philippe Jabre , was fined for market abuse over a Japanese bond deal .
Mr Jabre has since left the company .
Other leading London - based traders include Chris Hohn , who led opposition to Deutsche Börse 's attempt to buy the London Stock Exchange , and Michael Farmer - a metals specialist and devout Catholic who once toyed with the idea of becoming a priest .
Jonathan Lourie , who earned £ 100 m , heads Cheyne Capital , which recently revealed that one of its offshoots is invested in 24,900 sub - prime US mortgages .
The amount of money earned by hedge funds is relatively easy to calculate as they use formulas such as "" 3-and-30 "" or "" 2-and-20 "" - taking 2 % of assets invested and 20 % of profits earned .
Investors are unlikely to begrudge the millions scooped by the elite managers .
Mr Mauldin said : "" Hedge funds are businesses with a pre - agreed structure there for all to see .
If they generate no profit , they get no money .
There 's nobody holding a gun to investors ' heads and telling them they 've got to put their money into these funds . ""
World 's top - earning traders ( 2006 )"
2007-05-19,"Do you have to be an asshole to succeed in business ?
Many would answer ' yes ' - the rueful witnesses to the fact that in business , as in baboon troops , alpha males ( and females ) end up on top , where the combination of success , domineering natures and fawning underlings quickly turns them into horrible creeps .
This is why in a list of the world 's greatest assholes , business would take a disproportionate share - Kozlowski and Ebbers , ' Chainsaw Al ' Dunlap , Trump , Eisner and much of the top management at Enron .
Although in the UK maybe only Maxwell would make the A - list , we could supply a richly unpleasant supporting cast , including many trading managers in the City of London .
But the asshole imperative is self - serving fallacy .
As Bob Sutton notes in his entertaining and important The No Asshole Rule ( Sphere ) , succeeding in business is not the same as having a successful business ; in fact without careful management , the abrasive qualities that the unscrupulous use to elbow others out of their way as they move up can , and often do , tear the fabric of the organisation to bits .
Assholes may ' succeed ' , but they often wreck the business in doing so .
This forceful plea by Sutton - management professor at Stanford and co - author of Hard Facts , Dangerous Half Truths and Total Nonsense - for workplace civility is founded on a mass of psychological and management research demonstrating that the idea of ' the brilliant bastard ' , the star who is also an asshole , is , organisationally speaking , an oxymoron .
In terms of hard cash , one business estimated only the most obvious management , legal and HR costs of dealing with an ' untouchable ' but obnoxious performer at $ 160,000 a year ; adding in the indirect losses to the firm through stress , demotivation , absenteeism and knock - on effects for customers takes the Total Cost of Assholes , or TCA , multiples higher .
More cheerfully , high TCA means the results of getting rid of assholes are invariably less financially damaging than expected and often more than offset by the positive effects - freer flow of ideas , fewer leavers , better morale and more time to spend on customers rather than staying alive .
There are , Sutton admits , one or two exceptions to the ' No Assholes Rule ' .
Managers sometimes need to do ' bad cop ' as well as ' good ' , not least to deal with the clueless , spiteful and lazy - assholes , in fact .
In some people it 's hard to tell whether good or bad cop predominates .
When he googled ' Steve Jobs ' , Apple 's mercurial chief , with ' asshole ' , Sutton got 89,000 hits compared with just 750 for Oracle 's equally notorious Larry Ellison .
Jobs is undeniably both brilliant and impossible , capable of making underlings believe he is either the devil or a hero .
But research shows that fear motivates less well than positive reward .
Playing the asshole , Sutton concludes , is a dangerous game , the most likely outcome of which is that you are one , in which case you 'll almost certainly do far more harm than good .
The reason is that human emotions , including fear , contempt and rage , are contagious ; while conversely , personality has little influence on how people behave in particular circumstances .
Negative interactions have five times more effect on mood than positive ones .
The upshot of this triple whammy is that ' assholes breed like rabbits ' .
Worse , if the plague is n't stifled at birth , it can kick off a vicious circle
in which asshole behaviour becomes institutionalised , generating expectations that reinforce it .
Managers who rule by fear and loathing foster cynicism , resistance and indifferent performance that seem to justify yet another turn of the screw .
In some areas - Wall Street and the City of London , Hollywood , the music industry and increasing swathes of the UK public sector - asshole management is endemic , raising the spectre of the horror - film scenario in which our organisations reprocess us in their own malign and shrunken image .
In Sutton 's chilling phrase , ' Assholes are us ' .
This is not an idle threat .
While the reverse process also holds - civilised behaviour begets civilised behaviour - many of the things organisations do in the name of management encourage rather than dampen asshole tendencies .
For example , hundreds of research studies confirm the adage that power corrupts .
Increasing status and power differences turns alpha natures into assholes ( who as a result make worse decisions ) and inferiors into underperforming wimps .
Powerlessness corrupts , too .
Many organisations aggravate the problem with ' performance cultures ' that constantly rate and rank people , garland a few stars and ignore the rest .
Yet the evidence is clear and easily understandable : ' if you want to have fewer assholes - and better organisational performance - reducing the status differences between the highest- and lowest - status members .. is the way to go . '
Oh , anyway , sod it - this book is a blow for humanity as well as management .

2007-05-24,"UK companies spend nearly £ 1.5bn each year on audits of their financial statements .
Yet episodes like Hollinger , Farepak , Barings , Ahold , Equitable Life , MG Rover , Parmalat , Enron and others suggest that company audits offer little protection to stakeholders .
It 's time to replace them .
A common understanding is that auditors are independent of the company and its directors and thus in a position to make impartial judgements .
This is one of the biggest hoaxes of all time .
Company auditors are hired , fired and remunerated by directors though their decisions are rubber - stamped by shareholders .
Many auditors also sell tax avoidance and a variety of consultancy services to client companies .
This gives them a direct interest in corporate transactions and they have rarely exposed any shady dealings .
Despite having statutory access to almost all records , officers and employees of the company , auditors deny obligations to detect and report fraud .
Their files are not available to any stakeholder to see what they knew .
Though auditing firms carry the soubriquet "" professional "" , they are commercial organisations .
In pursuit of profits , they continued to accept Maxwell , BCCI , Enron , WorldCom , Transtec , Versailles Group , Hollinger and others as clients .
They are adept at prioritising the interests of directors above those of any other stakeholder .
In the case of the frauds by Robert Maxwell , page 328 of a report by the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) inspectors noted that the auditing firm consistently agreed accounting treatments of transactions that served the interest of Maxwell and not those of the trustees or the beneficiaries of the pension scheme , provided it could be justified by an interpretation of the letter of the relevant standards or regulations .
The audit firm 's strategy , as noted on page 381 of the DTI report , was summed up by a senior partner who told staff that , "" The first requirement is to continue to be at the beck and call of RM [ Robert Maxwell ] , his sons and staff , appear when wanted and provide whatever is required "" .
Scholarly research shows that nearly 60 % of audit staff admit to either falsifying audit work , or not doing it at all .
Audits are time and labour intensive .
To boost their profits , auditing firms continue to reduce time budgets .
They hope that audit trainees will work weekends and evenings for nothing to finalise the audit .
The routinised audit work is boring and time consuming .
To ensure that they are not seen to be unproductive or over budget , audit staff avoid awkward looking items and often pretend to have checked items that have not even been examined .
Over the years , I have forwarded this research to the Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) and the UK auditing regulators , but none have ever examined the organisational values of auditing firms .
The threat of lawsuits can force auditors to be more vigilant , but this has been diluted .
Generally , auditors only owe a "" duty of care "" to the company as a legal person rather than to any individual shareholder , creditor or other stakeholder .
As page 19 of a UK Treasury - sponsored study ( pdf ) notes , individual stakeholders can not successfully sue auditors even when they can show that "" the auditors had been negligent "" .
Most lawsuits against UK auditing firms are brought by other accountancy firms , acting in their capacity as liquidators .
Ordinary stakeholders rarely get much out of this .
Auditing firms already trade as limited liability companies and limited liability partnerships .
The prospects of making them accountable for poor audits are further eroded by "" proportionate liability "" introduced by the Companies Act 2006 .
This enables directors and auditors , subject to shareholder approval , to negotiate limits to auditor liability , this makes it even harder to bring negligent auditors to book .
The policy was first introduced in the US in the mid-1990s and played a key role in the Enron and WorldCom audit failures .
Now major firms are campaigning to place an artificial "" cap "" on auditor liability and their US political donations are about to pay high dividends .
The EU and UK are keen to follow suit .
Under a cap the outcome of lawsuits would have no relationship to the extent of auditor negligence , or the losses suffered by that negligence .
Serious doubts about the auditors ' ability to deliver good audits are also created by business developments .
It is doubtful that auditors can effectively audit banks operating from 140 countries .
The traditional ex - post audits can not perform any meaningful checks on the world of instantaneous transfers of money .
Neither are auditors able to deal with complex financial instruments .
Many major companies manage their risks by placing clever bets on the movement of exchange rates , interest rates and prices of commodities .
Depending upon the outcomes , the value of such contracts ( derivatives ) can range from zero to several millions .
The collapse of Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) showed that even the Nobel Prize winners in economics could not work out the value of such financial instruments .
Auditors are certainly not equipped with such skills and are simply rubber - stamping the figures produced by management .
Company auditors have shown little interest in becoming independent and have fought tooth and nail to preserve their right to sell consultancy to audit clients .
The regulators have shown little interest in protecting the interests of stakeholders or looking at the internal workings of auditing firms .
The liability regimes encourage inertia and audit failures .
Traditional audits can not audit banks or the financial statements of major corporations .
Yet people do need to protect their savings , pensions and investments from fraud .
So rather than constantly trying to revise the traditional auditing model and rescue the failed technology , alternatives need to be developed .
One possibility is to abolish the annual statutory audit and require all companies to have insurance cover equivalent to ( say ) twice the value of their assets so that defrauded stakeholders claims can be satisfied .
£
1.5bn can buy a lot of insurance cover and details would be publicly known .
To minimise the risk of misinformation , laws would need to be changed to make all company directors personally liable for knowingly publishing misleading financial statements .
Corporate laws will need to be strengthened to ensure that companies publish the required information .
Of course , insurance companies need to assess the fraud risks and may use the services of accountancy firms to make assessments of corporate internal controls and fraud potential .
It is extremely unlikely that , under these arrangements , accountancy firms would be able to deny any obligations to look for fraud and stakeholders will not have to put up with the pretensions of independent auditors ."
2007-06-22,"For the fraudulent mastermind behind the collapse of Enron , this week marked a minor milestone .
Jeffrey Skilling has completed his first six months at a low - security prison in Minnesota .
He only has 23 years and 10 months to go .
Skilling 's jail , which is just outside the 9,600-strong town of Waseca ( slogan : "" for an hour ... for a lifetime "" ) , houses inmates in four - bunk , dormitory - style cells .
A former inmate told the Dallas Morning News that the former millionaire is probably , as a new inmate , in an upper bunk with a steam pipe six inches away from his face .
"" I 'm sure he thinks it 's hell , "" said the one - time prisoner succinctly .
Does a similar fate await Conrad Black , the fallen press baron whose trial is entering its final stages ?
With the jury due to go out early next week , the former Telegraph owner 's future is truly on a knife edge .
Black is accused of fraud , racketeering , tax evasion and obstruction of justice .
The US government alleges that he plundered $ 60 m ( £ 30 m ) from his Hollinger media empire .
Legal analysts , journalists and expert commentators are split on the likely outcome of the thee - month trial .
Stephen Skurka , a Canadian lawyer who has been in court throughout , reckons Black will be cleared on all counts .
Others , including Chicago attorney Hugh Totten , believe the US government has done enough to prove its charges .
Totten told Canada 's CTV this week that prosecutor Julie Ruder 's closing statement was a "" home run "" showing a "" very broad and very deep evidentiary foundation "" for the case .
If the jury decides that Black 's guilt is beyond reasonable doubt , the erudite , ermine - clad former inksmith faces many years in the clanger . '
Where are those victims ? '
But just how high should his alleged crimes rank in America 's hit parade of crooked corporate chiefs ?
A comparison with Skilling is an interesting one .
Many people instinctively feel that the crimes of Skilling and his late conspirator , Ken Lay , were much worse than Black 's alleged transgressions because Enron went bust - leaving 21,000 victims without jobs , healthcare or pensions .
Hollinger , on the other hand , is still soldiering on under a new name - Sun - Times Media Group .
Black and his co - defendants are accused of skimming a cut of the proceeds from a series of sales of newspaper titles which were actually , as a whole , lucrative and cash - generative for investors .
In his closing statement , Black 's lawyer , Edward Greenspan , pointed out that the US government had failed to produce a single "" victim "" of the peer 's alleged crimes : "" We 've been sitting here for 14 weeks .
Where are those shareholders ?
Where are those victims ? ""
But that is n't really a satisfactory defence .
If Black is guilty , he hurt thousands of shareholders by a tiny measure apiece .
As individuals , they would n't have noticed their loss .
Is the pain suffered by victims a proper measure of the severity of a crime ?
Or , to be philosophical for a moment , should we also measure it according to intent ?
In the Enron scandal , Skilling and Lay went through extraordinary accounting contortions to hide the extent of mounting problems at the energy trading behemoth .
They shovelled losses into off - balance sheet vehicles in the belief that they could turn things round .
Their crimes were motivated by pride and by arrogance .
They were propping up their own lifestyles and there was some evidence of insider dealing .
But in their own twisted way , they were also trying to save their company - and , presumably , to avoid the catastrophic pain that its failure would entail .
If Black is convicted , he can not possibly argue that any of his alleged crimes were misguided attempts on any level to support Hollinger .
Or that he was swept along by events with a momentum of their own .
The charges against him amount to straightforward theft , motivated - the US government claims - by personal greed and a desire to maintain a luxurious transatlantic lifestyle of antique - stuffed apartments , champagne and caviar , diamond rings and exotic holidays .
If Black is guilty , he is a thief - pure and simple – even though the amount involved is far smaller than the sums tied up in Enron 's web of corruption .
America 's treatment of white - collar criminals is severe .
Sam Buell , a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at Washington University in St Louis , told me during the Enron fiasco that the difference is partly down to broad public involvement in the stockmarket .
About half of the US public owns stocks or shares , compared to about a third of Brits .
"" The average American is invested in the stockmarket to a degree not seen 10 to 15 years ago .
To have an adequate pension , you need to invest personally - it 's not enough to rely on your employer , "" said Buell .
"" All of that means candour and truth on the financial markets are much more at the forefront of American minds than they are in the UK . ""
Black 's fate will be determined within the next few weeks .
In the same courthouse , just upstairs , Chicago 's biggest mob trial for many years is just beginning .
Joey "" the clown ""
Lombardo , in a wheelchair aged 78 , is accused of being the godfather of the "" Chicago Outfit "" in the 1970s and 1980s .
Just like Conrad , he 's charged with racketeering .
But he 's alleged to have been involved in murders .
That 's worse – no argument there ."
2007-11-26,"A trio of British bankers dubbed the "" Natwest Three "" are on the brink of a plea agreement which could involve an admission of wrongdoing in return for a lighter charges from the US government .
A hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday at Houston 's federal court for David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew , who are accused of embezzling $ 7.3 m ( £ 3.53 m ) through a deal in the Cayman Islands with the defunct energy trading conglomerate Enron .
The hearing , before judge Ewing Werlein , is a re - arraignment - a process required in cases where the charges have significantly changed .
In an email to the media , a spokeswoman for the trio said : "" It is possible that by [ Wednesday ] they may have a case put to them against which they can enter a new plea . ""
She said there would be no further comment from the defendants , although she added that their families wanted the men to be "" back home soonest "" .
In the run - up to their extradition in July last year , the trio orchestrated a high - profile political campaign alleging that they were the innocent victims of an unjust treaty which allowed America to seize British citizens on the basis of scant evidence .
Among their supporters were senior Conservative politicians and business figures such as British Airways ' chairman Martin Broughton , the retail tycoon Philip Green , Glaxo SmithKline 's chairman Sir Christopher Gent and the London Stock Exchange chairman , Chris Gibson - Smith .
The trio staunchly maintained that they had done nothing wrong .
Critics , however , pointed to correspondence seized by prosecutors in which the bankers discussed keeping their controversial dealings with Enron under wraps and , at one point , referred to their actions as "" robbery "" of an Enron off - balance sheet venture .
Enron 's disgraced former chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , was scheduled to be the prosecution 's star witness against them .
For the last 16 months , the three suspected fraudsters have been on bail under stringent conditions restricting them to a curfew and preventing them from leaving the Houston area .
A coterie of 50 unnamed individuals , thought to include senior City bankers , put up $ 2 m surety for them .
Under the original indictment , the trio were charged with wire fraud .
In court papers , prosecutors indicated last year that they would seek punishments of between seven and nine years imprisonment ."
2007-11-27,"Three British bankers whose extradition to the United States caused a political storm last year are on the brink of a plea agreement that could involve an admission of wrongdoing over an alleged $ 20 m fraud related to the collapse of Enron .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were dubbed the "" NatWest Three "" when they were sent from London to Texas under a controversial treaty which , according to critics , allowed the US to seize British citizens on scant evidence .
After 16 months on bail in Houston , they are due to appear before a judge tomorrow for a re - arraignment hearing - a process required in cases where the charges have significantly changed .
In a statement emailed to the media , a spokeswoman for the trio said : "" It is possible that by then [ Wednesday ] they may have a case put to them against which they can enter a new plea . ""
She said there would be no further comment from the defendants , although she added that their families wanted the men to be "" back home soonest "" .
The three former senior bankers at NatWest 's capital markets arm were involved in a deal with an Enron off - balance - sheet venture in 2000 that culminated in $ 7.3 m ( £ 4.8 m ) flowing from Houston through the Cayman Islands and into their personal bank accounts .
They are accused of recommending that NatWest sell its stake in an Enron - related investment at a knockdown price - and of making a profit on the side through a conspiracy with Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , who is now serving a six - year prison sentence for fraud .
Prosecutors allege that the transaction defrauded Enron 's shareholders to the tune of $ 20 m .
Under the US government 's original indictment , each of the trio faced seven charges of wire fraud and up to nine years in prison .
Legal experts say that unless the government 's case has unexpectedly weakened , any plea agreement is likely to involve a prison sentence .
Sam Buell , a former Enron prosecutor who now teaches law at Washington University in St Louis , Missouri , said : "" If it looks anything like it did when it was initially charged , this is a significant fraud involving millions of dollars .
For a fraud of that size , it 's likely to involve some time in prison . ""
Lawrence Barcella , a white - collar crime expert at the Washington DC law firm Paul Hastings , said : "" The government is likely to argue that everybody who 's entered a plea , everybody who 's been convicted of a crime [ related to Enron ] , has served some prison time and that these men were part of a massive fraud too . ""
Lawyers for the three bankers have struggled to persuade former colleagues in Britain to travel to Houston as defence witnesses .
Supporters of the trio have accused Royal Bank of Scotland , which owns NatWest , of shielding past and present staff with uncooperative corporate lawyers .
But there has also been a setback for the US government through a recent decision by an appeals court to overturn Enron - related convictions against three former Merrill Lynch bankers .
The appeals judges decided that prosecutors had overstretched the definition of theft of "" honest services "" - a technicality which , lawyers say , could damage many other prosecutions tied to Enron .
At the time of the three bankers ' extradition , the British government was pilloried over the inequality of a treaty weakening the criteria for evidence required to send British citizens to trial in the US .
Among those signing a letter of support for the bankers were British Airways ' chairman , Martin Broughton ; the retail tycoon Philip Green , GlaxoSmithKline 's chairman Sir Christopher Gent , and the London Stock Exchange 's chairman , Chris Gibson - Smith .
Critics of the treaty said yesterday that the NatWest Three 's innocence or guilt had little bearing on the underlying debate .
Catherine Wolthuizen , chief executive of the pressure group Fair Trials International , said : "" It 's important to bear in mind that views of the fairness and appropriateness of the extradition arrangements between the US and the UK are entirely separate from how individual cases may play out over time . ""
Just because the subjects of one case may decide , for whatever reason , to plead guilty does n't make the extradition arrangements any less one - sided or any more fair . ""
Case history : Extradition was bitterly contested Britain 's business elite cried foul when the Natwest Three were dispatched by the courts to face trial in the United States last year .
Among those protesting at Britain 's extradition treaty with America were the retail entrepreneur Philip Green , the CBI director general Richard Lambert , former Asda boss Archie Norman , venture capitalist Jon Moulton and Next chairman John Barton .
Backed by the shadow home secretary , David Davies , the "" fair trials for British business "" campaign argued that the treaty was one - sided because America had failed to ratify it for application to US citizens .
The government replied that the evidence against the Natwest Three would have been sufficient for extradition under a previous , more stringent treaty .
Gary Mulgrew declared that he had been "" royally shafted "" .
Top City figures were among those who helped raise $ 2 m surety to secure the three bankers ' bail .
Campaigners argued that the trio orchestrated their controversial financial transactions from London and therefore ought to be tried in Britain .
The bankers are well connected .
David Bermingham is a neighbour of the Conservative MP Boris Johnson , who has spoken up on his behalf , while Mulgrew 's mother is Trish Godman , deputy speaker of the Scottish parliament ."
2007-11-29,"The so - called NatWest Three may be pleading guilty to stealing $ 7.3 m through a fraudulent Enron - related deal , but relatives and friends are fighting a rearguard battle to rescue their tarnished image as judicial martyrs .
The trio — David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby — face 37 months each in prison and will have to repay the money they stole from their former employer through a complex deal involving the sale of an investment in an Enron - related venture at a knockdown price .
Mulgrew 's mother Trish Godman , who is deputy speaker of the Scottish parliament , suggested the men were pleading guilty "" with deep reluctance "" under extreme duress .
"" My son , Gary Mulgrew , and his two colleagues are the victims of an unjust extradition treaty which breaches human rights and a Texan judicial system which has bled them financially dry and coerced them into a plea bargain , "" she said in a statement .
In America , speaking on the steps of Houston 's federal court , defence lawyer Reid Figel couched his clients ' crime in modest language , describing it merely as a "" significant lapse in judgment "" .
Friends of the trio pointed to a passage in the bankers ' plea agreement which indicated that Enron 's disgraced chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , who is now serving a six - year prison sentence , was the mastermind behind the fraud .
When asked yesterday whether the British trio truly accepted that they had done something wrong , one London - based adviser to the bankers paused before saying : "" I do n't know how to answer that . ""
Bermingham , Mulgrew and Darby are treading a delicate path .
The trial judge , Ewing Werlein , can throw out their plea agreement if he feels that their admissions are insincere .
Houston - based legal expert Douglas McNabb says : "" The judge has got to be convinced in his own mind that the defendants did what they 're saying they did and the judge has got to be convinced the defendants believe they have committed a crime .
The extradition of the NatWest Three to America last year threw a spotlight on a controversial treaty struck in 2003 which made it easier for British citizens to be sent across the Atlantic for trial .
Critics say America has a tendency to push its jurisdiction too far , particularly in white - collar fraud cases which transcend national borders .
"" What they were an example of was the concept that US prosecutors have a very broad view of their jurisdiction , "" says Luke Tolaini , chairman of the CBI 's working group on extradition .
""
Ostensibly , what you have is three Britons who allegedly ripped off a British company . ""
Of the seven charges of fraud originally levelled against the trio , five involved faxes and emails sent from Britain to Houston , although , arguably , the most damning , a wire transfer of $ 7.3 m , was from Houston to the Cayman Islands and occurred entirely outside the UK .
Julian Knowles , an extradition expert at the Matrix Chambers in London , says prosecutors only need to show that a portion of the events in a crime happened in the US and that there was an economic impact on the country : "" They do n't need much to jump on the bandwagon and demand the right to haul people over . ""
Experts say that , in theory , America could claim that a fraudulent email sent between Japan and Paris amounted to a US crime if it happened to pass through a computer server in California .
Once in America , a large majority of defendants end up plea bargaining to avoid the time , risk and potential harsh punishment involved in a trial .
The NatWest Three are far from alone in facing the long arm of American law .
The former Wembley boss Nigel Potter spent 18 months in a Pennsylvania prison after being extradited for attempted bribery in America 's clampdown on white - collar crime .
A former Morgan Crucible chief executive , Ian Norris , is fighting extradition for price - rigging .
Ten past and present British Airways staff face possible US action over alleged competitive collusion with Virgin Atlantic , which happened in Britain but which , according to US prosecutors , affected customers including American travellers .
The Royal Bank of Scotland , which owns NatWest , yesterday welcomed the trio 's commitment to repay their ill - gotten gains as a "" full and final satisfaction of RBS 's claims against them "" .
Legal commentators remain divided on whether the trio are victims of America 's judicial aggression — or simply criminals with a flair for public relations . ""
The NatWest Three obviously fought a very slick PR campaign —
they had a lot of money and they did very well in raising this issue , "" says Knowles .
"" But their case probably was n't the best example of over - zealous prosecution .

2007-11-29,"Last night , a trio of British bankers who like to go by the name of "" the Natwest Three "" pleaded guilty in a Texas courtroom to a multimillion - dollar fraud conspiracy with two senior executives at collapsed US energy giant Enron .
The plea comes seven years after the fraud was committed and follows four years of protestations of innocence as they fought a high - profile battle against extradition through the British courts .
Their belated admissions of guilt must now leave some red faces in high places among their high - profile supporters back in Blighty .
The so - called Natwest Three burst into the public consciousness after extensive media coverage of their ultimately unsuccessful fight against extradition to the US on fraud charges .
Until the fight ended in failure last July , they were the cause celebre for an eclectic group of campaigners opposed to what remains the deeply unpopular Extradition Act 2003 .
Campaigners included usual suspects from the human rights lobby such as Liberty and Justice - groups which have consistently support to all defendants facing extradition under the controversial rules .
But the former Natwest bankers also enjoyed backing by some of Britain 's most senior business leaders in a campaign marshalled by the Daily Telegraph newspaper and some of the most influential figures in the world of financial PR .
Signatories to the Telegraph 's "" Fair Trials For Business "" campaign included British Airways chairman Martin Broughton , GlaxoSmithKline chairman Sir Chris Gent , ICAP chief executive Michael Spencer , retail tycoon Philip Green and London Stock Exchange chairman Chris Gibson - Smith .
Heavier hitters from British business you could not find .
Central to the bankers ' complaint against Britain 's revised extradition rules was that they offered no opportunity to test the evidence against them in a UK court .
With the prospect of evading US justice slipping from their grasp , an increasingly desperate Bermingham last February said : "" We have effectively been subjected to a two - year sentence of imprisonment and bankruptcy even before we have had the chance to challenged the evidence against us . ""
Last night , that chance came - and all three men chose not to take it .
All three admitted that they knowingly , and with intent , took part in a scheme to defraud .
They have agreed to serve sentences of three years and a month behind bars .
All very embarrassing for their supporters .
Coverage of the plea in the Daily Telegraph yesterday was confined to a report on page 15 - with no mention on the business pages , where the campaign against bankers ' extradition had featured so regularly .
Indeed , the paper omitted even a passing mention of the campaign , despite some 7,000 readers having signed its petition in support of the Natwest Three 's case .
It is interesting to note , last month , that Evening Standard columnist - and former Telegraph business editor - Neil Collins described the paper has having "" its neck currently stuck out an uncomfortably long way on their behalf "" .
He was not wrong .
Another figure who may me feeling a little uneasy is trade minister Lord Jones , previously the CBI 's director general .
Last year , he pleaded with Tony Blair to intervene .
In a personal letter , he wrote : "" You still have time to sort out this mess - I implore you not to walk by on the other side .
This is about three British subjects depending on this wonderful country - depending on you , its democratically elected leader - to ensure fairness , to ensure that people are treated as innocent until proven guilty , to ensure that freedom reigns . ""
He later remarked : "" It is going to take a long , long time for the business community to forgive the government for this . ""
Lord Jones , the Telegraph and the long list of signatories to the Natwest Three extradition campaign will all now mumble about the fact that they never actually said the bankers were innocent - their 's was a broader objection , in principle , to an unjust law .
But this is feeble .
Some 52 people have been extradited from the UK after requests from the US since 2003 , according to the Home Office .
A dozen or more are believed to have been shipped out - without a murmour of objection from most of the Natwest Three supporters - under the controversial new act long before the now famous bankers crossed the Atlantic to face the music .
With the benefit of hindsight , participants in last year 's campaign look , at best , like injudicious bandwagon - jumpers .
At worst , they could appear to be a coterie of British business leaders seeking only to look after their own ."

2007-12-02,"The case of the NatWest Three - a trio of bankers who pleaded guilty to a sophisticated financial fraud linked to the collapse of US energy giant Enron - is not going to provoke the same levels of sympathy and outrage as , say , that of a British woman teacher threatened with a vicious flogging over the naming of a teddy bear .
Many will conclude they have got their just deserts .
That , however , is beside the point .
The central issue is the lopsided nature of the extradition treaty under which the three were delivered to the Texan courts .
New arrangements were pushed through in the aftermath of 9/11 , ostensibly to fight the war on terror but in fact used mainly against businessmen , allowing British subjects to be shipped to the US on the say - so of prosecutors .
If we want to yank a Yank , though , our authorities must show ' probable cause ' .
The implication is that it would be harder for us to extradite a suspected Irish - American terrorist , for example , than it would be for them to get their hands on a Brit accused of fiddling the price of widgets .
No other European nation has agreed to deliver its citizens to the US courts on such a flimsy basis .
The issue will have its next high - profile airing in January , when the case of Ian Norris , the retired boss of Morgan Crucible , comes before the House of Lords .
Norris is perhaps a more persuasive example of the iniquity than the NatWest Three .
He faces extradition on charges of price fixing on hearsay evidence , over alleged incidents in the Eighties , before it became a criminal offence in the UK in 2002 .
Business lobby the CBI and civil rights mavens at Liberty are united in protesting against the extradition rules .
Like the Sarbanes - Oxley regulations brought in to clean up corporate America , the treaty is heavy - handed and damaging to British business .
A guilty plea by the NatWest Three does not change that ."
2007-12-22,"During his tenure as president of Nigeria , Sani Abacha had a standing order to pay $ 15 m a day of stolen government revenues into a Swiss bank account that he controlled .
In 1999 the Economist estimated that African dictators held $ 20bn of stolen wealth in Swiss accounts alone – twice the continent 's annual debt repayment bill .
Enron , that paragon of US turbo - corporatism , had more than 800 secret offshore subsidiaries , allowing it to create one of the biggest accounting and tax frauds in history .
Offshore financial centres – "" tax havens "" , to use a phrase they do n't like – have been on the defensive in recent years .
Small wonder .
So is the whole system corrupt and immoral to the core ?
Should expatriates hang their heads as they arrange for their salaries to be paid into a Jersey bank ?
Some people will find the idea of low- or no - tax regimes abhorrent .
To the Guardian columnist George Monbiot , the only answer is to close these places down and make everyone publish his or her tax records .
If future Sani Abachas were prevented from indulging their hobby of grand larceny , how many people would object ?
But the eradication of offshore financial centres will seem draconian to ordinary international workers who simply take advantage of concentrated expertise in places such as Jersey and the Isle of Man .
They also want to minimise their tax bills while working abroad .
Is that immoral too ?
Let 's hear from the early 20th - century American jurist Justice Learned Hand : "" Anyone may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible .
He is not bound to choose that pattern which will best pay the treasury .
There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one 's taxes . ""
Tax evasion is obviously crooked .
In so far as the offshore world allows it to happen , it is also immoral .
But tax minimisation is a difficult area .
As Mike Warburton , an offshore tax expert at the accountancy firm Grant Thornton , notes , even the Inland Revenue and professional tax advisers are not always sure where the line is to be drawn .
Last year a group of MEPs tabled a motion in the European parliament calling for the outlawing of all tax - reduction practices .
Can it be reasonable to make tax planning illegal ?
"" I always use the rule "" , says Warburton , "" that even if what I 'm doing is strictly legal , would I be comfortable standing up in front of a Chancery judge and explaining what I 'd arranged for a client ?
"" That seems a sensible compromise between the maximalist interpretation of taxation and borderline fraud .
More unsettling is the way multinationals use offshore structures to reduce their tax bills drastically , or eliminate them .
Companies such as News International pay , at the time of writing , what seem to be grossly unfair amounts of tax – roughly 5 % per year over the past few years in the case of Rupert Murdoch 's company .
Figures from the US General Accounting Office show that offshore centres , despite accounting for only 1.2 % of the world 's population and 3 % of its GDP , hold 26 % of US corporate assets and 31 % of their profits .
A system known as transfer pricing allows multinationals to "" sell "" goods from one branch of their business to another at vastly disparate prices , the resulting profits being salted away in an offshore centre .
John Christensen of the anti - offshore pressure group the Tax Justice Network ( TJN ) wrote recently of plastic buckets being imported from the Czech Republic to the US for $ 972.98 and rocket launchers being exported from the US to Israel for $ 52.03 .
Multinationals respond that money not going into national treasuries goes towards increasing economic activity , which benefits everyone .
There is some truth in this .
Offshore centres seriously stepped up their operations in the 1970s when British tax rates became punitive ( the top rate plus an investment income surcharge ended up at 98 % ) .
High corporation tax rates drive companies to set up elsewhere .
This should n't be seen as a war between public virtue and private greed .
Yet groups such as TJN want an end to different tax rates , full stop .
So - called tax competition is immoral as well , they say .
The offshore world is a link in the tax competition chain a fortiori .
However , to assert that all competition should be outlawed is to say that their vision of the state should prevail worldwide , with no argument .
Warburton argues that offshore centres fulfil an important function : keeping governments honest .
"" They are a warning that governments must not abuse the trust of the citizens .
The last time that happened , and income tax levels were punitively high , money simply flowed out of the economy . ""
This is another way of saying that tax competition can protect citizens from predation by the state .
Where , then , is the balance to be struck ?
There has been a concerted clean - up effort over the past 10 years or so .
Supranational organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the UN , the EU and the G8 's financial action task force have been bearing down on illicit tax and secrecy rules in offshore centres .
Clearly dodgy places have been shut down .
Centres such as Jersey and the Caymans have been forced to disclose more information to onshore tax authorities .
The OECD approach may be the best one .
It distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate offshore .
Unacceptable offshore centres are defined as countries that levy little or no income tax , refuse to exchange information with tax authorities in other countries and lack transparency and lack "" substantial activities "" – meaning a real business purpose aside from avoiding taxes .
Offshore centres that offer expertise to international workers are protected .
After all , an expatriate will be liable for tax somewhere .
Using the offshore world to minimise the bill will still be allowed .
Tax competition will stay .
If this approach works , it will lessen the secrecy that facilitates obscene corporate tax evasion and institutional kleptocracy , but will keep the benefits available offshore .
It might be working already , albeit slowly .
Just before Christmas 2005 the Monaco authorities announced that Sir Mark Thatcher – house - hunting on the Riviera – will not be welcome back , even though he has had a temporary residence permit for a couple of years . '
I want morality , honesty and ethics to be at the centre of government , ' said Prince Albert , head of the principality ."
2008-02-10,"If responses to the SocGen scandal sound familiar , it 's because they are .
The usual remedies - new guidelines for derivatives trading , tighter trading controls and higher fines - have been trotted out after every debacle since Enron .
Unfortunately , they will be no more successful this time than last , because they all mistake a managerial failure for a systemic one .
The truth is that current regulatory and risk management systems are designed to retrospectively identify at what point a thief stole your money , not to alert you when he is actually stealing it .
Asking a group of investment bankers to investigate a fraud perpetrated against systems designed by investment bankers is unlikely to generate a new approach .
Rather than saying ' it wo n't happen here ' ( as the French did after Parmalat ) , or ' it wo n't happen again ' ( after Enron , WorldCom et al ) , we should be asking : are there lessons to be learnt from other industries ? '
The gambling known as business looks with austere disfavour upon the business known as gambling , ' wrote Ambrose Bierce in The Devil 's Dictionary .
Gambling is highly regulated , but does not rely on regulation to manage its internal risk ; it takes that on itself .
With risk as its primary product , gambling works on the assumption that , given the chance , everyone wants to take money out of it - customers and staff .
It also assumes most robberies are inside jobs .
Consequently , it concludes , the organisation should be watching the people with working knowledge of the systems - such as Jérôme Kerviel and Nick Leeson , who were familiar with their back - office set - ups - and not the systems themselves .
Casino surveillance cameras are trained on croupiers as well as punters .
Watching the croupiers are the ' pit bosses ' , who are also being watched .
All are monitored for behavioural changes and unusual patterns , whether winning or losing .
When a change is seen , managers investigate until they are satisfied with the explanation .
Some large insurance companies are doing something similar , using ' stress - detector ' technology to screen claims .
Only claimants whose voice patterns exhibit anomalies are investigated .
When Kerviel 's behavioural anomalies were reported , he was apparently able to shrug them off with minimal explanation , as Leeson had at Barings .
Management was n't managing : those in charge were either ' player - managers ' more concerned with their own performance , or so far up the chain as to be disconnected from the game .
Perhaps the most damning comment in the Barings affair was that of a very senior official who saw no reason for concern because Leeson 's trading showed ' nothing extraordinary ' .
Actually , his results were so contrary to both his own previous results and that of his peers that he warranted immediate investigation .
The senior manager had no idea his results were unusual - he just saw them as good .
The same was true of John Rusnak , the currency trader who lost £ 354 m at Allied Irish , of Kerviel , and no doubt many others .
According to the investigation by the governor of France 's central bank , Christian Noyer , SocGen 's controls were ' not followed up appropriately ' .
In other words , there were no ' floor walkers ' or ' pit bosses ' .
Even if the surveillance systems were effective , management 's actions were not .
This is a direct consequence of the flattening of organisational structures .
What has been flattened , by and large , is the ' monitoring ' function traditionally carried out by long - serving middle - managers with elephant - like corporate memories who could intuitively spot behavioural inconsistencies .
Psychologist Gary Klein calls this ' recognition primed decisions ' : you might know it as ' experience ' .
The gambling industry relies on this monitoring function to bolster its technical systems and guarantee its internal risk management .
It is the manager who activates the deep investigation , not the system .
Gambling has another invaluable lesson for the financial markets : the simplicity of its terminology .
For example , it has only one term for all the activities it covers - betting .
A government supposedly dedicated to educating the public in the intricacies of financial services would do well to copy this appproach .
Whether you ' invest ' in a building society , derivatives , credit derivatives , options or futures , you are betting that the return will outweigh the risk .
In casinos , everyone understands that there is no such thing as zero risk and no such thing as guaranteed returns .
Perhaps the sharpest lesson from gambling is that if someone is playing with my money , I watch them especially carefully .
I was once asked to follow a colleague at a small bookmakers where I worked and report on his movements .
It turned out that he was the ' runner ' who ' laid off ' big bets .
When the shop took a bet it could n't cover if the horse won , it off - loaded the risk to other bookies by betting a proportion of the punter 's money on the same horse with them .
If the horse lost , all the bookies made money ; if it won , the losses were ' spread ' and thus manageable .
Call it ' hedging ' .
My boss suspected that the runner was n't laying off the money with other bookies - he was gambling that the horse would lose and he could pocket the money .
If it won , of course , my boss would be exposed and probably out of business .
Such a business - critical activity was , therefore , carefully monitored .
Kerviel decided not to hedge his bets .
The markets turned , and his actions might eventually mean the sale of SocGen .
Some years ago I wrote that the financial market was the biggest casino in the world .
It seems that I was traducing casinos ; they appear to be better regulated and better managed . ·

2008-02-22,"A trio of disgraced British bankers known as the NatWest Three will be sentenced to lengthy jail stretches by a US judge today for stealing $ 7.3 m in a complex Enron - related fraud that sparked a row over Britain 's extradition policy .
The NatWest Three 's dealings with Enron went far deeper than a single transaction - and the men have used their wealth to invest in ventures ranging from engineering to movie production , pubs and Scottish property .
At a hearing in Houston 's federal courthouse , David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby are each expected to be sent to prison for 37 months , in line with the terms of a plea agreement .
Their sentencing will close the book on a prosecution that sparked cries of injustice and complaints of judicial overreach by the US .
The Texan court 's no - nonsense judge , Ewing Werlein , will offer them the opportunity to speak - and experts say they would be wise to eat humble pie . ""
I think it 's important for each of the three to express remorse for what they 've done , "" says Douglas McNabb , a US lawyer specialising in white - collar federal crime .
"" They 've got to be particularly careful they do n't start backtracking . ""
The trio became something of a cause célèbre when they were extradited to the US two years ago .
Their crime was to recommend that their employer , NatWest , sold a stake in an Enron venture , LJM Cayman , for $ 1 m - far less than its true value .
Unbeknown to NatWest , they had a personal interest in the buyer of the stake , which sold it on at a huge profit .
Since the Enron deal , Darby , 45 , the senior banker of the three , has exhibited the most modest business ambition .
A father of five girls , he left the financial world to become managing director of a small Wiltshire business , Bohan Engineering , which makes bespoke industrial machines for drilling , pinning and assembling manufactured products .
His colleagues have branched out into colourful fields .
Bermingham , 45 , became immersed in film finance , at one stage through a company called Grosvenor Park Productions .
He won credits as executive producer on movies including Things
To Do Before You 're 30 , Trauma and The Libertine - a 17th - century romp .
Mulgrew , a Glaswegian former bouncer , also dabbled in the movie world by investing in Trieste Film Partners - a film - leasing entity set up by the entrepreneur Patrick McKenna 's Ingenious Media group .
But the world of property proved more of a draw for the Scot , according to documents obtained by the Guardian .
In the years after his controversial dealings with Enron , he entered correspondence about a number of deals , including purchasing an Islington gastropub , a Highlands hotel , and Hewan Wood , a beauty spot on the outskirts of Edinburgh .
Mulgrew , 46 , snapped up a flat in Glasgow 's affluent Hyndland suburb for £ 120,000 in April 2001 - eight months after receiving the proceeds of the Cayman deal .
A month earlier , in March 2001 , Mulgrew paid £ 245,000 for a new apartment on Edinburgh 's Holyrood Road , beside the newly built Scottish Parliament .
He signed agreements to rent this property out to his mother , Trish Godman , who is a Labour MSP and the parliament 's deputy presiding officer , for £ 1,000 a month .
She appears not to have used the flat , however , as over this period she was claiming hotel expenses in Edinburgh .
She declined to discuss this with the Guardian .
This flat , which is beside Holyrood House , does not appear to have appreciated much in value .
Trish Godman and her husband , Norman Godman , a former Labour MP for Greenock , bought it from Mulgrew for £ 250,000 in November 2006 .
She has not had to record it in the parliament 's register of members ' interests because it is a personal residence .
She has not claimed hotel expenses since buying the flat .
Shareholders who lost millions in the collapse of Enron have suggested that the NatWest Three 's gains from the corrupt energy trading company went well beyond the $ 7.3 m deal to which they have admitted guilt .
After leaving NatWest in 2000 , the trio were hired by the Royal Bank of Canada to set up a London - based trading team .
Running this desk , they worked at the Canadian bank for just over a year - and over this period 30 % of their dealings were with Enron .
Their role was to help Enron create complex offshore entities with names such as Bob West Treasure , Jedi and Hawaii that kept losses off the energy firm 's balance sheet .
An internal email seen by the Guardian reveals just how lucrative this was .
In a message dated November 15 2001 , Mulgrew said that his team had generated C$ 64.9 m ( £ 33 m ) of revenue in 12 months , of which C$ 48.3 m was taken "" straight to the P&amp;L [ profit and loss account ] "" .
"" With a headcount totalling 47 , we are naturally delighted that we were able to contribute new business revenue in excess of C$ 1 m per head , "" wrote Mulgrew .
Presciently , he added : "" Obviously the year has n't been without its trials and tribulations , most recently the Enron situation which has been trying for a number of us . ""
When Enron went bust , the US bankruptcy courts appointed an "" examiner "" , Harrison Goldin .
He concluded that the RBC team used improper techniques to help the energy trading firm conceal its financial problems . ""
The ENA [ Enron North America ]
examiner has determined that the evidence is sufficient for a fact finder to conclude that RBC aided and abetted certain Enron officers in breaching their fiduciary duty , "" says Goldin 's report .
Goldin reveals that the trio were fired by RBC in 2001 amid suspicions that , once again , they had "" secretly invested "" in an Enron offshore partnership behind their employer 's back .
Even after their sentencing , the NatWest Three 's legal difficulties will not end .
A group of Enron shareholders led by the University of California , which lost $ 144 m in Enron 's collapse , has sued RBC and has subpoeaned the trio to give depositions . ""
After [ the ] arrival of the bankers from NatWest , RBC structured , financed and executed several deceptive transactions with Enron , "" says the university 's writ .
At the height of their success , Bermingham , Darby and Mulgrew wooed Enron 's top brass .
They forged close relationships with Enron 's chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow , and his second - in - command , Michael Kopper , both of whom are now in prison .
The British trio hosted a weekend for the energy company 's executives at Scotland 's Skibo Castle .
They went on an Enron skiing trip to Chamonix and cavorted with influential Enron staff at a Houston lapdancing club , Treasures .
The walls of an American prison cell will give them plenty of time for reflection .

2008-02-22,"An American judge has sentenced the so - called "" NatWest Three "" to 37 months in jail after expressing admiration for the support commanded by the disgraced British bankers who stole $ 7.3 m ( £ 3.65 ) in an Enron - related fraud .
David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby , whose treatment sparked a political row over Britain 's extradition policy , asked to serve their time at Allenwood prison in Pennsylvania – a complex some 200 miles north of Washington .
Rather than remanding them directly into custody , Judge Ewing Werlein gave them permission to surrender voluntarily to prison .
At Houston 's federal courthouse , judge Werlein said he was "" impressed by the large amount of support each of you have been given by people who see your favourable qualities "" .
But he told the trio that they must pay back "" every dollar or , over there , every pound "" they had stolen from their former employer NatWest , which is now part of Royal Bank of Scotland .
"" I wish you well in your future endeavours
and I 'm confident we will never see you before a court again , "" said judge Werlein .
Under a plea agreement , Bermingham , Mulgrew and Darby admitted one count of fraud related to a transaction concocted in 2000 with top Enron executives who have since been jailed for corruption .
In the fraudulent deal , the trio recommended that NatWest offload a stake in an Enron - related venture in the Cayman Islands for a knockdown price of $ 1 m .
Unbeknown to NatWest , they had a personal interest in the buyer of the investment which sold it on for $ 20 m , with the profits shared between the conspirators .
Each of the three men apologised to the court .
Bermingham , 45 , expressed regret for the pain he had caused his wife and family : "" My conduct in this matter fell well below the standards expected .
"" Darby , 45 , said the affair had "" far - reaching "" implications on the trio 's career and reputations : "" At the time , I did n't realise the implications of what was happening .
I failed to take the right course of action and I deeply regret that . ""
Glasgow - born Mulgrew , 46 , accepted that his actions "" lacked integrity "" and expressed regret to all those who had been affected : "" I would like to apologise unreservedly for my actions . ""
For the US Department of Justice , the conviction ties up a loose end from a string of prosecutions arising from Enron 's collapse in late 2001 which left 21,000 people jobless .
More than 20 people have been found guilty of fraud related to the bankruptcy of the energy trading behemoth .
One of the trio 's defence lawyers , Dick DeGuerin , suggested the British bankers were victims of a culture of unethical activity at Enron led by the energy firm 's jailed chief financial officer , Andrew Fastow . ""
Andy Fastow and the culture of greed at Enron corrupted everyone and everything it came in contact with , "" said DeGuerin outside court today .
He said the trio were "" as much victims as anybody "" .
The trio are likely to apply for a transfer to a British prison .
Until then , they will be expected to work for seven and a half hours a day in the American prison system , carrying out tasks such as cooking , cleaning and groundkeeping for about 40 cents an hour .
At the time of their extradition to face trial , the Natwest Three were portrayed by a well - orchestrated publicity campaign as victims of judicial over - reach by the US .
A new treaty lowering the hurdles for extradition to the US caused unrest among British business and political leaders .
Critics of their treatment included the CBI 's then director - general Sir Digby Jones , who said the trio posed "" no threat to society "" yet faced being "" banged up in a US prison with rapists and drug addicts "" .
When they were flown to the US two years ago , Liberty 's Shami Chakrabarti described it as a case of "" first they came for the white - collar worker , then they came for me "" .
But some legal experts now argue that the three bankers were poor examples of this extradition controversy .
Luke Tolaini of Clifford Chance , who chairs the CBI 's working group on extradition , said : "" In the UK , we have relatively low barriers to extradition to the US and a relatively unequal relationship with the US .
That remains a concern . ""
But that was not an issue that really applied in this case because it seems that the evidence provided in the Natwest Three 's case was significant and would have complied with the old extradition regime . """
2008-02-22,"The disgraced British bankers known as the Natwest Three were today each sentenced to 37 months in jail by a court in Houston , Texas , for their part in an Enron - related fraud that netted them $ 7.3 m ( £ 3.7 m ) .
David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and were sentenced today by judge Ewing Werlein at the southern district of Texas court .
He also ordered them to pay back the $ 7.3 million in order to "" regain their respect "" .
The judge said that the Royal Bank of Scotland , NatWest 's owner , should receive "" every dollar or , over there , every pound "" .
But Judge Werlein said he was "" impressed by the large amount of support each of you have been given by people who have seen your favourable qualities "" .
The judge said : "" I wish you well in your future endeavours
and I 'm confident we will never see you before a court again .
"" The trio were all working for a subsidiary of NatWest in 2000 when they convinced the bank to sell a stake in an Enron venture , LJM Cayman , for a fraction of its value .
However , they did not reveal that they had a personal interest in the buyer of the stake , which then sold it for a huge profit .
Each defendant was invited to address the court and Bermingham said : "" My conduct in this matter fell well below the standards expected . ""
He said he wanted to apologise to his wife and children , and to the people who suffered from the consequences of his actions .
For his part , Darby said : "" At the time I did n't realise the implications of what was happening .
"" I failed to take the right course of action and I deeply regret that . ""
Mulgrew apologised "" unreservedly "" for his actions and said they "" lacked integrity "" .
All three men also thanked their supporters both in Houston and in the UK for their support during the last few years .
The judge accepted a motion which will allow each of the three to surrender to prison voluntarily and no date for their reporting to jail was set .
The men told the court they wanted to report to Allenwood Prison in Pennsylvania .
They had originally faced seven charges of wire fraud and had faced spending 35 years behind bars if found guilty .
But a plea bargain in November saw the number of charges reduced and included an agreement that they would be able to serve some of their sentence in the UK .
The judge today indicated that would be possible .
The case sparked a row over Britain 's extradition treaty with the US after the men were forced to leave Britain and stand trial in the US .
They were eventually extradited in July 2006 after a lengthy legal dispute backed by a vocal media campaign to block the US move ."
2008-02-22,"At first they were portrayed in the press as high - rolling investment bankers accused of a multimillion - pound fraud connected to the Enron scandal .
A few years later David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby were seen as the victims of the deeply unpopular Extradition Act 2003 .
Indeed , in the months before they were sent out to face charges in Texas in July 2006 , the NatWest Three became synonymous with a high - profile campaign against extradition agreements with the US .
Business leaders lambasted the law for favouring the US justice system .
Their campaign was backed by public relations advisers who lobbied politicians and the media .
Now , as the NatWest Three face jail , those behind the campaign against their extradition insist it was a just one .
The loudest voice in the summer of 2006 was the Daily Telegraph .
Under the heading "" Fair Trials for British Business "" , the newspaper published a letter in July 2006 signed by scores of business executives and politicians calling on the government to suspend Britain 's "" manifestly unfair "" extradition treaty with the US and stop the removal of the NatWest Three .
The paper was careful not to take a view on the guilt or otherwise of the men , but instead founded its campaign on opposing the fast - track extradition procedure introduced in 2003 .
Its letter to the then home secretary , John Reid , asked him to intervene , "" not to save the NatWest Three , but to correct the mistake of a previous home secretary and preserve Britain 's ancient tradition of transparent justice "" .
The paper 's head of business , Damian Reece , stressed yesterday that the Telegraph 's letters , articles and online signature collection formed "" a campaign about the extradition , not the NatWest Three "" . ""
The UK had allowed a very unsatisfactory extradition arrangement to develop which put the UK citizen at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to dealing with the US authorities , "" he said .
With hindsight , was it ill conceived given the three bankers ' guilty plea ?
"" I would do it again at a drop of a hat , "" said Reece .
Similarly , the PR advisers to the three defendants remain convinced .
Melanie Riley , of Bell Yard Communications , worked with them from the summer of 2004 , mostly pro bono .
She says one of the advantages of the campaign was its broad appeal .
It united an unlikely coalition of business representatives such as the CBI and civil rights groups such as Liberty .
"" That made it quirky ; it made it interesting .
How often do you get the CBI and Liberty on the same page ?
It had cross - market appeal , "" says Riley .
She adds that anyone who now looks at the NatWest Three 's plea bargain and thinks the media ran an ill - conceived campaign over the Extradition Act "" has missed the point "" .
"" The fundamental principle was always the same , "" she says .
"" It was never about whether they are guilty or innocent .
It was about the fact this law needed changing . ""
PR adviser Adrian Flook , of M
: Communications , a former MP who worked pro bono for the Three in 2006 , said the campaign did change the fate of the men by reaching the prime minister who was "" very thin - skinned when it came to media attention "" .
"" The publicity forced Tony Blair into discussing the issue with the American authorities so that the case was looked at more compassionately , so they did at least make bail . """

One of America 's most notorious cases of corporate corruption sparked back to life at a packed courthouse in New Orleans as Skilling 's lawyer , Dan Petrocelli , pleaded for an immediate release of his client , who has been in a Minnesota prison since December 2006 .
Legal analysts say the appeal has a chance , albeit it a slim one , of persuading a panel of three judges that either a key prosecution theory was flawed or that his case ought to have been moved from Enron 's home city of Houston .
Skilling , 54 , has never swayed from his protestations of innocence - his appeal brief says he is in prison "" not only for crimes that he did not commit , but for acts of business judgement that are not crimes at all "" .
The defence argues that the jury selection process in his original trial was inadequate to root out prejudiced panellists in Houston , which suffered thousands of job losses when Enron collapsed in 2001 . ""
Long before any trial was convened , newspapers around the country , politicians in Washington and an inflamed public were all demanding prison sentences for Enron 's managers , "" says the appeal brief .
"" In Houston , such calls rung out daily with venomous emotion . ""
Among penalties for US white - collar crimes , Skilling 's sentence is second only to a 25-year stretch handed to the one - time Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers in 2005 .
Experts believe Skilling 's best chance lies in citing a parallel appeals court decision two years ago that threw out guilty verdicts on three Merrill Lynch bankers accused of helping Enron to inflate profits .
In that ruling , judges said a key government theory was flawed .
Prosecutors had argued that the bankers robbed Enron shareholders of "" honest services "" .
But the appeals court rejected this because the defendants did not personally gain and were instead purportedly acting to support the struggling company - even if it was in a corrupt manner .
But even if this argument is successful , it will only overturn Skilling 's two 10-year fraud convictions .
He will still have to serve a 52-month sentence for insider trading and lying to the company 's auditors .
Jamie Wareham , head of litigation at the international law firm Paul Hastings , said that although the appeal had certain strengths , it remains a long shot : "" Appeals have low success chances generally speaking .
While these arguments pass what I 'd call the red - face test , there 's a way , way lower than 50 % chance of Skilling getting any relief here .
"" In a 238-page rebuttal of Skilling 's claims of injustice , government prosecutors describe his arguments as "" hyperbolic rhetoric "" .
The appeal will be watched closely by the US department of justice as its outcome could have repercussions for nearly 20 other criminal convictions arising from Enron 's collapse ."

The most recent Enron - related convictions were of three British bankers dubbed the "" Natwest three "" who were jailed for 37 months for embezzling $ 7.3 m through in a fraudulent deal struck in the Cayman Islands with the energy trading firm ."
2008-05-07,"The American authorities have split up the so - called NatWest Three by ordering the British bankers to begin their prison sentences at separate jails in California , Texas and Pennsylvania .
Two months after they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison for embezzling $ 7.3 m ( £ 3.7 m ) in a fraud related to the collapse of Enron , the trio - David Bermingham , Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - have been ordered to report to different far - flung prisons .
Their lawyer , Mark Spragg , said they were disappointed : "" They would have all preferred to be together . ""
The US bureau of prisons has confirmed that Mulgrew , 46 , is already behind bars , having entered Big Spring prison in the Texas desert a week ago .
The isolated low - security camp is 290 miles west of Dallas and fellow inmates include Enron 's former global finance manager , Michael Kopper .
Darby , 45 , was due to enter Pennsylvania 's Allenwood prison yesterday .
The last of the three to go behind bars will be Bermingham , who has been given a deadline of tomorrow to surrender to Lompoc prison , which is next to an air force base some 175 miles north of Los Angeles .
The men became something of a cause célèbre when they were extradited to face trial in the US two years ago under a treaty that was branded unfair by human rights lawyers .
But once in court , they pleaded guilty to concocting a fraudulent deal routed through the Cayman Islands , which allowed them to skim money off NatWest 's sale of a stake in an offshore entity created by Enron ."
2008-07-10,"Taxi From the Darkside tells the story of an Afghan detained at Bagram air base .
Photograph : ICA
I was participating in a discussion panel for my film Enron :
The Smartest Guys in the Room , when a well - heeled attorney started talking to me about torture .
He said , "" I 'm very exercised about this subject and about the way the US government made me take this on and justify it "" .
I decided there and then that I wanted to make this the subject of my next project , but it is such a vast area .
You look at those pictures from Abu Ghraib and it is as if the people in them are not real .
They are like meat .
On top of that , most Americans do n't want to tackle the issue of torture .
They feel such rage about it , but they also feel complicit because they did n't raise their voices .
It 's hard to get people to watch this stuff ; they want to hide their eyes .
The challenge is to put a face to the story and find a narrative that connects all the different parts of the system .
Taxi to the Dark Side is the story of Dilawar , an Afghan taxi driver who was detained at Bagram air base in December 2002 .
He was innocent .
He was subjected to a five - day interrogation , and his interrogators knew that he was innocent but they tortured him just the same .
They tortured him to death .
The soldiers responsible were later transferred to Abu Ghraib .
The passengers in his taxi were sent to Guantanamo .
Through Dilawar , all the pieces of the jigsaw start to fit together .
So Dilawar gave a human face to a wider tragedy .
It was important for me to visit his village and to talk with his family , just as it was crucial that I spoke to his interrogators .
( I was actually surprised by how sympathetic some of the soldiers were - these so - called "" few bad apples "" . )
Inevitably there were other people - further up the food chain - who I was not able to interview .
Most of all , I wanted to speak with their commanding officer , Captain Carolyn Wood , who was honoured for her work at Bagram before being moved to Abu Ghraib .
I would have asked her how the policies she employed came to be in place .
What was behind her actions ?
Was she just trying to be a good soldier ?
And if so , who was giving her those orders ?
Making Taxi to the Dark Side changed the way I think .
I 'm not a conspiracy theorist , and I have no patience with that stuff at all .
But now I worry that my point of view is getting darker .
I was always haunted by the question of "" why "" ?
If coercive techniques are unreliable , and if cooperation is the better way to go , then why would our leaders do what they do - why would we have this policy of torture ?
And the answer is so obvious .
It 's political .
If you torture people they will tell you anything , and that way you get what you want to know , regardless of whether it 's true or not .
At first I rejected that idea .
Now I believe it .
We 've entered Orwellian territory .
Towards the end of making Taxi to the Dark Side , I started work on a documentary about Hunter S. Thompson , and I was running back and forth from one editing suite to the other .
I came to see the Thompson film as my light romantic comedy , an antidote to the torture .
Hunter had his dark side but at least he could make you laugh .
After Taxi , I needed some laughs ."
2008-09-26,"As the all - too - often selectively quoted Adam Smith actually said : "" All for ourselves , and nothing for other people , seems , in every age of the world , to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind . ""
No one can say that current events are a one - off .
The get - government - out - of - business brigade , the masters of the universe , have in their three decades of unbridled power produced the savings and loan bail - out , the Mexican bond bail - out , the Asian currency crisis , the Enron and other related scandals , the tech bubble , the Long - Term Capital Management collapse and rescue , a wage freeze for working Americans and now this .
And the irony is that these vile people who are now graciously agreeing to pocket a trillion dollars of taxpayers ' cash have been arguing for three decades that government has no business in business , least of all in pension provision .
In their famous phrase , it would pose a "" moral hazard "" for ordinary Americans to think that their government would look after them if in old age their income or their health failed them .
Those who have engineered these serial disasters , which have inflicted more damage on the US and world economy than Osama bin Laden and al - Qaida , have not been pursued into the hills of Bora Bora .
Governments have reduced their taxes as they reward themselves with more and more salary , bonuses and stock options .
If the shares of the company they manage take a dive , they backdate their options .
If the company fails , they take a golden parachute .
And when all else fails , they come to the taxpayers , top hat in hand .
There is one small consolation .
What if these guys had achieved their desire , shared with John McCain and George Bush , to privatise the social security system ?
Just think of the social and economic disaster they could have wrought given all those trillions of dollars to play with .
With the sudden affection for government ownership and assistance now globalising its way consensually from Washington , will we see a new , social - democratic age of government involvement in industry ?
Probably not soon .
But as Churchill said , this surely deserves to be beginning of the end of the Washington neoliberal consensus that George Bush 's father called voodoo economics .
Bill Clinton , Tony Blair and even Gordon Brown all succumbed to that old black magic – and looking at Barack Obama 's economic advisers , there is a more than even chance that he , too , is under its spell .
Clinton introduced tough love for working people , with welfare reform and lifetime caps , since it was clear that if you had no job it was your fault , not that of the titans of industry who had offshored your job or preferred to play the tables with sliced - and - diced derivatives of derivatives rather than use the capital for industrial and infrastructural investment .
Clinton famously quibbled about what "" is "" meant .
It is much more productive to consider what the "" market "" is , not least when it falls from McCain 's lips .
As the negative example of Soviet - style economy suggests , it is difficult to beat the market when you are talking about the free exercise of consumer choices for goods and services and the consequent allocation of capital for providing them .
But in the US , no one blinks when governments ban or regulate sales of tobacco , alcohol or drugs , let alone gambling or sexual services .
The financial markets , with increasing deregulation , have become a heady combination of sex and gambling .
The Wall Street ideologues have been gambling our money and screwing us all , as investors , pensioners , workers and taxpayers .
There has been some understandable chortling as the British and American governments override their free - trade platitudes to nationalise companies , whether Northern Rock or AIG , Fannie Mae or Freddy Mac .
But the plan Goldman Sach 's alumnus Hank Paulson is proposing now is not nationalisation .
It is a strings - free handout to his former colleagues on Wall Street .
However , there are opportunities in this crisis .
Do n't just take over the lemons left squeezed to the pips .
Take equity shares in the whole companies .
Maybe the proceeds could go to a sovereign wealth fund , to invest in manufacturing and infrastructure .
Above all , if the high priests of finance invoke government assistance , then now is the time to finish the job that Roosevelt started , Truman propounded and even Nixon considered : a universal single - payer healthcare system in the US .
If AIG , one of the world 's biggest insurers , is effectively now nationalised by the US government without debate , then who can argue ?
Nationalise the health insurance companies .
At the very least , now is the time to set up a comprehensive and effective regulatory system , and to ensure that if the taxpayers pick up the tab for executive excesses , the executives pick up more of the tab for taxes .
Over to you Obama – and for that matter , Gordon Brown .
Are you with the vile or the victims ?"
2008-10-03,"Bad experiences are supposed to be good , in a twisted sort of way .
That 's because we 're supposed to learn things that help us avoid the same mistakes the next time around .
But it 's hard to argue now that anything good came out of the bad experience called Enron .
In fact , one thing that is crystal clear amid all the chaos of these days is that the lessons from Enron went unlearned - or were just forgotten .
Start with the Houston - based energy trader 's notorious lack of transparency .
After Enron 's implosion , everyone talked about how important it was to be able to understand how a company makes money .
Now raise your hand if you understand how a modern financial services firm makes money .
No hands ?
The truth is , there is no way to understand .
These companies are as opaque as Enron .
Just as Enron had off balance - sheet vehicles - SIVs - that allowed it to book earnings and hide debt , Citigroup and other financial institutions had structured investment vehicles that did the same .
Indeed , Citigroup had to take almost $ 50bn of SIVs back on to its balance sheet after they ran into trouble .
It would be nice if the accounting rule - makers would grasp this basic tenet : if they want to hide it , we want to know about it .
Of course , SIVs are only a small manifestation of the deeper problem , which is the evolution of financial engineering into a dark art .
Enron now seems like the canary in the coal mine .
After its bankruptcy , Steve Cooper , who was in charge of restructuring it , told the Wall Street Journal his task might leave him "" in a wheelchair and drooling "" due to the complexity of its financial structures and the "" unbelievable amount of debt accumulated around the company "" .
Does n't that sound like our entire financial system ?
Just as Enron packaged bad investments into a private equity fund run by its chief financial officer , Wall Street packaged mortgages given to people who could n't afford the payments into sleek new instruments called RMBS and CDOs .
But Enron 's machinations could n't make the losses go away , and Wall Street 's shiny acronyms ca n't turn a defaulted mortgage into good money .
As for the lessons we 've forgotten , how about this one : financial statements are n't supposed to be fairytales .
Enron was castigated for its abuse of mark - to - market , or fair value , accounting .
This is supposed to allow investors to see what the market says a security is worth , instead of just what the company paid for it .
Employed correctly , it makes a company 's finances more transparent .
But we all joked that Enron did n't mark to market - it marked to myth , to whatever it wanted them to be .
In this , the US regulatory agency , the SEC , was complicit , because it signed off on Enron 's use of this accounting and never ensured it was n't abusing the rules .
Today 's mark - to - market saga has a new twist .
The SEC is facing political pressure to abolish mark - to - market accounting requirements for financial institutions , and some in Congress would like to dig mark - to - market 's grave .
Said in another way , now financial services firms may be allowed to deceive investors about their status , with the regulators blessing that deceit .
( An aside here .
Those who say mark - to - market should be abolished argue that because there is no market , firms are being forced to value these securities at artificially low levels .
But there is no market precisely because firms are n't willing to sell at a price at which a reasonable investor would buy . )
While for a short period in the aftermath of Enron , we did understand that short - sellers serve a good purpose , we have also forgotten that .
Short - sellers were the first to warn there were problems at Enron .
But today , nobody is thanking short - sellers like David Einhorn , a hedge fund manager who began to warn investors about Lehman 's problems in March , when the stock was worth about $ 50 .
Instead , companies say the short - sellers are to blame for their problems .
And the SEC has gone along with this and banned short - selling in a number of stocks .
Poor Washington Mutual and Wachovia , which plummeted after the ban on short - selling .
How will they explain what happened to them now they ca n't blame short - sellers ?
Which leads to the most sobering repeat lesson of all .
Most of the believers in the free market only believe in it when it is going their way .
When it does n't , it 's someone else 's fault .
Enron 's former leaders often cited their free - market beliefs .
Its demise , they said , was due to a short - sellers ' conspiracy .
Indeed , when all was booming , Wall Streeters said they deserved their pay because the market said they were worth it .
But now things are falling apart , they say the market does n't work , and we need to stop short - selling , and taxpayers need to pony up .
If there is a tiny bit of good in all this , it 's that Wall Street , although it was complicit in the Enron mess , managed to walk away relatively unscathed .
This time , Wall Street has brought itself down .
Then again , maybe it really is n't a good sign for the future that there do n't seem to be any smart guys anywhere in the room .

2008-10-10,"The management gurus have been strangely reluctant to come forward with their views about the credit crunch .
What could explain their unaccustomed shyness ?
Back in 2005 , London Business School 's late Sumantra Ghoshal caused a furore in the groves of academe with a paper called Bad Management Theories
Are Destroying Good Management Practices , which excoriated the business schools for their role in helping to create the Enron and WorldCom scandals .
Business schools , Ghoshal said , "" do not need to do a great deal more to help prevent future Enrons ; they need only to stop doing a lot [ that ] they currently do .
They do not need to create new courses ; they need to simply stop teaching some old ones …
It is our theories and ideas that have done much to strengthen the management practices that we are all now so loudly condemning "" .
In particular , obligingly backed the cult of shareholder value and macho management with ideas that were both self - serving and pseudo - science .
Ghoshal should be living at this hour .
Managers from Bear Sterns , AIG , Merrill Lynch and others may not have done anything strictly illegal , but they are nonetheless in a direct line of descent from Enron in their devotion to their own cause .
In the FT last week , US economist William Lazonick reported that from 2003 to 2007 , the top 500 American companies , including all those now in trouble , spent a stunning $ 1,700bn on buying back their own shares .
Major beneficiaries , of course , were senior managers loaded to the gills with stock options .
Lehman Brothers bought back $ 5bn of shares in the three years before it went bankrupt , money that could have come in handy these last few weeks .
On his own admission CEO Dick Fuld took home "" between $ 250 m and $ 350 m "" since 2000 – and , as late as September , the company was seeking authorisation to pay out more than $ 22 m in bonuses to departing executives .
Consultants and accountants , likewise deafening in their silence , will also be in the firing line for having lucratively devised and legitimised such schemes .
The secret that , understandably , none of the experts wants to admit to is that the heart of today 's problems is human behaviour , not impersonal flows of money .
Since it 's people wot done it , it 's there that the remedy has to be applied .
What kind of remedy ?
Step forward two Harvard professors who in this month 's Harvard Business Review , the US business bible , propose a radical solution : making management a profession , like medicine or the law , complete with its own Hippocratic oath , covering both personal ethics and wider responsibilities to society as a whole .
Ironically , given HBR 's leisurely publication lead times , the piece does n't even mention the financial crisis .
But that does nothing to alter its accidental timeliness .
The profs have given the game away : we can only avoid further episodes like this by junking the extraordinary and offensive idea that managers ' only task is to make money and put responsibility back where it belongs – as managers ' Job One ."
2008-11-14,"Adminstrators grappling with the European arm of failed investment bank Lehman Brothers have told creditors their task is "" ten times as big and as complicated "" as the unwinding of Enron .
Speaking after the first creditors meeting , a team from PriceWaterhouseCoopers said they had identified more than $ 1tn in assets and liabilities which need to be accounted for .
At the meeting , held behind closed doors in a conference hall at the O2 dome , lead administrator Tony Lomas told hundreds of representatives and lawyers who attended that he had recovered about $ 5bn out of a potential $ 550bn of obligations owing to creditors .
A further $ 22.3bn of client assets had been identified , all of which will be returned to their owners .
He drew a comparison with the administration of US energy trading group Enron , which collapsed in 2001 , noting that some of his colleague were still working on unresolved elements of that administration .
Lomas said the Lehman administration had already slipped behind schedule because of delays in receiving confirmation from third parties believed to be holding assets of Lehman Brothers International ( Europe ) . ""
The balance sheet position will be north of $ 1tn and we 've got a long way to go before knowing what the position is for creditors and , if there is a shortfall , just how short it will be , "" Lomas said after the meeting . ""

2008-12-14,"At the start of the decade , when US energy giant Enron collapsed after reporting fraudulent profits , and a string of smaller rivals including phone company WorldCom followed suit , financial journalists were criticised for failing to uncover the extent of their deceit .
Now , as the world 's biggest banks struggle to stay afloat , crippled by the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s , business reporters are being attacked for a different reason , accused by some , including a powerful group of MPs , of destabilising the economy by revealing the extent of the problems at Britain 's biggest banks .
Rather than telling their readers too little , as they were in the wake of Enron , journalists are now charged with telling them too much .
The Treasury select committee , chaired by Labour MP John McFall , announced last week that it would investigate the part journalism has played in the current banking crisis - as part of a wider inquiry into how the saga unfolded - examining ' the role of the media in financial stability and whether journalists should operate under any form of reporting restrictions during banking crises ' .
It will hear evidence from media organisations , including the BBC and major newspaper groups , in the new year .
In truth , the power of the press means it is unlikely new rules will be introduced , but whenever politicians talk about imposing limitations on the media , however quietly , protests from news organisations inevitably follow .
Jeremy Hillman , editor of the BBC 's business and economics unit , describes the idea as ' the most spectacular case of shooting the messenger you can imagine .
It would be a huge mistake at this time more than any other in our recent history .
The public has an absolute right to know about weaknesses and structural problems at Britain 's banks . '
Why should n't the average person have access to the same information as those in the know ?
How many senior bankers invested in Northern Rock in the months before its nationalisation ?
Not very many , I expect . '
The problem is that , like most financial institutions , banks can not function unless their customers are convinced their savings are safe .
Revealing the extent of their vulnerability can prompt a crisis of confidence , and ultimately a corporate collapse , while keeping that information private could avert a run on a bank .
News blackouts are not uncommon in criminal cases , and the police often co - operate with the media when lives are at stake .
At a time of national economic crisis , when fresh revelations about the scale of the banks ' problems can cause widespread stock market panic and undermine faith in the banking system , there may be a case for introducing similar arrangements in the financial sphere .
The sight earlier this year of hundreds of customers queuing outside Northern Rock , desperate to withdraw their savings , was a dramatic reminder of the power of the media , prompting calls from politicians , and some newspapers , for an investigation into how Robert Peston , the BBC business editor widely credited with breaking the story of Northern Rock 's talks with the government , was able to reveal that delicate negotiations were taking place .
The BBC has been forced to defend Peston , whose coverage of the credit crunch has been widely praised , but the dilemma he faced when reporting the Northern Rock story will be familiar to every other financial journalist .
In theory , every business story could potentially have a dramatic , and immediate , effect on the fortunes of publicly quoted companies simply because their shares can be bought and sold .
Share prices can move dramatically on the back of innuendo and speculation , and unscrupulous investors can make money by ' shorting ' shares and attempting to drive down their value by planting rumours on internet chat rooms or in the pages of the financial press in an effort to make a quick buck .
No reputable journalist would repeat those claims without checking them first , but for market columns and chat rooms , reporting rumours is part of the job .
The Press Complaints Commission , the newspaper industry 's self - regulation body , also has a voluntary code of practice that includes detailed instructions on how financial journalists should conduct themselves .
After the ' City Slickers ' scandal , when two Daily Mirror journalists , James Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul , were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act by ramping shares they owned in the pages of the paper , the PCC strengthened its code of conduct , drawing up new guidelines for financial journalists about what they could and could n't write .
They state that journalists should declare shareholdings that are relevant , and avoid writing about companies they invest in wherever possible .
The BBC 's Hillman says : ' Our journalistic [ criteria ] are : ' Is it true ?
Would our audience be interested in it ?
And is it crucial information ?
If so , we publish [ or broadcast ] . '
Who has the right to censor what we 're doing and who would benefit ? '
he adds .
The answer , Hillman says , is often the same institutions who were able to conceal the extent of their exposure to the American sub - prime market from regulators and governments for so long .
Responsible reporting could prevent that from happening again , and placing obstacles in the path of journalists would ultimately do the public a disservice ."

His films are sober , carefully crafted and thoroughly researched , politically committed but not propagandistic , and deeply felt without focusing the camera on his own bleeding heart .
He is thus considerably different from the subject of his latest film , Gonzo : The Life and Work of Dr Hunter S. Thompson , one of the creators and most extreme exponent of the "" New Journalism "" of the 1960s , and the man who gave us that overworked phrase "" fear and loathing "" .
Thompson , who had an obsession with guns , owning 22 of them ( all kept fully loaded ) , committed suicide with a gunshot to his head in 2005 at the age of 67 .
The film is an impressionistic portrait of Thompson as eccentric libertarian , admired outsider , rebel , scabrous social critic .
A romantic utopian , he was searching for the American Dream and lamenting its death .
As an ambitious writer , he was chasing after that chimera "" the Great American novel "" , but inevitably finding it eluded him .
Early on , Gibney takes us to the study in the Colorado farmhouse where Thompson lived for the last 40 years of his life , the camera scanning photographs of Mark Twain , William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway , the heroes he sought to emulate .
Thompson was one of three brothers raised in a lower - middle - class family in Louisville , Kentucky , and was in constant trouble at school and then in the US Air Force .
The film , however , passes rapidly over the youth and early career , eager to get to the wild , rebellious 1960s , which he observed , participated in , helped shape the image of , and of which he was ultimately a victim through his reckless addiction to every possible kind of drug .
There is an extended section on his first book , Hell 's Angels ( 1966 ) , an excellent piece of reportage on California 's motorcycle gangs , written after spending a year with them , and ending when he was given a terrible beating after they 'd demanded a share of any money he made out of them .
Gibney shows Thompson going to the self - destructive edge in writing this book and then plunging over that edge into Gonzo journalism .
Hell 's Angels was participatory journalism that put the writer into the story and drew on the techniques of fiction .
Gonzo happily stirred actual fiction into the brew ( some of it extremely mischievous , as when he wrote of politician Ed Muskie as a drug addict ) and added touches of the surreal .
Thompson was introduced to the term ' Gonzo ' by his friend , the Boston journalist Bill Cardoso ; it 's apparently an Irish - American term for the last man standing after an all - night drinking session .
From 1970 , British cartoonist Ralph Steadman illustrated many of Thompson 's books and articles , and his bold graphic style , an expressionistic combination of George Grosz and Thomas Rowlandson , became an essential element in the Gonzo package .
Steadman speaks with a warm , wry candour about their collaboration .
Having started out as a sport journalist , Thompson became immersed in politics .
He ran unsuccessfully for sheriff in Aspen , Colorado , on an independent hippy ticket .
More importantly , he covered all the presidential elections from 1968 onwards . ""
The Kennedys - they were his guys , "" one witness observes , but he became a friend of George McGovern , Gary Hart and Jimmy Carter , all of whom speak well of him , as does a less likely friend , the right - wing ideologue Pat Buchanan , who must have loathed everything Thompson stood for , yet arranged for him to ride in the back of Nixon 's limousine during the 1968 election .
During this period , we see Thompson developing a public persona through his signature dark glasses , cigarette holder , floppy hat and outrageous behaviour and being taken over by it .
By 1976 , when travelling with Jimmy Carter , it was Thompson 's autograph people sought , not the presidential candidate 's .
The peak of Thompson 's madness was reached in 1974 when he accepted a Rolling Stone assignment to cover the Foreman - Ali ' Rumble in the Jungle ' in Kinshasa .
Instead of attending the fight ( as more responsible New Journalists such as Tom Wolfe , George Plimpton and Norman Mailer did ) , he took a load of drugs and floated in his hotel pool wearing a Nixon mask and clutching a bottle of whisky .
Gibney 's elaborately textured film draws on much home movie footage , new interviews , old TV appearances and clips from the feature films inspired by Thompson 's antics ( he 's played by Bill Murray in Where the Buffalo Roam and Johnny Depp in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ) .
It 's often hilarious and captures the spirit of the time , both in its early hopes and its inevitable disillusionment .
Yet it 's a sad movie and somehow inadequate in its lack of true pity or understanding .
Thompson 's first wife , Sondi , mother of his son Juan , put up with him for 20 years , until his excesses and egotism forced her to leave , and it is she alone who says : "" I think his story was tragic . ""
And it is she who demurs from a general agreement that his suicide , like that of Hemingway , was somehow a courageous act .
In this documentary , we watch a man go insane and destroy himself , his final act of madness being the funeral he organised in which his ashes were sent into the skies with red , white and blue fireworks from a self - aggrandising tower he 'd designed with the help of Steadman . ·
This article was amended on December 28 2008 .
In the article above we said : "" Pat Buchanan , who must have loathed everything [ Hunter S ]

"" We meant the 1968 election , when Nixon beat Hubert Humphrey .

2009-01-06,"A US appeals court has upheld 19 criminal convictions against the Enron fraudster Jeffrey Skilling but has ruled that the former chief executive 's 24-year prison sentence is too harsh .
A panel of three appeals judges sitting in New Orleans resoundingly rejected all of Skilling 's arguments for overturning counts of fraud , conspiracy , misrepresentation and insider trading .
But the 55-year - old , who is serving time in a Colorado jail , did secure a minor concession on a technicality as the court found that his original trial judge had applied flawed guidelines in sentencing him .
Skilling is widely considered to be the mastermind behind a web of deceit and corruption which brought down Enron six years ago in one of America 's most notorious cases of corporate fraud which left some 21,000 people jobless .
The US department of justice expressed satisfaction that his appeal had failed .
Acting assistant attorney general Matthew Friedrich said : "" Today 's ruling is a victory for all those harmed by Jeff Skilling and his co - conspirators .
"" Skilling will be re - sentenced because the appeals bench decided that his trial judge , Sim Lake , wrongly added time for jeopardising the soundness of a financial institution , on the incorrect basis that Enron 's pension fund qualified as an institution .
But experts said this would only get him a modest reduction .
Brian Wice , a Texas - based sentencing specialist , told the Houston Chronicle that Skilling would probably still get between 15 and 19 years in prison .
Skilling 's lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli , said his client was "" deeply disappointed "" but that he would continue fighting : "" We 're not by any means prepared to throw in the towel . ""
Skilling had argued that jury selection was tainted because his trial was held in Enron 's home town of Houston - a place which his lawyers said was alive with "" venomous emotion "" over the company 's demise .
His legal team had hoped to capitalise on a successful appeal by three former Merrill Lynch bankers whose convictions were overturned because of a dispute around the meaning of the term "" honest services "" .
Defence lawyers argued that although Enron executives may have led the company poorly , they did not personally gain and they did not break the law .
The appeals court was unmoved , saying : "" Skilling failed to demonstrate that the government 's case rested on an incorrect theory of law or that any reversible errors infected his trial . ""
Skilling was initially imprisoned at a jail in Minnesota but he has since been moved to a low - security facility on the outskirts of Denver .
The US government 's Enron taskforce has secured convictions against 18 people in relation to the energy trading company 's collapse .
These include three British bankers known as the "" NatWest Three "" – David Bermingham , Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew – who pleaded guilty last year to a fraudulent off - shore transaction with Enron ."
2009-01-08,"Indian industry vowed to improve its corporate governance today after the founder of one of the biggest outsourcing firms confessed to a £ 1bn fraud , the country 's biggest corporate scandal in living memory .
B Ramalinga Raju , the chairman and founder of Satyam , admitted he had made up profits for years .
More than 70bn rupees ( £ 1bn ) had been deceitfully booked on the company accounts .
In what is being called India 's "" Enron moment "" , Raju and his brother hid the deception from the company 's board , senior managers and auditors .
"" It was like riding a tiger , not knowing how to get off without being eaten , "" Raju wrote .
But the confession pointed to serious lapses in corporate governance that will have global repercussions .
Questions have been raised about the role of the company 's external auditor , PricewaterhouseCoopers , and the role of its independent directors , who include the father of the Pentium chip , Vinod Dham , and Krishna Palepu of Harvard Business School .
Experts said the "" culture of good corporate governance needed deeper roots "" in India . ""
The idea of corporate governance has not sunk in as much as it should .
Certainly we have dynamic , modern companies in which it has
but in many family - owned businesses it has not .
We need truly independent directors and auditors , "" said T K Bhaumik , chief economic adviser to a $ 2bn family - run conglomerate , J K Organisation .
Other commentators said legal changes would help .
For example Hong Kong made it mandatory to count proxy votes on shareholder resolutions at annual meetings .
Ironically , the World Council for Corporate Governance ranked Satyam as among the best - run companies in the world .
Infosys , an outsourcing company likely to benefit from the fall of a key competitor , said the fraud was deplorable and that the government and regulators "" must investigate and make necessary changes to regulations so that such incidents do not happen in future .
"" What is clear is that Satyam is rapidly running out of cash and its interim chief executive , Ram Mynampati , announced that the company was still struggling to determine the size of the hole in the company accounts .
At a news conference at the company 's headquarters in Hyderabad , Mynampati said the company was still uncertain of its financial position .
Rivals are unlikely to be interested in the company .
The non - executive chairman of Infosys said it would not bid .
"" We have no such interest in looking at buying Satyam or anything like that .
Absolutely no , we will not touch such tainted company , "" Narayana Murthy told Indian television ."

Press Association"
2009-02-06,"Watching the crowds in Iceland banging pots and pans until their government fell reminded me of a chant popular in anti - capitalist circles in 2002 : "" You are Enron .
We are Argentina . ""
Its message was simple enough .
You - politicians and CEOs huddled at some trade summit - are like the reckless scamming execs at Enron ( of course , we did n't know the half of it ) .
We - the rabble outside - are like the people of Argentina , who , in the midst of an economic crisis eerily similar to our own , took to the street banging pots and pans .
They shouted , "" ¡
Que se vayan todos ! ""
( "" All of them must go ! "" ) - and forced out a procession of four presidents in less than three weeks .
What made Argentina 's 2001 - 02 uprising unique was that it was n't directed at a particular political party or even at corruption in the abstract .
The target was the dominant economic model : this was the first national revolt against contemporary deregulated capitalism .
It has taken a while , but from Iceland to Latvia , South Korea to Greece , the rest of the world is finally having its ¡
Que se vayan todos !
moment .
The stoic Icelandic matriarchs beating their pots flat even as their kids ransack the fridge for projectiles ( eggs , sure , but yoghurt ? ) echo the tactics made famous in Buenos Aires .
So does the collective rage at elites who trashed a once thriving country and thought they could get away with it .
As Gudrun Jonsdottir , a 36-year - old Icelandic office worker , put it : "" I 've just had enough of this whole thing .
I do n't trust the government , I do n't trust the banks , I do n't trust the political parties and I do n't trust the IMF .
We had a good country , and they ruined it . ""
Another echo : in Reykjavik , the protesters clearly wo n't be bought off by a mere change of face at the top ( even if the new PM is a lesbian ) .
They want aid for people , not just banks ; criminal investigations into the debacle ; and deep electoral reform .
Similar demands can be heard in Latvia , whose economy has contracted more sharply than any country in the EU , and where the government is teetering .
For weeks the capital has been rocked by protests , including a full - blown , cobblestone - hurling riot on 13 January .
As in Iceland , Latvians are appalled by their leaders ' refusal to take any responsibility for the mess .
Asked by Bloomberg TV what caused the crisis , Latvia 's finance minister shrugged : "" Nothing special . ""
But Latvia 's troubles are indeed special :
the very policies that allowed the "" Baltic tiger "" to grow at a rate of 12 % in 2006 are also causing it to contract violently by a projected 10 % this year : money , freed of all barriers , flows out as quickly as it flows in , with plenty being diverted to political pockets .
( It is no coincidence that many of today 's basket cases are yesterday 's "" miracles "" : Ireland , Estonia , Iceland , Latvia ) .
In Latvia , much of the popular rage has focused on government austerity measures - mass layoffs , reduced social services and slashed public sector salaries - all to qualify for an IMF emergency loan ( no , nothing has changed ) .
In Greece , December 's riots followed a police shooting of a 15-year - old .
But what 's kept them going , with farmers taking the lead from students , is widespread rage at the government 's crisis response : banks got a $ 36bn bailout while workers got their pensions cut and farmers received next to nothing .
Despite the inconvenience caused by tractors blocking roads , 78 % of Greeks say that the farmers ' demands are reasonable .
Similarly , in France the recent general strike - triggered in part by the plans of President Sarkozy to reduce dramatically the number of teachers - inspired the support of 70 % of the population .
Perhaps the sturdiest thread connecting this global backlash is a rejection of the logic of "" extraordinary politics "" - the phrase coined by the Polish politician Leszek Balcerowicz to describe how , in a crisis , politicians can ignore legislative rules and rush through unpopular "" reforms "" .
That trick is getting tired , as South Korea 's government recently discovered .
In December , the ruling party tried to use the crisis to ram through a highly controversial free trade agreement with the US .
Taking closed - door politics to new extremes , legislators locked themselves in the chamber so they could vote in private , barricading the door with desks , chairs and couches .
Opposition politicians were having none of it : using sledgehammers and an electric saw , they broke in and staged a 12-day sit - in of parliament .
The vote was delayed , allowing for more debate - a victory for a new kind of "" extraordinary politics "" .
The pattern is clear : governments that respond to a crisis created by free - market ideology with an acceleration of that same discredited agenda will not survive to tell the tale .
As Italy 's students have taken to shouting in the streets : "" We wo n't pay for your crisis ! ""

A version of this column was published in the Nation ( www.thenation.com ) www.naomiklein.org"
2009-03-15,"John Tiner once had a reputation for being the luckiest man in the City .
Without a university degree , he worked his way up to the top of accountant Arthur Andersen - and left nine months before it collapsed under the weight of fraud and false accounting at its client Enron .
He ticked the wrong age box on a private medical insurance form , and got a prostate cancer test normally reserved for the over-50s .
As a result , he was diagnosed early enough to be successfully treated .
He left his next job , as chief executive of the Financial Services Authority , in July 2007 with praise ringing in his ears .
Then he was lucky enough to secure two jobs in the private sector that could supply what the public sector lacked : significant earning potential .
Now , however , his luck seems to have run out .
Those companies are both in serious difficulties , and praise for his work at the FSA has evaporated .
A stinging report on the regulator 's stewardship over Northern Rock , the collapse of much of the UK 's banking industry and attacks on the rigour of the regulator - including some from his successors at the FSA - have wiped it out .
His latest , and potentially most serious , problem is at Resolution Life , the business established by the colourful entrepreneur Clive Cowdery .
It was designed to snap up bargains among financial services businesses laid low by the credit crunch .
Tiner agreed to become chief executive last year , when Cowdery established it , after the acquisition of a former business under the same name by Pearl Assurance .
Last week , the bargain - hunting plans were in jeopardy as Tiner 's former employer , the FSA , announced that it was investigating "" certain actions "" by Cowdery and three fellow directors between October 2007 and May 2008 , when the Pearl takeover battle was in full swing .
While Tiner was not on the board at the time and is not part of the investigation , it does raise questions over his judgment in joining a company without apparently conducting his own due diligence into its background and prospects .
Similar questions surfaced at New Star , where he took up his first private sector job as a non - executive last April .
Just months later , the company was plunged into financial turmoil as a period of dismal performance by some of its key fund managers led to a big outflow of funds by investors .
That undermined its profits just as it was entering talks with its bankers about refinancing its debts .
These failed and the company was forced to sell itself at a knock - down price to rival Henderson .
Again , Tiner was not there when New Star founder John Duffield paid the £ 364 m special dividend to its - mainly employee - shareholders that left it overstretched .
But when he joined the board , there were questions over his judgment in linking up with Duffield , who has a reputation as an idiosyncratic , rather authoritarian , manager .
Indeed , Tiner 's appointment was one of the moves to persuade investors he had heavyweight independent directors on his board .
More seriously , Duffield was one of the key players in the split capital investment trust settlement , an episode which , at least until the credit crisis exploded , was one of the few blots on Tiner 's record at the FSA .
While he started off being fiercely critical of the fund managers accused of colluding to mislead investors about the nature of these complicated instruments , he agreed to paltry settlement with the firms and let most of those involved escape without penalty .
No one is saying publicly what the Resolution inquiry is about , though the FSA may be examining sales of shares by some directors in the run - up to the sale to Pearl .
In December 2007 , for example , Cowdery sold 17.7 m shares , for £ 703 m , while fellow director Brendan Meehan sold 740,000 , raising more than £ 5 m .
The FSA has been conducting detailed investigations into the financial strength of insurance companies to ensure that they can survive the plunge in the value of shares , bonds , property and other assets in which the bulk of their funds are invested .
That may have thrown up concerns about Pearl and the terms of its takeover of Resolution , given the dramatic fall in insurance stocks as the financial crisis has unfolded .
Whatever the outcome of the FSA 's investigation , it is likely to jeopardise Tiner 's hope of getting rich quickly .
If Cowdery and his fellow directors are found guilty of any wrongdoing , that would effectively scupper any prospect of Resolution making an acquisition .
But even if they are exonerated , it may take some time for Cowdery to repair his reputation .
Tiner , who celebrated his 52nd birthday last month , must have relished the amassing serious money before he retires .
The prospectus for the flotation of Resolution , which took place earlier this year , revealed a very generous incentive package for Tiner and Cowdery - although , because they are not directors of the main company but work through a partnership called Resolution Operations , they do not have to disclose the exact amount .
The five partners of Resolution Operations will be paid £ 2 m a year or "" 0.5 % of the non - cash value of the company "" , whichever is greater , plus 10 % of the "" added value "" of the acquisitions they bring to the company .
If the company is sold - which is likely to be part of the gameplan - they get 30 % of the value of the firm .
That is a considerable improvement over the £ 650,000 or so he was earning at the FSA .
Tiner has long had a liking for the things a generous salary can buy .
After he took the FSA job , he was embarrassed when an interviewer revealed that he drove a Porsche with the number plate T1 NER , so he switched it for a rather more modest Suzuki Jimmy - but stashed the Porsche in the garage .
He has houses in Dorking and Salcombe , the Devon town that could qualify as Knightsbridge - on - Sea , and also enjoys sailing .
Ironically , Tiner was lauded for introducing a robust regulatory regime for insurers , forcing them to strengthen their capital reserves after the puncturing of the dotcom bubble left some of them looking extremely weak .
They were forced to significantly increase their capital strength and conduct regular "" stress tests "" to ensure they could withstand severe falls in the value of their assets .
The FSA has recently been using these powers to force insurers to analyse the impact of falls in the stockmarket of 40 % or more on their balance sheets , and has asked accountant KPMG to work with it on monitoring their solvency .
But reports that the Resolution investigation stemmed from KPMG 's work are believed to be inaccurate .
Other aspects of Tiner 's tenure at the FSA are , however , now being questioned .
One senior City figure who worked closely with him says he was "" never desperately impressed .
I always felt he was a bit invisible , a bit prone to take the view of the last person he spoke to "" .
His tenure certainly coincided with a very light - touch regulatory regime .
"" A lot of the stuff about the [ investment ] industry being the FSA 's clients
and it being there to help came from him , "" said one former colleague .
And Tiner prided himself on his principles - based approach , setting out the framework for regulation rather than imposing detailed rules .
"" You encourage them to operate fairly and properly in the market , but you do n't tell them how to do it , "" he said during his time as FSA chief executive .
The consequences of encouraging them to operate in the market are now apparent : millions have lost much of their life savings and taxpayers will be propping up the banks for years .
The FSA itself is clear about the errors of the old system .
Chairman Lord Turner told the Treasury select committee it had not been "" the function of the regulator to cast questions over the overall business strategy of the institution "" .
Tiner declined to be interviewed for this article , but those close to him say it is unfair to blame him for the failings of the FSA as the political climate was to encourage minimal regulation and break down barriers to doing business , rather than raise more .
Other international regulators were employing an equally light touch regime and the UK could have been put at a serious disadvantage if it had unilaterally increased regulations on financial services companies .
Hector Sants , Tiner 's successor at the FSA , made it clear in a speech last week that the regime was about to change dramatically : "" The limitations of a pure principles - based regime have to be recognised .
I continue to believe that the majority of market participants are decent people ; however , a principles - based approach does not work with individuals who have no principles . """
2009-03-22,"The scandal engulfing the Royal Bank of Scotland reaches new heights today with serious allegations from a senior Labour politician that at least three of its former non - executive directors may have been intimidated and threatened with the sack for asking searching questions about its financial affairs .
The Observer can reveal that a former government minister , Lord Foulkes of Cumnock , who has been extensively briefed by former bank insiders , has written to the Financial Services Authority , the City watchdog , asking it to pursue the claims which , if true , could trigger a criminal investigation .
The intervention by Foulkes , who is also a member of the Scottish parliament and sits on the Commons security and intelligence committee , comes amid fears that the bank will be exposed as the UK 's equivalent of Enron - the US trader that collapsed amid systemic fraud .
Last night Foulkes said there was "" widespread public anger among the public and Parliament that bankers in the midst of this financial crisis appear to be profiting and no action is being taken in relation to action which could constitute criminal offences "" .
In relation to claims of intimidation , Foulkes said : "" If it were to transpire that executives were pressured in such a way , then that is a most serious matter indeed that needs urgent action . ""
He is also understood to have been disturbed by claims that the bank misled investors over its exposure to bad debts .
Yesterday it was reported that more than £ 30bn of "" toxic "" sub - prime mortgages were bought for RBS by traders in 2007 without the board being informed - a claim denied by the bank .
Foulkes 's letter to the FSA chairman , Lord Turner , states : "" You will be aware that there is widespread disquiet that , unlike in the USA , there appears to be no action being taken against any of the UK bankers who may have been culpable of one or more offences in their dealings . ""
He asks Turner to address "" whether any knowingly false statements were made or prospectuses issued that could have led potential investors or depositors to believe the position was more favourable than the board knew it to be and whether there was any intimidation of non - executive directors who had been asking probing questions which led them to believe they would not be reappointed if they continued to pursue such searching questions "" .
Matthew Oakeshott , the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman in the Lords , said : "" I have never come across such damaging claims of megalomania , cover - up and intimidation ...
Never mind Northern Rock .
I am really afraid that RBS will turn out to have been another Enron . ""
Foulkes 's letter will be seen as the latest attempt by the establishment to up the ante on Sir Fred Goodwin , the bank 's former chief executive , who has been blamed for its demise .
Last month , Gordon Brown made a personal demand for Goodwin to hand back some of his £ 16 m pension and pledged to take "" all the legal action necessary "" if he did not comply .
The bank 's financial reports reveal that the former non - execs , who included Peter Sutherland , chairman of BP , Jim Currie , the former head of Customs and Excise and Steve Robson , a former adviser to the Treasury , were paid a basic fee of £ 72,500 a year .
According to RBS , they were meant to "" satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible "" .
Concerns that the bank 's non - executives failed to hold the board to account are bound to throw up further questions about how RBS was being run as it transformed itself from a relatively small outfit into one of the world 's largest financial institutions .
RBS said the bank had not seen Foulkes 's letter and could not comment .
However , a source close to the bank said allegations that the non - executive directors were pressurised may have some foundation . ""
Bullied is too strong a word , but , like many companies , somebody is clearly the leader and they may throw their weight around , "" the source said .
Last month RBS recorded a loss of £ 28bn - the largest in UK corporate history .
Its catastrophic collapse has forced the government to take a 75 % stake in the bank .
UK taxpayers are also having to underwrite billions of pounds of its toxic loans bought by subsidiaries in the US .
When contacted about Foulkes 's letter , a spokesman for the FSA said : "" We do n't comment on whether or not we are going to pursue individual companies unless it is decided it is a matter of interest to the public . """
2009-05-01,"A Manhattan court gave Chrysler permission today to keep paying employees as the bankrupt carmaker struggles to overcome mounting dissent over its restructuring plans from unhappy lenders .
Chrysler presented first - day motions to judge Arthur Gonzalez , a Brooklyn - born bankruptcy veteran who presided over the collapse of Enron and Worldcom .
The procedure is necessary to allow the third - largest US motor manufacturer to stay in business by meeting short - term cash obligations to customers and dealers .
But the Obama administration 's plan for a "" surgical "" bankruptcy taking only 30 to 60 days could be complicated by vocal objections from about 20 hedge funds and investment funds that intend to contest plans to write off two thirds of the company 's $ 6.9bn ( £ 4.6bn ) debt .
In a court filing , Chrysler 's bankruptcy counsel Corinne Ball warned that 38,500 jobs would be lost if the carmaker was forced into liquidation .
"" It will mean the end of an iconic , 83-year - old car company . ""
She said Chrysler intended to mothball most of its factories pending approval of a proposed rescue deal in which Fiat will take an initial 20 % stake and will share technology in producing small cars .
"" Time is of the essence . ""
Fiat 's chief executive , Sergio Marchionne , has emerged as a key player in salvaging the ailing manufacturer through an alliance that will take the Italian manufacturer across the Atlantic for the first time since withdrawing from the US in 1984 .
Marchionne told the Turin daily La Stampa that he had burned the midnight oil to agree a tie - up with Chrysler . ""
We worked day and night .
I spat blood . ""
An estimated 140,000 people work at US parts suppliers and car dealers that rely on Chrysler for business .
Japan 's government said it was watching for any damage to Japanese suppliers .
Economy minister Toshihiro Nikai hinted at possible financial support : "" We must take appropriate measures if they are being hurt .
"" Chrysler 's suppliers are worried that they may not be paid for past business with the US manufacturer and that contracts could be ripped up by a bankruptcy judge .
The Detroit - based carmaker has flirted with collapse before .
The company needed emergency aid of $ 1.5bn from the Carter administration to avert bankruptcy in 1979 .
Former boss Lee Iacocca , who presided over a rescue of the company in the 1980s , expressed hope that Chrysler would survive its present challenges .
"" This is a sad day for me .
It pains me to see my old company , which has meant so much to America , on the ropes , "" said 84-year - old Iacocca . ""
But Chrysler has been in trouble before and we got through it . """

Yes coming shortly , no one could accuse the theatre of ducking the crisis in capitalism .
The Soho gets in first with this collection of 10 short pieces about our current woes .
The result , written and rehearsed at great speed , is rather like a topical , intimate revue : not everything works
but you have to admire the Soho 's readiness to grapple with the global fiscal fiasco .
The best pieces are those that are pungent and precise rather than hand - wringingly apocalyptic .
Paula B. Stanic 's 6 Minutes , for instance , shows a woman stoically occupying her office in sympathy with an arbitrarily sacked shopfloor worker : it nails the CBI myth that employers and employees are drawing closer together .
And , although more fanciful , Megan Barker 's Anaphylactic focuses on a Deal or No Deal contestant winning a box of honeybees at the very moment when their disappearance is causing concern : sexily performed by Lara Pulver , the piece cleverly links our casino society with environmental chaos .
The show also manages to view the current situation with occasional bursts of wry humour .
Marisa Carnesky demonstrates recent mortgage madness by sticking an audience volunteer in her once proud home and proceeding to puncture it with knives : an old Magic Circle trick , but it neatly makes its point .
Steve Thompson and Rachel Dawson also contribute a couple of songs showing the banking collapse as a form of musical chairs .
Best of all is Oladipo Agboluaje 's Set Piece , in which a self - styled cinematic auteur from Haringey goes to Nigeria both to exercise his artistic muscles and impose his world - view on a local actor played with mutinous gaiety by Jimmy Akingbola .
If there is a moral , it is that it is best to be specific when dealing with financial crisis .
Ron McCants , for instance , comes up with a piece of American realism in which a West Virginia miner is driven , out of economic desperation , to murder a Mexican immigrant .
I was less impressed with those pieces that suggest we are all doomed .
Kay Adshead argues British homeless families will also be forced to kill for self - preservation : what she lacks is the social precision of her American colleague .
And Will Eno 's climactic sketch , indicating that western civilisation may well disappear , lapses into generalities .
In short , it 's a mixed bag .
It is held together by the suitably economic direction of Lisa Goldman and Esther Richardson and is well acted .
"" It 's hard to talk about a thing in the middle of a thing , "" says a character in Eno 's piece .
But the show itself proves that is actually the best time .

2009-06-29,"Everyone knew that Bernie Madoff was going down – since he had already pleaded guilty to running a fake investment scheme worth between $ 65bn and $ 171bn .
So there was none of the drama that accompanied fraud trials like that of Jeffrey Skilling , who maintained his innocence even after he was convicted for his part in the collapse of Enron .
The only question today was how long inside Madoff would get .
His lawyers suggested – in a spirit of optimism only paid advocates could muster – that Madoff deserved just 12 years in jail .
The judge gave him the maximum 150 .
So , with time off for good behaviour , Bernie will be out in time to celebrate his 146th birthday in 2084 .
In other words , barring a judicial miracle , the 71-year - old Madoff will spend the rest of his life behind bars .
In terms of discouraging others from selling their souls in return for enjoying 20 years of wealth and prestige , Madoff 's sentence is a good thing .
And it is tempting to indulge in schadenfreude at Madoff 's expense , after he had indulged in riches and privilege at the expense of others .
But the worst result of Madoff 's life sentence is that he becomes the face of the circa-2008 financial tsunami – and that he does n't deserve , even if he deserves to rot behind bars .
What Bernie Madoff really needs is company , and lots of it .
And not just from those who must surely have helped him – since no - one could carry out such a massive fraud for so many years without substantial assitance .
He should have company from the overseers of the fraud perpetrated by Wall Street 's most famous names , on a trillion - dollar scale that dwarfs even Madoff 's fraud .
Indeed , a 150 year sentence for Madoff verges on the heavy - handed , and not just compared to other crimes ( Ted Kaczynski , the Unabomber , also pleaded guily and got imprisonment without parole – but he killed people ) .
Skilling , the mastermind behind the house of mirrors that was Enron , received a sentence of only 24 years in jail , and that was after pleading not guilty .
( Skilling is still appealing his sentence , although his conviction has been reaffirmed by the US court of appeals . )
So what makes Madoff worse , apart from the size of his fraud ?
According to the judge who sentenced Madoff , the length partly reflects the fact that no friends , colleagues or family members were willing to give character references for Bernie to the court .
But that 's hardly a surprise , since they want to be as far away from the whole business as possible .
Feel free to speculate in your own mind as to why that might be .
And that is the difference between Madoff and Skilling : the Enron chief executive was one of several running the company who were tried and convicted , spreading the blame and the retribution .
But by allowing the blame to fall on Madoff – who made a billion - dollar understatement in court when he referred to his fraud as "" an error of judgment "" – lets many more people off the hook .
When the compilation clips of the 2008 financial crisis news - reel runs in the future , as it surely will , the face of Bernie Madoff alone ca n't be allowed to personify the scale of the disaster .
Madoff profited from it , to be sure .
But he was the scavenger who picked over the bones left behind by the crazy - money operations run elsewhere .
Sadly for Bernie Madoff , his fraud was straight forward : he stole money from investors and ran a Ponzi scheme .
( His particular genius was not to promise fantastic , overnight profits , as is usually the way .
Instead he offered solid long - term returns , less likely to attract attention . )
But if he 'd really been smart he would have got into selling collatoralised debt obligations , credit default swaps , mezzanine level revolving syndicated loans , tulip futures and all the rest .
Then , if he 'd really got lucky , he 'd have got a bailout ."
2009-07-04,"Lucy Prebble puts her faith in the idea that there is nowhere a writer , particularly a woman writer , should not go .
When she first lived in London , she says , she would visit sex shops in Soho and wander among the videos and magazines , "" just to sort of reclaim the space in a way -
I hate to be told that somewhere is out of bounds "" .
Her debut play , the multi - award winning The Sugar Syndrome , trespassed into the chatroom fantasies of paedophiles and demanded both comedy and empathy .
She followed that with an adaptation for TV of the bestseller by the anonymous Belle de Jour - Secret Diary of a Call Girl - which turned out "" lighter and frothier "" than she wrote it , but which again inhabited taboo territory - suggesting prostitution not necessarily as victimhood but as a career choice .
Prebble 's latest venture behind closed doors is Enron , which opens at the Chichester Festival this week , before a run at the Royal Court .
This time she has explored that most male arena , the last refuge of the patriarchy , the corporate boardroom .
When she first had the idea , she says , three years ago , at a time when the collapse of the American energy giant Enron looked more like an isolated scandal than the shape of things to come , it was to do it as a musical ( Prebble is nothing if not ambitious ) .
She pitched it that way to the theatre company Headlong ; however , Rupert Goold , who is directing the play - and is the most acclaimed interpreter of Shakespeare of his generation - suggested that when she described it she was not talking about a musical at all , but a classical tragedy .
Why did n't she go and write it that way instead ? ""
That was when it really came alive for me , "" she suggests .
We are in a pub behind the Union Chapel in Islington , north London , where Prebble has been watching rehearsals .
She is 28 , nervously articulate when describing her vocation .
A couple of things attracted her to the real - life story of her play , she says .
The first was a sense that the whole financial basis on which Enron rose and fell was "" that most theatrical of entities , just a game , an illusion , a system of belief "" .
The second was a more autobiographical impulse , a working through of some of the internal arguments of her childhood . ""
On an emotional level , "" Prebble says , "" all my family are from the business world .
My brother and sister both work for big consultancy firms .
My dad was the chairman of a multinational software company before he retired .
I was the youngest child , so I suppose I was always destined to be the arty one .
It was n't really conscious
but I 'm sure there is a bit of my head that suggested the path I did not follow as a subject for me . ""
Prebble grew up in Haslemere in Surrey , the frontline of the post - Big Bang stockmarket boom that attended the rise of the digital economy .
She was , she says , very much one of Thatcher 's children - born in 1981 , the year of "" if it 's not hurting , it 's not working "" .
Her play is , in this sense , a critical examination of some of the values she saw around her , the ethics of the great bubble of money making .
I 've only read it , but Prebble 's dialogue is sharply alive on the page .
Jeffrey Skilling , the disgraced former CEO of Enron , who played high - risk games with energy supply , made accountancy a fantasy of future growth , and for a decade convinced Wall Street that he was "" the smartest guy in the room "" , is presented as a full - blown tragic protagonist - a corporate Macbeth .
Skilling ( who will be played by Sam West ) begins full of the airy belief that he has reinvented the world on his own terms , and ends beset by his own demons as that world crashes around his ears .
"" We do n't have those kings and emperors any more , the stuff of traditional tragedy , "" Prebble says , "" but corporate CEOs are probably the closest we come to it .
Making decisions that affect millions of lives , and they were often undone , as we have seen , by greed and worse .
"" It was profoundly odd , Prebble admits , as she was refining drafts of the play to have different versions of it played out nightly on the news over the course of the past year .
She had n't set out to write the "" story of our times "" and she winces at the idea of zeitgeist , but she had clearly touched on a nerve . ""
The Bernie Madoff story in particular has an echo to the Skilling case , "" she says , "" the same kind of hubris .
Though what is extraordinary is that we had all watched this happen with Enron nearly a decade before and yet still we wanted to believe in the illusion of financial miracles .
There was a criminality in that faith , and I suppose we were all to an extent guilty of it . ""
To get inside Skilling 's head , she immersed herself for a long while in all the detailed forensics of the scandal that had come out in the various enquiries and court cases - "" in the end though you just have to stop and write , or you would be overwhelmed by it "" .
In attempting to understand the sleights of hand of the derivatives markets for herself she brings to the stage all the adrenaline - stoked complexity of the city . ""
What you come to realise , really , "" she suggests , "" is that a lot of what went on made no sense even to the people who were trading it .
People were mesmerised by the numbers .
"" Prebble uses the anarchy of a trading floor as a chorus to her story .
She and the cast visited the stock market bearpit to get a sense of its tone .
She now has the buy and sell hand signals off pat .
"" It 's the purest form of theatre , of course , "" she says , "" and belief in it is kind of the religion behind our society , so it 's odd that that world hardly ever makes it into a theatre .
"" Prebble has been seen in the vanguard of young women playwrights - including Polly Stenham , Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Ella Hickson - who have begun to force their work on to the London stage .
She does n't feel particularly part of a movement , she says , though she welcomes the shift .
She ca n't easily explain the persistent absences of work by women in the main spaces - at the Lyttleton or the Olivier , the RSC or the Globe .
She worked for a while in the office of the director of the National - "" And I do n't believe for a moment that someone like Nick Hytner has a bit of his brain programmed to say , ' this is just not as good because it 's by a woman ' .
I just do n't buy that . ""
But the fact remains . ""
And it is scandalous , "" Prebble suggests , "" because you are getting such a one - eyed view of the world in your art , in films in particular .
Only half of the world is being asked to do the looking , you know .
There are so many things missing from it as a result .
"" Some of those things are resolutely present in Prebble 's intuitive deconstruction of corporate arrogance - what Skelling and the rest lacked we come to understand is the kind of wisdom that comes across in the financier 's onstage interrogations with his young daughter :
Skilling : I have to check the stock price .
Daughter :
Why ?
Skilling :
Because that 's how daddy knows how much he 's worth .
Daughter :
Why ?
Skilling :
Because the market tells me .
Daughter :
Why ?
The comedy of that "" why ? "" , perhaps a legacy of her own childhood , informs every line of Prebble 's play .
This afternoon she has been watching the cast rehearse a scene about an "" Enron death weekend "" in which the bonus - heavy execs got to ride team - building dune buggies .
"" We were doing this vroom vroom stuff with chairs and so on , "" she explains , "" but of course all the guys got completely into it , and all the girls , me and the assistant directors and a few others , kind of looked on .
Some giggled and thought it was hilarious , and some tried seriously to analyse it , wondered what it meant .
"" Prebble - no doubt - managed to do both at the same time .

2009-07-10,"The fact that this show will be heading to the Royal Court is a sign of how much Chichester has changed and the quality of work available .
Written by Lucy Prebble , who won the George Devine award for her Royal Court play The Sugar Syndrome , and directed by Headlong 's Rupert Goold , this world premiere looks at one of the most significant of recent financial scandals , the collapse of Enron .
David Hare is already preparing to write about the current monetary crisis at the National in the autumn , and no doubt somebody is getting ready to do a verbatim number on the Bernie Madoff fraud , but Prebble 's play sounds more like a Serious Money , charting the attitudes and conditions that developed in the 1990s boom which allowed Enron to happen .

Minerva , Festival Theatre , Sat to 29 Aug"
2009-07-23,"It 's a sign of Chichester 's new adventurousness that , in partnership with Headlong and the Royal Court , it is staging theatre 's latest attack on corporate corruption .
Lucy Prebble 's hugely ambitious play , covering the rise and fall of the Texan energy company , Enron , is an exhilarating mix of political satire , modern morality and multimedia spectacle .
Spanning the years between 1992 and the present , Prebble 's play makes Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's top executive , the prime mover and principal villain , rather than Kenneth Lay , its founder .
It is Skilling who gets the top job by coming up with a vision of the future : one in which Enron does n't merely provide natural gas but trades in energy , the internet and even the weather .
But Skilling is aided by financial officer , Andy Fastow , who creates exotically named shadow companies in which Enron 's escalating debts are disguised as assets .
Eventually the whole bubble bursts , with the company 's debts revealed as $ 38bn , Skilling sentenced to jail and Lay dying before being sentenced .
Prebble 's overwhelming point is that nothing has been learned : that , even as Enron employees were losing everything , others were pocketing fat bonuses , as they might today .
But the virtue of both her play and Rupert Goold 's brilliant production is that they capture the dual face of capitalism : its turbulent energy and hubristic vanity .
The first half of Goold 's production reminds one of Citizen Kane in its dazzling , vaudevillian energy : stock prices are imprinted on human faces , traders whirl and gyrate like dancers , analysts sing close harmony numbers .
This is the free market as jazzy fantasy in which Skilling says of Enron , "" we 're not just an energy company - we 're a powerhouse of ideas "" .
Prebble and Goold , aided by Anthony Ward 's breathtaking designs , show that Enron was a vast fantasy in which everyone was complicit : not least the lawyers , analysts and investors who believed in this self - created bubble and kept it afloat .
The power of Samuel West 's fine performance as Skilling lies in its very lack of demonism .
In West 's assured hands , Skilling becomes a man who combines brilliance and stupidity and grows from a nerdy ordinariness into a tycoon through the idea that future income can be written down as earnings the moment a deal is signed .
Tim Pigott - Smith as Lay also rivetingly presents us with a devout , backslapping figure who sanctions Skilling 's dirty tricks without wanting to know the details .
There is rich support from Tom Goodman - Hill as the innovative Fastow surrounded by red - eyed raptors devouring Enron 's debt and from Amanda Drew , playing the one person who seems to believe that profits must be related to productivity .
Even if Enron is n't the last word on the free market debacle , it is a fantastic theatrical event ."
2009-07-25,"Making the virtual look real , turning ideas into flesh , is part of the business of theatre .
How better to give life to the illusions of finance , of trading in futures .
As is proved by Rupert Goold 's tremendous production - for Headlong and the Royal Court - of 28-year - old Lucy Prebble 's first - rate new play .
Dazzle and evanescence is everywhere :
the evening twists continually between the actual and the insubstantial .
This is one of the most incisive , most grown - up political dramas of the past 10 years .
Written acerbically , staged like a hi - tech danse macabre , Enron dramatises the rise and fall of the energy company which was once America 's seventh largest corporation .
It buoyantly explains mark - to - market and hedging .
It points with absolute clarity to the decisive shift in power from palaces and governments to corporations .
It demonstrates the faith that kept the whole hollow enterprise afloat .
A confluence of skills - Anthony Ward 's set , Mark Henderson 's lighting , Jon Driscoll 's video and Adam Cork 's soundscape - creates a reverberating cathedral of light and darkness , a mammon heaven .
Market figures run continuously in a strip of scarlet neon .
Fluorescent tubes dangle from the roof , flushing red , white and blue at the time of the Bush election , and later turning into lime - green Jedi swords .
A chorus is covered in illuminated columns of numbers , converted from characters into financial artefacts .
The Enron logo appears high above the stage , as does a pumped - up chief , addressing his staff like a preacher in a pulpit ; when the word "" GOLD "" flashes up there , it 's easy to miss the "" L "" .
At the centre of all this is an unholy trinity of men fuelled by rapacious intellect , a hunting instinct and messianic zeal .
As Ken Lay , the founder of the company , Tim Pigott - Smith has absolute bruising assurance .
The fine Tom Goodman - Hill is intent as Andy Fastow , the man who applied his ingenuity to manufacturing debt - concealing companies .
Samuel West is powerfully intelligent as Jeff ( all these big blokes have diminutive names )
Skilling , the ex - Harvard star who as CEO set about transforming Enron from a direct provider of electricity and gas into a market - maker in energy derivatives .
He begins as a beefy , overgrown schoolboy , with rolling gait and a neck poking out of an uncomfortable collar ; he gets sleeker , losing his specs and tufty hair ; he ends as a stomach - clutching shambles .
He "" just wanted to change the world "" , he explains , and it 's part of Enron 's triumph that he 's neither demonised nor let off the hook .
Nor is Amanda Drew 's utterly persuasive , hard - edged aspirer : she may have her feet on the ground but you could n't say her heart is in the right place .
The fully human mingles with the cartoon .
The Lehman brothers appear as conjoined twins , trapped in the one coat ; Enron 's accountants , Arthur Andersen , are a ventriloquist and his dummy ;
Fastow 's debt - eating entities crawl on as voracious raptors with ember - red eyes .
The traders perform a barber - shop number .
It 's astonishing that this is only Prebble 's second play .
Her first , The Sugar Syndrome , was a gem , but Enron is of a different order .
It can be seen as the successor to Caryl Churchill 's Serious Money .
But it is also its own magnetic thing .
Put your money on it being a sell - out when it moves to the Royal Court this autumn .
Hanif Kureishi 's The Black Album was one of the novels with which he helped - hurrah - to change the face of British writing .
Set in 1989 , when Ayatollah Khomeini pronounced the fatwa on Salman Rushdie , it took in the fall of communism and the music of Prince , but was chiefly prescient in its picture of a hero , Shahid Hasan , torn between hedonism and Islamic fundamentalism .
The importance of the subject has n't receded but it has made a leaden transition to the stage in Kureishi 's own adaptation .
Jatinder Verma 's poorly acted , jittery production strains to project the zap of the novel 's scenes and the whizz of the prose .
Videos - of Maggie and Madonna and of alarmingly encroaching wallpaper when our hero is tripping - race away at the back of a cramped room .
There 's music from Sister Bliss and a lot of arbitrary jumping around .
Almost any time students want to say something they stand up on a piece of furniture .
Dreams of Violence is rather too big a title for Stella Feehily 's dark , skittish , sharply phrased new play .
Its fragments from a politically - committed life under assault - from goatish ex - husband , druggy son , floundering dad and boozy mum - do n't exactly come together , until they too perfectly come together : the idealistic heroine is hospitalised because her heart is too big for her body .
Still , each fragment has its own point .
Max Stafford - Clark 's direction is particularly strong in visualising the daydreams of the ex - pop - star mother whose reveries are lit by brightly coloured bulbs .
And Feehily 's gift for encapsulation is bracing .

2009-07-25,"Three disgraced bankers , the so - called "" NatWest Three "" , who were convicted in the US of conspiring with former Enron executives to dupe the bank out of $ 20 m , are to be released from a British jail in October after serving just half of their sentence and failing to meet a pledge to repay the money they stole .
Gary Mulgrew , Giles Darby and David Bermingham , former bankers at the investment banking unit NatWest Greenwich , which is now part of taxpayer - controlled Royal Bank of Scotland , are to be released on tag from Ford open prison on the Sussex coast this autumn .
The men were handed a 37-month sentence in February 2008 by US district judge Ewing Werlein .
Had they not been transferred to the UK last January
, it is likely they would have been forced to serve at least 85 % of their sentence behind bars .
If they had been convicted in a British court and failed to meet a subsequent confiscation order , they would have had their jail terms extended .
The bankers waged an unsuccessful campaign against extradition to the US under the deeply unpopular Extradition Act 2003 .
The four - year battle won support from business leaders including the British Airways chairman Martin Broughton , GlaxoSmithKline chairman Sir Chris Gent , Icap chief executive Michael Spencer , retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and London Stock Exchange chairman Chris Gibson - Smith .
Mulgrew , Darby and Bermingham at first protested their innocence but after transferring to Texas they changed tack , each entering guilty pleas .
Outside court , friends and family insisted they had done so under duress .
Handing down the sentence , judge Werlein said the three must repay "" every dollar "" of the $ 7.3 m they gained from defrauding NatWest .
Bermingham and Darby each surrendered $ 500,000 , with Mulgrew handing over a further $ 250,000 .
However , almost $ 6.1 m remains owing to RBS .
The bank has contacted the convicted fraudsters , who told it they have little or no assets after years waging a battle against extradition .
A spokesperson said : "" We are continuing to engage with both the individuals and their legal representatives to bring this matter to a close . """

Out of Joint 's Mixed Up North is proving a talking point at the Octagon in Bolton ( where former Young Vic artistic director , David Thacker , will be staging All My Sons and Ghosts later in the season ) , and Deep Cut – a brilliant verbatim play about the unexplained deaths of young soldiers at the Deep Cut army barracks – cries out to be seen at the Sherman in Cardiff before it heads out on tour ( dates include the Ustinov in Bath ) .
You could also slip into previews of Andrew Bovell 's Speaking in Tongues , which stars John Simm ( so brilliant in Elling ) or Prick Up Your Ears .
Although , quite honestly , the presence of Simon Bent as writer interests me much more than the presence of Matt Lucas as Orton 's murderous lover , Kenneth Halliwell .
Tim Crouch 's The Author which starts at the Royal Court upstairs , sounds unmissable too .
But what else is there ?
Well , I 'm a big fan of Crocosmia by Little Bulb at BAC .
It is the kind of whimsical piece —adults playing children , operating at that point when charm could so easily slip into tweeness — that could get right up your nose , but I found it breaking my heart despite my initial resistance .
Another show that probably should n't work but which does ( triumphantly ) is the Bette Bourne/ Mark Ravenhill conversation piece , A Life in Three Acts , which is at Soho this week .

Theatre Zar 's Gospels of Childhood , part of the Barbican 's BITE season , sounds terrific too .
I just wish there were more nights in the week ."
2009-09-23,"After the high praise earned in Chichester , there was always the lurking fear the Enron bubble might burst on transfer .
But , although it had more room to manoeuvre at the Minerva , Lucy Prebble 's play and Rupert Goold 's production are so strong that they survive the move .
What they vividly offer is not a lecture on corporate madness but an ultra - theatrical demonstration of it at work .
The play shows how the Texan energy giant , Enron , moved from a model of the future to a bankrupt disaster with debts of $ 38bn .
Prime mover is Jeffrey Skilling : a Marlovian over - reacher who boldly announces "" we 're not just an energy company , we 're a powerhouse for ideas "" .
His basic idea is to trade in energy as well as supply it .
But , as his dreams expand to include video , internet and even the weather , the gap between stockmarket perception and reality grows ever greater .
As profits fail to materialise , Skilling turns to his sidekick , Andy Fastow , to create shadow companies to conceal mounting debts .
Once the market loses confidence , however , Skilling 's schemes are revealed for what they are : a fraudulent fantasy .
It could all be dry as dust .
But the pulse and vigour of play and production stem from their ability to make complex financial ideas manifest .
Everything is made visually apprehensible .
Thus the complicity of market analysts in Enron 's over - evaluation is captured by turning them into a close - harmony troupe .
The Lehman Brothers become Siamese twins locked into a single suit .
Best of all is the scene where Fastow explains his system for funnelling Enron 's debts into shadow companies .
Even financial innocents can follow this as Fastow shows boxes encasing ever smaller boxes lit by a flickering red light symbolising the basic investment .
This is capitalism exposed as con - trick and illusion .
Goold 's immaculate staging , Anthony Ward 's design and Scott Ambler 's movement illustrate the whirling kaleidoscopic energy that is part of the dream .
But Prebble also creates plausible people , and Samuel West is hugely impressive as the self - deluded Skilling .
It is difficult to feel sympathy for such a man , whose deregulation policies did so much damage , but West reminds us of the global complicity in money worship .
Amanda Drew as his rival , Tim Pigott - Smith as Enron 's avuncular founder , and Tom Goodman - Hill as the greed - driven Fastow , haunted by the scaly raptors which symbolise the shadow - companies , are also first - rate .
But the triumph of the evening is that it renders Enron 's rise and fall in exciting theatrical terms , and leaves us with the feeling that , as the bonus culture thrives while others lose their jobs , the lessons of this vast collapse have still to be learned ."
2009-09-23,"Everyone already knows that Enron is a masterpiece .
Lucy Prebble 's song - and - dance satire of the energy corporation 's spectacular 2001 collapse , staged by Rupert Goold at the Chichester festival this summer , had the critics positively ladling out the stars with sweaty - palmed admiration .
"" Wonderful , "" breathed Michael Coveney .
"" Fantastic , "" gushed Charles Spencer , "" and accessible even to dunderheads like me who would n't know a financial instrument from an instrument of torture "" .
While everybody , at some point or another , said "" the signature story of our age "" , "" harbinger "" and "" timely "" , about half a dozen times .
But now the play has come to London and as Michael Billington remarks , "" there was always the lurking fear the Enron bubble might burst on transfer "" .
But no .
West End and Broadway runs have already been booked , the film rights have been optioned by Columbia Pictures , and the critics have got their shovels out for another glut of praise . ""
The show is epic , noisy , colourful and cartoonish , "" says Michael Coveney , whose own touring opinions have moved from the Independent to the Stage .
"" But it 's so heatedly on the button of what happened in all of our lives , you wo n't want to miss it . ""
Although you will , at least until the West End version opens , because the Royal Court run is sold out .
Being the Evening Standard 's theatre critic , however , opens doors : Henry Hitchings managed to secure a ticket – and how glad he is . ""
Lucy Prebble 's dashing play … [ is ] an opulent visual spectacle , "" he declares .
"" Here is the blustering energy of capitalism , the illusion of being a delirious romp ; and here too its narcissism and testosterone - fuelled nastiness . ""
That 's all very well
Hitchings , I hear you mutter enviously , but who is at the centre of this whirligig ? ""
At the centre , "" he says , "" is [ Enron 's CEO , Jeffrey ] Skilling .
When we first see him he is a hopeless nerd , yet he transforms himself into a swaggering Übermensch .
It 's a role in which Sam West positively revels ; he is perfect as this suave , grandiloquent and crass overreacher . ""
On this point , however , Billington completely disagrees .
A "" Marlovian over - reacher "" , is what he thinks Skilling is , with a hyphen .
Though in all other respects , he pronounces Enron to be a rare five - star hit , tossing out auxiliary plaudits for the show 's direction ( "" immaculate "" ) , acting ( "" first - rate "" ) , choreography ( "" whirling "" ) , design ( also "" whirling "" ) , ushering , air conditioning , seat cushioning and half - time ice creams too , probably . ""
[ It ] leaves us with the feeling , "" he concludes , "" that , as the bonus culture thrives while others lose their jobs , the lessons of this vast collapse have still to be learned . ""
Or have they ?
Hitchings , on this point at least , is not so sure . ""
The Enron Corporation is used as a convenient synecdoche for the whole contentious notion of free markets , although really it was a special case , "" he avers , with a dose of ten - dollar vocab .
"" Might it not have been more interesting to expose the flawed praxis of law - abiding capitalists than to focus on capitalism 's most goonish criminals ?
"" It might , Henry .
It might indeed .
Depending on what praxis means … Do say : Bloody bankers !
Do n't say :
Yes , but Enron was n't a bank .
And it collapsed because of fraudulent false accounting , not through an excessive exposure to securitised subprime loans deals .
It 's totally different from the credit crunch , and …
The reviews reviewed : I want to marry this play and have its babies ."
2009-09-25,"With an excellent Winter 's Tale already out on the road and Enron at the Royal Court , Headlong is having a busy autumn and , in the case of this company , quantity does n't mean a drop in quality .
Here 's a chance to see one that Rupert Goold made earlier , a revival of Luigi Pirandello 's strange shifting masterpiece first seen at Chichester in 2008 which then went into the West End .
Jack Shepherd and Catherine McCormack lead the cast in a version of this 1921 experimental classic updated to chime with our own era of reality TV .
The six strangers of Pirandello 's original arrive not in a theatre but in the editing suite where a documentary film is in post - production .
Here the film - maker agrees to film their story .
Soon fiction and reality are frighteningly blurred .
It 's a strong production for BOV which is buzzing and has an enviable season of work .

Bristol Old Vic , Sat to 10 Oct"
2009-10-08,"In the past few weeks , I 've seen more evidence than ever that the recession has injected a shot of adrenalin into theatre land .
Three "" state of capitalism "" plays stand out : Money , a delirious satire based on Zola 's L'Argent and the 19th - century collapse of the French bank Union Generale , at Shunt ; Enron , Lucy Prebble 's hit based on the insatiable skulduggery of Jeffrey Skilling and his comrades , at the Royal Court ; and The Power of
Yes , David Hare 's narrative drawn from conversations with key players in the financial downfall , at the National .
All played to full houses on the nights I was there , and have been generating earnest debate in the press .
This is theatre doing what it does best , we drama - philes cry .
This is theatre holding a mirror up to nature , helping us to tease narrative from chaos and learn lessons to free us from history 's repetitive round .
This is theatre as public service , as social rehabilitator ; you can see it in the language used by the National when they describe how they asked Hare "" to write an urgent and immediate work to be staged this autumn that sought to find out what had happened "" and found the result to be "" as enlightening as it is entertaining "" .
By making the grubby underbelly of corporate greed into London 's hottest dramatic meme , we feel we have proved our humility ; we have already taken action to repair our rotten economic state .
But there is something a little suspect about how good these plays make us feel .
Money and Enron are both fantastic shows , spectacular and chilling .
Booing at their pantomime - villain bankers and traders feels great , but that 's mainly because they allow us to point fingers and condemn the bad guys in a way that we singularly failed to do at the time .
Although there were a few perfunctory attempts in each show to remind us that we , the great public , are the ones who facilitated the high - level deceptions – with our failure to question unsustainable returns and our willing collusion in a too - good - to - be - true system as long as it gave us three bedrooms and an en - suite – none of them really hit home .
Instead , we got to revel in our own humility and restraint compared to the mad maths geniuses whose hubris dragged us all down .
Even The Power of Yes – ploddingly unimaginative compared to the other shows – generated waves of that sound so characteristic of South Bank audiences : the smug giggle - sigh .
Watching the crimes of the government , the RBS , the FSA and an alphabetti - feast of other financial acronyms unfold on stage , we smugly giggle - sighed our way to absolution .
Yes , I left with a slightly better intellectual grasp of the maths , but I did n't feel emotionally touched or implicated at all .
One of the eggheads in Hare 's play suggests that we have all been passengers in a financial Mercedes , happy to enjoy the improbably smooth ride because we trust the technology of the system .
In Enron , a nameless woman uses the similar image of an engineless aeroplane , kept airborne by our collective blind faith .
But these identikit analogies are so bland and predictable they barely register .
After relishing our three hours in the moral high ground of the stalls , do we leave feeling that we have repaired our crooked values simply by forking out £ 20 to watch them replayed ?
Do we excuse ourselves from taking any responsibility for changing in the real world because we have "" faced up "" to the truth , valiantly using theatre to strip the scales from our eyes ?
One of theatre 's most ancient roles is to provide catharsis , but can it therefore be dangerously effective in purging us of our guilt ?
Now , I 'm one of the most idealistic and passionate defenders of theatre I know .
I have been moved to self - improvement by many excoriatingly honest shows .
But I also suspect that I frequently use theatre as a proxy rather than an agent of change .
And these cartoonish recession plays certainly have more of a reprimanding bark than a bite ."
2009-10-09,"English National Opera 's obsession with persuading theatre directors to confront the very different challenges of staging opera , and then watching them fall flat on their faces , continues .
The latest ingenue is Rupert Goold , who , fresh from his Royal Court success with Enron , finds himself entirely out of his depth with Turandot .
This is one of the most dismal evenings at the Coliseum in a long time .
Goold transplants the action from Puccini 's semi - make - believe , dynastic China , to a Chinese restaurant ( designed by Miriam Buether ) very much in the present day staffed by cleaver - wielding kitchen staff wearing pigs ' heads , with Ping , Pang and Pong as murderous chefs , and a clientele containing every contemporary stereotype from Elvis lookalikes to a Chelsea pensioner .
None of these glosses elucidates the drama , or creates a plausible dramatic context for any of the protagonists , surely the justification for any kind of updating .
Gwyn Hughes Jones 's Calaf is a wide boy with a garish tie , Amanda Echalaz 's Liu is a sulky 20-something , and Turandot herself – Kirsten Blanck , making her ENO debut – a character with no visible means of dramatic support .
There 's something desperate about the way Goold 's production strives to make a garish impact , never trusting the music to make any points without the help of totally redundant stage business , piling one irrelevance on another .
He even adds a character , designated in the cast list as a writer , and silently portrayed by Scott Handy ; whether he 's controlling the action , or merely recording it , is unclear until the final scene , when Turandot uses her sword to kill him , and in doing so frees herself to love Calaf .
Like so much else it 's a pointless addition , and ENO has missed a trick by opting to perform the traditional Alfano completion rather than Luciano Berio 's – arguably more faithful to Puccini 's intentions , and yet to be used in a staging by a professional company in this country .
A production offering no perceptions about Puccini 's final opera is matched by a musical performance with few revelations either .
Edward Gardner 's conducting is loud and unsubtle , and much of the singing follows his lead , though when she gets the opportunity in the final act , Echalaz does make something of Liu 's final aria .
For that some thanks , but this is one Chinese restaurant from which there is absolutely nothing to take away .
•
This article was amended on 19 October 2009 to make clear that Luciano Berio 's completion has yet to be staged by a professional British opera company ."
2009-10-09,"It feels like a good time in British theatre at the moment , as if everything is firing on all cylinders .
There 's great new writing in shows like Enron and The Author at the Royal Court , and Dennis Kelly 's Orphans at Soho , or Simon Stephens 's Punk Rock at the Royal Exchange .
And there are some terrific revivals of classic plays , notably the Curve 's revival of All My Sons , which joins the much - lauded David Thacker revival at the Octagon in Bolton .
I must also mention Sean Holmes 's revival of Trevor Griffiths 's brilliant Comedians at the Lyric Hammersmith .
I saw Holmes do a production of this play at the Northcott in Exeter a few years ago with a pre - Dr Who David Tennant playing would - be comic Gethin Price .
This time round , it 's rising star David Dawson ( a fantastic Romeo in an indifferent RSC Romeo and Juliet ) who is joined by Keith Allen and Matthew Kelly .
Full marks to Kelly , who has really reinvented himself with some brave performances in the Lichfield Garrick 's Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and
Howard Barker 's amazing Victory , at the Arcola .
If those do n't tickle your fancy , the Not Black and White season begins at the Tricycle with new plays from three black playwrights , Roy Williams , Kwame Kwei - Armah and Bola Agbaje .
Willams 's prison drama , Category B , is first off the block ( his fantastic Days of Significance also gets a well - deserved revival by the RSC and goes out on tour , starting in Newcastle , later this month ) .
Over at the Theatre Royal , Stratford East , you 'll find Cosh Omar 's comedy of belief , The Great Extension .
In Scotland , the Traverse 's The Dough is Rising season of lunchtime plays begins , alongside the premiere of Ursula Rani Sarma 's The Dark Things .
The Pitmen Painters is at Cardiff 's New Theatre , Simon Godwin 's The Winter 's Tale goes into the Theatre Royal , Bury St Edmunds ( the most fetching little theatre in the country ) , and Told by an Idiot 's delightful , playful The Fahrenheit Twins finishes at the Drum in Plymouth before heading to West Yorkshire Playhouse .
Plenty happening in the West End , too , with Simon McBurney 's Endgame opening this week ( how great to see Beckett back in the commercial theatre
– two in the last six months ) ,
Dominic West starring in Life Is a Dream at the Donmar , and of course , it 's just been announced that Keira Knightley will star alongside Damian Lewis in Martin Crimp 's bilious version of The Misanthrope at the Comedy .
Thea Sharrock directs , but she 'll have to get Nicholas Wright 's Mrs Klein on at the Almeida before that .
It 's a really fascinating play and I 'm sure Clare Higgins will do it justice playing the child psychoanalyst Melanie Klein who used her own children as subjects .
Meanwhile , Jane Horrocks is saddling up for Annie , Get Your Gun at the Young Vic .
And if all that still is n't your thing –
well , there 's still plenty of interest going on .
At the Nuffield in Lancaster , you can have an intimate karaoke encounter with a currently serving soldier in Quarantine 's Soldier 's Song .
Look out , too , for Quarantine 's Make Believe opening at Contact in Manchester later in the month .
Another view of the soldier 's life comes in Slung Low 's Beyond the Front Line at the Lowry .
If you missed Kristen Fredricksson 's Everything Must Go in Edinburgh , you can catch it at the Basement in Brighton next Friday .
I 'm very much looking forward to James Thierree 's new piece , Raoul , at the Barbican , and Sadler 's Wells has circus too in Cirkör 's Inside Out .
My big tips of the week are to get yourself a programme for Suspense , London 's first festival of adult puppetry for 25 years , which opens on 30 October , and find out what 's going on in the eclectic Bristol Jam , which starts at the end of the week .
Then take yourself off to BAC for Not For Me ,
Not For You , But For Us , a remarkable season of work that celebrates audience creativity and makes them participants , not spectators .
It 's already getting some people hot under the collar .
I 'd also heartily recommend the installation project Home Sweet Home and Small Town
Anywhere , a performance with no actors – just a playing audience – which I 'll be writing about later in the week .
Have fun –
oh , and do n't forget the Ken Campbell tribute at the National on Monday ."
2009-10-10,"Before its collapse , Enron ran a series of TV commercials around its corporate slogan "" Ask Why "" .
It 's a good question .
Economists and financial journalists have told us a lot about "" How "" , explaining the mechanics of the banking crisis , but they have said little about the infinitely more difficult puzzle of "" Why "" the Great Unravelling came down on our heads .
Why did they do it ?
Why did we let them ?
These are darker and more complex depths even than credit derivatives and we look to art , not economics , for an answer .
The crisis is migrating out of the financial bulletins and into the bookshops and theatres .
David Hare 's play The Power of Yes and Lucy Prebble 's Enron
both grapple with it on the stage and Sebastian Faulks addresses it in his latest novel , A Week in December .
All three are brave and entertaining , but this slump has not , so far , produced anything to compare with the insights or the power of the great crash - lit of the past , such as Tom Wolfe 's Bonfire of the Vanities , or Trollope 's monstrous financier Augustus Melmotte in The Way We Live Now .
Trollope in satirical mode would have delighted in the press night for the Hare play : he would have witnessed the confluence of two privileged establishments : north London bien pensants ticking off east London commerçants .
It was not so much the theatre of confrontation as a mildly self - flagellatory evening of corporate entertainment ; the audience was sprinkled with prominent figures from the media and finance including George Soros , who watched himself being portrayed by an actor as a leading character in the drama , and the BBC 's Robert Peston , who did not , having been neglected in favour of his colleague , Paul Mason .
By the following day , being an FOH – Friend of Hare – was the latest City ego trip : one very senior banker assured me he had talked to Sir David at length , but had n't been included the play in person because it would have been "" inappropriate "" .
Hare brought his research notebook to life , dramatising his interviews with the grandees of British and global finance , but the grittier world where people are drowning in debt , losing their jobs and their homes , was under - represented , with only a brief part for a Citizens Advice Bureau counsellor .
Hare is still , for the most part , stuck with the "" How "" than the "" Why "" ; he gave an entertaining guide to the technicalities but the motives remained a mystery .
Lucy Prebble delves deeper and her work packs a more powerful punch .
In one scene , the young daughter of Jeffrey Skilling , the chief destroyer of Enron , asks him why he checks share prices , why he wants to know how much he is worth , why he needs to make a profit , why he wants to make money ; each question is followed by another childish
"" Why ? "" until she leaves the stage , blowing bubbles .
Skilling produces an answer at the end , in a soliloquy delivered from his prison cell , where he is serving a 24-year sentence .
A stockmarket index , he tells us , is a mirror to the human soul .
Bubbles are necessary to human progress , giving us the railroads , the slave trade , the internet – and we will need another one to give us the technology to save the environment .
It is a speech that echoes both Gordon Gekko 's "" greed is good "" address in the film Wall Street , and St Paul 's Letter to the Corinthians , which tells us we have faith , hope and love and that the greatest of these is love .
Skilling , the arch - disciple of the free market , twists it to say : "" There 's Greed , there 's Fear , Joy , Faith …
Hope … and the greatest of these is Money . ""
Despite being superbly played by Sam West , however , Skilling lacks the demonic charisma of a Melmotte or even a Gekko .
He is not a fatally flawed genius , but as one of his duped employees informs him , just a faintly flabby common crook .
Skilling , and his catspaw ,
Andy Fastow are not , we are told with some understatement , people persons .
Neither is John Veals , the odious hedge - fund manager created by Sebastian Faulks , who masterminds a cynical short - selling scheme that will make him millions but hasten the ruin of the Allied Royal Bank , a thinly disguised Royal Bank of Scotland .
Veals , as his wife , Vanessa , recognises , lives in a semi - virtual world where profit is self - sustaining and unrelated to growth or production .
In this dystopia , "" functional autism "" and a very limited sense of "" the other "" is the ideal frame of mind .
Faulks 's characters all live in unreal worlds : tube train driver Jenni Fortune is addicted to Parallax , a fictional version of Second Life , and Hassan , the devout Muslim youth , has succumbed to the warped logic and morality of Islamic terrorism .
The collective insanity is underscored by the reality TV show It 's Madness , a dark parody of Big Brother , where inmates of the madhouse compete to win treatment for their condition , and by the character of Adam , who is trapped by schizophrenia .
And Veals is not the only short - seller : most of the others sell either themselves or other short too .
Jaded book reviewer R Tranter 's stock in trade is to trash rival writers , scanning the fiction pages like a fund manager to see whose stock is falling .
Even middle - class wife Sophie Topping rates rival dinner party hostesses as dispassionately as a company analyst would weigh up equities , ranking her rivals on the charmingness of their children and their home decor .
The book ends with Veals laughing as he contemplates the killing he will make from his depraved dealing .
The moral for Faulks seems to be that other people are the only reality and that books , although they create imaginary worlds , are the key to understanding .
It gets my vote , but the bankers wo n't be quaking in their boots .
Novelists and playwrights are relative latecomers to the crunch ; visual artists were the most prescient , perhaps because they themselves were part of the investment bubble .
Damien Hirst 's The Golden Calf , a preserved animal with 18-carat gold horns sold for £ 10.3 m at Sotheby 's on the same day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy ; pieces such as Marc Quinn 's Siren , an gold statue of Kate Moss , play with ideas about the intersection of art , money and celebrity and how we assign value in our culture .
The Frieze art fair in London 's Regent 's Park this week will have a theme of mirrors , suggesting a post - crunch need for self - examination .
It will show a four - part film by Danish collective Superflex , which overtly addresses the financial crisis ; they are promising to use a hypnotist to help them experience the final stages of a crunch as seen through the eyes of a major economic player .
Other artists address it on a more subliminal level : British collaborators Kim Coleman and Jenny Hogarth are presenting a piece called Players , part of which allows viewers to mount a scaffold from which they can see the mechanics and activities of the entire fair , speaking to the desire for transparency and to see things as a whole .
Fascinating stuff , but again , it will hardly set the tumbrils rolling to the guillotine .
The credit crunch is too important to be left to the specialists .
We need a broader cultural understanding and artists can have as much power to bring about change and reform as any regulator or politician .
In Tom Wolfe 's introduction to Bonfire of the Vanities , he cites "" the Moment of the Horse "" : while researching his great novel Germinal , Emile Zola went 150 feet below ground with some miners , where he saw a large work horse .
How , he asked , did they get it up and down each day ?
The miners replied that the horse came down only once , as a foal .
After a couple of years , he would go blind and when he was too old to work , he would die and be buried there .
That became , as Wolfe says , one of the supreme moments in French literature .
The financial crisis is producing some intriguing work , but no one has delivered the killer punch .
We are still waiting for our Zola moment ."
2009-10-12,"Rupert Goold has just directed Turandot for the English National Opera , but he has not exactly been thanked for his pains .
Lauded for his productions of Macbeth and Enron , he has now been bashed for his presumptuous interference with Puccini .
But , without wishing to get into a dispute with my critical colleagues , what startles me is the assumption behind some of the reviews : that this is yet another example of these pesky , tin - eared theatre directors invading the world of opera .
Admittedly , not all directors are known for their musical sensitivity .
There 's a famous , possibly apocryphal story of John Gielgud rushing on the stage in the midst of rehearsals for Don Giovanni at the Coliseum , crying "" Oh do stop that dreadful music ! ""
But if opera has enjoyed a boom in postwar Britain , it is partly because of the influx of directors ( and designers ) from the non - lyric theatre .
You have only to think of Jonathan Miller 's perennial mafioso Rigoletto and his almost equally popular 1930s Mikado , which have long been a backbone of the ENO rep .
And there are multiple examples of great work from theatre directors .
Peter Hall 's Mozart / Da Ponte trio at Glyndebourne has , according to many experts , hardly ever been bettered .
And what about Katie Mitchell 's Janáček productions for Welsh National Opera , Tim Albery 's Ring cycle up in Scotland or Peter Stein 's fantastic Falstaff down in Cardiff ?
Opera and theatre no longer exist in separate boxes ; the real truth is that many of the best directors in Britain and abroad – including Richard Jones , Luc Bondy and Robert Lepage – commute easily between the two forms .
Which brings us to Rupert Goold – who , I feel , has been excessively abused .
For a start , he is not some musical ignoramus gatecrashing the world of opera : in the past he 's done Rossini at Garsington and worked at the Batignano festival with some success .
Also , few people have asked what he is actually trying to do in his innovative Turandot .
Just as in his current Headlong production of Six Characters in Search of an Author , Goold is clearly exploring the tension between art and reality ; what you see in the opera are Calaf and Turandot finally destroying the on - stage figure of the writer as if achieving creative autonomy .
This exactly mirrors Pirandello 's play where the six "" characters "" demand that their story be told without mediation from the modern media .
Goold - watchers will also notice that Turandot pursues the director 's fixation with the link between cooking and violence .
Miriam Büther 's design sets the opera in the dining room and kitchen of a Chinese restaurant , one where severed heads are served up on silver platters .
Turandot herself is initially seen as a glacial wedding cake , and the vast burnished ovens resemble gleaming tombs .
I was reminded of Goold 's Macbeth , where Patrick Stewart buttered and sliced a ham sandwich while plotting Banquo 's death , and where the Dunsinane kitchens were a hive of activity .
Quite why food and felony are so intimately linked in the director 's imagination , I 'm not sure .
But the motif 's reappearance in Turandot is a sign that this production may be more than the piece of chaotic vandalism some critics have suggested .
I would accept that Goold 's production is over - layered with ideas .
But it captures the element of barbaric fantasy in Puccini 's opera , ingeniously addresses the problem of its incompletion and , for all its excesses , is theatrically alive .
Far from seeking Goold 's operatic banishment , I think we should be finding ways to harness his formidable energies .
Opera , just like straight theatre , thrives on imaginative direction ."
2009-10-13,"The US supreme court is to hear an appeal by the former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling , who is serving a 24-year prison sentence for his role in the spectacular collapse of the Texas - based energy trading company in 2001 .
The court 's surprise decision to review the case is a significant breakthrough for Skilling .
The justices typically only agree to hear appeals from 50 or 60 of the 10,000 people who petition them annually , and they only do so when they believe there is an issue worthy of close examination .
Skilling , 55 , was accused of fiddling investors out of billions of dollars in the run - up to the demise of Enron , which went bust in one of the biggest corporate scandals in US history .
He appealed on the grounds that a legal concept known as the "" honest services "" statute is flawed – an argument similar to that of Conrad Black , who also persuaded the supreme court to review his fraud conviction .
The court 's announcement drew an enthusiastic welcome from Skilling 's defence lawyer , Daniel Petrocelli .
"" I can not wait to get on the phone with Jeff Skilling , "" said Petrocelli .
"" We 've been waiting now for almost three years for this day .
To say we are relieved that finally a court has agreed to review these issues is understatement .
Jeff deserves a full , fair and frank hearing on these issues and it now appears that he will get it . ""
Skilling was convicted on 19 criminal counts of fraud , conspiracy , false statements and insider dealing in May 2006 alongside Enron 's former chairman , Ken Lay , who died of a heart attack while awaiting sentencing .
A jury found him guilty of presiding over an organisation riddled with accounting tricks hiding ballooning losses .
The scandal led to thousands of job losses and prompted the demise of one of the world 's biggest accountancy firms , Arthur Andersen .
During his trial , he vehemently protested that he was "" absolutely innocent "" and pledged that he would fight the charges against him "" until the day I die "" .
An appeals court in New Orleans upheld Skilling 's convictions in January , but ordered lower courts to re - visit the length of his sentence .
Skilling 's lawyers argued that the city of Houston , where Enron was based , was alive with "" venomous emotion "" and should not have been the venue for his trial .
At the heart of Skilling 's challenge is a question surrounding a contentious legal concept of "" honest services "" .
Under US law , this is the standard of probity that shareholders or the public are entitled to expect from business leaders or politicians .
Both Skilling and Black were convicted of depriving investors of these honest services , but many legal experts say the law in this area is poorly defined .
"" The lower courts have diverged on their interpretation of honest services , "" said Peter Henning , an expert in white - collar crime at Wayne State University in Michigan .
"" They 're going to use Skilling 's case and Black 's case as opportunities to put some parameters on it and give the courts some guidance on what to look for . ""
Henning said the supreme court , which will hear Skilling 's appeal next year , was unlikely to strike out the convictions altogether .
But he said Skilling stood a "" decent chance "" of a fresh trial if the judges redefine the honest services concept and ask lower courts to examine whether , under fresh guidelines , the government 's evidence proved sufficient ."
2009-10-28,"Sheila Bair was born and raised in Independence , Kansas , and , boy , do her adversaries know it .
The golden thread running through Ms Bair 's career is independence .
She was the Republican who dared to run for a house seat while supporting women 's rights on abortion , the commodity - futures regulator who tried to block the Enron - isation of the US energy market , and the financial regulator who spotted the sub - prime crisis coming .
In all these battles she ended up on the losing side – coming second in that primary , getting outvoted by her fellow commodity commissioners and being roundly ignored on sub - prime by George Bush and Alan Greenspan .
But her positions are usually motivated by a desire to serve the wider good rather than buy off some lobby group .
As head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Ms Bair has been at it again this week , telling US bank chief executives that investment firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley should not call themselves banks , nor be entitled to the state protection given to Main Street banks .
It was a characteristically bold intervention from a woman whose boldness has often got her into trouble .
US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner has reportedly tried to elbow her out of office , while Wall Street insiders have been heard to sniff that a philosophy graduate really ought to keep her nose out of economic affairs .
But if the position of treasury secretary ever fell vacant , Ms Bair would surely be the best person for the job ."
2009-11-09,"The Royal Court dominates this year 's Evening Standard theatre awards shortlist , announced today , with 11 of its productions or performers going head to head in major categories including best play , best director and best actor .
By comparison , the National Theatre , the Young Vic and the Lyric Hammersmith have earned three nominations apiece – with just one for the Donmar Warehouse .
However , it 's the tussle between the Royal Court 's productions of Enron and Jerusalem - both set for West End runs in the new year , with seven nominations in total - which will draw most of the attention .
Enron is only the second play written by 28-year - old Lucy Prebble , who scripted ITV 's Secret Diary of a Call Girl following her win at the Critics ' Circle Award for Most Promising Playwright in 2005 .
Examining the financial scandal whichengulfed the company of the title , Enron is already lined up for a Hollywood adaptation .
Prebble is up against Jerusalem writer Jez Butterworth - a previous Evening Standard award - winner in 1995 - for the title of best play , as well as Tracy Letts for August : Osage County and Simon Stephens for Punk Rock .
Lenny Henry has also drawn acclaim for his portrayal of Othello in the Northern Broadsides production at Trafalgar Studios , earning a Best Newcomer nomination for his theatre acting debut .
At the age of 51 , the comic finds himself competing against performers half his age , including 17-year - old Bel Powley , nominated for his performance in Polly Stenham 's Tusk Tusk , another of the Royal Court 's critical successes earlier this year .
Rachel Weisz , who played Blanche DuBois in the Donmar Warehouse production of A Streetcar Named Desire , competes in the best actress category against Juliet Stevenson , for her role as a concert violinist in Duet For One .
Also battling for the title - now renamed in honour of the late Natasha Richardson , who died last year - are Deanna Dunagan for her fiery matriarch in August :
Osage County and Penny Downie in Helen at the Shakespeare 's Globe .
Ken Stott , nominated for his role in A View From The Bridge , takes on three - time Evening Standard winner Simon Russell Beale , Mark Rylance and Samuel West in the fight for top honours in the best actor category .
Commenting on this year 's shortlist , the Evening Standard 's theatre critic Henry Hitchings – who sits on the judging panel with the Observer 's Susannah Clapp , the International Herald Tribune 's Matt Wolf , the Mail on Sunday 's Georgina Brown and the Daily Telegraph 's Charles Spencer – singled out the vibrancy of playwriting .
"" What is striking about new plays "" he said , "" is how they are engaging with urgent , contemporary issues , such as climate change and the financial crisis and social inclusion and race , but still work well as drama .
They 're not po - faced . ""
Winners will be announced at an awards ceremony hosted by Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young at the Royal Opera House on Monday 23 November .

2009-12-13,"It was a year brimful of new writing and young talent .
Jez Butterworth 's gorgeous Jerusalem – a play for a new Glastonbury generation – was given a superb production by Ian Rickson , with Mark Rylance , that most chameleon of actors , towering as a lord of misrule .
In Enron , Lucy Prebble produced one of the most incisive political dramas of the decade .
Rupert Goold directed it with dazzle , like a hi - tech danse macabre ; among raptor puppets and neon , Samuel West turned memorably from smoothie chops to shambles .
Both productions , bound for the West End , were staged at the Royal Court ( although Enron was first seen at buoyant Chichester ) .
That was symptomatic .
Dominic Cooke 's theatre flew sky - high on the wings of new plays .
The constantly reconfigured stage upstairs was ignited by Mike Bartlett 's Cock , Alia Bano 's Shades and by Polly Stenham 's sharp - toothed Tusk Tusk which was performed by a startlingly youthful cast – for most of the evening , no one on stage was over 18 .
In fact , 2009 was a year in which a new generation of gifted actors declared itself .
Simon Stephens 's Punk Rock –
Sean Holmes 's first show as artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith – featured the outstanding Tom Sturridge as a schoolboy slowly rumpling into murderous madness .
At the Young Vic , Che Walker and Arthur Darvill 's Been
So Long was galvanised by the tremendous Naana Agyei - Ampadu .
In the National 's Phèdre , Ruth Negga glowed –
she seemed scarcely to perform but simply to transmit .
Also at the National , Michelle Terry morphed wonderfully through multiple guises in Richard Bean 's exhilarating England People
Very Nice , which parodied prejudice in strip - cartoon style and got people 's danders up .
In this year of striking dialogue ( lots of that in Alan Bennett 's The Habit of Art ) , site - specific work was less evident .
Nevertheless , Punchdrunk took over a tunnel in Waterloo , and in Manchester combined with Damon Albarn and Adam Curtis ; for Cardboard Citizens ' Mincemeat , Mamoru Iriguchi brilliantly remade the Shoreditch Cordy House into a bomb site , a refuge and the chilliest of morgues .
The West of England became an essential theatrical destination .
Bristol Old Vic was galvanised by Andrew Hilton 's angry Tobacco Factory production of Uncle Vanya , while the Drum in Plymouth was shaken to the rafters by Carl Grose 's Grand Guignol .
In Liverpool , Roger McGough 's The Hypochondriac was most efficacious in every way .

2009-12-24,"Things to celebrate : That under the stewardship of Dick Penny and with the help of Theatre Bristol , Bristol Old Vic is back on the road ; The Royal Court 's great year that included Enron and Jerusalem as well as The Author , Cock and Caryl Churchill 's Seven Jewish Children ; Sean Holmes putting his mark on the Lyric with Simon Stephens 's Punk Rock ; Punchdrunk reinventing themselves with Tunnel 228 and
It Felt Like a Kiss ; a brilliant Edinburgh Fringe with astonishing shows such as Nic Green 's immense Trilogy ( at BAC , the Barbican and Nuffield Lancaster in January ) .
The most inspirational : The Barbican 's continued and inspiring BITE seasons included the mighty Roman Tragedies , one of the best shows of the year and one that I 'd predict will be hugely influential on practice here .
The shows that made me cry : For the Best , Mark Storrer 's extraordinary examination of living with illness and death at the Unicorn .
For me , it was the best show of year by far – and one largely ignored because it was for children .
Also right up there was Love Letters
Straight From Your Heart from Uninvited Guests , a piece of participatory performance which is going out on tour next year .
Best surprises : That Propeller 's Merchant of Venice set in a male prison really worked ; Eastern Angles 's Return to Akenfield ; Matthew Kelly turning into a genuinely superb actor and Australian circus company Circa .
People and companies to watch :
Action Hero who proved themselves with A Western and Watch Me Fall ; Coney , agents of adventure who made Small Town
Anywhere ; Alex Fleetwood and Hide and Seek , Kings of England whose Where We Live and What We Live
For is a delight , Lundah and Seitl whose Rotating in a Room of Images was a hit at BAC 's Burst , Nick Payne 's
If There Is
I Have n't Found It
Yet was brilliant at the Bush , Vanishing Point 's Matthew Lenton , Filter ( doing Three Sisters at the Lyric ) , fledging outfits such as Belt Up and The River People , and the rise of companies such as The Miniaturists and Nabakov , who may well change the way new writing is produced .
What I want for Christmas : For whichever government is in power after the next election , to understand that every penny put into theatre is an investment that pays dividends that are about much more than just money ."
2010-01-01,"From John Osborne with Look Back in Anger to Hanif Kureishi 's My Beautiful Laundrette , young British playwrights often start off by writing about what they know ; certainly , careers in drama are not usually made by tackling Texan energy firms ( honourable exception made for one 80s saga about the Ewings of Dallas ) .
So Surrey - born Lucy Prebble took a risk writing about the woes of Enron , the conglomerate that was in everything from natural gas to broadband – until it came crashing out of everything in financial ruin in 2001 .
This was a subject that took two years of research , starting in the archives of the Houston Chronicle .
From dusty beginnings , Prebble has constructed perhaps the best new play of 2009 – one that has transferred from the Minerva in Chichester to the Royal Court and is now playing in the West End .
It is a drama about globalisation ; a musical about bankruptcy .
Most of all , it is a feat of imagination : off - balance - sheet vehicles turn into dinosaurs that take over the basement of the headquarters ; the Lehman Brothers show up as two brothers crammed into one giant suit .
In the course of all this , the audience gets the kind of insight into the workings of modern business that any number of set - piece interviews and TV documentaries have struggled to provide .
All this is an impressive achievement for any 28-year - old dramatist ; but it is the fearlessness with which Prebble has tackled a complex and technical subject that particularly stands out .
One to watch in 2010 ."
2010-01-27,"In recent years , the stock of director Rupert Goold , the closest thing British theatre has to its own PT Barnum , has risen so high that he is regularly mentioned as a future artistic director of the National Theatre .
The bubble shows no sign of bursting with his West End transfer of Lucy Prebble 's all - singing , all - dancing morality play about the collapse of Enron , the energy company – a piece so confident it 's astonishing that it is only her second play .
Audiences that put their money into this ticket are guaranteed a return on a show that is exuberantly staged as a cross between a vaudevillian nightmare and roistering Jacobean City comedy .
Of course , it was that elusive "" sure thing "" that investors – ever gullible in their pursuit of a quick buck – thought they were onto when they put their money into Enron , the Texas energy giant which was America 's seventh biggest corporation before it collapsed in 2001 , costing 20,000 people their jobs and many more their life savings .
Under the leadership of company president Jeffrey Skilling ( played by Sam West , who is remarkable in what is a remarkable cast ) , Enron changed from a company selling something real – gas – to one selling hot air and dreams .
Like Goold 's playful , glossy production , which offers up the Lehmann Brothers bank as a Siamese twin double act , and the company auditors , Arthur Anderson , as a ventriloquist 's dummy , Enron was a box of tricks : an illusion created from smoke and mirrors that in effect hid its debts in the basement , portrayed as a shadowy place where raptors prowl , devouring dollar bills .
But whereas too much illusion may be bad for the bottom line , it 's a very good thing in theatre ; and while , in other circumstances , you might argue that the overlay of visual tricks and video amount to show - off distractions , in this show they are put to terrific use to create the dizzying and seductive spectacle of capitalism itself .
Accountancy does not , as a rule , lend itself to gripping theatre , but in Anthony Ward 's design the figures flash before our eyes in mesmerising digital displays that , together with the choreographed ballets of traders , capture the giddy euphoria of the markets .
The audience does n't have to do the maths because Prebble has done it for us , bringing clarity to a complex story , and cleverly blurring the line between fact and fiction to considerable dramatic effect ."
2010-01-31,"Directors keep wanting to rough Chekhov up .
They are right .
For too long his plays have been performed in England as if they were produced in some down - on - its - luck prep school : full of lethargy , uniforms and crumbling arrangements .
You half expect the sharp report which rings out at the end of Three Sisters to turn out to be , not a killing shot , but the thwack of leather on willow .
Sean Holmes and the theatre company Filter 's desire to shake things up is welcome .
Still , for much of the time , the wish to disconcert is more evident than actual disruption .
John Lightbody boldly plays the lover Vershinin as a flashy interloper ; Paul Woodson is a persuasive irritable shambles as the disappointing brother ( as Branwell to the Brontës , so is Andrei to his sister ) but the three sisters , though all nimbly , sympathetically acted , are intermittently underpowered ; the evening crackles with unachieved possibilities .
The action is set in a dusky rehearsal space , with bits of apparatus on display .
Romola Garai 's neurasthenic Masha languishes in a pale suit and fedora , like a turn - of - the - last - century lesbian ; Poppy Miller 's jumpy Olga bustles in a long skirt ; Clare Dunne 's Irina is in a lace mini ; as the old nanny , Sandra Voe is got up as a traditional dumpling in a headscarf .
This mixture does n't seem to carry much weight – other than mildly ruffling expectations .
What 's more unnerving in a play fuelled by shared memories is that Irina seems to come from a different place from her sibs : she has an Irish accent ; the others do n't .
A sound technician is onstage throughout .
Filter 's use of a soundtrack is one of their signatures as a company .
That 's good for the stage , where sound is mostly underused , and in particular good for Chekhov , who has been described as "" writing a score for boredom "" .
More than any other playwright of the last hundred years , he was fascinated by what sound could suggest .
There were the particular noises he wanted to create : in Three Sisters the humming top , and the song the lovers use as their private code .
There were also the noises he objected to : the neighings , croakings , mooings and bleatings which Stanislavski sought to impose on his Moscow Art productions .
Filter 's gritty eruptions – miked - up intimacies , amplified whispers coming from the wings , and a mysterious grinding rumble – are n't contrary to the Chekhov project : neither are they always illuminating .
Loosely tethered to the play , like a free - floating cloud of anxiety , they are characteristic of a production which flickers without fully taking fire .
Nic Green advertised for them in advance : women who would take off all their clothes , get up on the stage and sing "" Jerusalem "" in the buff at the Barbican .
Halfway through her show , she called for more women to do the same .
And the women did .
It was like watching some undiscovered chapter of the Apocrypha , to see them first trickling then streaming , sometimes running , down the aisles , and later stripped on stage : hundreds of them , waving and jumping naked in a pink light , beaming as they belted out the hymn adopted by the suffragettes .
Trilogy wears its heart on its exposed wrist .
It 's a feminist plea , a plan for action , a dancing demand : its varied parts are strewn around , like a do - it - yourself kit .
Footage from DA Pennebaker 's film of the incendiary 1971 debate between Norman Mailer and ( particularly ) Germaine Greer at the New York town hall is re - run , while Green and her co - celebrants ( one of them a man : feminism works for them , too ) perform an oddly worshipful dance .
A pointed comic episode advises the audience to seek out monuments in female shape ( not very numerous , those ) or customise a man statue with earrings and scarfs : "" I come from Scotland , where all the statues are of men .
"" There are some skimpy arguments , and some old ones ( sad that these are still needed ) , and some moments when instead of just expressing themselves , the performers tell the audience that they 're expressing themselves .
The mass naked sequences are extraordinary : at first you can hardly believe you 're seeing all that exposed pink skin ( there 's not much black or brown ) in the beige of the Barbican ; two minutes later the nudity has ceased to be remarkable .
These are the most urgent and the swiftest parts of the evening : they go by in , well , a flash .
Set in Palestine in 1948 , as the British mandate is ending , I am Yusuf and This is My Brother comes to London after premiering at Haifa and touring to villages and refugee camps in Galilee and the West Bank .
Amir Nizar Zuabi 's play is a thwarted love story and a tale of displacement .
For an English - speaking audience , the precise significance of a convoluted plot is muffled , as the performers flick in and out of Arabic .
Still , single images transmit a pageant of grief .
Jon Bausor 's design uses swathes of sacking to suggest both a rolling ochre - coloured landscape , and a refugee future .
A line of veiled women with earthenware pitchers tilted on their shoulders appear from time to time silently at the back of the stage , like an enduring reproach .
A dispossessed man arrives walking away from his home carrying an enormous uprooted tree on his back : he ca n't bear to see the occupiers sitting under the branches he 's cultivated .
He looks like Atlas .
Enron has arrived in the West End .
Lucy Prebble 's play is one of the most grown - up political dramas of the last decade .
The raptor puppets , the fluorescent dazzle , the great Mammon danse macabre of Rupert Goold 's production put flesh on the ideas , make the virtual look real , give life to the illusions of finance .
Last year saw a string of unmissable plays .
This is one of them ."
2010-02-09,"I 've no wish to be a party pooper
and I 'm delighted by the strong showing of two excellent theatres in the nominations for the annual Olivier awards , which recognise the best of London 's theatrical talent : 15 for the Royal Court and 10 for the Donmar Warehouse .
But , before we get carried away , it 's important to nail a few prevailing myths .
The first is that , because Lucy Prebble 's Enron and Jez Butterworth 's Jerusalem have transferred to the West End , we are witnessing a golden age for new writing .
The fact is that there only four new plays running in the West End , if you include Martin Crimp 's updated Misanthrope and Nick Stafford 's War Horse .
Against that , there are 22 musicals , which account for three quarters of the West End 's booming box - office .
Even more dismaying is that the bulk of the musicals are golden oldies , Broadway imports or songfests : only Lloyd Webber 's upcoming Love Never Dies and the well - established Billy Elliott represent new British work .
Delighted though I am by the commercial success of Enron and Jerusalem , two swallows do n't make a theatrical summer .
Of course , there is much good writing elsewhere , at places like the Tricycle , the Soho and the Bush : that 's where , in 2009 , we saw plays about Afghanistan , the financial crisis and ­global warming .
Exactly the kind of work that gets overlooked at awards time .
But today we seem astonished by the abundance of new writing where once we assumed it to be the backbone of British theatre .
1971 saw the premieres of Pinter 's Old Times , Edward Bond 's Lear , Simon Gray 's Butley , David Storey 's The Changing Room , Peter Nichols 's Forget - Me - Not - Lane and Trevor Griffiths 's Occupations ; and that was regarded as a pretty average year .
But another myth that needs ­puncturing is that the Royal Court has been magically transformed by Dominic Cooke .
I have great regard for Cooke 's enterprise and nous .
But Enron was largely the result of a ­commission from Rupert Goold 's Headlong , and ­Jerusalem was the product of the ­careful nurturing of Jez Butterworth by Cooke 's ­predecessor , Ian Rickson .
I was ­astonished
, in fact , to read that before the advent of Cooke , the Royal Court was "" pilloried as a place for cultural tourism where audiences alleviated their middle class guilt "" .
This is a savage rewrite of history that ignores the work done by Max Stafford - Clark , Stephen Daldry and Rickson himself .
It was Daldry who , in the mid-1990s , gave us an amazing season of new plays by Sarah Kane , Mark Ravenhill , Joe Penhall and Martin McDonagh .
And Rickson , during his tenure from 1998 to 2006 , balanced work from old Royal Court hands , such as Churchill and Hare , with new plays from Roy Williams , Laura Wade , Conor McPherson , Richard Bean and the admirable Butterworth .
Rickson also produced Tom Stoppard 's theatre - filling Rock'n'Roll , and directed Pinter in Krapp 's Last Tape and a Seagull that moved triumphantly to Broadway .
Hardly a record to be pilloried .
Mention of The Seagull reminds me of yet another myth currently gaining credence : that English Chekhov productions are full of swooning nostalgia for our own lost rural past .
This is rubbish , and I could cite a score of productions from Olivier 's Uncle Vanya to Michael Blakemore 's Three Sisters and Rickson 's Seagull that balanced rueful comedy and tragic despair , and highlighted Chekhov 's insistence on the need to endure .
So , while I 'm happy to celebrate British theatre 's achievements , I think we should recognise that there is much to be done .
We need to ensure the continued health of new writing by emphasising that it invariably comes from ­subsidised sources .
Rather than talking of golden ages , we should all be asking the ­political parties one key question : what do they propose to do about the arts ?"
2010-02-19,"Yes , here in New York we expect the English to give us world - class Shakespeare .
But could you keep your hands off our new American plays ?
I mean the ones we forgot to write ?
Or produce ?
Or revive ?
In early April , previews start for the Broadway run of Enron , writer Lucy Prebble and director Rupert Goold 's apparently brilliant anatomy of our nation 's biggest corporate scandal .
But the excitement over this transfer from the West End is mitigated by shame that no one here had thought of it first .
Like the astonishing production of Black Watch from the National Theatre of Scotland a few seasons back , Enron serves to remind us that American artistic directors are shockingly unimaginative .
They ought to dangle commission money in front of hungry playwrights in return for a smart , timely drama .
Instead , they programme whatever inoffensive living - room pap they think subscribers want to see .
But it gets worse : English writers are taking our off - Broadway slots , too .
Lucinda Coxon 's Happy
Now ?
just extended at Primary Stages .
Alexi Kaye Campbell 's The Pride is earning kudos for MCC Theatre .
And , in late April , your wunderkind Polly Stenham makes her US debut when That Face opens at Manhattan Theatre Club .
Although Andrew Bovell is Australian , not English , his family drama When the Rain Stops Falling is in previews at Lincoln Centre Theatre .
Has there been a drought of new American drama ?
No one wants to sound like a rabid protectionist , and it 's vital to see what the rest of the theatre world is doing , but , as the survey Outrageous Fortune documents , it 's hard out there for American playwrights ; they can barely eke out a living , much less expect high - profile productions .
To be fair , the production of new plays swings both ways , and your English scribes have cause to complain for lost gigs .
London theatres often showcase American writers before we do .
At the National Theatre next autumn , JT Rogers will have a world premiere , and Katori Hall 's The Mountaintop is slated for Broadway after a run at London 's Theatre 503 .
Londoners know about hot new American playwrights before we do .
Or they honour our great and living ones , as the Royal Court did last year with its unofficial Wallace Shawn festival .
Perhaps this season of Brits invading off Broadway is a fluke , and a year from now our non - profit companies will go back to American plays of the dysfunctional - family and identity - politics variety .
Then we 'll all sigh and say that English drama is sharper and more relevant , and hope we can afford to fly to London to see what 's on at the National or the Royal Court .
And after that , we 'll trudge over to the Park Avenue Armory and see Shakespeare "" done right "" – thanks to generous American donors ."

2010-03-02,"A groundswell of local hatred towards Enron meant the corrupt energy trading company 's boss , Jeffrey Skilling , had an unfair trial in Houston , the US supreme court heard yesterday , in a last - ditch appeal by the former tycoon to overturn a 24-year jail sentence for fraud , conspiracy and insider trading .
During a 30-minute hearing in Washington , defence lawyers said the "" degree of passion and prejudice in the community "" meant a judge ought to have moved Skilling 's trial away from Enron 's home city , just as the trial for the Oklahoma City bomber , Timothy McVeigh , was moved to Denver in 1997 .
Skilling , 56 , was chief executive of Enron until shortly before the firm collapsed into bankruptcy nine years ago .
The demise of Enron , once America 's seventh largest company , was blamed by US authorities on deceitful accounting that hid losses in obscure off - balance sheet entities .
The demise of the company , nicknamed the "" crooked E "" , caused 21,000 job losses and left thousands of people in the Houston area devoid of pensions and savings .
Lawyers for Skilling , who is serving his sentence at a minimum security jail in Colorado , filed a written brief claiming that Enron 's bosses were compared in various media attacks to "" Al Qaida , Hitler , Satan , child molesters , rapists , embezzlers and terrorists "" .
A column in the Houston Chronicle newspaper was entitled "" Your tars and feathers ready ?
Mine are . ""
The chairman of Enron , Ken Lay , died before his sentencing , leaving Skilling as the leading company executive convicted .
Events at Enron , where non - executive directors included Conservative peer Lord Wakeham , have now been turned into a West End play and Enron has become a byword for corporate misbehaviour .
In addition to claiming that Skilling 's trial should have been relocated , his lawyers have adopted the same supreme court argument used by jailed newspaper magnate Conrad Black .
Both maintain that their convictions depend on a so - called "" honest services "" fraud law that is worded unconstitutionally vaguely .
The supreme court 's nine judges questioned Skilling 's lawyers closely .
Sonia Sotomayor , who was recently appointed to the bench by Barack Obama , picked up on the defence 's point that the trial judge spent just five hours screening trial jurors for prejudice – compared to days on end for certain other US trials .
She asked : "" How can we be satisfied that a fair and impartial jury has been picked ? ""
A so - called "" honest services "" statute used to convict many white - collar criminals is under scrutiny because many experts feel it has been stretched too far .
Conceived to capture political corruption , it is now widely used to snare business leaders even if , critics say , they are not acting for personal gain .
The supreme court is expected to rule by June .
If the judges decide that fraud laws need redrawing , Skilling and Black could receive fresh trials ."
2010-03-15,"No one who has seen Lucy Prebble 's play about the collapse of Enron can forget the velociraptors .
These menacing , red - eyed dinosaurs are used to represent the company 's unique contribution to the financial hall of shame : accounting monsters created to gobble up debt and hide it from shareholders with a brazenness they could never imagine .
But the so - called "" special purpose entities "" ( named Raptors 1 to 4 by Enron finance director Andrew Fastow ) were perhaps not so unusual , after all .
When the time comes to stage our most recent financial drama , theatre directors might want to take a closer look at the beasts that Lehman Brothers kept chained in the shadows .
A 2,200-page legal report into the bank 's demise revealed last week a similar addiction to accounting hallucinogens .
Until now , the big mystery was how the Wall Street giant could have been reporting healthy profits right up until the moment it keeled over and died – bringing most of the west 's economies down with it .
But the latest investigation reveals financial transactions known as Repo 105 and Repo 108 , used to temporarily remove tens of billions of dollars of debt from the bank 's balance sheet at the end of every accounting period .
As the banking crisis grew , so did Lehman 's addiction to such trickery and the harder it became to come clean .
Executives even referred to Repo 105 as "" another drug we 're on "" in emails uncovered by the report .
Rather than Fastow , it is Lehman 's telegenic young finance director and front woman Erin Callan who is likely to end up in the starring role in any theatrical battle of the Repos .
Callan is already subject of a forthcoming book on Lehman called The Devil 's Casino , by Vanity Fair journalist Vicky Ward , which also highlights the bizarre rituals forced upon wives of Lehman bankers .
The capacity for Lehman to continue to shock after a year of books and revelations is itself a shock .
But the greatest surprise is how little has changed since Enron and the scams of the last financial bubble .
Regulators like to caution against simply addressing the specific causes of past scandals when trying to prevent future ones , but it is as if all the Wall Street rules introduced to clean up accounting have only encouraged finance directors to study the history books more closely for inspiration .
Perhaps when Prebble 's play moves to Broadway next month , she can simply swap Lehman for Enron ."
2010-03-16,"Sherron Watkins : Enron Sherron Watkins , a vice - president at the energy trading company ,
sent a six - page email to top management in 2001 warning of risky financial practices , containing the infamous line : "" I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals .
"" Her concerns were largely dismissed by Enron 's independent directors but she kept her job .
After Enron went bust , she wrote a book about her experience , became one of Time magazine 's people of the year and set up a consultancy advising companies on ethics .

2010-03-21,"It was like the Cheltenham Gold Cup all over again .
The best new play award at the Oliviers was assumed to be a two - horse race between Jerusalem and Enron .
Instead , a little - fancied outsider , Katori Hall 's The Mountaintop , upset the form - book and made pundits look foolish .
The award is not only a significant boost for black playwrights and small theatres , since The Mountaintop started its life at Battersea 's Theatre503 before moving to the West End .
It also gives new life to the whole awards circus , which has become monstrously repetitive and wearisomely predictable .
Each year the pattern is the same .
A select handful of plays and performances get honoured at the Evening Standard , Critics ' Circle , South Bank Show , Whatsonstage and Olivier awards .
By now you feel Mark Rylance , Rachel Weisz and Rupert Goold must be running out of acceptance speeches for , respectively , their performances in Jerusalem and A Streetcar Named Desire and the direction of Enron .
I would n't deny them their awards but what gets lost in our consensus culture is any recognition of the offbeat or unusual .
It saddens me that there has been so little acknowledgment of the National 's brilliant production of Burnt By The Sun , though Mark Henderson did pick up an Olivier award for best lighting , of Penny Downie 's blazing performance in Euripides 's Helen at Shakespeare 's Globe or of Richard Jones 's radical new take on Annie Get Your Gun at the Young Vic .
On the subject of musicals , it says a lot about the poverty of the form that the top Olivier award went to Spring Awakening , which covered Wedekind 's shocking 1891 play in a thick layer of feelgood sentimentality .
But at least we can cheer the fact that a 28-year - old black American playwright scooped the best new play prize with The Mountaintop .
That one gong has given a much - needed blood transfusion to the increasingly anaemic ritual of theatrical award ceremonies ."
2010-03-22,"It was meant to be the glittering awards night where Jerusalem went up against Enron .
But they were both pipped by a play from a young , black female writer which had its world premiere on a tiny pub stage in south London .
Katori Hall 's The Mountaintop was the surprise winner of best new play when this year 's Laurence Olivier awards were handed out tonight .
Hall , from Memphis , Tennessee , was inspired to write her play – an imagined account of Martin Luther King 's last evening before his 1968 assassination – by a family story about her mother .
It was spotted by James Dacre , son of Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre , who directed its world premiere at the 65-seat Theatre503 , above a pub in Battersea .
From there it was championed by producer Sonia Friedman , who took it to the West End , where it won glowing reviews and nightly standing ovations .
Now Broadway beckons for Hall , who is still only 28 .
Nica Burns , president of the Society of London Theatres , predicted an even brighter future for the playwright with an Olivier under her belt .
"" It is a wonderful fairy story and the award is going to a very talented and deserving winner . ""
Last night Hall , who was presented with her award by Jude Law , thanked Dacre for taking the play on .
She said : "" This was a story about a person that crosses lines of colour , class , countries and continents and I want to thank the London audience for teaching me that this is a story that needs to be heard about the world . ""
Elsewhere , it was a bad Olivier night for Shakespeare , the National Theatre and the English National Opera , but a good one for Tennessee Williams , the Royal Opera and the Royal Court theatre .
The last , led by Dominic Cooke , had the most to smile about after tonight 's black - tie do at the Grosvenor House hotel in London , having a hand in many of the successful productions .
Jez Butterworth 's Jerusalem began life there and it won two awards : best actor for Mark Rylance and best set design for Ultz .
It was Rylance 's second Olivier , winning from a strong shortlist that included Jude Law , James Earl Jones and Sam West .
Rylance paid tribute to Olivier and his widow , Dame Joan Plowright , who was in the audience .
"" All this competition is great , but the name Olivier to me is a sense of family and a sense of fun .
That 's what it will always mean to me , "" he said .
Enron , meanwhile – a Royal Court and Chichester co - production written by Lucy Prebble – won Rupert Goold the best director award .
The Royal Court 's success continued when Michael Wynne 's The Priory won best new comedy and , finally , it won the outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre award for the play Cock .
It was not a bad year either for the Donmar Warehouse .
Its production of A Streetcar Named Desire won two acting awards : Rachel Weisz picked up best actress for her stunning Blanche DuBois and Ruth Wilson won best supporting actress for her portrayal of Stella .
Further success for the small Covent Garden theatre came when rising star Eddie Redmayne won best supporting actor for his portrayal of Mark Rothko 's put - upon assistant in Red .
Accepting her award Weisz said : "" This means an awful lot .
I never thought I would be honoured like this in my lifetime .
I 'm in such strong company .
"" Williams 's Cat On a Hot Tin Roof , with its all - black cast , won best revival , beating strong competition that included The Misanthrope and A View From the Bridge .
In the musical categories the most striking winner was a production that was adored by critics , but failed to get audiences to come and see it .
Spring Awakening , an entertaining teenage sexual angst romp , won best new musical , beating musicals which the public , conversely , go to see in their droves : Priscilla and Sister Act .
Two of its young stars also won acting awards in shortlists that included such famous names as Rowan Atkinson , Sheila Hancock and Maureen Lipman .
Aneurin Barnard won best actor in a musical and Iwan Rheon won best supporting actor / actress .
The Open Air Theatre in Regent 's Park won best musical revival for Hello Dolly !
beating A Little Night Music ,
Annie Get Your Gun and Oliver !
Dolly herself , in the shape of Samantha Spiro , won best musical actress .
A new audience award for most popular show , voted for by members of the public , went to Wicked , from a list that also included Billy Elliot , The Phantom of the Opera , War Horse and We Will Rock You .
The Royal Opera 's Tristan und Isolde took both opera awards : best new production and outstanding achievement for the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme .
The best new dance award also went to a Covent Garden commission , a collaboration between choreographer Kim Brandstrup and Royal Ballet principal Tamara Rojo .
The Rambert Dance Company won the outstanding achievement award for its strong year .
A special award , equivalent to a lifetime achievement award , went to theatrical royalty – Dame Maggie Smith – while the theatre producer Michael Codron also won an outstanding achievement award for his 60 influential years in the business .
The awards , now in their 34th year , are decided by panels .
The theatre panel , for example , which saw 87 shows , is made up of five professionals and four members of the public .
And they come after the strongest West End year ever , with box office receipts topping more than half a billion pounds for the first time . ""

2010-03-22,"Katori Hall 's surprise win at the Oliviers last night is a big moment for black theatre .
Set in civil rights - era black America , the 28-year - old 's play
The Mountaintop beat heavy - hitters Enron and Jerusalem to the best new play award .
The playwright 's victory should , as Michael Billington says , provide "" a significant boost to black playwrights "" – and open the doors a little wider for those trying to sustain a career in theatre .
Although Hall was born in Memphis , her play was made in the UK , starting its life at Theatre503 in Battersea , south London .
But how healthy is black theatre in Britain ?
From one perspective , fighting fit .
In the past year , theatres such as the Tricycle , Birmingam Rep , Contact and Royal Court have managed to engage racially diverse audiences with work by non - white theatremakers .
Tricycle 's near sold - out seasons , The Great Game and Not Black and White , were two of the year 's biggest theatrical success stories , both as resonant as they were timely .
Yet there are still underlying complaints .
Amazingly , there 's still a persistent belief that black and Asian theatre is for minority audiences only , that if a play features a black cast or an Asian story , it ca n't be accepted as drama with potentially universal themes and ideas .
At a public debate on the future of arts funding a couple of weeks ago , I was asked by a former colleague whether I thought developing new audiences was really the answer to the industry 's future .
After all , he suggested , the audience is so limited that the cost of investing in black and Asian theatre is greater than anything it could deliver financially .
There 's also the perennial question of whether black theatre in Britain is ambitious enough .
Last month Lindsay Johns in the Evening Standard accused the Royal Court of pandering to stereotypes with its production of Bola Ogbaje 's Off the Endz .
That this is a smart play as much about class and social aspiration as it is about criminality is an aside :
Johns ( somehow inevitably ) had n't even seen the play , but still believed it perpetuated the myth that the majority of black people in British society are an underclass .
It 's an issue to which black theatremakers themselves are sensitive .
On BBC London radio , Patricia Cumper , artistic director of Talawa theatre , asked for sensationalist rhetoric to be withdrawn , as it undermined a serious point : that from her point of view , black theatremakers and playwrights are cornered by literary managers , dramaturgs and development programmes .
"" There is interest in black plays "" , she later told me , "" but only if you 're writing a certain kind , about a certain section of black society "" .
As the playwright Lynn Nottage said to me last week , "" the deprivation narrative "" – the rags to riches story , in which the downtrodden poor battle against the odds – has strong currency in theatre .
Being boxed within such narrow parameters is a well - established complaint among black theatre practitioners , and one it 's all to easy to understand .
But there are two responses to this .
The first is that black theatre in the UK is much more diverse than its critcs give it credit for .
Work like Michael Bhim 's The Golden Hour or Rikki Beadle Blair 's Family Man have nothing to do with the guns ' n ' drugs cliches worrying commentators such as Bonnie Greer and Quentin Letts .
More than that , it 's all too often forgotten that there is a tremendous wealth of black British writing , beyond the siginificant achievements of Kwame Kwei Armah and Roy Williams , that is multifaceted and engaging .
Secondly , surely we 're beyond the point where a single play or playwright is expected to represent a whole milieu ?
JB Priestley , Eugene O'Neill and Edward Albee were able to depict drunken , adulterous families without being accused of painting white society in a negative light .
The work of black theatremakers such as Hall must be allowed to exist on its own terms .
Let 's give them a break – and with it the chance to emulate her success ."
2010-03-31,"Will Enron repeat its success on Broadway ?
That 's the four - million - dollar question - the extravagant cost of the production - making the rounds as director Rupert Goold prepares for the start of New York performances for his London hit on 8 April , this time with a fully American cast .
One wonders whether theatrical lightning will strike twice for a play whose West End run has now been extended until August –
more than a year after Lucy Prebble 's play with music was first seen at the Minerva theatre in Chichester .
Since then , Enron sold out its initial London engagement at the Royal Court , transferred for its ongoing commercial run , and figured strongly in the recent spate of theatre awards , with Goold winning the best director prize at every turn .
That said , some critics have admitted privately that they found the evening less compelling the second time round , and it 's instructive that Prebble 's second - ever play has lost out as the year 's best twice – to Jez Butterworth 's Jerusalem and last week to US writer Katori Hall for The Mountaintop .
On Broadway , expectations surrounding the British treatment of so specifically an American story will be a crucial issue .
The dramatist George S Kaufman famously remarked with regard to New York theatrical tastes that "" satire is what closes on Saturday night "" , which does n't bode well for the tone of a piece that could also be ( mis)interpreted as mockery : the Brits having a go at hapless Americans and their hopeless financial ecosystem .
Consider , for starters , the use of the Star - Spangled Banner ( the American national anthem ) to open the play – a beginning that reportedly alarmed some of the play 's investors .
And I know plenty of savvy Americans who were n't at all pleased with Enron 's brief recreation of 9/11 : seeing that on stage in London is one thing , but altogether something else in the city where 9/11 occurred .
There is also the potential element of fatigue , at least among the critics , at the usual raft of shows brought over from London , which in addition to Enron this year includes starry versions of the Menier Chocolate Factory 's A Little Night Music , La Cage aux Folles and , opening this Thursday , the Donmar Warehouse production of Red .
More often than not , these shows transfer to New York already bearing the imprimatur of the New York Times 's chief drama critic , Ben Brantley .
But Brantley saw the West End
Enron weeks ago and has not written about it
, so his take on the piece remains unknown .
A good cast headed by Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz and , in a departure from her usual musical theatre terrain , the clarion - voiced Marin Mazzie will be working on the show 's behalf .
But neither of those performers is a big name in a Broadway season that has so far featured Jude Law , Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman .
The prevailing assumption in the industry is that Enron has to work on Broadway on the strength of buzz and critical acclaim alone .
And if not ?
Look at it this way : whatever happens to Enron , the play ca n't be half as grievous as the tale of Enron itself ."
2010-04-29,"You know the cliche about domestic disputes ?
A man beats his wife , the neighbours call the police , a cop knocks at the door and the victim screams : shove off , none of your business .
Sometimes I feel that way about English playwrights who tackle touchy American subjects .
It 's our dirty laundry ; we 'll get around to cleaning it .
Someday .
Yes , we have much atone for .
We 're obese and xenophobic and we 're poisoning the environment .
Does n't mean you lot have the right to dramatise it .
Then along comes Enron , the ingenious and unexpectedly sympathetic docudrama written by Lucy Prebble and directed by Rupert Goold .
In February , I lamented the fact that no American had thought of this first .
After having seen and thoroughly enjoyed Enron 's Broadway incarnation , I 'm doubly jealous .
Not everyone feels the same .
According to the useful review aggregator StageGrade , New York critics gave Enron a median grade of B , which includes an outright slam from Ben Brantley of the New York Times .
Given the disproportionate influence the Times wields in this town , this could mean Goold 's production will not earn back its $ 4 m capitalisation and close in a few weeks if the box office does n't pick up .
Given the hype that preceded Enron , the turn of events is surprising .
But then , it should shock no one that British critics raved about the show , which uses expressionistic staging to chronicle the rise and fall of the Texas energy - trading giant .
Of course you guys loved it ; a bunch of amoral capitalists in Bush 's home state bilk shareholders of billions .
The house of cards comes crashing down in the shadow of September 11 and the whole mess presages the shady fiscal practices of the subprime bubble that nearly tanked the world economy .
And what was our Securities and Exchange Commission doing about it ?
Wanking to ladyboy porn .
Despite Enron 's relevance , its intelligence and its technical bravura , about half the Broadway critics found it either too obvious or too contrived .
Brantley barely stifled his yawn over what he dismissed as lack of substance . ""
[ T]his British - born exploration of smoke - and - mirror financial practices is n't much more than smoke and mirrors itself , "" he sniffed , rather too glibly .
Truthfully , Enron is , in style and content , starkly original by Broadway standards .
The use of found text and video , the choreographing of stock - trader gestures to form a dance , the ambitious interweaving of psychological and sociological analysis to create a penetrating critique of a moment in history – all this is sadly rare on the Great White Way .
As for lack of substance , the play offers a sweeping analysis of how all progress in human history has taken the form of an economic bubble : slavery , the railroad , the internet .
That 's not shallow .
I do n't think critics were mixed on Enron because they perceived anything anti - American in its depiction of stock - market hucksters Jeffrey Skilling , Andy Fastow and others .
I think it 's more a case of critics who have n't the aesthetic sophistication to process postmodern dramaturgy or ideological ambiguity .
Still , there will always be a market for Yank - bashing .
If you 're an American author and you want a gig at the Royal Court or buzz in Edinburgh , obey the three V 's in portraying Americans : venal , vulgar , violent .
You Brits will lap it up .
But here 's the wonderful thing about Enron : it does n't rely on caricature or stereotype .
The final 10 minutes of the play are magnificent , as Skilling asserts that he 's not really a villain and characterises human progress as the jagged , upward - ascending line of a financial graph .
Guess what , he implicitly says about his crimes against economy , we 're in it together .
When it comes to the elaborate fictions that sustain our global marketplace , everyone 's American ."
2010-05-05,"For New Yorkers , watching a play that is predominantly a story about a Texan company in meltdown was always going to be very uncomfortable .
In the play , we use footage of George Bush being inaugurated ; on Broadway , some people would start heckling and hissing , while another pocket of the audience would applaud .
But however democratic New York is as a town , people there are still wealthy – and Enron is n't about politics , it 's about finance and the mindset of wealth and acquisition .
In the UK , money is dirty and sexy ; people from the corporate finance world came to see it and were tickled .
But in the US , money has nobility .
Enron makes an attack on different kinds of faith , not just our faith in finance – which was troubling , I think , for Americans .
It finishes with a quote from the Bible that is then twisted into a reference to finance : there , we were attacking twin American totems .
Americans also like having a hero character to root for – an Erin Brockovich or a Robert Redford ; Enron does n't give them that .
And from the classic , quite naturalistic opening scenes , the play quickly becomes strange and expressionistic .
In the UK , that is exactly where I feel audience reactions really take off ; in America , almost the exact opposite happened .
People were enjoying it as a serious piece of work , and then they read the play 's expressionist side as somehow whimsical or superficial .
The really sad thing about the play 's closure is that , in directing it , I was really influenced by American showbiz and the Broadway musical , while Lucy [ Prebble , the writer ] was drawing on all the current great American TV drama .
The Broadway cast felt that the text was really American , too – it did n't feel as if we were bringing an English play over to the Americans .
And it 's sad that there was no consensus among audiences – some people , like the New York Times critic Ben Brantley , clearly found it problematic , but a lot of people raved about it .
Maybe it was a generational thing – in London , we were lucky to play to younger audiences .
It 's a loud , fun , rock'n'roll show , so perhaps some people found that a little aggressive .
It 's just a shame that now more New Yorkers wo n't get a chance to decide for themselves ."
2010-05-05,""" Satire , "" in the words of the Broadway showman George S Kaufman , "" is what closes on Saturday night . ""
But at least Lucy Prebble 's Enron , with its satiric view of American capitalism , will make it through to this Sunday , when it closes prematurely at New York 's Broadhurst Theatre .
The news may be shocking , but it 's not that surprising , given three factors .
One is theatre critic Ben Brantley 's obtuse and hostile review in the New York Times .
Another is the aesthetic conservatism of a theatre culture that likes plays to be rooted in the realist tradition .
I suspect there is also a lingering suspicion of a young British dramatist 's right ( Prebble is in her 20s ) to tackle a profoundly American subject .
Enron , as theatregoers who have seen it at Chichester , the Royal Court or in London 's West End will know , is a hugely ambitious play .
Spanning a period from 1992 to 2001 , it shows how the Texan energy giant moved from a model of the future to a bankrupt disaster with debts of $ 38bn ( £ 25bn ) .
That was largely because its CEO , Jeffrey Skilling , was a Marlovian over - reacher , more interested in trading energy than supplying it .
As profits tumbled , Skilling turned to his sidekick , Andy Fastow , to create shadow companies to camouflage mounting debts .
In Rupert Goold 's brilliant production ( he directed both versions ) , this complex manoeuvre is –illustrated through a series of Chinese boxes , –illuminated by a flickering red light symbolising the minimal basic investment : capitalism , in short , as con - trick .
The play opened in New York last Tuesday , and there were plenty of –positive reviews from US critics .
"" Whip - smart , edge - of - your - seat , "" wrote the New York Post 's critic ; "" surprising , remarkable , utterly thrilling , "" thought the New York Observer 's .
But Enron 's fate was sealed the moment Brantley 's review appeared , the day after opening night .
His first sentence described Prebble 's play as "" a flashy but labored economics lesson "" , and you could imagine potential theatre - goers deciding to save their dollars and settle for a night at the movies .
And while , as a fellow critic , I respect Brantley 's right to his opinion , what is dismaying is his failure to see what Prebble and Goold were up to .
Far from being a flashy distraction , the play 's vaudevillian style is a visual embodiment of the dream - like illusion to which the Texan energy giant , and similar corporations , surrendered .
But no serious play on Broadway can survive a withering attack from the New York Times , which carries the force of a papal indictment .
It is also a situation that is rarely challenged .
One of the few people to take up the cudgels was David Hare when his play , The Secret Rapture , got a similarly dusty reception from the then Times critic , Frank Rich , in 1989angels , in 1989 .
This led to an acrimonious public dispute that prompted the memorable headline in Variety :
Ruffled Hare airs Rich bitch .
But what I recall most is a letter Hare addressed to Rich , saying : "" Frank , you are lord of all you survey .
What a pity it turns out to be ashes .
"" Brantley was not alone in his dislike of Enron . ""
Heavy on sizzle , light on steak , "" said the Daily News .
""
If you 've seen the news . .
.
the play wo n't offer up much in the way of insight or illumination . ""
New York magazine deemed the play "" good , dumb fun – though little more than that "" .
One reason for the attacks is the entrenched American view that visual pyrotechnics and razzle - dazzle are the province of the musical .
Plays , on the other hand , are judged by their fidelity to what a critic once called "" the visible and audible surfaces of everyday life "" .
It 's permissible for Wicked or –Legally Blonde to deploy expressionist –techniques but , on Broadway at least , plays are expected to conform to the realist rules .
With the exception of Tony Kushner 's Angels in America , I can think of no play that has successfully violated that tradition .
It is notable that when –writers such as Arthur Miller , Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee grew more experimental with age , they were quickly kicked into touch .
What hope had Enron , with its demon - eyed raptors , Jedi knights and Siamese twins ?
But Brantley does make one valid point when he says that the public memory of the Enron scandal "" grows fainter with each succeeding account of large - scale financial misconduct "" .
With America currently gripped by the story of alleged misdeeds at Goldman Sachs , it may be that the Enron story seems like old news .
Yet this could also work the other way .
What with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Bernie Madoff scandal , you would have thought New Yorkers might have been willing to give house room to a play that points out our complicity in financial bubbles , and which argues that lessons have still to be learned .
But I suspect there 's more than a touch of chauvinism in the rejection of Prebble 's play .
After all , if the Royal Court presented a US play about the collapse of Northern Rock , how would we react ?
Other factors may explain Enron 's swift demise .
Bombs around Times Square ca n't have helped .
Enron 's failure to be nominated for any of the major Tony awards , Broadway 's annual school prizegiving , was also the kiss of death ( it was shortlisted in the sound , lighting and original score categories ) .
I also ca n't help wondering if the production would have fared better with its original London cast .
Norbert Leo Butz , who played Skilling , is , to judge from his performance in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels , a figure of dynamic comic energy ; I doubt , however , he has the Shakespearean gravitas Sam West brings to the role in London .
If Enron 's melancholy saga proves anything , it is Broadway 's irrelevance to serious theatre .
Musicals , as the success of the Menier Chocolate Factory 's La Cage aux Folles and A Little Night Music at this week 's Tonys proves , are its stock in trade .
There might be room for one decent , straight new play , as shown by the current popularity of John Logan 's Red , which originated at the Donmar and is also nominated for the major awards .
But at heart Broadway is a big , gaudy commercial shop - window , where fortunes are won and lost .
I 've long said the beating heart of US theatre is in Chicago , from which two terrific new plays , Tracy Letts 's August : Osage County and Lynn Nottage 's Ruined , recently emerged .
In fact , next time an ambitious producer thinks of taking a London hit - play to Broadway , I 'd suggest they ask the question that used to adorn posters in wartime : is your journey really necessary ?

2010-05-06,"It is 7.30am and I have woken up in a parallel universe .
It is one in which Radio 4 's Today programme takes cultural matters seriously and routinely weighs into the second collapse of Enron , Paul McCartney 's meat - free Mondays and the novels of David Mitchell before I 've even finished breakfast .
How fantastic it would be if the programme was always like this .
But on this day of all days , it 's enough to leave a man rudderless .
How to vote in the general election without the early - morning instruction of a tub - thumping politician ?
Confused and directionless , I decline to go to the polling station and head instead to Edinburgh 's Traverse theatre , official poll card in hand , to seek answers in Gordon Brown :
A Life in Theatre , a self - styled piece of "" guerrilla theatre "" written with up - to - the - minute haste by David Greig , Rona Munro , Peter Arnott , Vicki Liddelle , Gabriel Quigley , Andy Duffy , Alan Wilkins and David Ireland .
"" We mostly wrote the script on Monday , "" says Greig , welcoming us to the lunchtime show and introducing us to a spookily Brown - like Steven McNicoll and fellow actors Gabriel Quigley and Callum Cuthbertson standing – of course – behind leaders ' podiums .
What they offer over the next hour is a kind of soap - opera version of the prime minister 's life , somewhere between verbatim drama and surrealist comedy .
It ranges from Brown 's early romantic dalliances with Margarita , crown princess of Romania ( Quigley doing her best Eurovision accent ) to his imagined off - air rebranding as Wolverine from X - Men .
All the while , he is haunted by Mrs Duffy from Rochdale and a catchphrase –
"" They should never have put me with that woman "" ­– that gets funnier with each repetition .
And what emerges from behind the many laughs is something that perhaps only theatre can achieve .
It is not only that there is a particular frisson of energy in an audience that feels it is sharing in a collective news event played out over the last few weeks and culminating on this day .
It is also that the play can expose the spin and distortions that are required by a mass media intolerant of ambiguity and weakness .
The most politically powerful moments are when Brown delivers speeches in which he says what he really means about the veniality of big business and the slickness of the New Labour machine .
It means that for all the play 's exploration of the flaws of the Labour government – and this is certainly no hagiography – what still resounds most forcefully is a Brown who says , "" I fucked you up by accident ; they will fuck you up on purpose . ""
And with that , I leave the theatre sure in the knowledge of how I will cast my vote ."
2010-05-10,"There has been much discussion in the theatre world ( and some gnashing of teeth and rending of garments ) over Enron 's failure to crack New York .
No such problems , though , for the Menier Chocolate Factory and its two West End - to - Broadway transfers – La Cage aux Folles and A Little Night Music .
Between them , they have picked up a remarkable 15 Tony nominations .
It 's an impressive haul , especially when you bear in mind that both shows started life in a 180-seat , non - government funded venue that only opened in 2004 .
And it 's not a fluke .
In 2008 , the south London venue 's US transfer of Sunday in the Park with George picked up nine Tony nominations .
It 's all even more remarkable for the fact that the Menier is , in effect , taking coals to Newcastle : its shows are UK revivals of great American musicals .
So , why such success ?
The two key factors are time and money .
By time , I mean the amount of which the Menier has to develop its shows before parachuting them into the harsh economies of Broadway .
And by money , I mean the different economies of producing musical theatre in the West End and on Broadway .
For a musical to work on Broadway , it needs to either be an instant hit , or have a huge fighting fund of production cash to support it through the opening months .
That 's because staging a show in New York is , thanks to a mixture of theatre rental and staffing costs because of higher union rates , far more expensive than creating the same show in the West End .
In London , producers are able to take greater risks and can develop a show over a longer period of time .
In the case of the Menier , with its shows originating outside the West End , the start - up costs are even lower , and the final product can be honed over an extended run before even transferring to a West End house .
Then , finally , probably after two years or more , it 's ready for a Broadway run .
By now , the huge financial risk of opening a show on the Great White Way has been significantly mitigated by the critical endorsement , awards ( both Sunday in the Park and La Cage have fared well at the Oliviers ) and general reputation that the show has ( hopefully ) gained along the way .
It 's a fantastic business model and one that is 100 % commercial .
Most crucially , because the Menier receives no government subsidy , it has to produce shows which are going to be box - office hits – a perfect preparation for the demands of Broadway .
Interestingly , David Babani , the savvy artistic director of the Menier Chocolate Factory , has previously indicated that he 'd be keen to set up a sister theatre in New York .
Given his recent success , you can understand why – but also wonder whether it might be an ambition too far when the current model seems to work so well ."
2010-06-24,"The disgraced former Telegraph owner Conrad Black and the Enron fraudster Jeffrey Skilling have won fresh hope of early release from jail following a US supreme court ruling that their convictions partly relied on a controversial corruption law that was too broad in its scope .
In a major legal victory for the two jailed tycoons , America 's top court issued separate , but related , rulings declaring that the men were treated unfairly when appeal court judges threw out their attempts to overturn their convictions .
However , the rulings shed doubt only on certain aspects of the men 's multiple convictions and stop well short of acquittal .
Black , currently an inmate at Florida 's Coleman prison , was sentenced in 2007 to six and a half years for defrauding shareholders in his Hollinger media empire out of $ 6.1 m ( £ 3.7 m ) by attaching a "" non - compete "" clauses to the sale of newspaper businesses that siphoned off funds from investors .
The Canadian - born peer was stripped of the Conservative whip following his conviction .
He has vigorously protested his innocence from the beginning .
Skilling , 56 , is in a prison near Denver and is serving a 24-year sentence .
He was chief executive of Enron until shortly before the energy trading company imploded in one of the most dramatic corporate corruption scandals in US history .
In both cases , prosecutors used a law that allows for conviction if business leaders are found to have robbed investors of "" honest services "" .
But twin decisions written by the supreme court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg rule that this law should only be applied to incidents of bribery and kickback schemes .
Referring to Black , the ruling concludes : "" We vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for further proceedings . ""
The decision affects three counts of fraud for which Black was convicted by a Chicago jury .
But the 65-year - old former press baron still faces a hurdle in that he was also found guilty of obstructing justice by removing boxes of evidence from his Toronto office in defiance of a court order .
Once friendly with society figures ranging from Margaret Thatcher to Henry Kissinger , Black described the case against him as hanging "" like a toilet seat "" around the necks of prosecutors .
His legal team have never been pleased to have their case lumped in with Skilling , even through they appealed almost simultaneously to the supreme court on the same legal grounds .
Skilling was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of fraud , conspiracy , insider trading and lying to auditors .
His co - accused , the former Enron chairman Ken Lay , died of a heart attack while awaiting sentencing .
Ginsburg 's ruling , which is written on behalf of a majority of the supreme court 's nine judges , says her decision does not necessarily mean the Enron boss 's convictions should be overturned .
And she threw out a claim by Skilling that his trial was unfair because it was held in Houston , a city scarred by the energy trading company 's demise .

This article was amended on Friday June 25 2010 .
The US supreme court has nine judges , not 11 ."
2010-06-29,"There may come a time that the imprisoned press baron and former Daily Telegraph owner Conrad Black , convicted in 2007 of defrauding his own company , is celebrated as a hero in the annals of American justice .
Along with two other plaintiffs of dubious reputation ( former Enron master of the universe Jeffrey Skilling and a onetime Alaska legislator named Bruce Weyhrauch ) , Black persuaded the US supreme court that the federal "" honest services "" law should be all but thrown out .
Gone were the three counts of fraud on which Black had been convicted , stemming from accusations that he had swindled his shareholders of some $ 6.1 m .
Rupert Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal called it "" Conrad Black 's Revenge "" .
The 1988 law made it a crime for government officials , business executives and others in a position of responsibility to deprive those whom they served of their "" honest services "" .
But in a decision written by supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and released late last week , the court ruled unanimously that the law was unconstitutionally vague , and could only be applied in matters of clear criminal wrongdoing – namely bribery or kickbacks .
In deciding that the law should not be thrown out entirely , Ginsburg ( who , tragically , lost her husband , Martin Ginsburg , to cancer on Sunday ) , wrote that Congress 's handiwork "" should be construed rather than invalidated "" .
Yet one is left wondering precisely what remaining purpose the law serves , given that bribery and kickbacks are already illegal .
Indeed , justice Antonin Scalia , joined by justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy , wrote a concurring opinion in which they argued that the law should have been put out of its misery entirely .
The decision was a Joe Biden - level big deal , even if it is destined to be overshadowed by Elena Kagan 's nomination hearings .
The law was a favourite of federal prosecutors , because it was an ideal fallback in case more - specific charges failed to hold up .
And as my friend and occasional collaborator Harvey Silverglate writes in his book Three Felonies a Day : How the Feds Target the Innocent , the honest - services law , along with equally vague statutes prohibiting conspiracies of various kinds , has been used to imprison people with no criminal intent – anathema to the federal justice system 50 years ago , routine today .
Last week 's decision was not the first time that Scalia has voiced his concerns about the honest services law .
Silverglate notes that Scalia has said the statute is so sweeping that it could outlaw "" a mayor 's attempt to use the prestige of his office to obtain a restaurant table without a reservation . ""
During oral arguments last December , the justices wondered , half - facetiously , if a government employee might run afoul of the law if he read the racing form while at work .
Or as federal appeals court judge Dennis Jacobs asked in a 2003 dissent : "" How can the public be expected to know what the statute means when the judges and prosecutors themselves do not know , or must make it up as they go along ? ""
The supreme court 's ruling is good news for a number of politicians facing federal corruption charges , including former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and Sal DiMasi , former speaker of the Massachusetts house of representatives .
That might strike you as unfortunate .
But if the feds are unable to show that they broke readily understood laws , then what business did they have going after Blago and DiMasi in the first place ?
The most serious problem with the honest - services law is that it allows prosecutors to target an individual and then discover crimes with which to charge him or her , turning on its head the idea that investigators should first identify a crime and then figure out who did it .
Will Black and Skilling go free ?
Not necessarily .
Each was convicted of other crimes as well – in Black 's case , obstruction of justice .
Yet both have argued that their convictions were suffused with the notion that they had withheld their honest services , and that those convictions should therefore be vacated .
Now it will be up to the lower courts to decide .
At a moment when liberals are wringing their hands over the direction taken by the supreme court on issues ranging from corporate speech to gun control , the virtual overturning of the honest - services law should be a cause for celebration .
For once , the only substantive difference between the court 's liberal and conservative wings was whether an unjust law should be defanged or thrown out altogether .
The awesome power that federal prosecutors can bring to bear has been taken down a peg .
You do n't have to like Conrad Black or Jeffrey Skilling to understand that such action was long overdue ."
2010-07-21,"What is the basis of Conrad Black 's appeal ?
The appeal follows a US supreme court ruling last month .
The decision threatens to unravel some of the biggest white - collar crime cases in recent years , not just that of Black but also of Jeffrey Skilling , the former chief executive of energy firm Enron .
The supreme court used an appeal by Black and Skilling to limit the use of a criminal statute known as the honest services law , which targets individuals for not fulfilling the duties of their office .
The court ruled in decisions written by supreme court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the statute applied only to instances of bribery or kickbacks .
Skilling 's lawyers said the ruling was fatal to the government 's case .
Black 's lawyers this week applied for bail .
The question now will be the extent to which prosecutors relied on the honest services provision in convincing juries that considered the two cases .
The same appeals court rejected Black 's appeal two years ago , before the supreme court decision .
If the convictions are overturned , prosecutors are unlikely to resurrect efforts to retry him , according to legal experts .
What was Black convicted of ?
Along with three other former Hollinger International executives , Black was convicted in 2007 of swindling the media empire 's shareholders out of $ 6.1 m ( £ 3.9 m ) .
He was acquitted of nine other charges , including racketeering and wire fraud .
Black was also convicted of obstruction of justice after jurors saw a video of him carrying boxes of documents sought by government investigators out of his offices , loading them into his car and driving off with them .
Does Black face other legal problems ?
Black and former Hollinger International executives face a raft of civil lawsuits .
The US internal revenue service is also after Black , who surrendered his Canadian citizenship to be ennobled Lord Black of Crossharbour in 2001 .
The IRS claims Black owes almost $ 71 m in unpaid taxes and penalties .
The IRS alleges that Black failed to report and pay taxes on income stemming from personal use of Hollinger 's corporate jets , the use of corporate money to acquire papers written by president Franklin Roosevelt and Roosevelt 's private secretary , and Hollinger 's purchase in 2000 of a $ 5.9 m New York apartment for his use .
Black says he was not required to file tax returns because he was not a US resident .
What are Black 's assets ?
Black 's net worth was estimated to be $ 400 m at his peak .
His fortune is considerably less now
but it is difficult to pin down as investigators do not know whether he salted money away in alleged offshore accounts .
Black denies any accusations to do with such accounts .
What we do know is that the loyal Lady Black , the former columnist Barbara Amiel , has a 26-carat diamond worth $ 2.6 m .
There is a house in Palm Beach , Florida , worth $ 34 m , where his wife lives , and another in Toronto , said to be leveraged "" to the hilt "" .
Black sold his Kensington home for $ 25 m and an apartment on Park Lane in New York for $ 8.5 m .
What happened to Hollinger International ?
The Barclay brothers acquired Hollinger International 's UK titles , including the Telegraph , for £ 665 m in 2004 .
The Jerusalem Post was sold in the same year to Mirkaei Tikshoret and CanWest , Canada 's biggest media group , for $ 13.2 m .
In 2006 , Hollinger International changed to the Sun - Times Media Group .
It filed for bankruptcy last year and was bought in October by the Chicago financier James Tyree and a team of investors for $ 5 m ."
2010-08-05,"With plays such as My Child and Contractions , Mike Bartlett has established a reputation as a theatrical miniaturist .
Now he has written a big , epic , expansive play about climate change , corporate corruption , fathers and children .
And , even if there are times when Bartlett seems overwhelmed by the sheer weight of material , Rupert Goold has come up with a gorgeously carnivalesque production that is more than a match for Enron .
Bartlett 's play spans the period from 1968 to the distant future and , in essence , deals with our disregard for our planet .
Wisely , it tackles a vast theme by pursuing the fortunes of a single family .
Robert , having become aware early on of the dangers to the environment of emissions from aircraft , sold out to the industry , only to turn in later life into a prophet of doom .
He has also become estranged from his three daughters :
Sarah , a Lib Dem environment minister ; Freya , pregnant and suicidal ; and Jasmine , a hedonistic student .
What we witness is both a partial family reconciliation and an acceptance of the need for positive action to save the planet .
Far from being preachy , the play is humane , multi - stranded and generally engrossing ; and my only reservation is that , in the later stages of its three - and - a - quarter hours , it descends into a speculative , futuristic whimsy .
In its first half , Bartlett beautifully combines domestic and cosmic issues .
In one telling scene , Freya 's distraught husband tracks down the doom - laden Robert and is sombrely told that "" the planet can sustain about one billion people – there 's currently six billion "" .
While establishing the gravity of Robert 's pronouncement , Bartlett shows him to be a hard - hearted father .
This ability to move between personal and public issues is wonderfully reflected in Goold 's production , which has the atmosphere of a controlled dream .
Miriam Buether 's brilliant design is dominated by a serpentine catwalk and two rectangular stages at either end of the auditorium .
And , just as the action periodically erupts into song and dance , the performances have a heightened realism .
Bill Paterson as Robert , Lia Williams , Anna Madeley and Jessica Raine as his daughters and Geoffrey Streatfeild and Tom Goodman - Hill as anguished husbands all combine naturalistic detail with a sense of being part of an epic fable .
It is , in every sense , a big play that has the courage of its convictions ."
2010-08-14,"They became poster boys for City fraud when they confessed to stealing $ 7.3 m in an Enron - related fraud .
But the convicted British bankers once dubbed the "" NatWest Three "" are now recanting their guilty pleas , claiming that they were extracted under duress by a flawed American justice system .
Recently released from prison after serving half of their 37-month jail sentences for a scam dreamed up with corrupt Enron executives , two of the NatWest Three , David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew , are far from remorseful .
They have launched a ferocious attack on their controversial extradition from Britain to the US in 2005 and subsequent imprisonment , claiming that they only admitted fraud in order to get home as quickly as possible after frustrating delays in their criminal trial .
In a two - hour - long video on the website Ungagged.net , which is dedicated to exposing "" prosecutorial abuses "" in the Enron saga , Bermingham has compared the US system of plea bargaining to "" Stalinist Russia "" , while Mulgrew asserts his ordeal was akin to "" torture "" .
"" They ripped me away from my home country , away from my family and friends , "" said Mulgrew .
"" Torture takes many forms .
They delayed the trial , delayed the trial . ""
Bermingham and Mulgrew , along with a colleague , Giles Darby , were at the centre of a furore over Britain 's extradition treaty with the US that sparked questions in parliament and a march by business executives on the Home Office .
The trio persuaded their employer , Greenwich NatWest , to offload a stake in an Enron - related investment venture in the Cayman Islands for a rock - bottom price of $ 1 m .
Unbeknown to NatWest , they held a stake in the purchaser , through a deal cooked up with Enron 's then finance director , Andrew Fastow , and the conspirators sold on the investment at a profit of $ 20 m .
Pleading guilty in front of a Texas judge in February 2008 , the British bankers delivered grovelling apologies .
Bermingham said his conduct "" fell well below the standards expected "" while Mulgrew accepted that an offshore transaction in the Cayman Islands "" lacked integrity "" , adding : "" I apologise unreservedly for my actions . ""
But the men now say that their confessions were drawn out of them by the pressure of extradition to the US and a two - year hiatus in Houston with little money and minimal family contact .
Bermingham said he feared a mistrial if a jury failed to reach a majority verdict , further prolonging the trio 's stay : "" On the one hand , we were going to be able to show without any shadow of a doubt that the government 's case was bullshit .
On the other hand , we were three greedy foreign bankers who 'd done a deal with Andy Fastow and made $ 7 m bucks .
And you 've got yourself a mistrial . ""
He added : "" The government made it clear to us that if we agreed to plead guilty , they would recommend that we got sent home under the prisoner transfer treaty so that we could spend a good proportion , if not a majority , of our sentences in the UK where would could be close to our wives and families .
But if we went to trial and lost , they said they would ensure we spent all of our sentence here [ in the US ] .
"" As part of their sentence , the trio were obliged to pay back $ 7.3 m to Royal Bank of Scotland , which now owns NatWest .
An RBS spokesman said they had reached a settlement : "" The dispute between the parties has been resolved pursuant to an agreement , the terms and conditions of which are confidential . ""
The US department of justice declined to comment on the bankers ' remarks .
The trio are now trying to rebuild careers in Britain .
The men 's solicitor , Mark Spragg , said there were ongoing contentious cases of British business executives being extradited to the US , including a former boss of the Morgan Crucible engineering group , Ian Norris , who was sent to the US for trial in May.
"" There 's a real issue here that businessmen being sent to America are under immense pressure to plead guilty to something even if they do n't feel they are guilty , because it 's the quickest way to get out of the system , "" said Spragg ."
2010-08-16,"Detractors may snort and roll their eyes , but I 'm no Anglophile .
Yes , earlier this year I blogged hand - wringers about how the English do some things better than Americans and my support for the Broadway incarnation of Enron drew scorn from readers and other critics , but I remain steadfastly loyal to New York theatre .
Even so , every few years I must make a passage to London and gorge on your dramatic treats , most of which we 'll never see ( except , perhaps , at the cinema ) .
So herewith are notes on what I 've booked for my August holiday , and why .
Obligatory Pilgrimage to the NT I expect to clock nearly 11 hours in total in the Olivier
( Danton 's Death , Welcome to Thebes ) the Lyttleton ( The Habit of Art ) and the Cottesloe ( Earthquakes in London ) .
I could fill a whole blogpost about how the National theatre 's repertory schedule — even at the butt end of summer — puts New York 's present offerings to shame .
The Büchner is the sort of Euro - esoterica we never see done professionally , while Moira Buffini 's Thebes , staged by the great Richard Eyre , is the sort of big - issue drama that hardly ever gets commissioned stateside .
Speaking of ambition , Mike Bartlett 's Earthquakes sounds as if it might be a bit attenuated and flawed .
Still , bravo to Rupert Goold ( and the NT artistic director , Nicholas Hytner ) for presenting a three - hour epic that links dysfunctional - family dynamics to catastrophic climate change .
And sealing the deal on Earthquakes : I bet Goold 's bravura environmental staging must be seen to be believed .
Yank - bashing at the Royal Court
When it opened Off Broadway last season , Bruce Norris 's Clybourne Park earned glowing notices , including one from me .
The time - jumping gloss on Lorraine Hansberry 's Raisin in the Sun is a wickedly dark tragicomedy about racism and neighbourliness — or lack thereof .
( Hint : if a white character in a Norris satire is playing the kind - hearted liberal in the first act , by the second he 'll be spewing racial epithets . )
The draw here — besides dropping in at the storied Royal Court — is to see how measured or grotesque the actors ' portrayal of ugly Americans will be .
The Broadway tryout Although I could wait until October to see La Bête on Broadway , it sounds so cool to casually mention in your review , "" When I caught this production in the West End … "" Seriously , something may be gained or lost in the transfer over the Atlantic .
Plus , why wait a moment longer to see Mark Rylance ?
Canon fodder at the Donmar
As noted above regarding Danton 's Death , there 's zero hope of New Yorkers seeing theatrical obscurities such as Heinrich von Kleist 's Prince of Homburg .
Season after season we get the same overdone classics by Ibsen , Shakespeare , Chekhov and Williams .
Outside of a student production or avant - garde deconstruction , hardly anyone attempts this sort of lesser - known European drama .
It makes me want to grab the Roundabout Theatre Company and scream : "" If you must do the same old masters , then less Hedda Gabler and more Brand ! ""
Whither pub and fringe ?
You might have noticed the absence of pub fare on this dance card .
Where , you ask , is the multimedia promenade freakout staged in an abandoned sausage factory ?
Frankly , I get enough of that in New York , which has a perfectly vital experimental scene .
Still , I must be missing key fringe events — and not just in Edinburgh .
I leave it to you , prickly commentariat of the Guardian , to indicate where to stray off the beaten path .

2010-09-29,"The BBC is to broadcast its first TV adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Henry V for more than 30 years as part of a season of his history plays to be overseen by Oscar - winning director Sam Mendes .
Working with Mendes on the BBC 's "" epic film versions "" of Richard II , Henry IV part I and II , and Henry V will be some of British theatre 's leading lights , including Sir Richard Eyre , Simon Russell Beale and Rupert Goold , director of Enron .
Another Oscar - winning writer and director , Jane Campion , and Sir David Hare will also be writing major new dramas for the BBC .
The four plays have not been adapted by the corporation for TV since 1978 and 1979 , during the BBC Television Shakespeare project , which brought the playwright 's entire body of theatre work to screen over seven years .
They will be broadcast on BBC2 and are part of a £ 10 m season in 2012 to celebrate Shakespeare , which includes a live broadcast of another play , yet to be revealed .
Mendes will executive produce the four Shakespeare films , in what will be the American Beauty and Revolutionary Road director 's first work for BBC TV .
Mendes founded and ran the Donmar Warehouse theatre in London for 10 years and won five Academy Awards for his first film , American Beauty . ""
One of my earliest introductions to Shakespeare was watching the plays on TV , and it 's terrific to have the opportunity to bring them to a new , wider audience , "" he said .
Russell Beale will be associate producer of the four plays , while the directors include Eyre and Goold – whose credits include the acclaimed play about one of the biggest frauds in corporate history , Enron .
The BBC drama controller , Ben Stephenson , promised "" epic film versions "" of the four Shakespeare plays , "" by some of the best directors in the country "" .
The BBC broadcast more than 60 TV productions of Shakespeare plays between 1945 and the late 1970s , according to the British Film Institute , culminating in the BBC Television Shakespeare season that ran from 1978 to 1985 and featured stars such as Laurence Olivier and Derek Jacobi .
But in the past three decades TV adaptations of Shakespeare have been less frequent .
However , last Boxing Day the corporation returned to tradition and broadcast a reworking of a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hamlet starring David Tennant which drew around 1 million viewers .
It is following it up by screening Patrick Stewart in a film version of Macbeth on BBC4 next year .
BBC2 will also air Campion 's series Top of the Lake .
Campion , whose credits include The Piano and In the Cut , has written and will direct the thriller set in New Zealand about a 12-year - old girl who disappears when she is five months pregnant .
Details of Hare 's single play have yet to be revealed but he will write and direct it .
Despite contemporary hits such as The Silence and Five Daughters and period dramas such as Cranford , the BBC 's critics have called for it to make more single plays .
The BBC has countered constant clamouring for the return of Play for Today with acclaimed BBC1 daytime series Moving On – a series of single plays which is returning for a second series with a star cast including Anna Massey , John Simm and the late Corin Redgrave .
Attracting some of the world 's leading creative talents to make such high quality dramas is likely to help provide the corporation with critical ammunition and support as it enters negotiations with the government over the future level of the licence fee early next year .
The next four - year settlement will be in place until 2017 but the culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , has repeatedly stressed the need for the BBC to take account of the recession and "" live on the same planet as everyone else "" .

2010-12-05,"Enron , the stage play that has enraptured the West End with its depiction of an energy giant 's rise and fall , is to be adapted for the big screen by George Clooney , the Observer has learned .
But , as the film attempts to emulate the success of its theatrical counterpart , it will be doing so without its British cast or director .
Apart from playwright Lucy Prebble , who is now writing the screenplay having sold the film rights , the team that made the original UK staging is not involved in the movie .
"" How do you compete with George Clooney ? "" asked Rupert Goold , whose production of Enron won him the Best Director award at the 2010 Olivier Awards .
It is understood the Oscar - winning actor - director - producer , who was bowled over by the satire of greed , will co - produce the film and is also likely to direct it , but it 's not clear whether he will appear on screen .
Goold , who developed the play over three years before any venue was chosen and whose production was a sell - out in Chichester , the Royal Court , the West End and on a nationwide tour , said it was frustrating not to be involved in the film .
His stage success was not equalled by a Broadway production which failed after 15 performances .
Goold also expressed dismay that a British stage success had been snapped up by US producers .
Philip Hedley , former director of the Theatre Royal Stratford East , said : "" It 's a great shame that the original talent has n't been able to follow through , to put on to film what they 've originally created . ""
Another prominent theatre director , who declined to be named , observed : "" Everything works on celebrity and famous names . ""
According to that logic , therefore , out goes Samuel West , who impressed the UK critics with his portrayal of Jeffrey Skilling , the Enron CEO indicted in 2004 for conspiracy , fraud and insider trading .
Tim Pigott - Smith , who was praised for his depiction of Ken Lay , Enron 's late founder , will not be appearing either .
The film rights have been acquired by Laura Ziskin , one of Hollywood 's biggest players .
Speaking to the Observer , Ziskin confirmed that she had joined forces with Clooney to produce the film and that he loved the play .
Asked about Goold 's exclusion , she said that the film will have a different "" take "" , while being true to Prebble 's vision : "" Once you 've done something … you 've done it .
Let that stand on its own . ""
She added : "" This is an American story . ""
The play recounts the spectacular decline of the energy company , once the seventh largest US corporation .
Commenting on why it failed to excite US audiences , Ziskin suggested that they may have felt uncomfortable about being satirised by a foreign company : "" Maybe Americans did n't want that mirror held up to them at that moment . """

( C ) SUMMARY :
The investigation of former Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec and the Podravka food company ( which is 26 percent state - owned ) is uncovering a growing scandal and has now tied Podravka 's financing schemes to the XXXXXXXXXXXX .
The majority of Podravka 's board are under arrest .
Prosecutors are seeking information from XXXXXXXXXXXX , who provided XXXXXXXXXXXX to the Podravka management board .
Prosecutors believeXXXXXXXXXXXX was then used in the board 's scheme to take over the company , which led to subsequent illegal actions to cover up their activities and financial losses .
Media are beginning to speculate on the role of former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader in the affair .
End Summary .
2 .
( C )
Croatia 's Chief State Prosecutor Mladen Bajic met with RSO and Poloff on February 2 to outline the prosecutor 's "" Operation Spice "" investigation into Podravka and former Deputy Prime Minister Polancec .
Bajic presented two documents .
The first was an unsigned financing agreement between XXXXXXXXXXXX and Podravka from November 2006 .
The second was a completed financing agreement between a company called XXXXXXXXXXXX and from XXXXXXXXXXXX which was secured by Podravka shares .
Bajic said that under the equity acquisition financing agreement , XXXXXXXXXXXX approximately 34 million euro ( with an additional 39 million euro available in a second tranche ) for purchase of nearly 600,000 ordinary shares of Podravka .
XXXXXXXXXXXX Bajic said Podravka 's management , under a plan spearheaded by Polancec , had arranged the deal in order to use the proceeds to purchase a controlling interest in the company .
( NOTE :
Four members of Podravka 's former management board are currently in detention .
The board , which is appointed by parliament , was composed of members supported by various parties within the ruling coalition .
End Note . )
XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX replaced an unnamed "" Podravka Management Approved Holding Company "" as the borrower of record .
3 .
( C ) Prosecutors from the Office of Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime ( USKOK ) are interested in learning the details of XXXXXXXXXXXX , including who approached XXXXXXXXXXXX ( NOTE : Post forwarded copies of the XXXXXXXXXXXXagreements to the FBI office in Vienna on February 8 .
End Note . )
Bajic told EmbOffs that the XXXXXXXXXXXX agreement is legal -- his interest is in learning who was involved on the Croatian side .
According to prosecutors , the criminal aspects of the deal involveXXXXXXXXXXXX and actions taken by Polancec and others in order to XXXXXXXXXXXX .
4 .
( C )
Due to the economic crisis , the value of Podravka shares fell more than 50 percent , from approximately 600 kuna ( 120 USD ) per share XXXXXXXXXXXX .
According to prosecutors , as the value decreased , Podravka management , XXXXXXXXXXXX had to meet margin calls for the shortfall .
In one scheme to increase Podravka 's revenues , at least on paper , Bajic said the management engaged in money laundering by funneling Podravka money XXXXXXXXXXXX in order to pay fraudulent contracts with Podravka .
5 .
( C )
While Polancec 's scheme at Podravka was unraveling , he was simultaneously involved in negotiations with XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE . )
Hungarian prosecutors forwarded to Bajic their report on an investigation of XXXXXXXXXXXX in the Podravka deal .
According to the report , when the XXXXXXXXXXXX of the equity agreement dropped to 35 percent in December 2008 , it triggered an early termination agreement .
Hungarian prosecutors say that at this point , Deputy Prime Minister Polancec , who was also Minister of Economy and deeply involved in the XXXXXXXXXXXX negotiations , approached XXXXXXXXXXXX and asked XXXXXXXXXXXX to be a consultant to Podravka .
As a result of these consultations , XXXXXXXXXXXX .
XXXXXXXXXXXX for his failed schemes at Podravka .
6 .
( C ) Press reports on the XXXXXXXXXXXX connection to the Podravka case within the past week have also speculated on the possible involvement of former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader .
Sanader was closely involved in XXXXXXXXXXXX negotiations and it would have been difficult for Polancec to have taken some of the actions prosecutors are alleging he did in the XXXXXXXXXXXX talks without Sanader 's knowledge .
Bajic declined to tell us on February 2 whether Sanader is a target of this investigation , but he has told us on previous occasions that his office is investigating the former PM in several cases .
7 .
( C )
Bajic has said privately that Podravka could be Croatia 's Enron , a game - changing case in the GoC 's efforts to tackle corruption , particularly if he can obtain sufficient evidence that Polancec intentionally undersold XXXXXXXXXXXX .
Cooperation with Hungarian prosecutors continues to improve .
Bajic said he was very impressed with the evidence and analysis the Hungarians provided on the XXXXXXXXXXXX connection .
8 .
( C ) COMMENT :
The Podravka case is one of the major cases that the EU is watching to determine Croatia 's commitment to fighting corruption .
The results to date are positive .
The willingness and ability of USKOK to investigate an incumbent Deputy Prime Minister , almost immediately after suspicions were raised , shows that , as Prime Minister Kosor has contended , there may no longer be "" untouchables "" in Croatia .
Post will continue to work with the FBI in order to facilitate USKOK 's contact with XXXXXXXXXXXX .
END COMMENT .
FOLEY"
2011-02-12,"The answer is , obviously , for anyone who saw Enron , yes .
But one of the key to Enron 's success was , for me , its departure from realism – which of course is so much easier in theatre than film .
In Lucy Prebble 's drama , metaphor became real .
Dinosaurs stalked the stage and market analysts broke out in close - harmony singing .
Tellingly , perhaps , Enron was n't even ostensibly about the financial crisis of 2008 ; but it was certainly "" about "" it .
So did Margin Call , which premiered at the Berlin film festival yesterday , work ?
The movie , by first - time writer - director JC Chandor , is set on one day in an investment bank .
A junior – a 28-year - old with an engineering PhD in propulsion – "" so , you 're basically a rocket scientist "" ( boom - boom )
– figures out all is not well .
There is one way for the bank to salvage itself , albeit with grave financial and moral losses .
As Andrew Pulver points out in his review , part of the formal pleasure of the film is the semi - comic shuffling upwards of responsibility , as we meet the boss , the boss 's boss , the boss 's boss 's boss .
Finally – deus ex machina –
everyone 's boss Jeremy Irons ( delivering a wonderfully baroque performance that may be from another film ) swoops in by helicopter to exert his amoral judgement on the situation .
The film – which I must say is very enjoyable – is constructed like a thriller .
But , according to Chandor , it might better be thought of as a "" tragedy "" .
Speaking in Berlin , he talked of how investment banking is "" a total misuse of our smartest people "" .
This is clear in the film : we are in no doubt that once , some of these besuited creeps could build bridges or dig holes or just make stuff – perhaps even babies .
It is a kind of parable of the talents .
The reason I think it struggles successfully to attain status as either a truly successful thriller or tragedy is that the stakes are low .
The jeopardy is : these bankers may become slightly less rich .
Now of course it is true that the financial crisis visited real tragedy on all kinds of people , but this is a film emphatically not about those who lost their homes or businesses in the sub - prime crisis .
This is about those who , having lost their jobs and been given a seven - figure payoff , will have the lovely chance to retrain as teachers , or potters , or engineers , or psychotherapists or whatever they want .
There 's also the problem , of course , that the financial crisis was very complex .
How do you explain derivatives to a movie audience , when even bankers , economists and finance ministers struggled ?
There is a lot of "" talk to me in plain English "" in the film , and Irons 's hilarious "" Speak to me as you would a small child , or a golden retriever . ""
Perhaps this is an accurate reflection of how bankers address each other ; but it sometimes felt like this was too nakedly an exposition - device , and dramatically dead .
Now , you can make excellent films about hard - to - follow , complex modern things like social networking .
But The Social Network worked hard to give its characters a great deal of depth and hinterland –
we did see them wrested away from their computer screens – whereas our Margin Call lot are never out of their suits .
And in Pushing Tin – that 's the one about air - traffic controllers , directed by Mike Newell
–
OK , most of us have n't a clue about how air - traffic control works , but the film had sufficient internal jeopardy ( people might die ! ) to make it work as a thriller .
Still , with extremely creditable performances from , among others , Kevin Spacey , Margin Call was an interesting attempt to dramatise the crisis .
And here 's a thing : it 's much better than Wall Street 2 ."
2011-03-06,"Alex Gibney made the excellent documentaries Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room and the Oscar - winning Taxi to the Dark Side .
For this film , he persuaded Eliot Spitzer , the high - flying New York lawyer , politician and scourge of Wall Street fatcats and villains , to take part in a film examining his rise to the governorship of New York and sudden , Icarus - like fall due to secret sessions with $ 1,000-an - hour callgirls .
It 's a riveting story of personal hubris and political chicanery .
At the end , Gibney has persuaded us that the brave , abrasive , undiplomatic Spitzer was brought down by something resembling a conspiracy involving the US government , the FBI , right - wing politicians in Albany and some reptilian Wall Street people whose forked tails he 'd trampled on ."
2011-05-25,"Enron , WorldCom , Madoff Securities , Lehman Brothers , Ryan Giggs PLC .
And so it is that another name is added to the fraudsters ' roll of shame , the list of glorified thieves who ... I 'm sorry .
Which of us has the strength ?
Of all the nauseating aspects of L'Affaire Giggsy –
and they 're legion
– perhaps the most emetic is the manner in which it has been dressed up in pseudo - financial language , the solemn tones of the whistleblower , as though those who wished to publish details of his sex life were exposing massive corporate fraud , as opposed to indulging in a bit of sharp business practice themselves .
And never forget it is the intimate details they wish to publish , as opposed to the mere allegations of infidelity .
Everybody with a timeshare on half a brain cell knows that the Sun wanted to run its original Giggs story because it would have titillated some of the public .
Yet you can not move for disingenuous cobblers about how Giggs had "" traded "" on a reputation which now "" lies in tatters "" .
""
The Giggs brand , "" runs some typically woolly posturing in the Daily Mail , "" was underpinned by his ' clean cut , family man ' image . ""
Doubtless the Trade Descriptions Act will have been adduced by Friday .
To the pseudo - financial , we may add the pseudo - political , exemplified by thunderous editorials lamenting that Giggs was an "" ambassador for the game "" .
Whether this is technically an FA or a Foreign Office appointment I ca n't say , but presumably Ryan travels with a retinue of attaches and can avoid repercussions for any dodgy tackle committed on foreign soil by claiming diplomatic immunity .
To follow these palpably disingenuous arguments to their logical conclusion , the best way to move the story on is to call for the immediate convening of an FA panel , to determine how many points Manchester United should be docked for the competitive advantage of some people not knowing that Giggs had done it a few times with someone off Big Brother .
Did n't you hear ?
We 're pretending to carefully weigh the value of everything these days – including the nebulous percentage of Giggs 's image rights dependent on his totally unpublicised family life – in order that the tabloids or a Twitter mob can apply the precisely calibrated moral counterweight .
Hereafter , Manchester United 's historic 19th league title must be asterisked , on the basis that we can not know how the table would have panned out had Giggs 's affair been exposed earlier in the season .
A few weeks ago , I took part in a panel discussion about the dysfunctional relationship between the press and sport , in which Max Mosley also participated and made some splendidly provocative rejoinders to those convenient old media clichés about footballers being role models and so on .
If sports stars really are the vitally important role models the tabloid press claims , ran one of these , then surely their misdeeds should never be exposed , to safeguard the ideals of impressionable children .
An extreme position ( though delivered with a twinkle ) , and not one I agree with –
but I 'm glad someone is willing to float it , because every well - rounded debate needs articulate ultras .
Alas , those who have thought things through tend to be crowded out by those apparently incapable of doing so . ""
Sick joke , "" began Janet Street Porter 's column on the John Terry exposé , quoted here at the time .
"" John Terry was chosen as ' Dad of the Year ' by Daddies Sauce .
That 's a product I wo n't be buying any more . ""
To which the only rational response seemed to be : Really , Janet ?
REALLY ?
Do you feel lied to by a condiment manufacturer ?
Or a Premier League footballer ?
I am afraid you sound too delicate to be around the news .
And so this week , where sections of the press will have you believe that there are myriad people other than Giggs 's wife who feel "" lied to "" by his behaviour .
Forgive me for adopting an ultra position , but if some people require smelling salts when they discover that young multimillionaires at their physical peak are occasionally shaggers , then perhaps they should be medically ruled too stupid and fragile to watch sport , and should instead only be allowed to spend their leisure time on less confusing activities , such as removing lint from their belly buttons .
I 'm all for privacy injunctions being granted on a case - by - case basis , though others will not concur .
But can we at least agree to dispense with the idea that such stories are run for any nobler reason than money - spinning titillation ?
To pretend otherwise seems a hypocrisy infinitely greater than that Ryan Giggs is supposed to have indulged in ."

He is in his late 20s , and , while showing no trace of arrogance , appears at ease in the world .
"" If for most political reporters the Watergate scandal is the gold standard , the sort of scoop that financial journalists dream of is probably Enron .
Is n't that what every journalist wants ?
To expose people who are doing something really bad and make sure they are stopped and go to jail ? ""
A working day in the life of this financial journalist ?
Well , actually , that can be quite boring
I 'm afraid .
Every morning at 9.30am loads of data about the UK economy is released .
Unemployment figures , GDP for this quarter , consumer confidence indexes , the sort of stuff that analysts and economists use to determine how the economy and individual companies are doing .
My job is to condense that data into a short article , telling readers what is happening in the economy and why .
As I am doing this , banks and analysts publish so - called ' notes ' with their interpretation of the figures , whether they are reason for optimism or pessimism , higher or lower than expected .
You may say they speculate how the markets will react to these figures .
I am going through these notes , and I call round my own contacts , economists in the City whose judgment I have come to value . ""
These ' notes ' are a curious thing .
Banks and analysts write them for their clients , but they also write them for us journalists .
If we quote a particular analyst it makes him , his ideas and his organisation look really good . ""
Investors are known to approach analysts on the basis of their being quoted in our pages –
it 's free publicity of the best kind .
For me the notes are useful as a first take on how the figures of that day are received , and also for colour .
If you write an article it helps the flow if can you stick in a quote or two .
Of course , analysts know this , so there is this game going on .
On the one hand the analysts do n't want to say controversial things that turn out to be wrong and make them look like fools .
Yet they need to say things that stand out if they want to have a chance at getting quoted .
"" I like writing longer articles .
Say unemployment figures show that the crisis has hit low - educated , white males hardest .
Then I try to go to the place in the UK where the effects are felt the most .
I talk to people , then use their quotes to ' head ' and ' tail ' the piece .
I open with descriptions of the people and their lives for ' colour ' , as we call it .
The statistics and analysis go in the middle , and at the end I return to the scene I opened with , for a final quote . """
2011-11-11,"On yesterday morning 's BBC Radio Four Today programme , the writer and commentator Rhidian Brook used his slot on Thought for the Day to consider the City 's relaxed acceptance that some financial institutions are simply "" too big to fail "" .
As the history of civilisation is littered with large organisations that have failed – from Lehman Brothers and Enron to the Tower of Babel – it seems peculiar that financiers and governments have come to a mutual conclusion that big is always best , he argued .
As business marches to the tune of "" might is right "" , our experience as users of public services and as customers tells us another story .
Smaller , citizen - led organisations rooted in communities , the institutions which understand our needs as individuals , are often those that prove the most successful in the long term .
There is lesson in this for the housing sector and it is a timely one to remember as housing professionals pay tribute to the late Terry Edis .
Edis taught us that trusting in tenants to understand and meet their own needs , trusting them to play a major role in the management of their own homes , can produce the best outcomes for all residents .
He was a tireless campaigner against the idea that big is beautiful .
He believed that housing should be personal , and he argued in defence of small , locally run organisations in the face of the rise of the monolith .
Struggling to cope with the dual pressures of funding cuts and spiralling demand for their services , the myth of big is beautiful has quietly crept into the housing sector .
The drive for efficiency can turn into the drive for merger , despite warnings from the Chartered Institute of Housing against merging "" for the sake of it "" .
Some of the most successful housing associations by financial measures alone are also among the very largest .
These providers are those which are using the best of business practice to improve their own performance and deliver the best returns for tenants .
There is no doubt that financial might can have a very positive impact within communities and generate social returns .
But are n't we missing something here ?
This week , the chief executive of Greenfields Community Housing spelled out the advantages of the new community gateway housing association model – smaller , tenant - led and accountable to the community . ""
It is important to remember that housing associations can not improve the lives of their residents simply by solving housing issues , "" Phil Adams wrote . ""
True community engagement and empowerment comes as a result of real social change , which encompasses education , crime reduction , health and employment .
"" The history of the so - called "" housing movement "" is rooted in community - based landlords , whose specific aims served the specific needs of very local groups of tenants .
Above all , it is based on providing a personal community service .
The reason that the term now feels so outdated is because the biggest players in the market have arguably moved so far from the original ideals .
As a political policy , localism fits neatly into the ambitions of these community housing organisations .
For the government , localism is a risky strategy : grant councils , landlords and neighbourhoods the freedoms you hope will lead to market - driven services , and you might not like what they decide to do with it .
But the time is certainly ripe for community landlords to restate their value and argue in defence of local tenant - led services .
The big beasts of the housing sector will still be with us , and merger and stock rationalisation may prove useful tools in making the efficiencies now demanded in an uncompromising fiscal climate .
But , as Adams asks , let us all learn from each other to raise standards across the sector .
The first lesson is thus : big is not always beautiful .

2011-12-19,"The man who has presided over the Royal Court 's most dazzling period for many years is leaving to go freelance .
Dominic Cooke , 45 , whose productions of Enron and Jerusalem transferred from the small Sloane Square venue to the West End and then Broadway , will step down as artistic director in 2013 .
The venue 's executive director Kate Horton is also departing to become deputy executive director of the National Theatre .
Cooke was appointed artistic director in 2006 , having spent eight years as associate director of the Royal Court and the RSC .
Under his directorship , the Royal Court has won an unrivalled reputation as the home of provocative new drama , innovatively staged .
Laura Wade 's Posh , timed to coincide with the May 2010 election , dissected the decadence and sense of entitlement of the Bullingdon Club .
Bruce Norris 's Clybourne Park , first staged in New York , shocked and delighted audiences by teasing out the racial tensions behind urban gentrification .
And Cooke brought to London Lucy Prebble 's Enron , directed by Rupert Goold , which turned a version of the credit crunch into a theatrical spectacular .
By the time he leaves , Cooke will have staged 100 new plays , including work by a raft of young playwrights including Mike Bartlett , Nina Raine and Polly Stenham , whose play That Face was written when she was only 19 .
However , it is Jerusalem , written by the established name Jez Butterworth , which is likely to sum up his and Horton 's tenure .
The play , a multi - layered evocation of English identity driven by a landmark performance by Mark Rylance , was garlanded with awards , received rave reviews , and was a sell - out hit both on Broadway and the West End , enhancing both the Royal Court 's international profile and its financial security .
In a statement , Cooke said : "" My time with Kate at the Court has been a thrilling adventure .
Through the theatre 's burgeoning writers ' groups , we 've brought a new generation of playwrights to the stage , including many young women ...
Box office receipts and fundraising are at an all - time high . ""
Horton added : "" It has been an honour to work with him in leading an extraordinary Royal Court team in delivering Dominic 's programme . ""
The Royal Court recently announced a new season including In Basildon by David Eldrige , which will be directed by Cooke , and an environment - themed collaboration between director Katie Mitchell and Professor Stephen Emmott , head of computer science at Microsoft Research .
Cooke will be artistic director for two more seasons after that before stepping down in 15 months ' time .
Though he is sure to be a strong candidate to run the National Theatre if Nicholas Hytner leaves , in January he told the Guardian that he would like to make a film – "" or maybe I 'll become a landscape gardener "" ."

2012-03-01,"Among the unintended consequences of the financial crisis which has engulfed the world 's economies over the last few years has been the emergence of a new strain of art inspired by the bubble , the crisis and its consequences .
In theatre , David Hare 's The Power of Yes and Lucy Prebble 's Enron , in documentary Michael Moore 's Capitalism : A Love Story and Inside Job , in music Bruce Springsteen 's forthcoming Wrecking Ball , and most recently John Lanchester 's novel Capital have all attempted in their own ways to make a drama out of a crisis .
Marina Lewycka 's novel begins in September 2008 on the trading floor of the London stock exchange , where we meet Serge , a 28-year - old maths whiz who wears ironic Buddy Holly - style glasses and lets his parents think he is pursuing a maths PhD when in fact he is a City trader pursuing an eastern European colleague .
Serge has to hide the truth of what he does from his parents Doro and Marcus because they are old - school hippies who met at a protest march in 1968 and went on to raise their children in a south Yorkshire commune where lentils , free love and radical politics were encouraged and marriage was reviled as an oppressive patriarchal institution .
Doro and Marcus have finally decided to get married , and they want to invite Serge , his sister Clara , who teaches in a Doncaster primary school , and his other sister Oolie - Anna , who has Down 's syndrome , to the wedding .
Using multiple narratives Lewycka takes us back to the days of the Solidarity Hall commune , and also behind the scenes in the City , where Serge finds himself engaging in increasingly unethical financial practices .
Lewycka confidently bandies around opaque references to short selling , collateral debt obligations and the Fibonacci series , and if she is even half right about the goings - on inside financial organisations it appears that the epicentre of malpractice is located somewhere inside the disabled toilets .
It is while holed up in the loo that Serge secretly engages in insider trading , hoping to make enough money to be able to quit work .
Lewycka is a warm and humane writer whose previous novels have found unexpected humour in old age and the plight of European migrants .
Here she pokes gentle fun at the naïve idealists who created the commune , and the children who find them mortifying .
( Serge believes that no one over 40 should wear a sequinned denim gipsy - flounce shirt . )
As the novel progresses we see that below the humour runs a current of sadness and anger .
The utopian ideals of Solidarity Hall , it emerges , often fell victim to the human frailties of lust and envy .
Those same frailties afflict the children , and the novel is at its most affecting when Lewycka contrasts the hopes of Doro and Marcus 's generation with the world they bequeathed to their children .
Even the language has been appropriated : "" revolutionary is what you call the latest mobile phone technology … struggle is trying to get home on the bus with your bags of shopping . ""
When Oolie - Anna is set upon by a gang of yobs , her sister Clara notes that "" the people running the show are the ones who have only ever helped themselves .
No wonder the lost kids snatch out for whatever they can get . ""
The hippies of Solidarity Hall and their contemporaries may have been naïve , they may have worn – and continue to wear – terrible clothes , but they belonged to a generation , Lewycka suggests , who truly did believe we were all in this together .
As Serge puts it , they had something they believed in – "" Values and stuff –
it all seems a bit retro . ""

2012-05-23,"Facebook 's founder , Mark Zuckerberg , has gone from hero to zero as the stockmarket flotation of the decade flounders amid lawsuits and accusations of greed , hype and deception .
The law firm that won a $ 7bn settlement for Enron 's shareholders is pursuing Zuckerberg , his board and the long list of banks advising the company for making "" untrue statements "" about its financial performance .
Robbins Geller is bringing the second class action law suit in as many days against Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , Barclays and a host of Silicon Valley luminaries including PayPal guru Peter Thiel .
A separate suit filed in California on Tuesday by investor Darryl Lazar claims that the social network 's share prospectus contained "" materially false and misleading statements "" .
The regulators are also closing in .
Mary Schapiro , chair of America 's main financial watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission , said : "" I think there is a lot of reason to have confidence in our markets and in the integrity of how they operate , but there are issues that we need to look at specifically with respect to Facebook . ""
After months of hype about the float of the social networking site , which has nearly a billion users across the globe , the appetite for its shares has collapsed since its launch at $ 38 per share on Friday .
The shares are now trading at $ 31.78 , leaving the company that boasts a user base including half the American population is worth £ 4bn less than it was six days ago , and earning it a new moniker : Fadebook .
So while the social network 's bankers and its wealthy early investors have profited handsomely from the float , the legal profession is set to cash in .
Both lawsuits claim that certain investors had access to information that would have dented confidence in the shares , while others were left in the dark .
The problems began on 9 May , when Facebook amended its initial public offering ( IPO ) prospectus with a short and , for some , hard - to - interpret reference to the fact that while its usage on mobile phones was growing exponentially , the company was finding it harder to sell advertising on its mobile website than on "" desktop "" pages .
Analysts promptly began revising their forecasts .
Those included Scott Devitt , who covers consumer internet firms for Morgan Stanley .
The bank , as lead underwriter for the IPO , was employed as Facebook 's cheerleader - in - chief .
According to Reuters – Morgan Stanley has not yet made the date or the content of the forecasts available to the public – Devitt decided that revenues in the second quarter of this year , which runs until the end of June , would be $ 1.111bn ( £ 705 m ) , down from an earlier estimate of $ 1.175bn .
He shaved full - year forecasts too , from $ 5bn to $ 4.85bn .
JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs , the second and third lead underwriters , also downgraded their estimates .
Participating banks can not publicly issue research or make recommendations until 40 days after an IPO is priced , but their analysts are allowed to communicate estimates orally to customers .
The concern is that this information may have filtered through only to a privileged few rather than the wider public .
In a statement , Morgan Stanley said a "" significant number "" of analysts in the IPO syndicate reduced their estimates after Facebook 's disclosure on 9 May , adding : "" Morgan Stanley followed the same procedures for the Facebook offering that it follows for all IPOs .
These procedures are in compliance with all applicable regulations . ""
The actions of Facebook 's underwriters in the days that followed gave no hint of the information they were receiving from their own number - crunchers .
On Tuesday , 15 May , the range at which they estimated the float would be priced was raised from $ 28–$35 to $ 34–$38 .
A day later , the insiders and early investors who had invested in Facebook during private funding rounds increased the number of shares they planned to sell during the IPO by a massive 25 % .
Those most likely to have heard the analysts ' downgrades may have decided that the shares would not enjoy the widely expected day - one surge , seen when Google and the professional networking site LinkedIn went public .
Basically , for those in the know , at $ 38 a share , Facebook was a "" sell "" .
Smaller retail investors appear to have paid the price .
Only 10 % to 15 % of shares were thought likely to go to small shareholders .
Estimates suggest that the bulk of the 84 m extra shares released last Wednesday went to investors at the bottom of the tree .
Chad Brand , founder of the investment adviser Peridot Capital , had put in orders at E*Trade , one of the underwriters .
Brand wrote on his blog : "" I did not really think they would allocate us any shares ...
What happened ?
We got every share we asked for .
"" Some of the retail clients who called him that day were getting up to 20,000 shares .
Jacob Salzmann , named as a plaintiff in the case being brought by Robbins Geller , spent $ 124,000 buying shares at $ 41.766 a piece .
By close of play on Tuesday , they were worth just $ 31 .
David Joy , an analyst at wealth adviser Ameriprise Financial , wrote in a note to clients : "" These developments reinforce the notion that the underwriters did a wonderful job of pricing the offering in order to maximise the profitability to the company 's insiders and its private investors but [ they ] left very little on the table for public investors in the secondary market . """
2012-08-10,"The current war of words between the US and UK over banking regulation has a familiar ring to it .
When the US passed the Sarbanes Oxley bill in 2002 , in the wake of the Enron debacle , the London Stock Exchange spotted a marketing opportunity .
The Sox bill imposed more onerous reporting requirements on the corporate sector and the stock exchange thought it could use its lack of red tape to attract more companies to list in London .
This proved extremely successful – and London became a popular place for international companies to raise capital .
Controversially , a London listing added a veneer of respectability to a host of mining companies with minimal business in London .
It was the same with the banks .
Successive British governments boasted about the co - operative approach adopted by London regulators , compared to the legalistic US stance .
But we all know where light - touch regulation has ended up : about £ 2tn ( $ 3.13tn ) sunk into supporting the banks and the return , for the UK , to the depths of a double - dip recession .
So you ca n't blame New York regulators for spotting an opportunity of their own .
Brussels is doing the same .
Our banks have hardly helped themselves .
Barclays admitted manipulating a leading benchmark interest rate for years – first , for its own gain , and then , to convince regulators it was healthier than it looked .
HSBC turns out to have been accepting truckloads of dollars from money launderers with no questions asked .
Yet I stopped in my tracks this week when the accusations against Standard Chartered were made .
The bank is a byword for respectability .
It came through the financial crisis largely unscathed .
Its former chairman moved on to the House of Lords , where he currently champions getting more women onto company boards .
Its current head only recently said the bank 's business was so boring it was unlikely to come to the attention of regulators .
And here was a new regulator I had not heard of calling it a "" rogue institution "" for processing Iranian transactions .
This seems to have come like a bolt out of the blue for the bank as well since it was not ready with any statement to react to the allegations .
It has since come out fighting and is disputing the charge .
The New York regulator says the bank processed $ 250bn of transactions .
Standard Chartered says only $ 14 m did not comply with the rules .
As the mud has started flying , London 's mayor Boris Johnson has accused New York regulators of being tougher on foreign institutions than their own banks .
But who can blame them for trying to win back a bit of business and influence ?
US regulators tend to be higher - profile than their UK counterparts , and some are keen to make a name for themselves .
In a previous life , Eliot Spitzer took on Wall Street ahead of running for office – until he was brought down by his own reputational damage .
Benjamin Lawsky , the new guy on the block at the New York State Department of Financial Services , could be keen to show he can be just as tough as any of his fellow law enforcers .
However , there is a more serious issue at stake here : that is , whether the banks are inherently ungovernable .
Bankers at Barclays and HSBC appear to have been out of control .
These scandals seem even worse to me than trading in toxic derivatives – even though that nearly brought the entire financial system crashing down .
These bankers were acting intentionally against the spirit , if not the letter , of the law .
They have discredited the City of London 's reputation across the world .
That culture is set at the very top of a bank .
If directors are pushing hard for profits at any cost , employees will bend the rules accordingly .
Compliance departments are there to guard against it , but in many British banks , they have a lowly status .
British regulators are talking about a crackdown , but little has actually changed .
So who can blame New York for taking a tough stance ?
Our banks have brought it on themselves ."
2012-11-03,"The Effect , London Much anticipation for the latest play from Lucy Prebble , whose Enron was showered with awards , except on Broadway where the dynamically - staged tale of the US financial scandal was rather less favourably received ( ca n't think why ) .
The Effect is described as "" a clinical romance "" – set as it is in a clinic where two volunteers for a pharmaceutical trial fall in love – that explores sanity , neurology and the limits of medicine .
So not just a love story , we can expect some intellectual fireworks from Prebble too : she 's reunited with Enron director Rupert Goold , who brings Miriam Buether , designer of his Earthquakes in London production .

When Dominic Cooke leaves the Royal Court next year he can point to a theatre bursting with varied life .
What has happened under his artistic directorship is more interesting than his declared intent at his inaugural press conference , when he said he was going to scrutinise the middle classes and the powerful .
If he had done only that , he would have presided over a limited stage , one that was , for example , a fairly female - free zone .
The reverse has been the case .
He has helped to get us to the point where journalists no longer feel it necessary to call dramatists without penises "" women playwrights "" .
More important , he has time after time astonished audiences with different kinds of fresh writing .
The play that above all made manifest the success of these years was Jez Butterworth 's Jerusalem , which caught at the hearts of a young theatre audience with its rock ruralism , anarchic romanticism and the magnificence of Mark Rylance .
In fact , its talents spring from an earlier Court era , when Ian Rickson was the artistic director who brought on the male playwright
Butterworth as one of his main talents .
The phenomenon of Jerusalem has spawned the phenomenon that is The River : a work that is utterly different in scale – a chamber piece not a symphony – but one that has made people queue for hours .
One woman told me it had been worth getting up at a quarter to four to make sure of a ticket .
On a non - press day , at least two - thirds of the audience stayed behind for a fizzing Q&amp;A. People subscribe to the Court as they once subscribed to libraries , knowing they will get new sustenance .
Perplexity , rapture and inquisitiveness seem to have made those spectators want to debate a play in which , as someone pointed out , rhythm sometimes seems more important than sense .
Another actor suggested the drama might help audience members to end unsatisfactory relationships .
No two people will agree about what happens on stage , and the plot can not be described without damage .
It involves a man , some women and fishing .
It seems on the brink of revealing a murder or a ghost .
It pivots on obsessionalism , duplicity and the swirl of time .
Miranda Raison is nicely strained ; Laura Donnelly melts beautifully .
Dominic West burns slow but sure as the rough - hewn male , confessional but withheld .
He throws off with ease the hard task of dealing in overripe language – a trout he has landed is like "" God 's tongue "" .
In a Rickson production , sensations roll off the stage and into the stalls . ""
Have a good time in the cabin , "" someone said to me as I went into the auditorium .
Fifteen years ago , Rickson 's production of Conor McPherson 's The Weir brokered a new intimacy with the audience , making them feel they were lounging in a country pub .
Now he inveigles spectators into sharing the splintery space – compact but big enough to contain a welcoming range and a dark secret under the bed – that has been skilfully designed by Ultz to suggest the wildness of an English rural retreat .
Charles Balfour 's lighting wraps the action in a glow fringed with darkness : it is perpetual sunset ; bad news always seems about to break .
Ian Dickinson 's imaginative sound design makes a deep interior experience .
Even before the house lights go down , the play begins to penetrate the audience with the murmur of birdsong , the sound of water gushing .
Stephen Warbeck 's musical setting of a Yeats poem weaves through the action .
A long wordless sequence in which West guts and cooks an enormous trout is made vibrant partly by the actor 's competence (
"" Was that dill in the middle ? ""
asked someone at the Q&amp;A ) and also by the magnified clarity of cabin noises : the roar of fire and clank of knives .
Jerusalem was the most smell - filled of plays .
The River offers some tanginess too – whiffs of chopped wood and cooking fish can be caught by those in the front rows .
Meanwhile Cooke has given the bigger Court stage over to less established , though quickly rising names .
Lucy Kirkwood , here making her Royal Court debut , has updated Hedda Gabler , written the gory Tinderbox , and niftily encapsulated paradoxes of the women 's movement in a play about Greenham Common ; the results of a collaboration with Katie Mitchell can be seen next month in Hansel and Gretel at the National .
Her new play , NSFW , is directed by one of the theatre 's zooming talents , Simon Godwin .
The result is quick and acerbic : a satire with no subtext but with an effective glance at what drives people to become disgusting .
NSFW is text - talk for Not Safe for Work : initials designed to warn about online material that people might not feel easy looking at in public .
It would be a brilliant wheeze to write a play about this : secrecy in that least secret of places , the theatre , carries an extra charge .
Actually that is not what Kirkwood has done .
Her drama , set in two all - too - plausible shag mags , has two intertwining tales , both involving desperation and betrayal .
Doghouse magazine discovers that one of the many pairs of breasts it has flaunted belongs to a 14-year - old : an inflamed unemployed father threatens legal action , but turns out both to be a regular "" reader "" of the mag and to be too broke not to take a payoff .
Meanwhile Electra , a lethal Photoshopped fashion publication , invites prospective employees to ring the bad bits of women and say why those bits should be banished : this causes a naive young man who likes Dickens , puffins and his girlfriend ( Sacha Dhawan renders him with sad - sack precision ) to turn venal – because he has no money .
In both halves , the stars are a special breed : predators .
Julian Barratt from The Mighty Boosh presides with lolling contempt and just - concealed anxiety over his squalid – "" the articles are shit "" – pages .
In charge of Electra , Janie Dee scythes her high - heeled , cleavage - friendly way through her staff with a face as frozen as her assets are available .
Kirkwood 's language is light and her targets are not highly contentious – the stage could do without another pot shot at Margaret Thatcher – but her aim is good ."
2012-11-14,"How do you follow a big hit ?
Just as Jez Butterworth succeeded Jerusalem with the more modest The River , so Lucy Prebble follows her spectacular Enron with an intimate four - hander that examines love , depression and the limitations of neuroscience .
It 's an absorbing , if slightly diagrammatic , drama immaculately directed by Rupert Goold in a joint production between Headlong and the National Theatre .
Prebble 's setting is a posh clinic where paid volunteers take part in pharmaceutical drug trials .
We meet two of the guinea pigs : Tristan , a boisterously flirty Ulsterman , and Connie , a bright psychology student .
As they take ever stronger dosages , they are closely monitored by a psychiatrist , Lorna , who is herself being supervised by another doctor , Toby , with whom she enjoys an edgily tense relationship .
But , escaping Lorna 's policing , Tristan and Connie start to fall in love .
What they are not sure of is whether their newfound passion is instinctive or a byproduct of dopamine .
Prebble uses the situation to explore some big questions mostly articulated in the debates between the two doctors .
Toby passionately argues that we are witnessing an epidemic of depression which is the result of a chemical imbalance that can be cured by medication .
Lorna takes the opposite view : that "" so - called depressed people have a more accurate view of the world "" and that the cause of their illness often lies in external factors .
Prebble herself clearly leans towards the latter view just as she shows that the love between Tristan and Connie depends on something deeper than artificial stimulants .
It 's a fascinating debate , but I feel Prebble overstresses the parallels between the two couples .
For a play that supports the validity of the heart 's affections , it often seems strangely cerebral ; and there is a certain structural neatness about the way Tristan 's instinctive ardour is matched by Lorna 's own longstanding depression .
But at least the play is questioning and profoundly wary of what Steven Poole in the programme calls the idea that neuroscience "" has a right to become the ultimate arbiter of any human activity "" .
The piece is also beautifully staged by Goold in a Miriam Buether set that turns the Cottesloe into a clinical institution filled with beige banquettes .
And the acting is excellent throughout .
Billie Piper , as she proved in Treats and Reasons to Be Pretty , has a strong stage presence , and endows Connie with a glowing warmth and palpable hunger for love .
Jonjo O'Neill is equally good as the volatile Tristan , who is randy , funny and disobedient , even if I found it difficult to believe that the character 's susceptibility to seizure would n't have been checked in advance .
But Anastasia Hille and Tom Goodman - Hill carry the main burden of the play 's argument , and do so with utter conviction .
There is a wiry tenseness to Hille that makes her confession of the character 's depression totally plausible .
And Goodman - Hill has the right mix of assurance and guilt that comes from a man who believes that antidepressants are a universal cure - all .
It 's not a flawless play , but it 's a palpably intelligent one that proves Enron was not a flash in the pan and that Prebble is one of the long line of dramatists who view medical practice with a rational scepticism ."

2013-05-29,"I complained of Lucy Kirkwood 's last play , NSFW at London 's Royal Court , that it was too short : no such problems with this gloriously rich , mind - expanding three - hour play , which explores the complex relationship between China and America .
Co - produced by the Almeida and touring company
Headlong , it has the extravagant scale and swagger of the latter 's version of Lucy Prebble 's Enron .
Kirkwood 's play takes the form of a quest .
Joe Schofield , a fictional American photojournalist who snapped the lone protester confronting a tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , gets a tip - off that the man may now be living in the US : this leads him on a journey through America 's Chinese community , in the course of which he jeopardises his job , his friendships and his affair with a British market researcher .
In Beijing , meanwhile , Joe 's chief contact , Zhang Lin , has problems of his own .
Outraged at the death of a 59-year - old neighbour through smog poisoning , Zhang Lin leaks the story to Joe , only to find himself being tortured by the authorities and losing the love of his factory - foreman brother . ""
Chimerica "" was a term coined by economist Niall Ferguson to indicate the global dominance of the dual country that is China and America .
But Kirkwood 's play highlights the sharp differences , as well as the similarities , between the twin superpowers .
In America , Joe 's bolshie individualism as a photographer who records world events is ultimately celebrated ; in China , Zhang Lin , who has already suffered for his involvement in the Tiananmen protests , pays a heavy price for inciting unrest .
Kirkwood goes even further in examining the nature of capitalism in both countries .
China may be open to western investment and apparently enthralled by its products ; at the same time , Joe 's girlfriend Tessa , in a brilliant presentation - speech to her clients , explains that the only way into its markets is to understand that China is a country that values the supremacy of its culture .
Among a host of other issues , Kirkwood deals with the ethics and practice of photojournalism ; and this is dazzlingly reflected in Es Devlin 's design , in which blown up , contact - sheet images are projected on to a revolving cube .
Lyndsey Turner 's astonishingly filmic production keeps the action driving forward through 39 scenes and boasts an impressive array of performances .
Stephen Campbell Moore precisely captures Joe 's mix of reckless idealism and self - absorption , Benedict Wong eloquently conveys Zhang Lin 's private grief and public defiance , and there is exemplary work from Claudie Blakley as the sharp - tongued Tessa and Sean Gilder as a battered reporter .

2013-06-21,"The former chief executive of Enron , jailed for his role in the collapse of the energy giant , could be free before the end of the decade after he was given a shorter sentence as a result of an agreement with prosecutors .
Jeff Skilling , who was originally sentenced to more than 24 years in 2006 , was resentenced to 14 years at a court in Houston on Friday .
A federal judge in signed off on an agreement betwee Skilling and federal prosecutors , under which he will drop his appeal and forfeit $ 40 m in assets seized by the government .
Skilling was given the longest sentence of any executive involved in the 2001 collapse of Enron , once one of the world 's largest energy companies .
The company 's fall was one of the biggest business scandals of the decade , costing thousands their jobs and wiping out billions for shareholders and pensioners .
In May 2006 , Skilling was convicted on 19 charges including conspiracy , insider trading , securities fraud and making false statements to auditors .
US district judge Sim Lake sentenced Skilling to 292 months – more than 24 years – in prison .
The founder of Enron , Kenneth Lay , was also found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud .
He died of heart failure six weeks after the trial ended .
An appeals court ruled in 2009 that Skilling had been the victim of misapplied sentencing guidelines , a ruling that made inevitable a reduction in his sentence .
Skilling 's resentencing was delayed for years , however , as he fought to overturn his convictions .
He has consistently maintained his innocence .
In 2010 the supreme court ruled one of Skilling 's convictions was flawed and that prosecutors had overreached themselves using the "" honest services "" fraud law .
But that decision did not lead to a retrial , as Skilling had hoped .
In May prosecutors brokered a deal with Skilling to reduce his sentence in return for the end of his appeals and an agreement to forfeit the seized assets .
Enron 's collapse wiped out more than $ 2bn in employee pensions , $ 60bn in Enron stock and cost thousands their jobs .
The $ 40 m seized by the government will be distributed to victims of Enron 's fraud .
"" The investigation and prosecution of [ Skilling ] has been ongoing for more than 10 years , "" the agreement stated .
"" The government has invested extraordinary resources into this case during a lengthy investigation , pre - trial litigation , trial and extensive post - trial litigation before the District court , the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court .
In the absence of this agreement , the parties anticipate substantial ongoing litigation .
By the terms of this agreement , [ Skilling 's ] convictions will become final . """
2013-07-09,"The biggest obstacle to tackling environmental crisis , according to sustainability experts polled last year , is lack of political will .
If that 's true , then why do n't we give more attention to understanding political will and ways to cultivate it ?
The Enron scandal offers a teaching tale of what happens in business when political will is lacking .
Before its bankruptcy in 2001 , Enron 's website described the organisation as a "" global corporate citizen "" aiming to live by its motto of "" respect , integrity , communication and excellence "" .
After its fall , Lynn Brewer , a former Enron executive , said , "" there are two equally destructive forces in every corporation : those who will commit fraud and those who will be complacent towards it . ""
She estimates that while 20 to 40 people at Enron actually committed fraud , another two thirds sat back and watched it .
While Enron might seem an extreme example , it is not uncommon for organisations to have great sounding value statements but lack the political will to live by them .
If we want the values of sustainability to be taken seriously , how do we grow in our culture the desire and determination to change the way we do things ?
A key factor influencing human behaviour is what we see others do .
If other people see us being complacent , they are more likely to become so too .
So if we want to influence political will , a good place to start is with ourselves , looking at what strengthens or obstructs our own will to make a difference .
Having worked as an addictions specialist for nearly two decades , I 've learned that motivation is not a static feature found in some people and absent in others .
Rather we can learn ways to grow this precious renewable resource .
A useful first step is to pay attention to our own experience , noticing the triggers to feeling pushed or pulled .
By spotting the rises and falls in our inclination to act , we can both learn ways to feed it and understand how it gets blocked .
In health psychology , the term teachable moment is used to describe a time when someone is troubled by symptoms related to their behaviour .
For example , a smoker 's motivation to stop is likely to be higher if they 've been up in the night coughing .
Symptoms can serve as wake up calls that inspire the desire for change .
A stronger form of this is the hitting rock bottom of an addicts recovery , where crisis becomes a crucial turning point .
The principle here is that our own distress can provide inspirational dissatisfaction that mobilises our determination to act .
Does this principle of inspirational dissatisfaction mean we have to wait for a catastrophe before there 's enough political will to change things ?
Unfortunately rock bottoms are n't always a hit .
They can also be masked , and understanding how this happens reveals some of the barriers to growing political will .
If the smoker does n't connect their disturbed sleep with their cigarettes , then being up all night coughing has no motivational impact .
In a similar way , if we do n't see the rise in extreme weather events as anything to do with climate change , we miss potential opportunities to strengthen our will .
In July 2004 , the UK government 's chief scientist Sir David King warned that , "" on current trends , cities like London , New York and New Orleans will be among the first to go "" .
Since then , two of these cities have been flooded by storm surge from unusually powerful hurricanes ; masking rock bottom involves hiding away any reference here to climate change .
When predictions criticised as alarmist begin coming true , a healthy hitting bottom includes feelings of alarm .
I know I 'm touching on disturbing themes here , yet might one of the main blocks to political will simply be the idea that this stuff is too depressing to look at ?
To tackle a challenge , we need to give it our attention .
Fortunately there are insights and strategies that help .
One of the most successful treatments in the addictions field is an approach called motivational interviewing .
Its core idea is that you do n't motivate people by telling them they should change ; rather , through using an encouraging listening style , you support them to voice their own concerns .
When people listen to themselves making their own argument for change , they 're more moved to act .
Over thirty years ago , US author and activist Joanna Macy discovered this same principle when developing workshops to help strengthen people 's capacity address their concerns about the world .
When describing what helps us grow our will , she said : "" The person people most need to hear from is themselves "" .
Her workshops take participants on a transformative journey through four areas that fuel our commitment to act .
The first is gratitude : research shows this emotion not only improves our wellbeing and resilience , it also increases our willingness to act for others .
The second stage is to witness our own and each other 's concerns for our world , making room for the range of feelings that accompany them .
By expressing grief for what has already been lost , we unmask and hit the rock bottoms already reached .
By naming our concerns for the future we 're heading into , we raise the rock bottom , further activating our motivation .
While expressing our concerns can strengthen our will , the experience of powerlessness can sap it .
So the third stage involves seeing with new eyes , drawing on perspectives that help open up our power to make a difference .
The last stage of going forth applies action - planning tools to move from concerns to visions to practical steps we can see ourselves taking .
We do n't have to wait till London goes the way of New Orleans or New York before political will is activated .
We can learn ways to build on the motivation we already have , strengthening and enhancing our determination and resolve .
Who knows what might become possible when we do this .

2013-08-22,"Transferring a five - star hit play from one theatre to another is always a tricky business .
But it 's fair to say that Lucy Kirkwood 's Chimerica looks every bit as good at the West End 's Harold Pinter as it did at the Almeida .
It 's also worth recalling that the play is much more than an overnight sensation : it was commissioned and nurtured over a six - year period by Headlong and is in the epic style of its obvious predecessor
, Lucy Prebble 's Enron .
Seeing it again earlier this week , what struck me was Kirkwood 's success in balancing private and public worlds .
Her play is partly about the personal quest by an American photojournalist , Joe Schofield , to discover the whereabouts of the lone protester who confronted a tank in Tiananmen Square in 1989 ; but it is also about the similarities and differences between China and America and their mutual misunderstanding of each other .
Those are big issues for any one play .
As a study of a journalist , the play sees Joe 's shortcomings without launching into an attack on his profession .
I was reminded of another recent drama , Vivienne Franzmann 's The Witness , which arraigned its photographer hero for achieving fame at the expense of other people 's misery .
But Kirkwood 's Joe is a much more complex figure .
He jeopardises the safety of his Chinese source , fails to look after the source 's US - based nephew and sacrifices his own lovelife to his hunger for a story .
At the same time , Joe is a genuine idealist , pursuing his quest in the teeth of opposition from an expenses - conscious editor .
We are used in drama to the journalist as villain .
Kirkwood instead shows the journalist as muddled antihero driven by an ungovernable obsession .
But this is also a political play about the dynamic tension between the two global superpowers .
In Kirkwood 's view , China is a country still suffering the social consequences of a speeded - up economic revolution : it is also a place that "" values the supremacy of its culture above all else "" .
America , meanwhile , is economically dependent on China while buying into the myth that it is simply a vast market awaiting exploitation .
Neither country , Kirkwood suggests , understands the other , and never will until there is a real exchange of ideas and information .
This makes Chimerica sound dry .
It is anything but , in Lyndsey Turner 's exhilarating production and Es Devlin 's design .
A Guardian colleague I bumped into said he thought the play was a bit like television .
I disagree profoundly : it is certainly filmic in its speed and multiplicity of short scenes , but it is also overwhelmingly theatrical in its ability to relate character to issues and to come up with astonishing images .
When a body tumbles out of a refrigerator in the Beijing apartment of Benedict Wong 's Zhang Lin we are in the realm of the ultra - theatrical , a million miles away from the bland realism of television .

2013-09-13,"In the five years since 7.56am on Monday 15 September 2008 , when a judge put the UK arm of Lehman Brothers into administration , Tony Lomas has been unravelling the $ 1.1bn ( £ 700 m ) of assets and liabilities inside the collapsed bank .
Even for this partner at the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , who has unwound companies as diverse as the Maxwell empire and the British arm of collapsed energy group
Enron , the sums involved that fateful and unforgettable Monday morning were eyewatering , even scary .
The 56-year - old restructuring expert had watched the minutes ticking on the clock awaiting the decision from the judge , knowing the London market would start trading at 8 am and that mayhem could unfold .
He did not want to contemplate what might happen "" as soon as 8 o'clock came and the payments were due "" .
Even now , five years on , he admits he finds it hard to believe that the US authorities allowed Lehman Brothers to fail , causing the domino effect on its entities around the world .
Sitting in his corner office high up on the 23rd floor in a Canary Wharf tower , Lomas recalls : "" I was disbelieving that it could have been allowed to happen because I could see what would unfold would be immense . ""
Unlike many of the other administrations the industry veteran has worked on , Lomas had barely any warning that Lehman was heading for the wall .
It was a Saturday night and he was having a Chinese meal with his family in his favourite Essex restaurant when he took a call from Elizabeth Lee , lead lawyer for Lehman in London , who had been advised to prepare for the possibility that that the Wall Street firm might go bust over the weekend .
She told Lomas she needed him to make plans – completely in secret – in case a rescue operation for Lehman across the Atlantic failed .
"" I started to have confidential conversations with my relevant service line leaders .
If we had to walk in on Monday morning , I needed an army , "" Lomas said .
But it was all about trust . ""
Lehman had n't gone bust .
I was only there in case it did , "" he said .
The events that unfolded that weekend have now gone down in history as some of the dramatic in the financial world .
No one had expected Lehman Brothers to fail – the US authorities had orchestrated a takeover of another troubled firm Bear Stearns only six months earlier – and the decision by the US to refuse to rescue it led to fears about the stability of other banks .
Once the judge pulled the plug , Lomas needed to set about understanding the structure of the bank – formally known in the UK as Lehman Brothers International ( Europe ) – and finding out if he could pay the 5,500 staff based at the London headquarters of 25 Bank Street .
He had to find the money to pay the staff , as £ 3bn of cash had been swept across the Atlantic on the Friday night to the parent company .
With the parent bankrupt , the London arm had no money to pay it staff or make payments on any of its bills .
Lomas admits that the next 10 weeks were chaotic as his team tried to assemble a plan .
Within the first days , 2,500 staff transferred to Japanese bank Nomura , which took on the equities business in Britain .
By Christmas the headcount had fallen to 700 and shortly afterwards reached 500 .
Now Lehman Brothers International ( Europe ) employs 500 staff – including frontline traders and back office lawyers – complemented by 200 or so from PwC , all under Lomas .
He points out that the operation is still a bank , regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority .
"" We 've recruited .
Many were previously here , others were not .
We 've gone out of our way to create a business - as - usual environment .
We provide rewards , we pay market [ rates ] .
We have a training programme , we have objective - setting and appraisals .
There are bonus systems and promotion and disciplinary procedures .
This is a business , "" Lomas says .
Five years ago , his concern had been about the risks of taking on a job that was so big and unprecedented .
"" I was thinking about the big risk for PwC. Would we be able to control the risk ?
The value would be eroded and we would be blamed and it would take a long term to control the situation .
When stakeholders and customers of the bank are at risk of losing hundreds of millions or billions of pounds , situations can become very litigious and those are very scary numbers to be litigated , "" he said .
For the most part , the situation did not spiral out of control .
Some hedge funds had money locked into Lehman , with shares in banks and other entities , and needed it back .
Walking in the door of 25 Bank Street – now the offices of JP Morgan –
Lomas said he drew upon plans his company had used ( and are still using ) to unravel the UK arm of Enron , which collapsed in 2001 .
The experience led to his discussing with regulators ways to draw up contingency plans for banks in the future .
Ideas like this have become known as living wills – though five years on from the crisis few are yet ready to be tested and Lomas gesticulates that such a plan could easily create a 2ft - high paper stack .
If he had one for Lehman , it "" might have removed 25 % of the uncertainty and reduced the instability and the chaos , but people would still have panicked "" .
This month he intends to make another payment to creditors on top of £ 13.6bn already handed back and admits that the 10-year lease in the corner of Citigroup 's tower in Canary Wharf will expire before the job is done .
He will have retired – PwC requires partners to leave at 60 – but he can already see creditors in Lehman getting their money back , racking up fees of £ 1bn for PwC in the process .
"" There is a reasonable chance now that we have enough money to pay the ordinary unsecured creditors in full .
Then there is the shareholder claims .
At that level of recovery , I 've still got enough money .
It is possible in due course that we will prove this company was balance - sheet solvent .
It did n't fail the balance - sheet test .
What it failed was the cashflow test – it could n't pay its debts when they fell due . """

2014-01-28,"The whistleblower on the failings of the BBC 's Digital Media Initiative , the IT project scrapped last year at a cost of nearly £ 100 m to licence fee payers , has claimed figures used to justify continuing with the initiative were "" like Enron "" .
In written evidence published by the Commons public accounts committee on Tuesday ahead of a hearing into the DMI debacle that will take place on 3 February , Bill Garrett , a former BBC employee , said he believed that four years ago "" a number of staff knowingly falsified estimates of financial benefits "" in order to secure further funding for the project .
Garrett also called on the BBC to investigate further his belief that "" certain individuals acted wilfully to subvert governance processes and falsify value propositions so as to deceive the various governance panels "" .
He challenged evidence given by former BBC director general Mark Thompson to the PAC in 2011 about the progress of DMI .
Thompson has been recalled to appear before the PAC again on 3 February to face further questions about DMI , along with former BBC finance chief Zarin Patel , trustee Anthony Fry , ex - chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and BBC operations director Dominic Coles .
The ambitious DMI scheme was supposed to do away with the need for videotapes across the BBC and use digital technology to call up archive footage , but it was axed in May 2013 , after £ 98.4 m had been spent , to avoid "" throwing good money after bad "" .
Garrett , the former head of technology for BBC Vision Productions , warned BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten in May 2012 that DMI was doomed .
He told the PAC that in 2010 the predicted cost of DMI not going ahead was increased from £ 7 m to £ 15 m , ahead of an application to the BBC finance board for further funding .
According to Garrett 's damning statement they were "" unjustified figures in my view "" and there was not enough "" proper scrutiny "" .
He said : "" The revised investment case ... of April / May 2010 , which sought funds to continue DMI 's development in - house was a fundamentally flawed proposition consequently placing public funds at significant risk .
I believe a number of staff knowingly falsified estimates of financial benefits to ensure case approval . ""
Garrett added that during one meeting in February 2010 : "" I describe the numbers as ' like Enron ' , referring to the approach of adjusting estimated figures to suit needs rather than being based on pragmatic rationale . ""
He told the PAC that having previously worked as an investigative journalist at the BBC on a film about failed US energy company Enron , he "" felt qualified to draw this comparison "" .
Garrett also called into question evidence given by Thompson and former BBC director of future media and technology , Erik Huggers , to the PAC in February 2011 , during which the committee was told DMI was "" out in the business "" and on track to be rolled out at BBC North and in Scotland .
Thompson , who left the BBC in September 2012 and is now New York Times chief executive , has been recalled to appear before the PAC again in over his DMI evidence .
Garrett said at the time "" the BBC was still to commission the design and delivery of the infrastructure for DMI , which brings into question their evidence "" .
He also found "" it difficult not to conclude that the National Audit Office was mislead during their previous 2010/11 investigation "" .
Garrett , who left the BBC in the summer of 2010 , said he gave a series of warnings during his time at the corporation , beginning in 2009 , that the project was in trouble but they were dismissed .
He subsequently received a departmental email from a senior BBC executive saying : "" These are our colleagues , not a third party we are testing for credibility .

Garrett said he was "" shocked "" by this as "" it was crucial to determine the credibility of DMI ahead of its business case application for further funding "" .
He added that a production colleague commented to him : "" I think we 're being told to shut up . ""
He concluded : "" Too many staff members and contractors ' jobs depended on DMI continuing , many of them recognised the project had little chance of success however speaking up would impact their careers and livelihood . ""
Many senior[BBC ] figures had reputations invested in DMI .
The resulting behaviours ensured that concerns external to DMI were either dismissed or shut down and business cases and other approvals were simply waived through without proper scrutiny . ""

2014-02-22,"The collapse of Kodak and Enron shows what can happen when businesses fail to manage their businesses ethically or invest in the long term .
Business leaders at Davos , including Indra Nooyi , chairman and CEO of PepsiCo , called for "" corporations to use their influence on business schools to shift business education away from its emphasis on short - term profits "" .
However , many corporations still ca n't see beyond the short term and the value of corporate social responsibility remains elusive .
"" The golden decade of CSR , from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s , has evolved to a starker , more competitive , bottom - line focus in the post - recession world , "" said Peter Robinson , CEO of the David Suzuki Foundation , a Canadian NGO whose mission is to protect the diversity of nature .
"" This is largely because firms now view further CSR as a cost , rather than a core business advantage . ""
Most civil society leaders believe that businesses need to adopt a longer - term view that puts a higher priority on people and the environment .
However , NGO leaders with whom I spoke also gave examples that illustrate how shared social and business goals can be achieved and measured – even in the short term .
The Collective Impact approach , coined by John Kania and Mark Kramer , may have the potential to accelerate social change and deliver quantifiable results . ""
In Australia we are witnessing a greater capacity for corporations to collaborate with other stakeholders ( eg government , other corporations and not for profits ) to take a Collective Impact approach with their strategy of social change , "" wrote Louise Walsh , CEO of Philanthropy Australia .
Walsh cited the example of Platform 70 , a collaboration initiated in 2011 .
International bank UBS , law firm Freehills and property firm Colliers partnered with the United Way , the City of Sydney , mental health provider Neami , and community housing provider Bridge Housing to successfully bring down the number of rough sleepers for the first time in decades .
"" This is an outstanding example of members applying their intellectual rigour and funding to create a better civil society and break entrenched disadvantage , "" said Walsh .
Businesses that have put social change into their core have no trouble linking short - term profits with social purpose .
Robinson noted Bullfrog Power , a company whose mission is to provide Canadians with 100 % renewable energy , as an example .
"" I think Bullfrog is a company where the founders believed that they could make money and stay true to their mission at the same time , "" said Robinson .
For companies such as Bullfrog Power , every dollar of profit is also a measure of environmental responsibility .
Focusing on short - term profits is n't always a bad thing .
However , many civil society leaders also believe that a different approach is needed – one that involves a sustained commitment to working with non - profit organisations to achieve bold social goals .
"" To be truly socially responsible , businesses need to re - orient themselves to the source of their products and to human and long - term values , "" said Glenda Yoder , associate director of Farm Aid , a US non - profit organisation that serves as the public defender of family farms .
Darell Hammond , CEO and founder of KaBoom ! , a non - profit organisation that creates play spaces for children , believes that corporations looking to truly become catalysts of social good need to become transformational partners , investing and coupling with non - profits to work toward a shared goal .
For KaBoom !
's corporate partners this means signing up to a new goal to ensure that the 16 million US children who live in poverty get the active play they need to become healthy and successful adults .
KaBoom ! 's partners include the Mattel Foundation , which supported an in - depth study investigating how to make playgrounds more engaging and appealing for all children , and the Humana Foundation , which allowed KaBOOM !
to bring together thought leaders , municipal decision makers , and other stakeholders at its inaugural Playful City USA Leaders ' Summit . ""
These transformational partners funded foundational initiatives , laying the groundwork for our organisation to start evaluating our work from an end - goal perspective , rather than one that uses outputs as proxies for success , "" said Hammond . ""
In doing so , they diverged from traditional CSR efforts that may see short - term outputs as ' good enough ' to funding programming with an eye towards long - term success . ""
As demonstrated by KaBoom ! 's work with Mattel and Humana , layering social change on to a conventional business purpose is possible .
Companies such as Bullfrog illustrate that potential for businesses designed with CSR in mind in the first place to link short - term results with social change .
And Platform 70 shows that new models of collaboration such as Collective Impact could be the best way to solve some of the most difficult social challenges .
Non -
profit executives are cautiously optimistic about the potential for corporations to better address issues in a way that also translates into profits .
"" Social change is normally about the difficult things in life – improving your mental health , changing behaviours , achieving tipping points for key groups in our society , "" said Paul Farmer , CEO of Mind .
"" It 's been a long time since we 've seen a major corporation take that lead ( certainly in the UK ) to address a difficult subject , and yet it can be hugely valuable to your brand , your customers and your staff . ""
Civil society leaders do n't believe that a one - size - fits all solution exists .
Broad generalisations do a disservice to the growing number of companies that are making money and making a difference at the same time .

2014-07-14,"Like her 2009 play Enron , Lucy Prebble ’s
The Effect is a play of ideas , which sets two arguments against one another and methodically works through them .
This sort of well - made play is frustrating for the lack of abandon and the tightly controlled , convenient plot turns that support a neat discussion of the given topic ; in this case materialism ( we are nothing more than our physical brains ) and dualism ( the mind is elevated from the physical brain ) in the mind - body problem of philosophy .
That said , Prebble ’s writing is clear and punchy and this production , directed by Sarah Goodes at Sydney Theatre Company , is good .
The Effect follows psychology student Connie ( Anna McGahan ) and class clown Tristan ( Mark Leonard Winter ) as they sign up to participate in a clinical trial for a new anti - depressant .
They become amorous fairly quickly but ca n’t be sure if it ’s love or just their elevated dopamine levels .
The trial ’s organisers , psychiatrist Dr James ( Angie Milliken ) and drug developer Toby ( Eugene Gilfedder ) , have quite some trouble keeping the drug - crossed lovers compliant .
The play is unashamedly educational ; we learn of what the Stroop Effect is , that placebos work really well and
we ’re not so much taught about the brain in a vat thought experiment as we are shown a cute version of it –
that is , Toby carries his father ’s preserved brain around in a white plastic bucket .
The play is also topical considering the recent open letter from 130 scientists to the European Commission criticising the management of the Human Brain Project , and similar commentary from Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at New York University , recognising that neuroscience alone will not provide us the bridge between brain and mind .
But there are a couple of implausible leaps we ’re asked to take with this play .
The hospital staff seem to have no control over the participants and Dr James is scandalised by the fact that the clinical trial is "" double - blind "" to prevent bias ( as clinical trials usually are ) ; but hey , it 's acceptable in the name of drama .
And drama is in no short supply here .
McGahan and Winter are likeable as young lovers and the more complicated , mature relationship between Milliken and Gilfedder is just as compelling .
Goodes’ direction is strong , apart from a schmaltzy lovers’ dance representing Connie and Tristan ’s first night together .
Sex on stage is never fun , but turning it into a dance is n’t fooling anyone .
Considering that in a study of anti - depressant usage among 33 OECD nations Australians are second only to Iceland , this play will have broad appeal .
It ’s an ambitious undertaking on Prebble ’s part and she never offers any answers , other than the vague comfort that kindness is enduring .
The Effect is playing at Sydney Theatre Company until 16 August"

2015-01-28,"The Church of Scientology , the subject of a scathing new film from Enron and Wikileaks documentarian Alex Gibney , has intensified its campaign to combat what it calls ‘ false information’ in the documentary .
A special report published on the Scientology website Freedom seeks to discredit Gibney ’s film
Going Clear :
Scientology and the Prison of Belief , which premiered at Sundance this week .
A new Twitter account , Freedom Media Ethics , has been set up to promote the site .
In the film , based on Lawrence ’s Wright ’s muckraking book of the same name , Gibney talks to defectors from the church , including Crash director Paul Haggis .
He explores the history of the religion from its founder L Ron Hubbard through to current leader David Miscavige , who is accused during the film of intimidating , beating and imprisoning insubordinate followers ; high - profile followers like Tom Cruise also have their involvement raked over .
The Church is now distancing itself from the ex - members who feature in Gibney ’s film .
“ Wright and Gibney cherry - picked expelled , discredited former Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda , ” the website reads .
“
The one - sided result is as dishonest as Gibney ’s sources .
”
They lambast Gibney ’s choice of Haggis as a contributor , saying Haggis had n’t been involved in the religion for decades leading up to his departure from it , and that “ all he did was read falsehoods on a blog by anti - Scientology zealot Marty Rathbun ” .
A long article on the site is devoted to individually discrediting Gibney ’s sources .
The Church claims it tried to get in touch with Gibney and HBO regarding his sources , but they were rebuffed ; Gibney meanwhile has said that the Church resisted his invitation for comment .
On Twitter meanwhile , the Church is trying to drum up a viral campaign against the film , comparing it to Rolling Stone ’s article about rape at the University of Virginia , which was shown to have discrepancies and inaccuracies .
It links to a New York Times advertisement it took out earlier in the month entitled “
Is Alex Gibney ’s
Upcoming HBO ‘ Documentary’ a Rolling Stone / UVA Redux ?
”
Going Clear will screen on US network HBO later in the year ."
2015-06-28,"Alex Gibney is n’t just one of America ’s most prolific documentary makers , he ’s also one of the best .
He ’s taken on whistleblowers ( We Steal Secrets : The Story of Wikileaks ) , corporate corruption ( Enron :
The Smartest Guys in the Room ) and the war on terror ( Taxi to the Dark Side ) , for which he won an Oscar for best documentary .
Esquire has described him as “ becoming the most important documentarian of our time ” .
Exploring the murky terrain between truth and lies has become something of a speciality ( he ’d finished a film on Lance Armstrong ’s comeback when revelations about his doping finally came out .
Gibney went back and remade the entire film ) .
It ’s a skill that comes to the fore again in his latest work , which turns its attention to the Church of Scientology , described by the New York Times as “ maybe his most perfect subject yet ” .
Going Clear :
Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a forensic examination of the religion invented wholesale by the science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard , 50 years ago .
Gibney does n’t just dwell on the wackier elements ( Thetans , a galactic overlord called Xenu ,
humans frozen 75 m years ago and dropped into volcanoes ) but on the very human stories at the heart of it : why perfectly ordinary people ( and not so ordinary people , like Tom Cruise and John Travolta ) have been drawn to it .
Using the eyewitness accounts of former high - ranking officials from within the church and previously unseen archive footage , he builds a picture of a powerful , multinational organisation that controls its followers through abuse and fear – and takes on all critics .
The film is being released in the UK this week despite legal attempts by the church to prevent it .
So , what first sparked your interest in Scientology ?
I ’d just finished a film on sex abuse , clerical sex abuse in the Catholic church , called Mea Maxima Culpa , and I ’d been thinking about these issues of faith and belief and also corruption , specifically noble - cause corruption , where the end justifies the means .
I was thinking about some of these issues and then Larry Wright sent me his book [ Going Clear : Scientology , Hollywood and the Prison of Belief ] .
I ’d been offered an opportunity to do a Scientology film in the past , and turned it down .
But when I read Larry ’s book I felt I had to do it , because it was about some of those ideas I ’d been thinking about already .
And Larry ’s focus on this notion of the prison of belief was very powerful .
A lot of stuff on Scientology in the past had been very focused on the wacky stuff and neglected the broader context .
One of the things that comes across very powerfully in the film is how credible and normal the people you interview are … and yet were involved with Scientology for years .
Was that something you found difficult to get your head round at first ?
Yes , it was .
And I spent more time than I would have thought asking them about how they got into it .
Because I was so impressed with them as people
and I was curious to know what led them there in the first place .
And then also what it was that broke their faith .
They were these really interesting , vital , discerning people and it kind of turned my head around .
I think there is a tendency in all of us to think ,
“ I would never do something like that , how could people be so stupid ?
”
And by spending time with these folks , it seemed very evident that any of us could have gone there under the right circumstances .
One of your interviewees is Paul Haggis , who ’s an almost exact peer to you in that you ’re both Oscar - winning film - makers .
[ Haggis wrote and produced Million Dollar Baby and directed 2004 ’s Crash . ]
Was there any sense of his story being a kind of parallel journey ?
So we ’re both bald and wear glasses .
But yes , I think so .
I was a bit amazed that he kind of practised this cognitive dissonance for so long .
But the more I talked , the more I kind of understood it .
I think he himself deeply regrets it now , but there ’s this idea that you can imagine yourself to be an embattled outsider and that that gives you a sort of moral basis on which to deny any attacks on you or your religion .
There does seem to be the essential difficulty of grappling with any understanding of Scientology .
From the outside , so many of its central tenets seem preposterous .
But then the people who are inside it obviously do have these beliefs , and have found something of worth to them , have n’t they ?
They have .
But then there ’s a lot of things about , say , Christianity , that I think many Christians , if pressed , would probably conclude were more resonant as metaphor than reality , like the virgin birth .
But still they accept the idea and move forward .
Scientology does not explain its cosmology or origin story to a member until that person has been in for many years .
Scientology attracts you with a very simple form of therapy that can be immediately appealing , and does n’t threaten any of your other beliefs .
They say , “ It ’s an applied philosophy and here are some tools to make your life better .
”
No one ’s going argue with that .
And then the next thing you know , you are spending thousands of dollars moving up the bridge to total freedom and reading – as a sacred text –
L Ron Hubbard ’s tales about body thetans , prison planets and Xenu the galactic overlord .
Is n’t that the thing ?
That lots of religions have outlandish creation myths , but they ’re older and originated in pre - modern times .
Whereas , the idea that a grown adult is going to buy the idea that people were frozen 75 m years ago and then shot up into space in rockets and dropped into volcanoes is quite something , is n’t it ?
Yes , it seems preposterous on the face of it .
But I think one of the things that the film tries to do is to show how you slowly slide into that .
By the time you find out about the Xenu story , I think people like Paul Haggis think , “
Oh well , whatever this crazy stuff is , I ’m still getting something out of the auditing [ a talking therapy ] and now I know all these people .
”
You ’re part of a community .
And it has its whole own language .
I talked to some Scientologists who had only recently left and I needed a translator to talk to them , because they were so steeped in the language of Scientology .
Which I think is very purposeful .
It gives you a sense of character and identity that is very hard to give up .
What is striking in the film is the bravery of the people who have spoken out against Scientology .
It ’s been so effective in silencing critics , has n’t it ?
One of the interviewees , Mike Rinder , had to give up his entire family when he left , did n’t he ?
Yes , and another had to make a Sophie ’s choice .
She had to pick one of her children over the other .
Scientology is one of the few religions that does n’t allow you to escape , that tries to do everything it can to prevent you from escaping .
If you ’re a Catholic and you decide one day you ’re not going to mass , the priest does n’t usually show up at your house , or the house of your relatives , and persuade them to “ disconnect ” from you .
But in Scientology , they really go after you pretty hard .
Did you think long and hard about doing the film ?
You must have known that they ’d come after you …
Yes , I did .
I knew they would .
So yes , I had to think long and hard about whether or not to take it on .
But a lot of my films have been about abuses of power , and I did n’t see why I should steer away from this one .
So it was no great surprise when they did come after you ?
That they ’ve done things like setting up a website to try to slur your reputation , and your father ’s reputation even .
[ They have claimed that Gibney ’s father , a journalist , worked undercover for the CIA . ]
No , and I ’m perfectly happy to guide people to [ these websites ] because I think there are some ridiculous ones .
On freedommag.org for example , you ’ll find they vilify me , my dad and everybody who ’s in the film .
And they are still calling up colleagues and trying to get them to talk dirt about me .
It ’s a campaign that still goes on .
The number of legal letters threatening me , threatening HBO and the distributors and exhibitors in every single one of the territories has been staggering .
And in the UK , they ’ve had some success , have n’t they ?
They quashed the publication of Lawrence Wright ’s book two years ago , did n’t they ?
My understanding about that is that it was a risk / reward calculation done by the publishers .
They did n’t feel that the commercial success of the book would warrant the legal fees that they would have to undertake .
Which to me is a very small - minded and shortsighted view , but it ’s the accountant ’s view and the lawyer ’s view .
It was a business decision , and Lawrence Wright ’s book has still not been published in the UK , Canada or Australia .
They ’ve also been sending out legal letters , have n’t they , to Sky , the UK distributor ?
To Sky .
To the [ Oscars ] academy .
To Sundance .
To everyone .
They come after you .
Particularly in the UK , because the libel laws are not as friendly to the press as they are in the States .
If you were to accuse me of libel in America , there ’d be a discovery process and I do n’t think David Miscavige [ the head of the Church of Scientology ] or Tom Cruise want to put themselves in front of a skilled lawyer to answer questions about the Church of Scientology .
David Miscavige and Tom Cruise really come across as these very powerful , charismatic figures right at the heart of everything .
Do n’t they ?
Yes .
They ’re very much at the heart of Scientology .
I think David Miscavige is a true believer , but he ’s also ruthless .
If there was ever an example of an organisation run with an iron fist , singlehandedly , by a ruthless individual , it ’s Scientology .
And Tom Cruise is so tightly bound up in it , is n’t he ?
The highest - paid movie star in the world …
did you get to the bottom of what the great attraction is for him of Scientology ?
I think he ’s a true believer .
I think there ’s probably a sense of jeopardy , were he ever to become a critic , because they have so much on him , but I think he is very much a true believer .
And I know actors and writers who ’ve been on the receiving end of his prophesying .
So he ’s all in
, I do n’t doubt that for one second .
And , I think that he knows it ’s at some sacrifice to his career
and he is very invested in being a movie star .
In the film , it ’s suggested that he is in such a position of power that he could look into these abuses of power or demand reform .
And the fact that he has n’t , you think …
It ’s appalling .
He could stop a lot of this abuse but he chooses not to .
Scientology has been incredibly clever in harnessing the power of celebrity .
Is it the ultimate American religion in some respects ?
Yes .
And also the fact that it was invented by somebody who ’s looking to make a buck .
That is a classic American plan .
L Ron Hubbard invented the whole thing .
He was a science fiction writer who invented a religion to make money .
But America is a land of self - invention and reinvention , and Hubbard is a classic example of that .
And he really understood the power of celebrity in America .
In the film , you made the point that the numbers of active members is going down , but the church ’s financial assets keep going up and up .
It ’s dying as a religion , but as a business , it is thriving .
And I think they will continue to be powerful because money buys you lawyers .
And lawyers can threaten you and it can have a chilling impact .
You ’ve had this incredibly prolific career , and you ’ve taken on these big subjects - Enron , the war on terror , Wikileaks .
Do you see your film on Scientology as part of an arc ?
A lot of your films have reflected upon the state of modern America .
Is this a continuation of that ?
People have pointed out a pattern , though I was n’t entirely conscious of it .
I ’m interested in abuses of power and deception , and self - deception .
And how for many people the ends justify the means .
America is a land of extremes and Scientology represents that in a way .
It ’s a self - help religion , but it ’s also a corporation , a brutal and abusive place .
You have two more films about to be released , one on Steve Jobs and another about Frank Sinatra – two more extraordinary , successful individuals .
What ’s the Alex Gibney secret to success ?
You ’re incredibly productive .
I ’m insane .
All these films take a long time
but I do a number of them in tandem , and I work with very talented people .
That ’s something I learned from Steve Jobs .
Surround yourself with really talented people .

2015-08-25,"It ’s quite a journey from the mudflats of the English south coast to the sparkling waters of the southern hemisphere ’s most famous harbour .
But it ’s a journey British theatre - maker Jonathan Church will be making in 2016 , when he takes over the reins of Sydney Theatre Company ( STC ) .
Church , 48 , departing artistic director at Chichester festival theatre where he nurtured such theatrical hits as Enron , will replace writer - director Andrew Upton , who will have been at the helm of “ the Wharf ” for eight years , five of those job - sharing with his wife , actor Cate Blanchett .
The Australian theatre community has been waiting the best part of a year since Upton announced his departure to find out who would take over the top Sydney job , with names as varied as young Australian director Kip Williams and Hollywood heavyweight Kenneth Branagh bandied about by insiders .
While a less starry appointment and one likely to rile local talent seemingly overlooked for the job , Church is a savvy and imaginative hire by the STC board , whose chairman , businessman and philanthropist David Gonski , said he was confident in their choice .
“
We wanted to find the best person for the job today , ” he told Guardian Australia .
“
We believe Sydney Theatre Company has come of age and is able to look widely and , indeed , immodestly , we were thinking why people would look at us , too .
”
During his decade at Chichester , Church has led one of the biggest turnarounds in British theatre : the transformation of a fading regional house – albeit once home to the fledgling National Theatre – into a commercial and critical success and the launchpad for countless West End and international transfers , including Patrick Stewart ’s Macbeth , directed by Rupert Goold ( now running the Almeida ) , and The Judas Kiss , directed by Australia ’s own Neil Armfield .
In March , Church announced his Chichester departure in 2016 to explore new projects , including developing his own independent production company , Jonathan Church Productions , but said when he was approached by Sydney , it was too good an opportunity to miss .
“
It ’s not every day a situation of such international importance , with such an incredible track record and network , comes up , ” he told Guardian Australia .
“ Over the last three years , I ’ve been spending more and more time in Australia and I ’m deeply impressed by the acting talent , not just the established actors one knows about , but the drama school graduates as well as the new writers and directors you ’ve got there .
” Church travelled to Melbourne to catch Geoffrey Rush in The Importance of Being Earnest in 2011 , since when he has returned to tour David Suchet in Chichester ’s production of The Last Confession with Australian producers Andrew Kay and Liza McClean and to audition local casts for his international revival of Singin’ in the Rain , which comes to Sydney and Melbourne in 2016 , featuring Adam Garcia .
If these tastes signal a switch of pace for STC – more musical theatre , perhaps ( the Upton / Blanchett years , while charmed in many ways , focused heavily on drama )
– Church stresses that he wants to “ elevate and expand ” on their legacy , rather than reverse it .
“
Very cleverly , successive Sydney managements – but particularly Andrew and Cate – have brought some really challenging writing into the repertoire , ” he said .
“ Not many companies would do Botho Strauss ’s Gross und Klein and , of course , that ’s been supported with some great Australian work .
People talk about the sort of actors I ’ve been able to attract – and Cate and Andrew , too – but the real thing is using those actors to introduce people to work they would n’t expect to see .
”
There will be pressure to fundraise and though Church can not boast a Hollywood rolodex , he led a £ 22 m ( AUS$46 m ) building redevelopment at Chichester for its 50th anniversary as only a former theatre electrician who grew up in a theatre family could .
For someone who started out in stage management , STC ’s four performance spaces and on - site set and costume facilities were a huge part of the job ’s appeal , Church said .
Upton , who will reveal his final STC season in September , called Church “ a terrific choice ” for Sydney .
“
After a period being led by an actress and a writer , I think it ’s important to have a theatre director once more at the helm , ” he said .
Church himself identifies more as a producer .
“
I direct and I ’m passionate about directing , ” he said .
“
It ’s the only way you can understand a company where you want to make work .
But enabling other artists , that ’s what I most enjoy .
”
He said he is prepared for “ questions ” over his appointment but pointed to Rafael Bonachela at nearby Sydney Dance Company as a successful and popular European hire .
“
I ’ll have to take all sorts of speculation until I deliver my first programme in 2016 –
it ’s only through the delivery of the work that you are judged .
”
Gonski said : “
For sure , we would have loved it to be an Australian and one day , we hope it would be again .
But Jonathan was the best on the day .
“
Having read his CV , I expected someone who was arrogant and proud .
Jonathan has got a wonderful , well - contained ego and we could see right up front that he would be a great contributor to the company .
”
Church will announce his first season in a year ’s time but plans to start setting up home in Sydney before Christmas , to be followed by his wife and four children once he finishes up in Chichester .
He is excited rather than daunted by the leap .
“
Look , I ’ve spent my life moving from city to city .
It ’s a bigger move , perhaps , and it will be a big learning curve certainly .
But my last move was from Birmingham [ Repertory Company ] to Chichester and two more different audiences and cities you ’d never meet , ” he said .
“
The thing that brought me into theatre was both a love of the art form and a belief in its ability to connect with people and make communities cohesive .
So culturally and politically , I think I ’m going to be at home even if there are a new set of challenges .
”"
2015-09-23,"Martin Winterkorn , Volkswagen ’s chief executive , has been sacrificed in an act of contrition to the shareholders , regulators and lawyers circling the German car conglomerate .
His departure will matter little to the long - term fortunes of VW without an overhaul of the company ’s governance .
The emissions - rigging scandal , which is being talked about as a corporate failure on the scale of Enron or WorldCom , extends beyond the CEO .
A company which has admitted to a flagrant violation of global rules and went to such extensive lengths to hoodwink officials has bigger questions to answer than just who takes the blame .
Looking at those with whom Winterkorn shared the top table might be one place to start .
To British eyes , the way Germany companies are structured looks a bit ungainly .
At the top , VW has a management board made up of executives from across the different business functions , and a separate supervisory board , which is supposed to appoint and then keep the managers in check .
Half of the supervisory board are voted for by shareholders , the rest are from a wider group of stakeholders .
The make - up is a mixture of shareholders , union officials and – in VW ’s case –
ministers from the Federal State of Lower Saxony , where the firm is headquartered .
Further entangled in the corporate web are the various companies owned by the Volkswagen Group , such as Audi , Seat , Skoda , Bentley , Porsche and so on .
Some of those have their own boards , with their own chairman and annual reports .
Members of one board sit on or chair others , supposedly providing scrutiny and asking the difficult questions we would expect of a normal director .
Winterkorn , who previously headed up Audi before the entire VW Group , was also chairman of Audi ’s supervisory board and Porsche ’s management board .
Heaven help anybody who has to draw the diagram .
The goal is to link disparate subsidiaries and management teams into one giant organisation .
However complex , the system has been credited with encouraging family - owned firms and allowing German businesses to take a much more long - term approach than their impatient Anglo Saxon counterparts .
There are countless examples where this is precisely what happen , s and many who believe that the two - board structure with a big family shareholder is a worthy model .
The Schröder family , for instance , own nearly half of Schröders and two family members sit on the board .
They have won plaudits for driving a long - term outlook at the company .
In the case of VW , however , it appears to have failed .
Volkswagen succumbed to the temptations of patronage , privilege and favour .
By many accounts Winterkorn owed his place at the top to a bitter power struggle that embroiled the Porsche family and soured boardroom relations .
He has been there for eight years – a little longer than most CEOs at European companies .
A strong and forceful management team requires daring , bold and fearless overseers and a governance system which encourages them to ask the difficult questions .
For VW to get away with such an audacious con , proper oversight must have been lacking .
The point is that a company needs both the proper structure and the right personnel .
One can not make up for a lack of the other .
Somebody at VW messed up –
that is beyond question .
Fitting 11 million cars with a piece of software which artificially reduces vehicle emissions during regulators’ tests is not the work of a few rogue employees .
That decision was taken and put into action by people of reasonable seniority .
But the reason it continued , unchecked , for so long is because the structure of the company stifled honest and transparent oversight .
If the board members knew what was happening , that is clearly severe – and possibly criminal – malpractice .
If they did n’t , then that is a dangerous failure of responsibility .
Either way , VW need to assess that elusive corporate characteristic – culture – and work out whether their governance rules helped create an environment in which breaking the law was an acceptable course of action in order to sell cars .
Without a robust system that holds management to account , there is a risk people will fall into the temptation to cut corners .
Say , for instance , your new vehicles are not meeting tough emissions requirements .
You might consider the quick fix if nobody will question what you ’ve done , how it works or even notice something has changed .
We demand more ethical behaviour from our senior executives , and flagrant abuses of power are rare .
But having the right structure in place is fundamental .
The problems at VW extend beyond Winterkorn .
His failures are both a symbol and a product of a system which has proved itself dysfunctional .
Removing the top brass can not be the end of the matter .
Good corporate governance places ethical and fearless directors into roles which let them ask penetrating questions , hold managers to account , advise on strategy and guide the business through good times and bad .
Times have turned bad very quickly at Europe ’s largest carmaker , and the board can not imagine that one decapitation will hold back the onrushing tide of lawsuits and fines , or repair VW ’s shattered reputation .
However , if the company puts as much effort into fixing corporate governance as they did into fixing emissions tests , they could yet stop it being torn apart .

2015-11-22,"For any British teenage girl hoping to become a playwright , the chances are at last looking rosy .
A series of celebrated female dramatists , including creators of hit plays such as Enron , Chimerica and Posh , are now in effect calling out like sirens : “ Come on in , the water is lovely .
”
But exactly how welcoming to young women can the theatrical world be so soon after the Guardian ’s venerable theatre critic , Michael Billington , featured only six female writers when drawing up a list of the 101 greatest plays ?
And when only one of those women , Caryl Churchill , is still alive ?
Do the boards of the West End ’s great stages suddenly offer an even playing space for male and female playwrights ?
Proof of the impact of inspirational examples is Katherine Soper , 24 , winner of last week ’s Bruntwood prize for playwriting , who , along with fellow emerging female writing talents , Lulu Raczka and Anya Reiss , is now determined to write for live theatre .
She said that when she first saw Breathing Corpses , a 2005 play by Laura Wade , writer of Posh , her ambition changed .
“
It completely blew my mind .
So then I read the complete works of Sarah Kane too .
I had always had a sense I wanted to write in some way and it quickly became clear that I wanted to write for the stage , ” said Soper , who still works in a perfume shop in London to pay her rent .
Kane , who took her life in 1999 at the age of 28 , gained early notoriety for her explicit sexually violent first play , Blasted , but is recognised now as a hugely influential literary force .
Soper ’s play , Wish List , was selected as Bruntwood ’s winner by a panel of judges including Sir Nicholas Hytner , former artistic director of the National Theatre .
Unperformed as yet , it is a four - hander about low wages and changes to the benefits system .
“
I do n’t think you could read my work and see any Sarah Kane in there ,
” said Soper , “
but I loved her plays and there is perhaps a kind of emotional directness I have taken .
At university I wrote my dissertation on her work and I got a lot of push - back then .
She was not popular because there was a view it was only after she died that people started to reassess .
This made me angry because I had reviews of her work showing this was not the case .
By the time her later play , Crave , was being performed people were already beginning to think the criticism of Blasted was really stupid .
”
Although they did not claim the top prize , two of the four runners - up for the Bruntwood were also young women with great promise , Chloe Todd Fordham and Kendall Feaver .
This is a further indication that a wider range of female voices is finally being heard , and about time too , according to Hannah Hauer - King , the 24-year - old director and founder of Damsel Productions , a new theatre company that brings plays by women and staged by women to London audiences .
“
I would say that Polly Stenham has led the way and that more young women writers really are doing well now , ” said Hauer - King , praising the impact of the author of the acclaimed play That Face .
“
It is my impression you can characterise the work of these writers as fearless , honest and true .
They are not necessarily all making radical work , but they tend to come from what you could describe as an honest place .
” Tickets have sold out for Hauer - King ’s own well - received but uncompromising production of Dry Land , by American Ruby Rae Spiegel , now running at the Jermyn Street Theatre , in London .
“ Stenham , I think , is trying to break a few boundaries too .
A lot of these plays by young women are not didactic and political , though .
It is all there between the lines and in what they choose to portray , ” she said .
The fresh trail being blazed by Soper and by Raczka , who won praise for her play Nothing , and by Reiss , who wrote Spur of the Moment when she was 17 , was illuminated by a slew of successful women writers who went before them and who are now either in , or approaching , their 30s .
This peer group includes Stenham and Wade , but also Lucy Kirkwood , who wrote Chimerica , Lucy Prebble ( Enron and The Effect ) , Ella Hickson ( Eight ) , Morgan Lloyd Malcolm ( Belongings ) , Debbie Tucker Green ( Stoning Mary ) , Bola Agbaje (
Gone Too Far ! ) and Nina Raine ( Rabbit and Tribes ) .
The list is so long that not long ago certain theatre critics could be heard complaining about the similar - sounding Lucys and Lauras bursting on to the scene .
Nowadays Soper is able , without irony , to note instead that she sometimes finds it difficult to distinguish one contemporary male stage writer from another .
“
There are so many called David or Chris , the names tend to blur together , although I know the work is different .
My favourite dramatists are all women .
I saw American playwright Anne Washburn ’s
Mr Burns three times last summer
and it was genuinely one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen .
There was so much going on .
”
The previous generation to Soper were , of course , not the first female playwrights to have work staged in the West End since Churchill made her impact with Top Girls .
Stenham , Wade , Tucker Green and Prebble ’s generation were able to follow in the footsteps of writers such as Moira Buffini , who wrote Handbagged , Rebecca Lenkiewicz , Bryony Lavery , who presented Soper with her prize last week , Timberlake Wertenbaker , who wrote the repertory staple Our Country
’s Good , and Tamsin Oglesby , whose work about the inequity of the education system , Future Conditional , was staged this year at the Old Vic .
And Churchill has a new short play about death ,
Here we Go , opening at the National this week .
Soper felt the draw of dialogue pulling her towards writing for the stage , she said , because it “ reveals so much without meaning to ” .
She found further inspiration from watching the intense and dramatic unscripted exchanges in the television documentary Educating Essex .
While she resists the insistent pressure for writers to develop distinct “ new voices ” , or mannerisms that may hamper their writing in the end , Soper does suspect that several of the women playwrights she admires are keen , like her , to find fresh ways to present real lives on stage .
“ I am interested in finding different ways to show conflict .
Drama is not always about two people with opposing views simply duking it out , ” she said .
Soper studied English at Cambridge , but her skills were honed by writing draft after draft of dialogue scenes and studying for an MA in stage writing at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London .
Cambridge , she said , nearly put her off the theatre .
The student drama scene paid little attention to new work and revolved around producing slick , West End - comparable , productions of recent hits .
Writing for the stage , Soper said , was by nature more exposing than either acting or directing .
“
It always comes from somewhere personal , even if you do n’t realise it to begin with .
In the end it feels like putting your diary on stage .
”
Wish List will now be developed for a potential staging at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester .
For Hauer - King at Damsel Productions the old excuse that there is a dearth of high quality work by women will no longer wash .
“
It drives me mad when people say they ca n’t find work by women to do , ” she said .
“
There has been a remarkable shift in terms of sourcing work from less privileged people but I am not sure there has yet been quite the same shift for women , particularly for directors and producers .

2015-12-11,"Respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
Those were Enron ’s core values , which , the energy company said , guided its behaviour as a “ global corporate citizen
” .
We know how that story ended : bankruptcy , court cases and ( unusually for the business world ) custodial sentences .
The once - mighty accountancy firm of Arthur Andersen was also brought down .
Over a decade later bad corporate behaviour – the stuff we find out about , anyway – continues to make front page news .
That dependable , “ clean diesel ” Volkswagen turns out not to be so clean after all .
Thomas Cook takes an age to come up with a decent and civilised response to human tragedy .
And now Sports Direct is revealed to be conducting business in a brutal fashion .
Boardroom practices at the company may be comically bizarre , but life in their Shirebrook warehouse is not funny at all .
The public have noticed .
A survey this week for the Institute of Business Ethics found that 39 % of people think business is behaving unethically .
The three biggest causes for concern are tax avoidance , executive pay and exploitative labour practices .
Two - fifths of the public have given a vote of no confidence in British business .
That is , potentially at least , a lot of customers .
Why , apart from the headline - grabbing scandals , is business seen in such a poor light ?
To some extent this represents a failure of the “ corporate social responsibility ” ( CSR ) movement .
Bad CSR deserves to fail and be seen for what it is – a flimsy public relations exercise .
Good companies do n’t need CSR programmes .
They think hard about their activities and the impact they have on the world .
They worry about how they make their money .
Good companies make sustainable profits , and do n’t externalise the costs of doing business on to the world around them .
But why does bad corporate behaviour still exist ?
The chances of getting found out are much higher than in the past .
Everyone carrying a smartphone is equipped with a vital tool of investigative journalism .
Fearlessness , or shamelessness , may have something to do with the “ risk / reward relationship ” , as it is called in the financial world .
The rewards for breaking the rules can be high .
But the punishments are often feeble – fines ( merely another cost of doing business ) and loss of reputation ( cushioned by a healthy bank balance and lifetime financial security ) .
Very few business leaders have ended up behind bars on account of their actions .
“
You ’re going to jail !
”
screamed angry protesters at Dick Fuld , the former chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers , in 2008 .
But he is n’t going to jail .
He is going to his midtown Manhattan office to work for his new business , Matrix Advisors .
Perhaps bad corporate behaviour is explained by the fact that , whether they realise it or not , some senior executives are still coming to terms with the post - financial - crisis world .
Deep down they fear it could all go wrong again , any time .
They are in a hurry and are cutting corners .
They also seek extravagant pay packages to cushion their ultimate , inevitable fall .
So , yes , sanctions have to get tougher , and the fear of punishment for wrongdoing has to increase sharply .
One encouraging sign is that some responsible business leaders have had enough of the opprobrium brought on their heads by others .
Simon Walker , director general of the Institute of Directors , said this week : “ IoD members share the public ’s outrage
…
I urge people to remember that Sports Direct is categorically not a representative of British business .
”
He is right about that .
And we as customers can not complain if we continue to shop with businesses that at other times we might denounce loudly as unethical .
We are all in this together .
My friend Steven Gauge has written a lovely play about taking up rugby again in middle age , called ( perhaps inevitably )
My Life as a Hooker .
In one scene he is nervously running out on to the pitch for the first time in decades , and confesses to a team - mate that he is probably a bit rusty about the rules .
Do n’t worry , his fellow paunchy sportsman tells him : “ Just cheat until you get caught .
”
This would have made a more accurate mission statement for Enron .
Sadly , it appears to be the guiding ethos for too many people in business today ."
2016-09-08,"Beth Steel scored a big hit in 2014 with Wonderland , which examined the scars left by the miners’ strike 30 years earlier .
In Labyrinth , she again goes back to the 1980s , this time to probe the Latin American debt crisis .
The result is a racily exciting work that offers the most compelling theatrical study of high finance since Lucy Prebble ’s Enron and which suggests chilling parallels with what is happening today in the eurozone .
Steel ushers us into a big subject by focusing on the fate of an individual .
John Anderson is a greenhorn credit analyst who , in 1978 , joins a Wall Street bank , anxious to expand its international portfolio .
John , who has risen through merit rather than privilege , is assigned to work with the sharp - witted Charlie , who is off to Brazil to arrange a loan of $ 320 m to its government .
But although John has doubts about the deal , they are quashed as we witness his surrender to the corporate ethic and the biggest credit bubble in history .
This climaxes in Mexico ’s declaration of bankruptcy in 1982 and a massive Latin American debt crisis that the big banks , aided by the IMF , turn to their advantage .
As so often in drama , the virtue lies in the detail .
Steel does n’t just tell , but shows how the system works .
In the case of Brazil , we see how vast loans are provided for power plants that may never become operational and for which US construction firms are handsomely rewarded .
The relevance of all this to today ’s world is underlined in a climactic scene when , after the credit bubble has burst , stringent terms are imposed on a bailout of the Mexican government by US banks and the IMF .
Austerity will have a crippling effect on the majority while those at the top are carefully insulated .
This is invigorating , informative stuff .
My only query concerns the play ’s increasing resort to phantasmagoria .
John , as we learn early on , is overshadowed by a father who was imprisoned for fraud , and the implication that the son is simply extending paternal practice on a larger scale is unmistakable .
But the father gradually turns into a ghostly presence haunting John ’s coke - fuelled nightmares .
I like the play best when it sticks to the known facts and shows , in the manner of financial movies such as Wall Street and the even better Margin Call , the corruption beneath smart - suited expertise .
Played on a wide traverse stage , Anna Ledwich ’s production has a hurtling energy that propels us through the intricacies of international banking .
Sean Delaney as John has the right air of a Candide - like innocent slowly succumbing to the system .
Tom Weston - Jones as his Mephistophelian mentor exudes a narcissistic hedonism and there is high - grade support from Philip Bird as John ’s dodgy dad and from Elena Saurel as a journalist who sees the ruinousness of reckless loans .
It ’s a demanding play , but one that shows how today ’s ills are rooted in past actions .
It also confirms theatre ’s extraordinary capacity to heighten our awareness of complex subjects , ranging from nuclear physics to , in this case , the labyrinth of high finance .

2016-09-21,"The former European commissioner Neelie Kroes , who is now a paid adviser to Bank of America and Uber , failed to declare her directorship of an offshore firm in the Bahamas while she was the most powerful corporate enforcer in Brussels .
A cache of previously unseen documents published on Wednesday reveal that Kroes was recruited by a venture funded by the United Arab Emirates , which intended to snap up the international assets of the energy company Enron in a $ 7bn ( £ 5.4bn ) deal .
The information comes from a leak of 1.3 m files from the Bahamas corporate registry , which has brought to light the names of directors and shareholders at nearly 176,000 shell companies , trusts and foundations located in the Caribbean tax haven .
The data was received by Süddeutsche Zeitung , the German newspaper behind the Panama Papers , and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington is releasing it to the public online .
Kroes was an EU commissioner from 2004 until 2014 , initially overseeing the powerful competition directorate and then Europe ’s digital agenda .
She was forbidden by the commissioners’ code of conduct to hold any outside directorships while in the roles .
The code states : “ Commissioners may not engage in any other professional activity , whether gainful or not .
”
Kroes was also obliged to make a full declaration of her previous financial and corporate interests , stretching back 10 years .
She may have breached both of those rules .
Papers from the Bahamas corporate registry show that between July 2000 and October 2009 , she was registered as a director of Mint Holdings Limited , a company set up by a polo - playing private equity boss from the Middle East .
When she joined the European commission in 2004 , Kroes declared previous roles at more than 60 companies , foundations and educational bodies , including Volvo , McDonald ’s , the defence and aerospace company Thales and the British mobile phone group mmO2 .
None of her filings , however , mention Mint Holdings .
After being approached by the Guardian , the Dutch newspapers Trouw and Het Financieele Dagblad and other media , Kroes responded through her lawyer , who said : “ My client agrees that formally she should have declared this directorship … Mrs Kroes will inform the president of the European commission of this oversight and will take full responsibility for it .
”
Kroes ’s lawyer said she made her filings in good faith because she believed Mint Holdings had been liquidated in 2002 , before her appointment as Europe ’s antitrust watchdog .
She said she was not paid for her role , did not offer advice on the Enron deal and did not hold shares in the company .
She said the company never became operational and there had been no board meetings .
Mint Holdings is owned by Amin Badr - El - Din , a former special adviser to the president of the UAE .
A polo fanatic who used to breed ponies at an estate in the Chiltern hills , his team has been a regular fixture at Cowdray Park and other prestigious grounds .
In 2000 , Badr - El - Din led a group of investors in negotiations to buy almost all of Enron ’s international assets .
He then recruited Kroes , who is also a former Dutch transport minister , to advise on the venture .
The talks took place shortly before Enron collapsed , brought down by a major accounting fraud .
The UAE deal fell through in the late summer of 2000 , because of financial complexities and concerns about Enron ’s accounting , Badr - El - Din said .
Had it succeeded , the transaction would have placed between $ 6bn and $ 8bn worth of assets in India , Turkey , Brazil , the Caribbean and Japan into a company of which Kroes was a board member .
The assets included power plants and utility groups , oil and gas reserves , ships and terminal rights and an international gas pipeline .
One of the aims was to make Europe less dependent on Russian gas .
Mint Holdings was set up to “ open the dialogue with Enron ” , Badr - El - Din ’s lawyer said .
The directors were to oversee the hiring of professional advisers , raise funds and agree the final details .
The financier briefed Kroes on the strategy , which she found “ intriguing enough to join a few friends in Mint ” .
He said : “ If the deal had been successful then her continued involvement would have been immensely valuable for her strategic vision .
Many of the board would have come from the various assets of Enron , the Middle East and internationally .
The idea was to build the world ’s premier gas - based company .
”
The financier said he had ordered Mint Holdings to be wound up in 2002 , but a “ clerical error ” meant this never happened .
In 2004 , it became active , holding shares in another Bahamas company unrelated to Enron or Kroes .
It was not until 2009 , he says , that Kroes and two other individuals recruited for the Enron deal were discovered to be still on the register of directors .
Their names were then removed .
Kroes said she was not aware of the mistake until being approached by reporters last week .
The UAE attempt to buy Enron ’s assets has been reported , but Kroes ’s involvement has not been public knowledge until now .
The online version of the Bahamas registry , which often contains patchy information on companies , does not list the directors of Mint Holdings .
The revelation is likely to cause controversy .
During her term , Kroes initiated major interventions in the oil and gas markets .
Nicknamed “ Steely Neelie
”
during her time in Brussels for tackling Microsoft and other corporate giants , she conducted a two - year inquiry aimed at challenging the power of former national monopoly companies in the oil and gas sectors .
In 2006 she ordered dawn raids on six gas companies , which resulted in E.ON and GDF Suez paying more than € 500 m ( £ 430 m ) each for breaching cartel rules .
Carl Dolan , the EU director of the campaign group Transparency International , said the case reinforced the need for public registers to be more transparent about the owners of offshore companies .
He said : “ Kroes’ links to the proposed Enron deal would have remained a secret were it not for this leak .
All EU commissioners , and in particular competition commissioners , have access to privileged and market - sensitive information .
“
That ’s why asking for a complete record of a commissioner ’s past business links is one of most basic things the commission can do to avoid potential conflicts of interest .
The fact that Neelie Kroes did not take this obligation sufficiently seriously shows the need for the commission to scrutinise these self - declarations more thoroughly .
”
The revelations will fuel tensions over the business ties of European commission bosses .
The commission ’s former president José Manuel Barroso is under fire for taking up a post this summer with the investment bank Goldman Sachs as chairman of its international business .
Barroso has countered that he is not a lobbyist for the US bank , but one French minister has described the move as “ scandalous ” and it has prompted an inquiry by the EU ombudsman .
The current European commission president , Jean - Claude Juncker , has asked its ethics panel to investigate , and 145,000 people have signed a petition calling for Barroso to have his pension withdrawn .
The only sanction available against former commissioners is the loss of their pension and other benefits such as allowances for moving home , and to exercise this the commission must first secure an order from the European court of justice .
In order to secure her post as the EU ’s antitrust chief , following concerns about her business ties to an array of multinationals , Kroes vowed “ not to engage into any business activity following the end of my term ” .
Within two years of leaving the commission , however , she has joined three US companies .
She is a special adviser to Bank of America Merrill Lynch , a full board director at the customer data firm Salesforce , and a policy adviser to the taxi hailing company Uber , which shelters its international revenues from tax through the Netherlands .
Kroes is already busy promoting US interests .
Earlier this month , she made headlines by criticising the European commission ’s ruling that Apple owed the Irish government an estimated € 13bn in unpaid back taxes .
Challenged on why Kroes , now 75 , had gone back on her promise to stay out of the private sector , her lawyer said : “ It is true that Mrs Kroes made this pledge at the beginning of her first term with the European commission .
Having fulfilled this term , Mrs Kroes fulfilled this pledge and did not enter into business activity .
Instead , she was honoured with a second term in a completely different field .
Having now finished her second term , she no longer feels bound by the commitment made prior to taking her first post .

2016-10-16,"The old idea that women dramatists tend to shun the epic form has emphatically been given the lie in recent years .
After Lucy Prebble ’s Enron , Lucy Kirkwood ’s
Chimerica and Beth Steel ’s
Labyrinth , we now have Ella Hickson ’s new play , which takes on a vast range of subjects , including empire , energy and the environment , as well as mother - daughter relationships .
The result may be uneven but the piece is bold , playful and scorchingly ambitious .
Spanning more than 150 years , Hickson ’s play focuses on a woman called May who travels effortlessly through time .
We first see her as a 19th - century Cornish farmer ’s wife for whom the newly invented kerosene lamp becomes a source of personal illumination .
Later , we see May working as a servant in 1908 Tehran , at a time when the British are desperate to exploit Persia ’s natural resources .
By 1970 , she has risen to become CEO of an international oil company threatened by Libya ’s proposal to nationalise its assets .
But , as May rises in the world , difficulties with her daughter , Amy , intensify and become deeply problematic as they head into a nightmarish future .
Hickson suspends the normal rules of realism to pursue big ideas .
One is that there is a parallel between the imperialist instinct of countries and corporations and that of parents .
This is most vivid in the scene where May , on one crisis - ridden evening , simultaneously seeks to retain control of her company ’s Libyan oil wells and of her teenage daughter ’s love life .
But Hickson is equally fascinated by the price that has to be paid for living through a century and a half of accelerating progress : in particular , she shows the career - driven , uncompromising May becoming habituated to loneliness and to a sense of estrangement from the activist Amy who , as her three - letter name implies , represents her other self .
Hickson strives too hard for cyclical neatness .
The level of the writing also varies from one scene to another .
But she has created a remarkable play that , aside from an opening scene that is as impenetrably dark as a Georges de la Tour painting , is very well directed by Carrie Cracknell and contains one of the best theatrical mother - daughter relationships of recent years .
Anne - Marie Duff excellently catches all
May ’s contradictions : her sensuousness and solitude , her curiosity and curmudgeonliness and the oppressive nature of her maternal love .
Above all , Duff , with her taut , expressive features , is very good at suggesting hardship overcome .
When May says : “ There is still blood on my hands from hauling myself up , from clinging on , ” Duff makes you believe every word .
Yolanda Kettle is equally good as daughter Amy : defiant , angry , passionate about the environment , yet imbued with a faint touch of self - righteous certainty .
The men are less multi - dimensional , but there is good work from Tom Mothersdale as May ’s abandoned husband , Patrick Kennedy as her regimental pursuer and Nabil Elouahabi as a Libyan emissary .
And even if Hickson ’s play is about the ultimate exhaustion of our oil reserves , it has a renewable energy of its own .

2017-01-10,"Enron Chosen by Vinay Patel
I saw Enron on 5 August 2010 .
I know this because I still have the ticket stuck to my wall .
Lucy Prebble ’s play charts the rise and fall of the energy giant whose story mirrors the hubris and deceit behind the 2008 sub - prime mortgage crisis in the US – which in turn triggered the global recession that I conveniently , more or less , graduated into .
Prebble has spoken about how any prescience on her part regarding the financial collapse was coincidental , but with Enron as a company revealing itself to be less a singular cautionary tale and more a microcosm of a failing system , a play dramatising its workings seemed like vital viewing for a bewildered 24-year - old who was trying to figure out what exactly had just happened to the world .
I expected high - stakes drama .
I expected important individuals waxing lyrical about money and power .
What I did n’t expect was the fun .
Both the play and production embraced the absurdity at the heart of theatre – the silliness of the act , the joy of metaphor – and used it to power its more serious points .
Is depicting the once mighty , now defunct financial services company Lehman Brothers as giant , conjoined twins any less ridiculous than believing you can set up countless shell companies to help buy up your growing debt while still believing yourself to be the biggest company in the world ?
Do you miss warning signs when you ’re an employee at such a place , because working for a titan made you feel as if you wanted to wrap a tie around your head in celebration and belt out Welcome to the Jungle on repeat ?
For me , the play ’s real triumph is less in showing how Enron happened ( though it does that masterfully ) and more in letting you feel how it happened .
A desire to replicate that experience for an audience sits at the heart of everything I now do .
I adore Enron because it ’s messy and ambitious and so many things at once .
It ’s a play about dismantling capitalism ’s catechisms .
It ’s a play about faith .
Light and shadow .
Rise and fall .
Raptors and ruin .
A swaggering statement piece from an extraordinary young playwright .
Prebble ’s second - greatest work , after her Twitter feed .
Good People Chosen by Atiha Sen Gupta For playwrights the challenge is how to dramatise the big questions of our day .
It means treading the tightrope between the political and the personal .
Good People by David Lindsay - Abaire does this expertly , weaving a convincing tapestry of working - class life in south Boston , a go - to setting for dramas about hardened criminality and bleak existences but treated here with dignity and respect .
Our protagonist , newly unemployed Margie , spends the bulk of the play trying to coax a job out of her ex - boyfriend Mike – a doctor who made it out of their tough neighbourhood while she did n’t .
In the process , profound questions are raised about success and social mobility .
Does the system determine our destinies ?
Is there such a thing as making our own luck ?
If we are subject to forces greater than ourselves , why do some people succeed and others do n’t ?
Alan Plater said that after watching a play we remember moments above all else .
We do n’t recall character arcs or structure but moments : funny ones , sad ones , tender ones .
My favourite in Good People is all three at once .
It comes just after Mike suggests that Margie has n’t succeeded because she made , and continues to make , the wrong decisions .
In an impassioned rebuttal , Margie savages this notion of choice ; the commonly bandied about idea that people choose to be poor .
She traces why she lost her job to a piece of candy brittle : she was late for work because she lost her car ; she lost her car because she used her instalment money to pay the dentist ; and she needed dental treatment because one night , to save money , she missed dinner but got hungry and ate a piece of candy brittle , which cracked a tooth .
Margie concludes : “
And that ’s all it took – a piece of fucking candy brittle , and I was out of a job again .
”
I saw the play in 2014 in the West End , with Imelda Staunton as Margie .
She was so convincing that I bristle when I see her in posters for anything else .
Despite its title , there are no goodies or baddies in the play : our protagonist is flawed , our antagonist sympathetic .
The play ’s beauty lies in its ability to hold two contradictory realities in tandem : Margie is both victim ( of circumstances not of her making ) and victor ( she resists her reality ) .
She suffers but she survives .
Circle Mirror Transformation Chosen by Sam Steiner A disclaimer : I may find it difficult to explain why I think Circle Mirror Transformation is as wonderful and important as it is .
But that seems fitting for a play about the limits of honest expression , whose characters try and fail to communicate the depth of their loneliness , pain , love and regret to each other .
Annie Baker ’s play is set in an adult community drama class in the fictional town of Shirley , Vermont .
It takes place over six weeks and Baker shows us snapshots from each of the weekly classes .
We watch the characters perform drama games and exercises such as explosion tag ( like tig , but the person that ’s “
it ” has to explode ) .
Much of it is laugh - out - loud funny .
Not chortle - at - witty - wordplay funny .
Proper belly - laugh - until - the - person - beside - you - gives - you - weird - looks funny .
But the humour invariably stems from failure and inadequacy .
In one scene Schultz , a divorcee in her late 40s , casts the other members of the group as objects in his beloved childhood bedroom .
As they twist their bodies into baseball gloves , trees and a very specific stuffed snake , Schultz steps back , surveys the room , sighs and says sadly :
“
It does n’t really look like my bedroom .
”
Moments of high comedy are undercut with those of profound pathos .
The silly becomes sublime .
The petty becomes magical .
In another scene , Lauren directs James and Marty in a hammy re - enactment of an argument between her parents .
The scene begins to say just as much about James and Marty ’s own marital scars as it does about Lauren ’s troubles at home .
Baker draws lines between these characters’ feelings but never treats them as anything less than subjective .
Schultz ’s
loneliness is different to Theresa ’s .
Marty ’s sense of regret
is different to James ’s .
Therein lies the quiet tragedy of the play .
Their pain and insecurities unite them and force them apart .
Baker ’s writing is often accused of being apolitical .
The words “ small ” or “ inward - looking ” frequently appear in reviews .
But at a time in which our society has seemed more disconnected than ever , in which far too often the loudest , most soundbitey voice has triumphed over thoughtful discussion and reasoning , few pieces of theatre seem as urgent , vital or hopeful as this “ little ” play about five broken people in a windowless room in small - town Vermont trying desperately to understand each other .
The Djinns of Eidgah Chosen by Anya Reiss
The Djinns of Eidgah by Abhishek Majumdar was staged in 2013 at the Royal Court ’s Theatre Upstairs and it was everything you expect from that space
: the play was by someone I ’d never heard of , it was about a world
I knew nothing about and it was brilliant .
It ’s set during the conflict in Kashmir , but is n’t a politics or history lesson .
It ’s a strange , dreamy , haunted , funny and blood - soaked play in which one boy dreams of becoming a professional footballer while his sister hides in stories about ghosts and gods .
Both are trying to ignore the war - torn reality they find themselves in .
In general , I ’m not a big fan of highly poetical or theatrical plays .
I usually feel they take themselves too seriously and lose sight of reality , but this one did n’t .
I suppose it was because the reality is so horrific that you have to step away from it to actually talk about it .
Richard Twyman ’s production kept it so grounded – the play is about people not ideas .
What I remember most clearly is coming back after the interval and the play beginning again in darkness : you sat and listened as brother and sister searched a tent of dead bodies to steal their murdered friend ’s shoes for football practice , only to realise as they felt around in the dark that the friend ’s body had no feet .
That is always going to stay with me .
I ’ve never been so relieved for the lights to come back on in a theatre .
Mr Burns Chosen by Katherine Soper Mr Burns , a “ post - electric play
” by Anne Washburn , charts the short- and long - term aftermath of an American nuclear disaster , focusing on the changing role of artistic culture in the lives of the survivors .
It shows art ’s ability to comfort and connect us , and shape a sense of our own identity .
Washburn ’s
stroke of genius is to use a famous Simpsons episode , Cape Feare , as the central focus for the characters .
The shaken refugees’ attempts to piece together the episode from memory are achingly similar to Primo Levi ’s desperation in Auschwitz to remember fading snatches of Dante .
Matt Groening ’s TV series is a truly populist cultural phenomenon that has changed the way a generation tells jokes , and it perfectly grounds an idea that could easily have become inaccessible and overly cerebral .
The Simpsons , chart hits and even adverts become both nostalgia and currency : the characters struggle to move on from the pre - meltdown world , treating each salvaged line as sacred , even as their re - enactments ca n’t hope to replicate the past .
Aside from exploring how stories morph in transmission , threading images and dialogue from earlier acts into an operatic parable about the disaster , Mr Burns captures the reasons we tell stories at all .
In times of upheaval , it ’s easy to think of art as frivolous , or to measure the “ effects ” of it in a very narrow way .
In its final act , showing Burns himself reappropriated as a symbol of the nuclear disaster , the play becomes a tribute to art ’s power to help us process real events .
I suspect that in times of collective grief , directors will reach for it again and again .
Jerusalem Chosen by Barney Norris
Jez Butterworth ’s
Jerusalem is about a man being evicted from his caravan .
Except more than that happens and he ’s more than a man .
Johnny
“ Rooster ” Byron , the local drug dealer , becomes a scabrous , seductive embodiment of the wild heart of England itself .
At the Royal Court in London in 2009 , directed by Ian Rickson , Mark Rylance gave a performance channelling Cantona that detonated among my generation as the most extraordinary thing we ’d ever seen in a theatre .
As someone who grew up in the landscape it depicts , I have a lot of arguments with it .
Wiltshire is more waterlogged than the play ’s pyro - Technicolor , and I felt my world was used more as metaphor than treated in its own right .
Butterworth has lived in Pewsey , but it struck me as a Londoner ’s play in its raucous bones .
Mind you
, Jerusalem never claimed to be an anthropological portrait of anywhere
: any play with a vicar and a morris dancer on the same stage has more in common with Alan Bennett than William Cobbett .
Like Martin McDonagh , Butterworth ’s game is to play with theatre as much as with society , simultaneously mastering and satirising tropes , delighting us with what he can do with the conventions of the form .
And Butterworth gave me everything I look for when I go to the theatre : roles affording great actors the room to do their best work ; a set of people who find a way to stand for more than themselves ; a willingness to dive into aria , to delight in verbal creativity ; and a glorious , defiant , snarling evocation of the extraordinariness of ordinary people living ordinary lives , the things that turn us all into giants .
So I cherish my disagreements .
Jerusalem is a play worth having a row with .
My response to it has fuelled my whole career .
I long to see it again .
Someone should revive it post - Savile – it is , among so many other things , the definitive exploration of England ’s affair with the pied piper myth .
The Scottsboro Boys Chosen by Charlene James
I never thought that one of the best pieces of theatre I ’d ever see would be a musical – or that it would involve a minstrel show .
John Kander and Fred Ebb
’s
The Scottsboro Boys is based on the harrowing true story of nine black teenagers in 1931 who were falsely convicted of raping two white women on a freight train in Alabama .
They were beaten and thrown in jail to await execution .
The use of minstrelsy in the show is subversive : instead of white actors “ blacking up ” , it is the black cast that take on a plethora of all - singing , all - dancing white characters , as well as playing the nine boys .
The music is a mix of jazz and gospel , and the exaggerated movements of the choreography acknowledge the vaudeville shows of the time .
The youngest character performs an unsettling tap dance about his fears of the electric chair .
As my toes began tapping along to the uptempo beat , they were soon stopped by the gut - churning lyrics .
( “ If on that chair you put your rear , your hair frizzles out and your eyes disappear .
” )
No matter how often my fingers wanted to click along to the score , or a brief smile appeared on my face at the buffoonery , the underlying feeling of discomfort stayed with me – and did so long after it ended .
The finale of most minstrel shows was the cakewalk , a moronic dance that ridiculed slaves on plantations .
But here the boys refuse to participate and they walk off stage .
The real Scottsboro boys had no choice in their narrative ; the play ’s characters , in this moment , do .
They leave the stage more empowered .
The week I saw Susan Stroman ’s production at the Young Vic in 2013 , the Alabama parole board granted posthumous pardons to the three Scottsboro boys , who had yet to be exonerated .
It took 82 years for all of their names to be cleared .
An Oak Tree Chosen by Alistair McDowall
It was the first play I ’d seen that was conceptually daring and highly emotionally engaged .
I ’d always presumed those two things were exclusive –
I went to certain stories to get my fix of the first , and others to get the second .
Tim Crouch ’s
An Oak Tree satisfied both in just over an hour .
I first saw it while I was at university .
I ’ve seen it a few times now , and it works brilliantly with audiences of all shapes and sizes .
It ’s a story about the death of a girl from the perspective of both her father and the man who killed her accidentally , a hypnotist .
The twist is that the actor portraying the father has no knowledge of the play – a different actor plays the role at each performance and arrives at the theatre the same time as the audience .
The actor is then invited on stage and guided through the performance by the hypnotist , played by Crouch .
It ’s a simple , well - told story , and the way the twist in the form works is straightforward enough to be understood by everyone as , crucially , it emerges from the story itself .
It is about hypnosis and transformation , and we watch an act of hypnosis , we see a transformation .
Form rises from content .
In the opening scenes , the actor is told to repeat questions and learn answers from Crouch about who they ’re playing , what the world of the play is , what the rules are .
It ’s the entire act of theatre distilled .
We are invited to begin imagining together .
As Dan Rebellato puts it in his introduction to the play : “ The theatre only exists if we believe in it .
”
On a good night at the theatre , it ’s thrilling to be in the audience – all of you working together to will something into being .
I think about these opening moments when trying to do my job effectively ; trying to find a language , a structure and a form simple enough to reach everyone , deep enough to contain multitudes .
Stick Fly Chosen by Branden Jacobs - Jenkins
The plot of Lydia Diamond ’s
Stick Fly is a staple of American theatre , but with a twist .
A clan of significant wealth descends on their homestead ( in this case , a summer home on Martha ’s Vineyard ) , the adult children with romantic partners in town .
Secrets are revealed .
Drama ensues .
Everyone ’s
“ changed
” .
What ’s the twist ?
Well , the family is black .
If there ’s one theme American drama has in spades , it ’s family :
Long Day ’s Journey Into Night ,
Death of a Salesman , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , Buried Child .
Unfortunately , entries into this canon by playwrights of colour are rarely treated as such .
Instead they are often regarded as nothing more than sociological studies of black economic disenfranchisement and labelled as being about “ the African - American experience ” ( as if every black person in the US was either stuck in mid-19th - century Chicago or living in Pittsburgh ) .
Like something halfway between Fences and Hay Fever , Stick Fly dared to expand our repertoire of black representation in US drama .
It was n’t a play so much about race , as one about the essence of privilege and love and fatherhood .
Stick Fly is a remarkable piece of writing on a number of other levels .
It is self - consciously well - made , something – oddly enough – frequently lobbed at it as some sort of criticism .
It spoke to genuine evolutions in race relations that I believe just were n’t recognisable at the time .
The best writing , to me , is never so much about technical proficiency .
It ’s about daring to chart uncharted waters of feeling and experience .
As the product of two highly educated , black , middle - class Americans , whose own education can often feel like a curse as much as a privilege , who had found himself romantically entangled with folks across all kinds of racial lines , who , too , had been raised by a single mother – suddenly , for the first time in my life , I found myself fully identifying with what was happening and what was being said on stage , and it was like a bolt of lightning .
For the first time , I fully understood what the power of identification in the theatre truly meant and why this form matters .
Hoke ’s Bluff Chosen by Lulu Raczka
It ’s the run - up to the big game .
No team from the town of Hoke ’s Bluff have made it this far in forever .
A win would mean everything .
No one feels this more than the team captain .
It ’s all on him .
Sound familiar ?
It ’s supposed to .
Gemma Paintin and James Stenhouse , who make up the Live Art company Action Hero , are knowingly telling us the unoriginal American underdog story .
Between them they play every character of this familiar cinematic universe : the competitive cheerleaders , the coach living vicariously through his team and the guy chatting shit on a car bonnet , looking at the stars .
I was fascinated by this show when I saw it three years ago at Forest Fringe , but not because of what it does , more because of what it does n’t do .
We sit in bleachers and a Wildcats mascot fires up the audience .
Then it starts , and the cliches roll out and the performers keep their British accents .
And you think : this is about the American Dream , I know where this is going .
You see , most other theatre - makers , myself included , would have kept up this premise for two - thirds of the show , and then started to dismantle it , until it broke down completely , probably taking some of the set with it .
Break the cliche , make a point .
But Action Hero played it straight .
Cliche after cliche was treated with the earnest tone of the movies they borrowed from .
And I actually connected to it .
Of course , we could be cynical , we could play the stoned high - school philosopher and say that Action Hero , along with all the movies , have sold us a lie .
But this show reminded me it ’s easy to be cynical .
It ’s much harder to be hopeful .
And it is much , much harder to take the most saccharine material possible , and find real warmth in it ."
