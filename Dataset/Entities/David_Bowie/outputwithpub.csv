1999-04-14,"There is only one small Mediterranean fishing village that numbers the likes of Joan Collins , Jack Nicholson , David Bowie , Naomi Campbell , David Beckham and Elton John among its summer visitors and it is taking steps to stay that way .
Saint - Tropez , which became famous when it stole the show from an unknown young actress called Brigitte Bardot in the 1955 film
And God Created Woman , has registered its name as a trademark . '
This is really not a question of trying to make money out of the name of Saint - Tropez , or even the abbreviation Saint - Trop ' , which we 've also copyrighted , ' said Jean - Michel Couve , the town 's mayor .
' It 's about actively defending and controlling our public image , and making sure not just anyone goes around selling any old garbage with our name on it . '
So far , the council licensing committee has signed contracts with four companies hoping to exploit the name : a champagne house ; a mineral water producer ; an upmarket cutlery maker ; and a television company which wants to use the name for a cafe in a sitcom .
It has refused applications from dozens of different souvenir and T - shirt manufacturers , and from companies wanting to name a set of playing cards , a disposable camera and a new condom after the town .
It has also fought three successful court battles , including one against the owners of a pizza business in the Vaucluse who were ordered to pay Â£ 5,000 in damages . '
I 'm afraid anything at all involving the notion of disposability will not be looked upon very favourably , ' said Mr Couve .
Although the village first hit the headlines thanks to Ms Bardot , a string of artists were drawn to its spectacular light in the late 19th century .
But the resort quickly became a victim of its own success and in 1989 Ms Bardot herself declared that she was ' leaving it to the invaders ' .
These days , despite the packed beaches and the 12,000 cars that try to reach the village every day in high summer , the international jet - set are returning to Saint - Tropez . '
I 'm told LA has too much smog , Miami too much crime and Bali is too dull , ' said Simone Duckstein , a local hotel owner ."
1999-05-14,"Eidos , the computer games company , has teamed up with rock star David Bowie and his wife Iman , and the best - selling author Michael Crichton in two deals designed to create hit games .
Eidos has signed a long- term publishing deal with Timeline Studios , North Carolina , for games based on original material to be written by novelist Michael Crichton , who co - founded Timeline .
Crichton is the author of Jurassic Park , made into a film by Stephen Spielberg , and creator of the television series ER .
Bowie and Iman 's first Eidos project , however , will be released in October .
Omikron :
The Nomad Soul , will feature music and songs composed for it by Bowie who also appears in the game as a character called Boz , above .
The game has been in development for two years and uses the latest technology to create a three - dimensional fantasy world with 140 characters , 400 different sets and four hours of dialogue .
Bowie has written eight new songs for Omikron .
The game will incorporate new technology which makes facial characteristics of cartoon characters more realistic ."
1999-06-01,"Two years ago , David Bowie struck a deal on Wall Street that brought him $ 55 m overnight and a credibility among bankers he was never likely to achieve with Ziggy Stardust .
The "" Bowie bonds "" were a radical innovation : shares sold in Bowie 's own talent , namely the projected royalties of his first 25 albums over the next 15 years .
He had , in effect , floated himself on the stock exchange and , with this , gained greater control of his royalties .
Bowie got the applause , but the man behind the deal was a 36-year - old broker who has just pulled off the same trick for James Brown this time to the tune of $ 100 m .
His name is David Pullman , he comes from New York , and he has a flair for drama to rival that of his clients .
"" Your dad wants you to be a doctor because he says business is bad ; your mom wants you to be an attorney because she 'd like to divorce her husband .
I wanted something bigger .
After I was in Time magazine , my third - grade teacher called to say , ' Is that the same David Pullman ?
I knew you 'd be the one to succeed . '
"" Pullman looks like Jerry Seinfeld , talks like a machine gun and , while modest he ai n't , his boasting recalls that of the class nerd who grows up to be hugely successful but never quite believes it .
"" When we struck the Bowie deal , we did n't even know if it would work .
But the first lesson of success is that you must n't be afraid to fail .
Bowie never once rang to ask if there were problems .
The same with James Brown .
They look you in the eye and , within 60 seconds , they get the concept .
Everyone thought I was crazy when I first did the deal ; now they 're all at it . ""
"" It "" is the intellectual property market an estimated one trillion dollar field that deals in non - tangible assets like royalties .
The idea came to Pullman when Bowie 's manager approached him with the aim of selling his publishing rights .
Pullman had a better idea : why not keep the rights and float bonds backed by Bowie 's future earnings ?
"" It was pro - creator , pro - artist , because it let them keep the copyright .
The artists loved it : they 'd say , ' I wish I 'd met you years ago .
It 's about time there was someone on our side . '
""
Pullman charges a 10 % commission and , before doing anything , sends in the auditors to find out whether his clients are being screwed .
"" Most artists are lazy : they complain a lot but they are n't disciplined enough to audit their accounts .
So we send in the best .
"" It 's a hard line he also takes with his staff , snapping down the phone as they ring in at 15-minute intervals .
"" You got the message this morning ?
And have you done anything about it ?
That was four hours ago .
This is unacceptable .
Have you phoned Mandy ?
Have you phoned Mandy ?
You 're not listening to me : I said , ' Have you phoned Mandy ? ' ""
He bangs down the phone .
"" Someone I should have fired , "" he says , smiling to show that he 's soft really .
The Pullman Group gets 1,000 enquiries a year , but it 's rare that an artist has the status to secure the deal
: Iron Maiden have done it , and the songwriters behind 40 % of Motown 's hits Holland - Dozier - Holland .
For once , old age increases the artist 's value . ""
James Brown was 66 when his agents approached us .
Our catalogues are typically 20 , 30 , 40 years old .
If a song is producing money from 1966 to 1999 , the odds are it 's going to continue to produce . ""
Pullman gets on well with the artists because he says he understands them .
His first ambition was to go to art school , and he likes the glitz of rubbing shoulders with legends .
"" There are similarities between the sharpness in eye of someone who 's an artist , and of one who 's a top businessman .
"" It would all be very wearing if he took himself too seriously .
But he does n't .
There is a "" family "" crest on the company website , a medley of lions and harps that turns out to be cribbed from the Pullman coach company a total piss - take .
At least , I think it is .
The phone rings again .
It 's New York .
"" Did you update the website ? "" he asks . ""
No , not the photo of James Brown .
Just the one of me . """
1999-06-08,"Behind The Music : Iggy Pop 10 pm , VH1 .
Lust For Life
, Real Wild Child , and Search And Destroy are merely the accompaniment to this biog of the high priest of punk , documenting Iggy 's on - off relationship with stardom , The Stooges , mental illness , and heroin .
Born the strait - laced son of a teacher , Iggy was soon hurling himself at everything from mic stands to David Bowie , perfecting his pugnacious and self - destructive live shows .
Dave Green Prenom : Carmen ( Jean - Luc Godard , 1983 ) 1.25am , FilmFour .
Here 's Godard musing on the hellish difficulty of film - making , plonking himself in a lunatic asylum and re - running Bizet 's Carmen as a bank - robbing terrorist ( Maruschka Detmers ) starting an affair with a young cop ( Jacques Bonnaffe ) .
Meanwhile we are treated to views of the city and the sea , and jokes about blood and death :
Godard may have embraced the notion of narrative more fully in his later years , but he was never going to make it easy .
Legends Of The Fall
( Edward Zwick , 1995 )
2.50am , FilmFour Anthony Hopkins is patriarchal Montana rancher Colonel Ludlow ; his boys are Aidan Quinn 's Alfred , eldest and steadiest ;
Henry Thomas the wide - eyed nipper , Samuel ; and in between , Brad Pitt 's all - American hero , Tristan .
All fall for Alfred 's girl , Susannah ( Julia Ormond , pictured ) ; she leans , unsurprisingly , towards Tristan , who nobly heads for World War I , and a family tragedy .
Alien Resurrection ( Jean - Pierre Jeunet , 1997 )
10.15pm
, Sky Premier Fourth of the Alien series , set 200 years on from Alien3 , with Sigourney Weaver 's cloned Ripley back from the dead .
True , it squanders the macabre ramifications of genetic mutation inherent in Ripley 's rebirth , in favour of the familiar run - before - they - get - you mayhem ; but Jeunet , director of the queasy comedy Delicatessen , adds some ghoulish touches to the action and the humans - a band of space pirates ; Winona Ryder 's elfin Call , and particularly the enigmatic super - Ripley - are as freaky as the monsters ."
1999-09-06,"I ' ve got this thing about Croydon , "" David Bowie said recently .
"" It was my nemesis .
I hated Croydon with a real vengeance .
It represented everything I did n't want in my life , everything I wanted to get away from ...
it was gon na be the big second city to London , but it never came to be .
Bits of it they put up , these awful faceless office blocks , complete concrete hell .
"" That was the considered view of a south London suburban boy made mythically big , who , by his own admission , has n't been back to Croydon for years .
You might not expect a megastar to spend much time in the suburb that would be a city ; nor would you expect such a radical talent to share a view of Croydon - and thus of postwar British planning and architecture - with the Prince of Wales .
Yet , last week , the prince laid into the country 's planners , criticising their "" 60s mindset "" - the mindset that gave us the Croydon Bowie hates .
Like too many of our towns and cities , it was made all but uninhabitable by a pseudo - scientific practice called "" zoning "" : the separating of the different functions of a town or city - housing , offices , factories and so on - into their own ghettos .
But the prince has got it ever so slightly wrong , just as he did when he attacked architects in 1984 with a speech that failed to recognise that architecture was moving away from the grim , pseudo - Modern banality that , to an extent , characterises the centre of Croydon .
Now he imagines planners as men - from - the - ministry types devoid of imagination .
Yet many of them have long since turned their backs on the zoning fad and Croydon is doing its best to raise its standards .
At the beginning of next year , as part of the national millennium celebrations , one British town will win a city charter , and Croydon 's remarkably civic - minded Conservative authorities have been working to beat Milton Keynes to the honour .
The council has been in discussions with many leading architects , and the place has started to look and feel significantly different from the way it did in the dread 60s when , as a model of zoning policy , it raised the kind of office blocks that must have made US planners laugh in disbelief .
Considering Mies van der Rohe had demonstrated in 1922 how a Modern Movement office block might be a thing of beauty , and proved it in 1958 by designing the Seagram Building in Manhattan with Philip Johnson , the British were very backward in the design of office towers : many looked like giant cornflakes packets turned on their sides .
Yet this was only a part of the problem Prince Charles has recognised a quarter of a century after nearly everyone else : it was the relationship between where people lived and where they worked that was fundamentally wrong .
Those glum new zones of office blocks were a long bus or train ride from the homes of those who typed and filed in them .
The idea we have rediscovered over the past 10 or 15 years - that you might want to own or rent a city - centre home - was thought of as medieval .
The car was king , public transport worked pretty well and it was assumed that , country yokels and Soho bohemians aside , everyone would lead the suburban life that ultimately nurtured talents like Bowie 's , even though he despised it .
It is significant that the prince made his comments last week at a private meeting with the government environment committee looking into plans for the 3.8 m to 4.4 m new homes that will swamp mainly southern England over the next 15 or 20 years .
Here , there is a problem .
New private housing developments have been allowed to spread like a nasty rash alongside A - roads , motorways and mainline railways over the past decade .
And there seems to be no cure in sight , despite the best efforts of Lord Rogers and his urban task force ( which includes planners ) who believe that we should be building most of these homes on brownfield sites in , or on the edges , of existing town and city centres .
It is interesting to see , in the centres of major cities , notably London , 60s office blocks being converted into flats for those who wish to walk to work and enjoy city - centre life after work without having to take the last packed train to Croydon .
And yet , despite the huge efforts of planners , architects , developers and local authorities to revitalise our city centres over the past decade , our view of where to locate and how to design new homes is stuck in the "" 60s mindset "" identified by the prince .
The prince then is half - right , and so is Bowie .
The way we split our towns and cities into fragments was folly and we are paying for it in many ways , from teenage boredom to the absurd time- and energy - consuming journeys we make to and from work .
Clearly there is a lot of healing needed ; but it 's as wrong for Prince Charles to single out planners for attack in 1999 as it was for him to bludgeon architects in 1984 .
The cure for zoning can only be found if we identify why the virus thrives years after it was recognised as harmful .
Crude economics and tired social values are to blame .
It is far cheaper for housebuilders to develop on greenfield sites than in town centres .
It is still much easier for them to sell new homes based on the suburban dream than it is to market city - centre apartments .
And in terms of design , they make much bigger profits churning out tired old- world homes than they would if they were to be brave and invest in modern homes on brownfield sites .
The problem with the planning system is that , as servants of local authorities , planners , like other officials , must toe the line for much of the time and go along with the absurdity of seeing new homes built wherever and whenever local councillors and housebuilders see eye to eye , squire .
What we need to do if we are to save much of Britain from being overwhelmed by a mounting tide of schlock , car - oriented suburban housing is to face up to the brute economic system and tired code of social values that have enabled us to destroy the very country and countryside we say we love .
If the Prince of Wales wants to help - and his heart is in the right place - it is time he started to question the system and values that have led us to blight city and countryside for 50 years , and stopped attacking those who would love to be able to plan rightly and well , in the would - be City of Croydon as elsewhere ."
1999-10-10,"At the click of a mouse , the global village finally arrived last night - with a little help from David Bowie , Puff Daddy , George Michael and other leading pop stars .
Up to a billion people across the world - one - sixth of humanity - logged on to three overlapping concerts in London , New York and Geneva , broadcast live on the Internet .
Millions more tuned in to the NetAid concerts on television and radio in 120 countries in a unique collaboration between the three media .
NetAid , a link - up between the United Nations and the American computer company Cisco Systems , aims to alleviate world poverty .
The proceeds from last night will go to refugees in Kosovo and Sudan . '
We are expecting a billion hits on the Net , ' said Chris Dedicoat , vice - president of Cisco in Britain and Ireland , who was confident that the Internet could cope with the load .
All the stars performed free .
Among those appearing with Bowie and Michael at Wembley Stadium were Bryan Adams , Bush , Catatonia , the Corrs , the Eurythmics and Robbie Williams .
The London concert was put together by Harvey Goldsmith , the promoter who has something of a cash crisis himself .
Bono , who is also campaigning for debt relief for the Third World , played at the Giants Stadium in New York with Sting , Puff Daddy , Jimmy Page , Sheryl Crow , Busta Rhymes , Jewel , Cheb Mami and the Black Crowes .
Bryan Ferry appeared in Geneva with Texas , Des'ree , Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Michael Kamen .
Unlike Live Aid in 1985 , Bob Geldof 's money - raising extravaganza for Ethiopia , NetAid is not a one - off concert .
The website will continue . '
NetAid will be a lasting weapon that will help mobilise people who were not involved previously and create new virtual communities that will work together to eradicate extreme poverty , ' said Mark Malloch Brown , the Briton who runs the UN Development Programme .
The UN estimates that 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty - existing on less than $ 1 a day .
Secretary - General Kofi Annan said last night at the concert in Geneva : ' In three days ' time there will officially be six billion human beings - and nearly half of them will have to survive on $ 2 a day or less . '
The scale of misery that implies is beyond our imagination .
How many children unable to go to school ?
How many without clean water to drink ?
How many with nowhere to sleep ?
How many crying because they are hungry ?
How many dying of diseases caused by malnutrition ? '
All of us would like to change that if we could .
And now every one of us can help change it , with the click of a mouse . '"
1999-10-10,"We were at Wembley Stadium 's first charity gig since Live Aid , and there , as if the 90s had never happened , were George Michael , David Bowie and Eurythmics .
Dave Stewart even had the beard , which is no more becoming now than during Eurythmics ' last incarnation 10 years ago .
Evidently , we are so bereft of young A - list talent that this lot , average age 44 , were recruited to lend weight to NetAid , the sprawling event that took place in London , New York and Geneva on Saturday .
Their dull - but - worthy presence ensured there was little sense of occasion , and nothing to talk about afterwards , once you 'd exhausted the subject of Michael 's Ali G glasses .
Some people , though , may one day tell their grandchildren about Michael being slotted under grunge nonentities Bush , and poor old Ziggy Stardust getting sandwiched between Bush and prole - rocking Bryan Adams .
There was also the perplexing disunity during the "" Moment of Unity "" , when the three venues linked up to sing .
Geneva and New York duly sang , but the assembled London cast shuffled off before the tune began , apparently to allow the stage to be prepared for headliner Robbie Williams .
This bowing to market forces recalled a remark made backstage by Catatonia 's Cerys Matthews .
Asked if Net Aid would meet its goal of eradicating extreme poverty , she said : "" Of course not . ""
Few proselytised about why we were there , and there was no unifying Geldof figure demanding your money , now .
The atmosphere was closer to that of a sleek showcase .
A fishnet - encased Matthews epitomised the whole thing , perfunctorily wenching through Road Rage and leaving no aftertaste .
Eurythmics were also on and off before you could say , "" At least they did n't play the new album "" .
Only the Corrs and George Michael emphasised the charity angle , with versions of REM 's Everybody Hurts and the Depression standard Brother , Can You Spare
A Dime ?
Michael , by the way , deserves commendation for turning his segment into a camp revue , complete with choir and dancers .
Bowie treated the event as a promotional exercise , squandering half his six songs on dull new ones that made his set the best time to queue for a hot dog .
The best 20 minutes was turned in by a Welsh band that makes Bryan Adams sound like Eno .
Appearing just before Robbie Williams , as a gentle wind stirred the red dragons on flags that suddenly popped up in the throng , Stereophonics finally made sense .
The eternal question "" Why them ? "" was answered by five examples of the genus Pubbus Rockus that spoke to the 60,000 as no one else had .
Being this decade 's Status Quo does n't exactly enhance their CV
but , like Quo , Stereophonics touch a nerve in the old part of the brain that makes you nod along automatically .
Which left only Robbie - so famous these days he only needs one name - who cried as he confided : "" You just fulfilled a dream of mine . ""
The dream , one assumes , was to preside over Wembley Stadium as every last soul roared , "" She offers me protection , a lotta love and affection , whether I 'm right or wrong "" .
Glad to help , Rob .
But , er , why were we there , again ?"
1999-11-09,"Storytellers 4 pm and 10 pm , VH1 David Bowie plays highlights , some of which have been violently rearranged , for a carefully selected audience from a career which has spanned plastic soul , glam , electronica , and , most regrettably , jungle .
Theatrical at all times , the songs are interspersed with stories - including his time in Berlin with Iggy when they were "" very naughty boys "" - most of which seem to have been selected to showcase Bowie 's repertoire of accents .
Indulgent and at times embarrassing , as a TV show
, it 's got "" you had to be there "" stamped all over it .
The Passion Of Joan Of Arc
( Carl Dreyer , 1928 )
6 pm , FilmFour Known as the last great silent , Danish director Dreyer 's film is an intense account of the last days of Joan of Arc , from her interrogations to execution at the stake : an extraordinary drama of anguish and faith , played out in stony interiors .
Shaven - headed and make - up free , ReneÃ© Falconetti is mesmerising as the maid , her features beautifully framed in Dreyer 's close - ups .
My Life
As A Dog ( Lasse HallstrÃ¶m , 1985 ) 8 pm ,
FilmFour
The charming , funny tale of a 12-year - old boy ( compare Kes 's Billy ) sent to live in a hick village in southern Sweden by his ailing mother .
It 's the summer of 1959 and , missing his own pet back in the city , he feels as exiled as the Russian spacedog then famously orbiting the earth .
A perceptive study of the magic of childhood , lit up by the cheeky sparkle of Anton Glanzelius .
Deconstructing Harry ( Woody Allen , 1997 ) 10 pm
, Sky Premier Woody Allen is writer Harry Block , suffering from - yes - writer 's block .
It 's a very sharp - edged , complex comedy .
Beset by Allen - esque personal problems - he 's antagonised family and friends by using them in his work - Block takes off for an ex - lover 's wedding , Allen weaving numerous fictional episodes into the "" real - life "" story .
The cast also includes Billy Crystal , Demi Moore as well as Robin Williams ."
1999-12-03,"The first worldwide licence to stream music videos over the internet was announced yesterday by the music company EMI and Launch Media , writes Chris Barrie .
The deal gives EMI a small equity stake in Launch Media , based in Santa Monica , in exchange for granting the digital media company access to its music video library .
The deal could see artists such as David Bowie feature in online video distribution , with fans downloading pictures and sound to the PC .
EMI said the deal would make Launch Media the most extensive video collection on the web with access to EMI labels including Virgin , EMI , Capitol Records , Astralwerks , Priority , Angel and Blue Note .
Artists under the EMI umbrella range from Robbie Williams to the Beatles , via artists such as Japan 's Utada Hikaru .
The deal is similar to others struck by EMI with online companies , swapping access to its extensive content for equity stakes .
The company hopes that internet distribution will extend its reach and bring a wider selection of its music to potential customers ."

Interviews by Imogen Aylen , Catherine Jones and Kim Bunce"
2000-02-01,"As the godfather of technopop , actor , model and soundtrack composer Ryuichi Sakamoto has reached places other musicians barely know exist .
Yet , despite having worked with a list of collaborators that includes David Bowie , Youssou N'Dour and Bernardo Bertolucci , Sakamoto remains a shadowy and self - effacing presence .
Barely visible on the unlit platform , he busied himself with banks of tape machines , turntables and digital keypads .
The idea seemed to be to whet his listeners ' appetite for the melodic material due later in the show by testing their responses ( and possibly their patience ) with an apparently random assortment of noises .
Snatches of Japanese koto music alternated with chunks of tribal chanting or eerie orchestral strings .
What sounded like hiss from a faulty amplifier gradually took on rhythm and shape .
Then Sakamoto slipped across to the piano and plunged into the mainstream of European classical music .
His first piece was limpid , delicate and somewhat Satie - esque .
Then he grew more "" romantic "" , hinting at the ghosts of Chopin - even Rachmaninov or Schumann .
Words and symbols flashed up on a pair of screens behind him - "" a massive bundle of letters sleeps in my arms "" , "" a newborn baby "" - but it was hard to discern what they added to the performance .
Sakamoto may be a cunning synthesist of concepts and cultures , but for that very reason , it 's difficult to pin down what he means .
Perhaps that 's what has made him such a successful soundtrack composer : writing music for movies means missing bits out and playing down your own identity .
Joined onstage by the string quartet Solid Strings , he played Rain , from his Last Emperor soundtrack , then a piece he composed for Wuthering Heights .
The first sounded like a formal exercise in Nyman - esque minimalism , the second was windswept , lush and vapid .
Excerpts from his opera , Life , seemed technically assured but lacked intensity .
It was as if Sakamoto had passed through but left no trace behind him .
Quite an accurate reflection of his whole career , in fact ."
2000-02-14,"Rock star David Bowie announced yesterday that he is to become a father again at the age of 53 .
Bowie and his wife , the model
Iman , 44 , were married in 1992 .
Both have children from their previous marriages which ended in divorce .
Both plan to reduce their work schedules to make more time for the child , which is due in August .
In a statement Mr Bowie , estimated to be worth more than Â£ 500 m , said : "" It 's been a long and patient wait for our baby but both Iman
and I wanted the circumstances to be absolutely right and did n't want to find ourselves working flat out during the first couple of years of the baby 's life . ""
Bowie has a son , now 28 , from his 1970 marriage to Angie , who changed his name from Zowie to Joe .
The couple were divorced in 1980 .
Iman has a daughter , Zulekha , from a marriage to a basketball star ."
2000-02-23,"It 's priceless .
I 'm in the local cafe with Sophie Fiennes to talk about The Late Michael Clark ( BBC 2 , 11.25pm ) , her documentary portrait of the ever - contentious dancer and choreographer , and all I 'm hearing
are the city boys beside us discussing share prices .
She 's brimming with enthusiasm - detailing her adolescent fondness for David Bowie and the way "" as soon as you bring a camera into a relationship , everything changes "" - but such is the volume of our neighbours , there 's really only one conversation at this table , and it 's about investing in sugar .
How 's that for art versus commerce ?
Eventually , however , we get the place to ourselves .
Which is fortunate , because while tonight 's programme hardly threatens to bulldoze through the ratings , it does prove its director to be more than simply a celebrated family name ( yes , you may be familiar with her brothers , Ralph and Joseph ) .
A loose , non - linear account of the build - up to Clark 's CURRENT / See ( his return to the stage after four years of smack and inactivity ) ,
The Late ... gives you everything from the rehearsals of Big Bottom - the all - bass quintet whose stentorian rumblings provide the show 's soundtrack - to the star 's bin - bag - clutching trip to the laundrette .
And , somewhere between the relative relaxation of Clark in front of the camera - borne of having known Fiennes for eight years - and the film 's Digital Video - derived sense of vÃ©ritÃ© , the results are absorbing , inventive and , more unexpectedly , entirely approachable .
"" I realise my tastes probably lean towards the experimental , "" she admits , "" but at the same time , one of the things I find most irritating in any medium is self - indulgence .
And I really do n't feel there 's anything in there which is wilfully obscure .
I mean , I know so many people who are interested in the same things as me , who are hungry for this kind of stuff , and that it 's not , you know ...
a wank in the bath . ""
So far so good .
Yet , despite its ease of access , her film wo n't just have to contend with viewers ' preconceptions ; it 's also going to be remembered as much for what 's been left out as edited in .
The thorny issue of heroin , for example , comes and goes in the space of a sentence .
But , she says , that 's neither an oversight nor the act of a friend eager to paper over the cracks .
"" Once you introduce heroin , "" she remarks , "" I just feel it unbalances what you 're actually trying to do with the work .
I mean , it 's so much easier to make a documentary where you spend fifteen minutes talking about someone 's heroin addiction than it is to actually look at their work .
That way , you have to give something of yourself . ""
Similarly , there 's a distinct lack of talking heads and pop - psychoanalysis in evidence .
Almost uniquely , Fiennes remains adamant she wants Clark - or whoever she happens to be dealing with - to be understood through their work rather than the other way around ; not for her the hackneyed game of small - screen headshrinking .
Rarely less than animated , she fairly bristles at the mention of more conventional documentary technique .
"" You see , I think that school of thought often produces what I call illustrated radio , where you basically have a voiceover interpreting someone like Michael Clark for you , and as a viewer you 're then supposed to just venerate at the shrine of their celebrity .
But that 's not what I wanted to do .
Because once you put someone in this ... "" She leans in , her fingers forming an impromptu frame . "" ... what you find are all sorts of visual things which say more about you than a voiceover or journalist could ever convey .
So I did n't want to make something where people sat and talked about Michael , and where Michael was forced to do that himself . ""
Indeed , it 's striking how , while he seldom shies away from the lens , Clark seems markedly disinclined to PR himself ; for a man often condemned as a self - publicist , he seems reticent about thrusting himself at the audience .
"" Right , "" Fiennes nods , "" and one thing that has led to is people saying that I 'm not telling them enough about Michael , that I 'm not revealing what 's
he 's like . ""
And does she have a problem with that ? ""
No , because I think by the end you have a far better insight into Michael and his work than you would with a series of experts offering their ' take ' on him . ""
In one sense , of course , it 's all about context .
The snag with such an approach is that it runs the risk of fazing an audience weaned on the non - stop drama of the docusoap ; what makes her film tick is its ellipses , the spaces between the big events .
You wonder how she fits in alongside the Airports and Uncovereds . ""
What troubles me , "" she remarks , "" is that those programmes are basically emotional pornography , and their success pushes people like me into a really tight corner .
I mean , part of it is that they imply a kind of instant celebrity , so you find people simply playing a role they 've created for themselves .
There is n't a great deal of naivety in subjects anymore . ""
She lets out a small sigh .
And , instead of drawing inspiration from TV , looks instead to the purism of the Dogme 95 film - making collective for kinship .
It 's an admiration dating back to 1998 's Lars From 1 - 10 , her documentary sketch of Dogme nabob Lars von Trier - a choice of subject which ca n't help invite comparisons with Clark ( both dismissed as controversialists , both notorious control freaks , both extremely media savvy .... )
"" Oh , I can see the parallels , "" she confirms .
"" I do n't know , I think maybe it 's because I respect people who do n't offer themselves up on a plate .
I mean , I 'm drawn to the kind of work they do where you really have to crawl through barbed wire on your belly . ""
Next up comes a feature - length documentary she 's preparing on Noel Jones , "" an amazing gospel preacher in LA who , it turns out , is Grace 's brother "" .
But , with her Dogme connection and her desire to "" marry documentary to the language of cinema "" , is The Late Michael Clark simply a prelude to a career in features ; what you could , if you were feeling lippy , call the big league ? ""
Hmm .
I do n't think so .
I 'm interested in using cinematic language , but I like being inside the story as it unfolds .
And also , and I know this might sound funny coming from me , I do n't really know enough about actors . ""
Funny she should mention that .
Because , if she were to make the move into features , she 's all too aware her public profile would expand with it ; not the most comfortable thought for a woman who admits a faint terror at the idea of being sold as someone else 's sister .
That said , she 's sceptical whether "" there 's even much mileage in that angle in career terms -
I mean , all it means is that if I wore a fancy dress to a film premiere there 'd be a picture of me smiling in someone 's society pages . ""
"" And I am nervous about revealing myself .
I do n't know , maybe it 's because I 'm secretive .
It 's probably why I 'm drawn to people like Michael , because they 're so brave in exposing themselves .
And that fascinates me , because I 'm so wary of it .
I mean , if I were to make original fiction , I 'd feel totally naked . ""
"" So , "" she says , "" at the moment , I 'm quite happy to indulge in this kind of ...
Munchausen By Proxy .
"" She raises an eyebrow ; then comes a broad , lopsided grin ; and , finally , Sophie Fiennes bursts out laughing ."
2000-02-25,"The titles of the tracks are not exactly in the David Bowie class .
One is called A Shirt Ironed Hastily ; another , Finally , the Freezer is Full Again .
Neverthless , the producers of Nie Mehr Allein ( Alone No More ) are hoping that their new CD can win a place in the hearts and collections of a lucrative section of the record - buying public .
It is the ultimate in singleton listening : more than an hour of background noise simulating the presence of a non - existent partner . ""
It has the advantage over a real partner that , if you are bothered , you can switch it off .
This is difficult to do with real partners , "" said Bernd Klosterfelde , whose inspiration it was .
The album is due to reach the shelves of record stores in Germany next week .
Mr Klosterfelde , who works for a Hamburg publishing house , said negotiations were in progress with distributors in other countries , including Britain .
The German version , promising "" 62 minutes of togetherness "" , comes in a case bearing the vacuously smiling face of a shop window mannequin .
"" You feel cared for .
But you do n't feel disturbed at all , "" says one advert . ""
Alone
No More sweetens the solitude and lightens the loneliness . ""
Mr Klosterfelde , a 56-year - old divorcee , got the idea three years ago shortly after he began to live by himself .
"" I was speaking on the telephone to a friend on a Sunday morning which is when you tend to think most about being alone .
"" It was not until last December , however , that he got around to turning his idea into a CD .
The recording was simplicity itself . ""
A young colleague of mine followed his girlfriend through the flat with a microphone , "" Mr Klosterfelde said .
An initial run of 3,000 copies was produced for marketing exclusively on the internet .
A spokesman for the distributors said returns showed that the highest sales so far had been in Switzerland .
"" Maybe it 's because of the mountains , "" Mr Klosterfelde ventured .
The webpage advertising Alone
No More could serve as a manifesto for Singleton Pride .
"" Only the single tree in an open field is a desirable subject for a photograph , "" it enthuses .
"" If the same tree were to stand in the middle of a forest no one would notice it . ""
The distributor 's spokesman said the response had been promising , with 300 copies sold since the CD went on sale in January .
"" We are pretty confident we will sell out , "" he added .
Mr Klosterfelde said a deal had been signed to make Alone No More available through conventional outlets in much bigger numbers . ""
Hopefully , tens of thousands . ""
He is confident it can be marketed internationally . ""
After all , there is very little to translate . """

2000-03-14,"Jean Baudrillard 's lecture in London last Friday did not take place .
But do n't be alarmed : the aim of thought , after all , is not truth or reality .
Thinking is the art of making things disappear .
Let 's try , then , to make this impish , septuagenarian matre Ã  penser disappear too .
Picture , if you will , Baudrillard in the chemistry lecture theatre of University College , London .
Gazing down from a side wall is a vast chart of the periodic table , whose elements huddle together for comfort , anxious at the appearance in their midst of this unpredictable catalyst .
Baudrillard looks wonderfully like a hyperreal cafe Frenchman : short , rotund , in a crumpled suit , with tufts of golden - grey hair poking out from his temples .
But that appearance is a mask .
To an audience of alternately amused and blankly bamboozled architecture students , Baudrillard delivers an hour of sizzlingly dense , rococo argumentation in his warm but near - impenetrable Gallic tones .
He explains his love of taking photographs , and mercilessly dissects the poverty of modern art .
He laments the loss of magic , the fact that in an age of technical explanation , the universe has now "" fallen "" into a banal reality .
The universe is given to us ready - made , like Duchamp 's urinal .
And art has no answer to this ; it can only rehearse the disaster . ""
To turn an object into art , "" Baudrillard smiles , "" you just have to make it useless . ""
But the idea of uselessness is itself useless .
Today , we merely enjoy the idea of art , not art itself .
Why ?
Baudrillard calls it "" image - feedback "" .
The image masks itself with an idea of itself .
It constantly transforms itself into a message , and thus prevents us from seeing .
Meaning , the omnipresent , choking smog of the post - industrial era gets in the way .
This is true of all visual media .
"" It is the TV that looks at us , "" he insists , "" from a blind spot , from nothing .
"" Our gaze is turned back from this dead zone and blinds us .
And yet there is hope .
Perhaps a certain sort of image could "" break the screen "" .
And perhaps photography is the weapon for this violent liberation .
Because photography , if it avoids being assimilated to a message , can be unintelligible : the opposite of thinking .
The potential for "" something that is neither true nor real , but is beautiful "" .
That is Baudrillard 's plea , his challenge .
Across the road after the lecture we congregate in the bar , drinking beer while Baudrillard 's own photos are projected in triptych on the walls .
The images are inscrutable .
An empty red armchair faces out at the viewer , enacting the disappearance of a human body , whose shape remains , in Baudrillard 's own beautiful phrase , "" like a smile "" .
Close - ups of brick walls or alleys radiating in ecstasies of brown and blue ; a lone bicycle gazing out over a golden river ; a philosopher 's still - life of book , pens , ashtray and coffee bowl ; keys on a cafe table ; splotches of red and black paint on a wall , almost humanoid .
These stories of charged absence continue to glow on the walls as the bar empties and the chatter fades .
The next morning I meet Baudrillard at his hotel in South Kensington . ""
Oh , the grand homme himself ! ""
chirps the receptionist , after I repeat the magic code of his name .
Downstairs in the bar , Baudrillard drinks black coffee and smokes a cigarette he has rolled in advance ; he delivers a rolling monologue in an English - French hybrid .
It 's early , but the twinkle in his eyes bespeaks pure joy in thought .
"" Ouf , it 's a game ! ""
he says , as if astonished that anyone could think otherwise of thinking .
But sometimes even champions need a break .
That 's why Baudrillard took up photography , as a way of escaping writing and thinking .
"" I began to photograph without any ambitions , "" he says , "" not to be exhibited .
It was just surprise encounters with objects , with situations , with lights . ""
He had tried to take portraits of people , but "" it 's a disease of mine before human beings , "" he confesses .
"" I can not take them as subjects .
With objects it 's an elective affinity , as far as they are traces of the living human world . ""
His photographs , he hopes , are without "" meaning "" .
For Baudrillard adores unintelligibility .
There is not enough of it around . ""
Gone is the innocence of nonsense , "" he said wistfully in his lecture .
But he tries his best : "" It is the task of radical thought , since the world is given to us in unintelligibility , to make it more unintelligible , more enigmatic , more fabulous . ""
That is why we love Baudrillard : because he can do this .
But that is not to say he is a mere conjurer of nonsense .
Baudrillard foresaw the allure of virtual reality long before William Gibson ; he was in the vanguard of Marxian critiques of modern consumerism ; before it became fashionable , he wrote a scintillating analysis of man 's sentimental exploitation of animals .
Baudrillard got there first , many times .
And now his self - imposed task is "" this art of taking reality as fiction , taking fiction as a hyperreality "" .
To shock us into realising that thought and the world need not be as they are .
That is why we love him ; it is also why he enrages a certain stodgy , anti - imaginative Anglo - American sensibility .
Baudrillard is most infamous in non - philosophical circles for having said that the Gulf war did not take place .
The theory is that these days , the "" model "" precedes the event and exhausts it totally in advance .
The Gulf war was played out as simulation before any tanks began rolling , and then it was played out again as simulation through videogame - style missile - runs on TV .
Behind this orgiastic virtuality , the "" real "" event was nowhere to be seen .
Baudrillard 's pioneering analysis is now common - so thoroughly domesticated as to figure in such books as Michael Ignatieff 's recent Virtual War .
A few years ago , Baudrillard also claimed that the year 2000 would not happen .
So ?
Did it ? ""
No , "" Baudrillard insists gleefully . ""
Because we were already in the 21st century long before we came to this dead point .
We abused the scenario of the millennium long before it happened .
Now , we stay in the 20th century .
We have not really passed over .
We do n't live in a rational time ... ""
But what , pray , is a "" rational time "" ?
The most high - profile charge levelled against Baudrillard 's game of thinking came a few years ago from Alan Sokal 's and Jean Bricmont 's book , Intellectual Impostures , which named Baudrillard among a phalanx of French "" postmodernist "" thinkers who regularly abuse scientific concepts .
It caused a huge storm in France , and an ejaculation of happy sneering over here , fortifying the complacent impression of those who had never bothered to read any French philosophy that it was all a load of rubbish .
Up until now , Baudrillard has not dignified the attack with a public reply .
I ask him about it , and he sighs simply : "" It 's a misunderstanding of metaphor .
"" It is further , in his view , based on an outmoded idea of the scientific process .
Nowadays , Baudrillard argues , we know that hypotheses are never verified - "" they give way to other hypotheses .
And thought has always been like that ...
I was surprised that no scientist ever answered to Sokal himself as a scientist . ""
And then he adds , with a devious grin : "" In a way it was a compliment . ""
To be accused of imposture , after all , is not necessarily a bad thing .
"" There is a good use of imposture , "" he points out slyly .
"" It is the art never to take a definite posture .
The ability to metamorphose posture . ""
Indeed , Baudrillard 's own career has been an exercise in balletic shifts of pose .
In 1991 he summed up his intellectual journey : he had been a pataphysician at 20 ( the term is Dadaist : a scientist of imaginary solutions ) , then "" situationist at 30 , utopian at 40 , transversal at 50 , viral and metaleptic [ having seizures about seizures ] at 60 .
That 's my history . ""
Now Baudrillard is 70 :
so what is it this time , monsieur ?
He laughs : "" I ought never to have said that .
Well , let 's see , at 70 , I would say that I am ... beyond the end .
It was my fateful strategy to go beyond the concept , so as to see what happens beyond . ""
So where next for the perpetually self - reinventing man , the David Bowie of philosophy ?
Becoming digital ?
Well , Baudrillard rather likes the idea of the internet voraciously sucking up the world , because that would "" leave thought alone in its radicality "" , although he does n't use the net himself .
"" I can not see a text , a modulation of thinking , on a screen - on a screen I can only see an image ... ""
Yet nor does he prophesy cyber - doom .
"" I did this critique of technology , but I would not do that any more .
I am not nostalgic .
I would not oppose liberty and human rights to this technical world . ""
For now , Baudrillard has another book due out in France - the final volume of his delightful journals , Cool Memories .
And then ? "" After that , maybe I become an artist . ""
I wish him luck . ""
Ouf , on verra !
"" he chuckles , and with that , Jean Baud - rillard puffs on his cigarette and wanders back upstairs , leaving only the traces in my notebook behind ."
2000-05-04,"Plain John Smith is not as plain a name as most people thought .

At the top of the top 100 most common male names in England and Wales sits David Jones , a moniker shared by 14,341 other David Joneses , including the former Monkee and David Bowie , who changed his name from Jones .
Robbie Williams 's music and stage persona may be unique but his name certainly is not .
Robert Williams is the 50th most common name and 4,628 men are so called .
Other famous singing names which make an appearance are James Brown , James Taylor , Thomas ( Tom ) Jones , and Paul Jones .
Top of the list of women 's names is Margaret Smith , a name shared by the actor Dame Maggie Smith and 7,639 others .
Margaret Jones is second most common followed by Susan Smith , Susan Jones and Mary Smith .
The survey shows that women tend to have a wider range of names than men : the most popular boys ' forenames are used more often than the most popular girls ' names .
David appears 22 times whereas Margaret gets 11 mentions .
The ONS compiled the list from the national health service central register , which comprises everyone who is registered with a GP .
Mohammed Khan is the only Asian origin full name to make it into the top 100 male names , while none make it into the women 's list .
Khan , Ali , Singh , Begum and Hussain all make it in to the list of top 100 surnames .
In this list , Smith is the most popular , followed by Jones , Williams , Taylor and Brown .

Although Amsterdam is not so big , it is a very cosmopolitan city .
Any unusual requests ?
I have been a concierge here for 11 years and of course there have been strange requests during that time .
But we are always very private .
Our work is to make our guests feel happy , so I have to care about everything .
What about a night out ?
There is a very good restaurant at the American Hotel , and our sister hotel , the Amstel , has a Michelin starred restaurant , La Rive , which is one of the best in Holland .
It is in a nice location , overlooking a canal , and the menu is French cuisine .
However , the American Hotel is probably the best place for breakfast .
It really depends what guests want , because there is food from all over the world here : Indonesian , African , Italian , Japanese .
The Nightwatch bar is very famous , and there are lots of cafes and bars around Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein .
What about sightseeing ?
I recommend visiting some of the bigger museums , such as the Van Gogh , Rembrandt and Anne Frank museums .
The markets are also interesting : there is a good antiques market in Waterlooplein .
We have four main canals in Amsterdam , with many boats , which are always popular with tourists , but if you want a little more privacy we can make a reservation for a water taxi , which seats up to eight people , so you can explore the canals with your own guide .
The most beautiful canal is Prisengracht , which is named after William of Orange .
It is not too far from the hotel , and the best residential areas are around this canal .
Also , if Leidseplein is too busy , try the area around Concertgebouw , which is much quieter and is the place to go for classical music concerts .
Holland is famous for flowers and this is the best time of year to see them .
There are more than 500 types of tulip at the Keukenhof flower park .
The gardens are about one hour from Amsterdam and are open for the next two months .
All along the way there are spectacular fields of tulips .

But rarely have the worlds of traditional and modern collided so spectacularly as the day Luke Vibert met BJ Cole .
Vibert is a man of many guises .
From the drum'n'bass twiddlings of Plug to the electronica of Wagon Christ , his has been a career in cool .
Cole , on the other hand , has added the sound of his pedal steel guitar to the songs of everyone from the Verve to Kiri Te Kanawa .
The pair 's album , Stop the Panic , is less a set of songs than a collage of musical postcards , taking in countless influences from all around the world .
As Vibert and Cole amble onto the stage , it 's difficult to decide who looks the most uncomfortable .
Without a word , it 's straight into the music .
Bongo beats slap against a heavy bassline while Cole slides away , his face scrunched up in concentration .
Vibert and Cole barely look at each other throughout the gig , each lost in different musical landscapes .
Drum'n'bass , jazz , hip hop and big band sounds all make an appearance here , with Vibert 's humorous but dark undertones resonating throughout .
For Cole it 's a case of keep up while you can ; his delicate pluckings are often lost in the swampy epics .
The guitar god comes into his own during the cheesier songs : Cheng Pooey is a vision of Oriental loveliness , while Dischordzilla is a screwed - up horror film theme with scary twangings .
But it 's in the Hawaiian - influenced tunes , notably Fly Hawaiian , that this collaboration works best .
The slippery steel guitar adds character in the absence of vocals and gives some cohesion to what can be fun , but just as often becomes a mess of sounds , squeaks and cleverness .

Before the model marriage , the internet albums and , indeed , Tin Machine , David Bowie had iconic status .
Twenty - odd years on , this film of the last Ziggy Stardust gig reminds us why he inspired such devotion .
Almost skeletally beautiful , clothed in , well , not very much , and made up like a geisha , he is a prodigious talent , moving between rock , cabaret and psychedelia with ease , aided by guitarist Mick Ronson , in split - to - the - navel jacket and masses of eyeshadow .

The first part of fresh indie director Linklater 's ramshackle trilogy , followed by Dazed And Confused and Suburbia .
Slacker looks like a lot more than its $ 23,000-worth of alternative Austin , Texas life , wending its way round the city from one oddball scene to the next , crafting a patchwork of 100 or so strange - to - deranged characters : the result is sometimes puzzling , often riveting .

A spectacular mega - budget adventure adapted from Philip K Dick 's mind - bending tale .
Arnold Schwarzenegger plays an ostensibly ordinary ( though unfeasibly large ) labourer who slowly recalls he was once a secret agent : powerful corporate forces have been messing with his mind .
Cue dizzying reality uncertainties and state - of - the - art violence , all effortlessly handled by Verhoeven .

2000-06-01,"Following the ancient saw that the old ones are the best ones , this year 's Glastonbury festival may well be dominated by artists who could have headlined the first mudlark back in 1970 .
David Bowie , US country star Willie Nelson and lounge legend Burt Bacharach were among the acts announced yesterday for the 22nd festival , to be staged next month at its traditional home , Worthy Farm in Pilton , Somerset .
The three artists , who have a combined age of 191 , will all appear on the main stage on the final day , bringing the curtain down on three days of music , dance and performing arts that organisers are promising will be the biggest yet .
The best selling pop act of last year , Travis , will headline on Saturday evening , a slot that traditionally brings out the extremes in the band of the moment .
Oasis played a famously lacklustre set in 1996 , while Pulp and Radiohead were generally thought to have triumphed in succeeding years .
Travis had a hit last year with Why Does It Always Rain on Me ?
, so the band at least has the material to cope with adverse weather of the sort that has blighted two of the last three festivals .
Among other highlights on the main stages are the Chemical Brothers , making their third appearance at the festival in as many years , best - selling dance act Basement Jaxx , and Moby , who will get the chance to prove his ambient sound works as well in a field as on the car adverts that feature his work .
Elsewhere on the seven stages around the 800 acre site , the mix is more ecclectic .
The jazz stage will feature reggae great Horace Andy , Gil Scott Heron , and Roni Size 's Reprazent .
Kate Rusby , Hank Williams III , and jazz guitarist Ronnie Jordan will play on the accoustic stage .
The Avalon field will feature veteran psychedelicists
Gong , as well as Rolf Harris .
New this year is the Glade , an area reserved for mellower dance music than that found elsewhere on the site .
"" It 's going to be magical , "" said a spokesman .
As well as music the festival features a full programme of cabaret , comedy and circus acts , and a giant screen .
Since the festival coincides with the Euro 2000 quarter - finals , the screen will show all the matches .
Some 100,000 people are expected to attend , paying Â£ 89 each ( including camping ) .
Festival organisers say : "" The long - term weather forecast is good and there are more toilets than ever . ""
The Guardian is sponsoring this year 's event , and free mini - guides , the official , hang - round - your - neck guide containing listings , essential information and a map , will be available on site .

2000-06-26,"With the country 's biggest live draws , Oasis and Radiohead , booked elsewhere , it was left to the less sexy Chemical Brothers , Travis , and David Bowie to headline Glastonbury 's 30th anniversary .
Less sexy , that is , in terms of whipping up excitement , for however festival friendly Chemicals and company may be , they lack what Travis 's Fran Healy called "" that ' wooargh ' thing "" .
In headlining the main stage the Chemicals represented dance music 's in creasing importance at Glastonbury .
Moby showed how it should be done , stealing the weekend with a set that combined live and recorded music , and that oft - neglected human element .
The New Yorker charmed Glastofarians by singing and playing congas .
Friday 's surprise special guest , Macy Gray , contributed the night 's other bit of sass .
Her male - baiting songs and blue haired backing singers were uplifting as the sun went down .
Travis made a bit of Glastonbury history last year when they played Why Does It Always Rain On Me ? on a sunny afternoon and the heavens obligingly opened .
The fact that such an unexceptional band were headlining at all could be taken as proof of a deal with a higher power .
Fran Healy was a sweet frontman , but he was right
- they have n't got the "" wooargh "" thing .
Nor did Leftfield , headlining the second stage with arid breakbeats , nor the DJ , Fatboy Slim , who had them crammed into the 12,000 capacity dance tent to listen to him play some records .
The weekend produced some surprising delights however , including festival first - timers the Pet Shop Boys , who came dressed for cocktails but played a greatest - hits set that struck just the right incongruous note .
There were thrills out there if you looked for them :
Ben Christophers ' delicate torch songs , Terry Callier 's wild - hearted soul , Rolf Harris 's wobbleboard .
It may not have been a vintage Glastonbury , but the sight of the crowd singing happy 70th birthday to Rolf will linger for years ."
2000-08-16,"Rock star David Bowie embraced his role as a new father with enthusiasm yesterday providing hands - on assistance at the birth of his daughter Alexandria Zahra Jones .
He cut the umbilical cord minutes after his wife Iman gave birth , publicist Mitch Schneider confirmed .
He said the child had been born in the US but declined to say where .
The couple , both of whom have children from previous relationships , were said to be "" overjoyed "" at the arrival of Alexandria .
The child , who weighed 7 lb 5 oz , is the first that Bowie and Iman have had together .
Bowie , 53 , famed for constantly reinventing his image as much as his music , said last year that he and his wife wanted a child "" more than anything else in the world "" .
The pair , who met in 1990 and married eight years ago , had been trying for a baby and were delighted when Iman fell pregnant .
Bowie said then : "" It 's been a long and patient wait for our baby , but both Iman and I wanted the circumstances to be absolutely right , and did n't want to find ourselves working flat out during the first couple of years of the baby 's life .
This is a wonderful time in both our lives . ""
Iman , 45 , gave birth less than a week after Madonna , who is also in her forties , celebrated the arrival of her second child , Rocco Ritchie .
The Somalian - born model has a daughter , Zulekah , 22 , from her marriage to basketball star Spencer Haywood .
Bowie 's other child , originally called Zowie but who has since changed his name to Duncan , was born to his first wife , Angie , in 1971 ."
2000-11-14,"Capital Gold , the favourite radio station of London 's baby - boomer generation , is to undergo a major image revamp .
Owner Capital Radio has unveiled a new logo for its Gold brand and has recruited a raft of older rock acts to star in a marketing campaign for the new - look radio station .
From the end of this week , the faces of David Bowie , Mick Jagger , Debbie Harry and Sting will appear on 850 London buses beside the new logo to promote Capital Gold and remind consumers of the quality of its playlist .
But die - hard Capital Gold fans worried about their station becoming too modern have little to fear .
The station 's new autumn schedule shows that Capital Gold will remain true to its sixties and seventies roots with a new Saturday show called Cream of the 60s and forthcoming specials including a Tom Jones night on November 20 and a Queen chart on November 24 .
Glam rock legend Noddy Holder will also host two new shows , Noddy 's Saturday Night Fever and Noddy 's Seventies Sunday Show .
Capital Gold programme controller Andy Turner said : "" The music from these artists is as timeless and relevant today as ever .
It 's simply great music , whether you are hearing the songs for the first time or celebrating a great song from your past .
"" You only need to look at the massive anticipation for the new Beatles album "" 1 "" or the recent press interest in the sale of John Lennon 's piano to bear this out . ""
Capital Gold marketing manager Paula Gunn added : "" The new logo design and marketing campaign will challenge long - outdated perceptions of Capital Gold and encourage new trial . ""
Capital Gold is all about great music and the images reflect the passion of the station . """
2000-11-22,"Fortune hunters and art enthusiasts will descend on the Royal College of Art today for an exhibition combining the suspense of a masked ball with the thrill of a lottery .
The exhibition , Secret , features hundreds of postcard - sized works by students and recent graduates of the RCA , established artists and celebrities including David Bowie , Nick Park and Terry Gilliam .
Each postcard is on sale for Â£ 35 , the catch being that the buyer does not find out which , say , is the Hirst , and which the unknown , until after purchase ; the back of the card reveals the artist 's signature .
It is usually impossible to discern the famous creators from the obscure , but this year - the seventh in the series - some of the celebrities appear to have chosen to "" celebrate "" themselves .
A watercolour of a penguin with a rubber - glove quiff looks suspiciously like the villain from Park 's The Wrong Trousers , while the subject of another watercolour bears a striking resemblance to Shaun the Sheep .
Bowie , whose website Bowieart.com sponsors the show , appears to have submitted a self - portrait .
There could be a few spoofs in the mix .
Another of the postcards features a line drawing of a youthful Bowie with the ( self mocking ? )
tag "" Biggest Fan "" .
Visitors will search in vain for a giant cartoon foot crushing King Arthur 's knights , but some postcards have a Pythonesque humour that suggests the hand of Gilliam , who has submitted four works .
Other contributors this year include Terry Frost , Peter Doig , Damien Hirst ( the dot painting near the entrance ? )
Christo , Manolo Blahnik , and Brian Eno .
Some of those taking part this year might well join the throng of buyers , but everyone will be dealt with on a strict first come first served basis .
Both Hirst and Bowie have expressed interest in some of the art .
The exhibition 's sales raise money for RCA students ; all who submit a card get Â£ 200 towards the cost of their degree show .
One of the featured artists , Billy Childish , said , however , he feared it was all a marketing gimmick .
"" It 's good but it 's a stopgap towards getting students proper grants .
Creativity is not about making money .
We should have confidence in creativity and allow it to develop without putting pressure on students . ""
Art students need time to develop .
I want money to go towards people who could n't go to art college . ""
In past years , Eduardo Paolozzi , David Hockney , Chris Ofili and Tracey Emin have been among those submitting work .
The show itself , said the curator , Emily Sargent , "" liberates buyers "" , allowing them to buy purely for aesthetic pleasure without the pressure of conforming to established opinion .
RCA Secret 2000 opens from 10 am to 6 pm from today to Wednesday , at the RCA , Kensington , Gore , London SW7 .

2000-11-28,"He became one of the most subversive icons of his generation and now the senior statesman of rock , David Bowie , has been named as the artist who has most influenced today 's music stars .
Born David Jones in a south London suburb , the 53-year - old star , who recorded his first solo album 37 years ago , was voted as the most influential artist by more than 100 pop stars interviewed in the latest edition of New Musical Express magazine .
With his androgynous appearance , south London accent and fluid sexuality , Bowie was at the forefront of 1970s youth culture .
Credited with having influenced several pop genres , including punk and glam - rock , his 1972 album and tour about an androgynous space - rock messiah , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , sparked a huge following that he continues to enjoy .
NME interviewers asked today 's generation of stars which band or artist made them pick up a guitar or write their first lyrics .
Stars who voted for Bowie included Brett Anderson from Suede , Brian Molko from Placebo , Ed O'Brien from Radiohead , and Marilyn Manson .
Radiohead was second in the NME list with the Beatles taking third position .
Bono , lead singer of U2 whose chart career spans two decades , nominated Radiohead because of their new live show and the lead singer 's voice .
The grandfathers of hip - hop , Public Enemy , took fourth place in the survey .
Miles Davis , Kraftwerk and the Sex Pistols took fifth , sixth and seventh place respectively .
American rapper Eminem , famed as much for his violent , homophobic and sexist persona as his music , took eighth position .
His nominators included Shaun Ryder of Black Grape and formerly the hit 1980s band , Happy Mondays .
Stars such as Stevie Wonder , Bob Dylan and The Velvet Underground made the top 20 .
Spice girl Victoria Beckham said that she nominated Wonder , who took 11th place , because she had grown up listening to his music .

2001-01-15,"The Rainbow Theatre in north London can hold several thousand people , but only about 100 are gathered on this chilly Friday morning .
Once it was one of Britain 's top rock venues , resounding to the screams of teenage fans of the Beatles , David Bowie and the Osmonds .
Now it belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God , a global evangelical church which originated in Brazil in the 1970s ; and assistant bishop Wellington Marcelo is pacing the stage bellowing gospel tunes , leading a "" deliverance service "" which offers protection from "" voodoo , black magic and witchcraft "" .
Marcelo 's pastors , cleancut young Brazilian men in neatly ironed shirts , march up and down the aisles like cheerleaders , singing along loudly .
The congregation is ordered to form a circle before the stage , and we all hold hands .
The preacher is in the middle . ""
Are there any evil spirits tormenting you ?
Stopping you sleeping ? "" he cries .
A young woman who is making the loudest noise is brought to the middle of the circle .
The preacher is shouting now , asking Jesus to "" send his fire - burn the evil spirits ! ""
"" Burn !
Burn !
Burn ! ""
the worshippers shout in response , stamping their feet .
Marcelo takes hold of the young woman , clasping her neck in what looks like a wrestling grip , and tells everyone a devil is inside her .
Marcelo shouts at the devil to leave her and she gets more hysterical , hitting him with her fists and making a growling sound .
He calms her down and gives her a cup of water that he has blessed in the names of the Holy Trinity .
She says that she is from the Congo , a mother of three and a care worker .
In front of the now hushed congregation , she reveals that she attempted suicide that morning .
Marcelo asks her what her problem is . ""
Marriage problems , "" she says .
"" No , "" he says , "" spiritual problems . ""
The care worker again says that she is going through problems with her husband .
He disagrees .
Like an impatient teacher with a slow child , he gets her to repeat that she has "" spiritual problems "" , before letting her go back to her place in the circle .
The Universal Church has already got into trouble over its claim that evil spirits are the cause of people 's woes .
In 1997 , the Advertising Standards Authority banned a church poster that said : "" Constant headaches , depression , insomnia , fears , bad luck , strange diseases . . .
These are just a few symptoms caused by demons . ""
But now the deliverance service has dragged the church into its darkest controversy yet .
It was to one of these services that eight - year - old Anna Climbie , the little girl who died of hypothermia after being tied up in a bathtub in one of Britain 's worst ever cases of child abuse , was to have been taken by her adoptive mother , Marie Kouao .
Kouao , who - along with her boyfriend , Carl Manning - was last Friday convicted of Anna 's murder , had taken her to various churches , believing that the girl was possessed by demons .
Throughout her trial at the Old Bailey , Kouao held on to a Bible .
Giving evidence , Alvero Lima , a 21-year - old assistant pastor of the Universal Church at Finsbury Park , told the jury about a conversation he had had with the girl in the week before her death . ""
[ Anna ] said she had a vision at night when the devil , in the form of a snake , told her to do these things [ injure herself ] and she was unable to stop .
She said Satan made her do it .
She said she hated me because I prayed for people .
I told the mother I thought it was a spiritual problem .
The Bible says there are evil spirits that leave people 's bodies through fasting .
I told her I and others would pray and fast all week . ""
Lima told Kouao that the congregation 's efforts would culminate in exorcism of the devil from Anna at a deliverance service .
The day before the scheduled service , Kouao brought Anna , who was then very cold and barely conscious , in for exorcism .
A shocked Lima , to his credit , urged Kouao to take the child to hospital immediately .
She died two days later , on February 25 .
Kouao 's barrister Michael Gledhill asked Lima : "" What you were doing was playing with fire , was n't it ? ""
"" No , "" he replied .
Asked if he felt "" at all responsible for this child 's death , "" Lima again answered : "" No . ""
The court case has turned the spotlight on the church 's beliefs , and on the swath of society towards which its ministry is directed .
At the deliverance service I attend , almost everyone is from an African or Afro - Caribbean background .
Judging by their dress , the people do not seem wealthy .
Another clue to the economic realities of these people 's lives appears in the church 's free newspaper , City News , where an advert declares : "" If money is your problem , come to the richest person in the world - God . ""
The church seems to be a one - stop shop for every social ill : on Monday there is a service for financial and immigration problems ( "" bring your CV , passport etc "" ) ; Tuesday 's speciality is health and Thursday 's is family problems .
On Saturday there is a prayer for prosperity - "" bring your Bible and learn how to be prosperous "" .
All this is brought into sharp focus at the end of the service when the preacher turns to the subject of fundraising .
Drug dealers have plenty of money , Marcelo says .
New nightclubs are built every day .
But there is never enough money for God 's work .
"" We need offerings to build more churches , "" he says .
"" Is there anyone here who will give Â£ 50 or more ? ""
A woman goes to the front and writes out a cheque .
An extraordinary Dutch auction commences as the assistant bishop asks : "" Is there anyone who will give Â£ 30 or more ?
Â£
20 ?
Anyone who will take an envelope and come back next week ? ""
He gives Bibles in exchange for the big donations .
Then he asks for anything people have - even as little as 50p .
No one seems to find this strange .
This fundraising has proved hugely successful .
The Universal Church , which claims to have 4,500 members regularly attending its services in London and the west midlands , raised Â£ 2 m from donations at services in 1999 , the last year for which figures are available .
On its website , the church discloses that it committed Â£ 569,000 to "" direct charitable expenditure "" in the financial year 1998 - 1999 , and describes some of the work it carried out : an outreach service supplying shoes , blankets and Bibles to prisoners , and a lending library of taped services for the housebound elderly .
Some Â£ 330,000 was spent on "" fundraising and publicity "" , while management and administration costs were Â£ 246,000 .
At the time the records were filed , the church had a bank balance of Â£ 3.3 m , including income saved from previous years .
Church spokeswoman Christoulla Boodram says the main objective of the church , as a charity , is to advance the Christian faith .
"" This is done by means of spreading the gospel through opening churches , literature , evangelism , radio programmes etc .
The donations raised during church services are spent to pursue these objectives . ""
Last August , further evidence of the church 's wealth and ambition emerged when a company part - owned by its Portuguese branch bought Liberty Radio , a London - based speech and music station , from Mohamed Al Fayed , the Harrods owner .
Observers of the church say that it seeks media investments both for commercial reasons and to obtain a platform .
In Brazil , where it was founded by a former lottery shop assistant , Edir Macedo , in 1977 , the Universal Church is far more than a spiritual organisation ; it is a powerful political , financial and media force .
It owns one of the main terrestrial television channels , about 20 other TV stations , 50 radio stations , a football team renamed Universal and a newspaper with a weekly circulation of 1.3 m .
It is estimated to have an annual turnover of Â£ 700 m - which would put it in the top 100 Brazilian companies - and is the country 's fastest - growing religion , with an estimated 8,000 churches and eight million followers .
The church also has 18 elected deputies affiliated to it in the Brazilian congress , giving it a political clout that outweighs its size .
In the early 1990s Brazil 's attorney general ordered an investigation , which is still in progress , into Macedo and the church over allegations of charlatanism .
The vast majority of Macedo 's followers in Brazil are from the poorest communities .
They , like the members of other churches in a country where there is no national health service , are attracted by the promise that true believers will be able to find the cure for any disease .
Followers are expected to donate 10 % of their earnings .
Many priests who have left the fold have accused the church of only being interested in making money .
Boodram says : "" In Brazil , the church is a very large organisation and recognised by its active role in helping the poorest and destitute in society .
It seeks to play the same role in Britain . ""
But the death of Anna Climbie has exposed the church 's practices to unwelcome publicity that could hamper its ambitions in Britain .
"" We were very shocked and saddened by the suffering and subsequent death of little Anna , "" said Boodram .
"" This must be a terrible time for Anna 's family and our thoughts and prayers go out to them , especially her parents in Ivory Coast . ""
She insisted that "" the value of prayer in positively affecting a person 's health has already been acknowledged by several medical studies "" , and added : "" It is the practice in our church to always advise people to keep to their medical treatment and follow doctor 's instructions . ""
She also says that , as well as offering up prayers for prosperity , it refers seriously indebted people to debt advisory services .
But this defence is somewhat undercut by the preacher 's insistence , at the service I attended , that the troubled young woman 's problems were spiritual .
It is also undermined by its free newspaper , the pages of which are filled with stories of prayer curing afflictions deemed incurable by conventional medicine .
For now , the Universal Church and its pastors will have to tread carefully with everyone they advise .
After Anna 's death , the accusation that they are "" playing with fire "" could yet come back to haunt them ."
2001-01-18,"We would like to set the record straight in response to allegations against War Child UK ( January 10 ) .
Firstly , the impression given is that patrons left recently - but Luciano Pavarotti , Brian Eno , Juliet Stevenson , Brent Hansen , David Bowie and Tom Stoppard resigned between February and June 2000 .
Neil Morrissey has been a patron of War Child UK since 1998 and Hugo Speer has been a patron since 1999 .
Bill Leeson left on October 29 1999 and Mike Terry has not been involved since March 1999 .
When the then trustees were made aware of the payment to Bill Leeson , they ordered its immediate return .
The decision to retain Bill Leeson as an employee rests with that board .
War Child UK 's administrative costs are not excessive .
Over the past four years , our average administrative costs have been 5.5 % .
These are shown in our audited accounts .
We disagree with the figure stated by the charity commission and have requested clarification as to how they calculated it .
No money that has already been raised for the Pavarotti Music Centre has gone astray .
Additional funding has recently been received which will be disbursed in full to the project .
The only other element that has not gone to the project is the contractually agreed 8 % administration charge .
War Child Netherlands continues to support the Pavarotti Music Centre .
All money raised by War Child UK for the Liberian Children 's Village was directed to that project .
The initial expenditure , which was paid from London , related to development costs in starting up the project .
These costs included the assessment , looking for suitable land and other legitimate expenses .
In June 1999 , the project was handed over from War Child UK to War Child Italy which has since become Music for Peace .
All remaining monies were transferred to War Child Italy , together with all the relevant paperwork .
Eleven employees did attend the Modena concert in 1998 but at minimum cost .
Six people drove and the rest flew economy .
All of them were engaged throughout the concert on War Child UK work .
It was a prime opportunity to raise the profile of the charity and promote its work .
Lynne Kuschel states that she has never taken a business class flight on War Child UK business .
She did attend the garden party in Sarejevo to celebrate the Queen 's birthday in summer 1998 at the invitation of Charles Crawford , the British ambassador to Bosnia , because she had been awarded the MBE for War Child 's diabetic programme .
All the allegations predate the involvement of the current board of trustees .
War Child "" started as a daring and innovative charity "" and the current board , staff and patrons are determined that the ideals at the heart of the charity will remain .

2001-02-10,"An artist will today begin destroying all his possessions in the name of art .
In a fortnight 's time all that Michael Landy , 37 , will have left will be a cat named Rats and his girlfriend , the Turner Prize - winning artist Gillian Wearing .
Landy has made a computer inventory of everything he owns , 7,006 objects from odd socks and David Bowie singles to his Saab 900 car .
Each item , including his collection of works by artists such as Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst , will be publicly placed on a conveyer belt in C&amp;A 's former store in Oxford Street , central London , and be shredded or granulated so that nothing but particles remain .
Landy said the process would form an exhibition , Break Down , that examined society 's romance with consumerism .
"" It 's about the amount of raw material that goes into making objects , and about the lifespan of things .
But the title also reflects an emotional break down .
"" I see this as the ultimate consumer choice .

2001-04-02,"Of course , when it comes down to it , glam rock was all very amusing .
At the time it was funny , then a few years later it became sort of serious - looking and a bit foreboding .
Lots of postmodernist juxtapositions and â significant â ciphers â that kind of twaddle .
Now ?
Well , now it âs just funny again , albeit with a certain clout .
I still derive immense pleasure from remembering how many hod - carrying brickies were Â­encouraged to put on lurex tights and mince up and down the high street , having been assured by know - it - alls like me that a smidgen of blusher really attracted the birds .
This was true , of course , and has been since woad .
Â­However , for the likes of Roxy Music and me , mascara was merely the conveyance by which great globs of non - rock flotsam and Â­jetsam were to be delivered .
Japanese kabuki , Dada , Dietrich and Riefenstahl , Piaf and futurism , and above all â elegant gloom â , as the author Barney Hoskyns has put it .
Not for us the couple of pints in the backroom bar after the gig .
We were wondering where to lay our hands on absinthe and puzzling through the big question : greasepaint or pancake ?
Climbing the heights of what we felt was much - needed pretension , we were above common - or - garden chat - up lines to dodgy slappers .
We craved the Â­rarefied Â­stratosphere whence we dropped really heavy names : Burroughs , Brecht and Baudelaire tumbled Â­meaninglessly over Warhol and Wittgenstein in a blur of de- and reconstructed pop .
Let me backpedal for a Â­second . Pretension , or the â School of Â­Pretension â as I pretentiously dubbed Eno and myself in 1978 , was a quick - fix category for it all .
By 1970 , the knock - on effect of The Dice Man , Warhol âs culture - flattening and the break dances of Derrida and Foucault had substantially changed the notion of â the absolute â , of reality .
It was no longer possible to take seriously the history of things as stage - managed by the media and the Â­educational system .
Everything we knew was wrong .
Â­Burroughs , being the John the Baptist of postmodernism , had proselytised over this point for years .
Free at last â or , if you like , at sea without a paddle â we were giving ourselves permission to reinvent culture the way we wanted it : with great big shoes .
Well , all right , if you insist : we could nât have pounced without Marc Bolan .
The little imp opened the door .
What was so great , however , was that we knew he had nât got it quite right
â sort of Glam 1.0 .
We were straining in the wings with versions 1.01 and 1.02 , while Marc was still struggling with satin .
But boy , he really rocked .
He did , yâknow .
Annoyingly , Americans often make territorial claims for the US as the spawning ground for this brief movement , as they usually do with punk and television .
Yes , we loved American underground music and John Rechy âs City of Night , but we really did have our own drag queens and drugs in London , thank you very much .
We also had A Clockwork Orange , Lindsay Kemp , Berlin and Fritz Lang , George Orwell and Nietzsche , Kansai Yamamoto
( 100 % responsible for the Ziggy haircut and colour , by the by ) , Mishima âs gay army and Colin Wilson to draw upon .
( I could list ad nauseam , and have been known to do so , as high - glam âs ingredients were dizzyingly disparate . )
And if I read one more self - aggrandising denizen of the Big Apple screaming blue murder over the issue of who established the shaved eyebrow â well , gosh , I âll just hurl .
The truth is , as wonderful as the New York Dolls were , they were just the Stones in lame .
The Americans at heart are a pure and noble people ; things to them are in black and white .
It âs either â rawk
â
or it âs not .
We Brits putter around in the grey area .
In our minds it âs â a little bit rock , a little bit snigger â .
British glam - rock never made much of an impact on middle America .
Before and after , we were bookended by Alice Cooper and Kiss â butch , â manly â glam with lots of guillotines and fireworks , muscle and metal .
No mistaking the sexual bent of those fellers :
â
Nothing ambiguous about our boys .
â
That âs the only way Ohio could accept lipstick on males .
So we limeys all swanned off sniffily to the wings where we did make an impression .
For a brief moment or two , we ruled in New York and Los Angeles .
Have a look at the jolly pictures on these pages .
Does nât it look like I âm having fun ?
Next week , I âll be showing you how to turn all those Â­earrings into a perfectly serviceable chain with which you can anchor yourself for the oncoming tremors of 1975 .
All you âll need will be a snotty nose , an abused Ziggy haircut and an Â­ability to Â­pronounce â anarchy
â .
Me ?
I âll be pissing off to Berlin , thanks .

By 1970 [ ... ] the break dances of Derrida and Foucault had substantially changed the notion of ' the absolute ' , of reality . ""
Well , yes .
But here 's a thing : Derrida 's first three major works were n't translated until 1973 , 1976 , and 1978 respectively ; and the first two major Foucault translations came in 1971 ( The Order of Things ) and 1972 ( The Archaelogy of Knowledge ) .
And then even professional philosophers had a devil of a time assimilating the conjoined epistemological "" break "" of these epochal texts .
It would be at least half a decade or more - post 1970 - before those groovy "" de.con "" FX began to be felt outside the grooves of academe .
Bowie 's pretensiousness is not at question here ; but is he asking us to accept that - in between birthing and binning Ziggy , overhauling every other pop media extant and leading a tres eventful recreational life - he had the available longeurs to parse these fiendishly difficult texts ... in the original French ?

Quite right .
As an academic philosopher , I struggle hard to write clearly .
I have something to say which is I think of importance for our public life .
What I experience is an unrelenting struggle to get anything into print anywhere , but especially in the public arena ( my 1984 book , From Knowledge to Wisdom , is out of print ) .
The media play their part in blocking lucid discussion of what our problems are and what we might do about them .

2001-05-04,"David Byrne Look Into the Eyeball ( Virgin / Luaka Bop )
*
*
* * Â£ 14.99
These days , pop stars are available in only three varieties : Manufactured , Neanderthal and Boring Bloke .
In the early 1980s , however , a different genus existed .
Art school - educated and influenced by glam eggheads David Bowie and Roxy Music , the Brainy pop star made the top 10 shoehorning cleverclogs stuff about art and sociology into quirkily commercial singles .
Britain had David Sylvian and Scritti Politti 's Green Gartside , while America had Talking Heads frontman David Byrne .
Most Brainy pop stars eventually traded hits for highbrow pursuits : Byrne has spent the decade since Talking Heads split scoring ballets and exploring world music .
Stimulating for him , perhaps , but less fun for the listener , a state of affairs highlighted by Look Into the Eyeball 's return to unabashed pop .
The Great Intoxication and the lovely Philly soul pastiche Neighborhood marshal
Byrne 's arch lyrics and scholarly musical enthusiasms - Brazilian rhythms , bursts of atonal jazz and electronica , knowing mimicry - behind careening , carefree melodies that recall the naive romance of 1940s showtunes .
The result is Byrne 's best since 1985 's Little Creatures : sumptuously orchestrated , effortlessly droll and - of course - as brainy as they come .

Michael Franti and Spearhead Stay Human ( Parlophone )
*
* * Â£ 14.99 Rapper and vocalist Michael Franti has always been an anomalous figure in hip - hop .
In the early 1990s , when gangster rap 's funk samples and trigger - happy lyrics ruled supreme , Franti 's Disposable Heroes of HipHoprisy sampled livid industrial noise and wrote Noam Chomsky - influenced raps about mass media 's destructive influence on individual thought .
While Franti 's words remain committed as ever , his current band Spearhead back his sung - spoken musings on government corruption and racism with jazzy funk and , on Thank You , even disco .
Curiously , however , as Franti has moved from rap into Gil Scott - Heron territory , he has fallen prey to one of hip - hop 's most pernicious evils : the "" skit "" .
Stay Human features nine of these irritating spoken - word interludes ; telling an initially provocative tale about death row and starring Woody Harrelson as an unrepentant state governor , they quickly become irksome , interrupting the album 's flow .
Judicious use of the fast - forward button becomes a must if Stay Human is to get the repeated listening it deserves .

Moldy Peaches Moldy Peaches ( Rough Trade )
*
*
* * Â£ 9.99
While the naive wisdom of childhood is eroded in most of us by responsibility and respectability , Adam Green and Kimya Dawson have not only clung to the surreal images and outspoken brashness of youth but distilled it into an artform .
Using Sesame Street singalongs as a template , Moldy Peaches sing about the bare essentials and fleeting emotions of life with New York cool and laughter in their voices .
Nothing Came Out has Dawson trying to tell a boy she likes him in words of heartfelt innocence .
"" You 're probably holding hands with some pretty skinny girl who likes to talk about bands , "" she sings , yearning to watch cartoons with the object of her affection .
All the motifs of childhood are here , from Converse trainers and Duran Duran to MP3s , BMXs and rollerskates .
In many of the songs Green and Dawson handle a line each , punk poets disguised as Nancy Sinatra and Dean Martin against a background of guitars and hiss .
The recording is deliberately crude , the impression one of two cynical , introspective kids with heads full of ideas , let loose with a tape recorder .
While the duo rock out on the fantastic NYC 's Like a Graveyard
and Who 's Got the Crack
, it 's the fragile melodies and honesty that linger .
Anyone Else
But You , which describes the central relationship as "" part - time lover and a full - time friend "" is the highlight of an album that is sweetly crazy and completely memorable .

The Black Crowes Lions ( V2 )
*
* Â£ 13.99
The Black Crowes , stalwarts of good - time rock'n'roll , are cool .
A recent secret show was stuffed to the rafters with the London showbiz elite ; soon they 'll be touring the US , co - headlining with Oasis - it 's the latest thing to be down with their long hair , meandering guitar solos and outbursts of "" Awwhhhhh ! ""
Lions is the band 's sixth album and although the keyboards are a little bit more inventive , it 's still the traditional spit and sawdust , late night Black Crowes sound .
Here women lay their men down .
A lot .
In fact , the Black Crowes may be the least pro - active bunch in rock .
But the lyrics are n't what counts , it 's the laid - back , blues - influenced vibe that 's important .
When it 's there , it 's good .
Lay It All on Me tames Chris Robinson 's shrieky vocals with a melancholy mood of subtle riffs and sleazy piano , and Losin ' My Mind is a ballsy ballad spoilt only by the way each track runs abruptly into the next .
But much of Lions is tiring , the sound of the maudlin rather than the cocksure drunk in the corner .
It 's in stadiums , not bedrooms that the Black Crowes belong .
Come On 's pomp and stomp will please the faithful but , despite what the cool kids say , the Faces did it better .
( BC ) Paul McCartney
Wingspan - Hits and History ( Parlophone , 2 CDs )
*
*
* * Â£ 16.99
Faced with the challenge of developing a post - Beatles career , Paul McCartney devised Wings as a kind of surrogate family , bringing his wife Linda along for moral support .
The group always felt vaguely insubstantial and somehow unserious , but as this double - disc anthology demonstrates , the Wings years ( 1971 - 80 ) produced an impressive streak of hits : Band on the Run , Jet , Live and Let Die , My Love ... and Mull of Kintyre .
It is n't all Wings material here , though , since there are also extracts from Sir Fab 's solo albums , not least Maybe I 'm Amazed and Take It Away .
Meanwhile , the CDs fit into a grand strategic plan that also includes a two - hour TV documentary tracing the inside story of Wings .
Yes , there was life after the Moptops .

*
*
* * Â£ 13.99
It 's hard work digging new life out of the much - shovelled earth of da bloooze , but Eric Bibb does it better than most .
Blessed with a light , flexible voice that can plumb growling depths when required , Bibb interprets his remit as broadly as possible .
Delia 's Gone is a nifty specimen of nimble vocals and sprightly guitar - pickin ' , while both the sound and the sentiment of Hope in a Hopeless World owe more than a passing debt to Marvin Gaye in his "" social justice "" mode .
Among the funkiness and slides guitars , Bibb boldly reworks the Hendrix warhorse Angel , using just voice and piano .
Eminently consumable .
( AS ) Vocal Sampling Cambio de Tiempo ( Decca )
*
* * Â£ 13.99 Vocal Sampling are a novelty band who are too good to be considered a mere novelty - Paul Simon called them "" the best thing I 've heard in 10 years "" .
They are a six - man a cappella group from Cuba who use no backing tracks or instruments , but manage to sound like a full Latin orchestra .
Other singers may mimic the sounds of particular instruments - it 's a gimmick that has been used by anyone from Bobby McFerrin to Jose Alberto - but this group imitate everything from double bass and percussion through to strings , guitar and brass .
They 're so good at it that you almost forget you are listening only to vocalists .
Their sense of rhythm is impeccable , and so are their elaborate arrangements , which switch between salsa , jazz and do - wop , often within the same song .
Their dance pieces actually swing , their revival of that well - worn standard Guantanamera is inspired , thanks to what sounds like a slick , big - band brass arrangement , and they even take a spine - tingling stab at the Richard Strauss epic known in Havana as Asi Hablaba Zarathustra .

Shed Seven Truth
Be Told ( Artful )
*
* * Â£ 14.99 Britpop swaggers afresh in the shape of Shed Seven , who have acquired a new guitarist , keyboardist and label since 1999 's platinum - selling Greatest Hits .
Undaunted by their perennial second - banana status , the York fivesome have a can - do spirit that lifts this album above the everyday .
Even if they are essentially just adding a new coat of paint to the same retro structure , they do it with a certain panache .
If The Music Do n't Move Yer makes up for its yokelish title by deploying the guitar riff from Anarchy in the UK - not the most original move , but it virtually explodes out of the speakers .
The dribbly sentiment of Love Equals may be the inevitable consequence of the Sheds hitting their 30s , but singer Rick Witter invests it with youthful yearning .
To the Wind also passes pleasantly , pairing feathery guitar with Witter 's Paul McCartney impression .

To Rococo Rot and I - Sound Music Is a Hungry Ghost ( City Slang )
*
*
* * Â£ 12.99 Based in Berlin and Dusseldorf , brothers Ronald and Robert Lippok together with Stefan Schneider are very much in the contemporary German electronica mould .
On this , their fourth album ( and first in tandem with New York DJ Craig Willingham , alias I - Sound ) , To Rococo Rot use computers and live instruments to create a series of ambient songs that function either as background sound - decor or , cranked up higher , as concise instrumental pop .
The inner sleeve dedication to Mute Records label boss Daniel Miller points to a fascination with old school experimental electro - pop , echoes of which can be heard on The Trance of Travel and Along the Route .
With its glitch rhythms , Mazda in the Mist betrays TRR 's history on Germany 's avant - garde circuit , while the pretty From Dream to Daylight features the violin playing of Alexander Balanescu of Balanescu Quartet fame .
( PL )"
2001-05-31,"He has been called the world 's greatest living composer and a minimalist , but pinning Philip Glass down is like trying to bottle thoughts .
He has done urgent soundtracks such as Koyaanisqatsi , reinvented opera and even bashed out a symphonic version of David Bowie 's Low .
But this is different again .
In the late 1980s Glass was asked by African kora master Foday Musa Suso to collaborate on music for a new production of Jean Genet 's The Screens .
The results first appeared on album in 1992 , but Suso and Glass are remodelling The Screens as a concert performance and a work in progress with new pieces .
Genet 's play dealt with Algeria 's struggle for independence from France , so we 're treated to a revolutionary collage of music of the world , featuring everything from stark European classical music to French traditional sounds and Afro pop .
The stage line - up , which includes flute and percussion , is probably one of the oddest ever seen at the Bridgewater .
In African robes , Suso sits centre stage , a kora ( a large , guitar - like instrument ) on his lap .
The combination of the waterfalls of beatific Afro notes and Glass 's restrained but haunting playing really is extraordinary .
In fact , the sheer scope , power and many textures of the music make a mockery of Glass 's minimalist tag .
Within a five - piece , Alexander Balanescu ( best - known for his Kraftwerk tribute , Possessed ) forms the third component of a fascinating creative triangle .
His stark violin adds the unmistakable atmosphere of post - war Europe .
However , The Portrait also allows percussionist Yousif Sheronick to unveil his box of tricks , while flautist John Gibson is never far off with contrasting western and Arabic moods .
Unexpectedly , Glass is an amusing compere .
He confesses that he has n't actually seen the play in years and announces a world first - a "" cosmic premiere "" by God - of a performance featuring both European and African violin , which sounds like acid rock .
Suso ends it with a defiant squawk , and everybody laughs .
But , brilliantly , there are no clues as to where this performance will go next .
Spring Waterfall is moving and mesmeric ; and they leave us with a pop song , Cloudwalk , which sounds like the Police .
Just another night , then , in the history of global fusion , Sting - tinged African classical .
At the Royal Festival Hall , London ( 020 - 7960 4242 ) , tonight and the Salisbury Festival ( 01722 320333 ) , tomorrow ."
2001-06-06,"It generally takes a week of alcohol - driven hedonism and round - the - clock Moldovan mime marathons - of which the Edinburgh Festival is justly famous - to induce double vision , but the Fringe is this year seeing double from day one .
A rash of impersonators , tribute bands and various homage artistes , including Suspiciously Elvis , the Japanese Beatles , Elsie Costello and a musical cabaret from the songs of David Bowie , loom large in the programme unveiled yesterday .
The organisers also hired two Ali G impersonators to launch a lottery - backed "" two for one "" scheme to kick - start the event 's traditional slow first week in August , and encourage local people - who tend to flee the country when it 's on - to go to shows .
The real Joan Rivers , or at least a cosmetically enhanced version of the American TV star , is likely to be one of the main draws of the festival alongside Neil Finn , the New Zealand born singer and song writer from the band Crowded House .
The novelist and critic Clive James , who has yet to submit himself to the surgeon 's knife , will also be appearing in one of the 1,462 shows in 175 venues across the Scottish capital .
Theatre , which for years has been slowly edged out of the limelight by hundreds of comedians competing for the Perrier Award , has made something of a comeback , with the number of shows up by a quarter , a sign that the prospect of extra government money has made a difference .
Edinburgh is still the biggest arts festival in the country , but it has had its problems .
One of its mainstays , the Gilded Balloon , got into trouble last year and although the long - running threat hanging over the Assembly Rooms has eased , the economics of the three - week jamboree remain precarious .
But the Fringe 's director Paul Gudgin is still bullish . ""
In the past five years , we 've gone from selling 679,000 tickets to 850,00 tickets , "" he said yesterday .
"" But there are more seats to be filled and we want more bums on them . """
2001-06-23,"For a generation of 80s art lovers , Keith Haring 's work summed up New York cool .
Andy Warhol , Elton John and David Bowie were collectors of his paintings ; Madonna , Grace Jones , Dennis Hopper and William Burroughs were among his many friends .
By the start of the decade , he 'd forged an entirely fresh aesthetic , with roots in punk , hip - hop and the late 70s craze for street graffiti , which thrived in the subways of the Lower East Side , The Bronx and upper Manhattan .
During his short career , his jellybean - like doodles in unapologetically garish colours would become familiar on posters , T - shirts , even mugs and key - rings .
Such apparently throwaway work has sometimes blinded people to its political content .
In 1982 , for example , he painted an anti - nuclear poster , then gave away 20,000 copies that he 'd paid for himself at a demonstration in New York 's Central Park .
Likewise , his Free South Africa posters were distributed at an anti - apartheid demo three years later .
He was fiercely anti - Republican - a portrait of Ronald Reagan had the president holding up a torch marked with the devil 's number , 666 .
And , at the height of his fame in 1989 , Haring attacked the prejudice surrounding the growing Aids crisis with his painting Silence = Death , which features figures covering their eyes and ears and a pink triangle ( the badge gay men were forced to wear in the Nazi death camps , and appropriated in the 70s and 80s as a symbol of gay pride ) .
Another bugbear was organised religion .
Take Haring 's 1985 series of paintings , The Ten Commandments , about to go on show at Wapping Hydraulic Power Station , London .
The giant canvases , commissioned to fit the 10 arches of an entire floor of the Bordeaux Museum of Art , do n't illustrate each commandment , but jumble them up .
Yet there is a logic there , too : oppressors and oppressed are colour - coded , blue figures denoting the exploited , red figures the tyrannical - and probably referring , also , to Hell .
The most sacrilegious image shows a God - like giant with two penises assaulting two of his "" flock "" .
Haring claimed he came up with the idea while he was out clubbing .
"" It 's so obvious , "" he recalled later . ""
Since it 's 10 arches to be painted , why not the Ten Commandments ?
While I 'm dancing , I try to think of as many commandments as I can , but can only think of a few .
So the minute I get to Bordeaux , I ask for the Bible . ""
And , typically , he left the execution to the last moment .
Once he had arrived at the museum , he had three days to complete the 19 ft by 25 ft canvases ; he worked around the clock to meet his deadline - propelled along , in the final hours , by amphetamines .
The show was a hit , the opening party a blast , attended by , among others , Helmut Newton , who photographed Haring in a gold lamÃ© tuxedo for Vanity Fair .
Haring adored being the centre of attention and partied as hard as he painted .
To New York 's groovy underground culture , he was the pip in the Big Apple .
Socially , his biggest asset was Warhol , whom he had met at an exhibition in 1983 .
The two enjoyed a symbiotic relationship , Haring feeding Warhol the latest youth culture , Warhol easing
Haring into star - studded circles .
Haring hobnobbed , too , with the great disco divas and drag queens of the day : Gwen Guthrie , Jocelyn Brown and Lady Bunny .
His spectacularly theatrical parties became legendary .
At one of his birthday bashes , Boy George sang Happy Birthday .
At another , Madonna trilled Like A Virgin on a bed strewn with white roses .
It was far away from Haring 's Middle America roots .
He was born in 1958 , in Reading , Pennsylvania , to strait - laced , Republican parents , and as a child developed a passion for Disney and Dr Seuss , and spent his time drawing cartoons with his father .
In the mid-70s , while reluctantly studying commercial art at Pittsburgh - at the behest of his parents , who considered it a more prudent option than fine art - Haring was a hippy with a long , unbecoming plait , who frittered away his leisure time listening to the Grateful Dead and smoking dope .
Flunking out of college , he took on a series of bum jobs and by the time he reached tolerant , gay - friendly New York in 1979 , he was gagging to make up for lost time . ""
New York was the only place I would find the intensity I needed and wanted for my art and life , "" he said .
"" Haring was a white boy from smalltown America , who responded to and drew energy from the culture and music of New York 's black and Latino population , "" recalls Julia Gruen , Haring 's assistant from 1984 to 1990 .
"" He started out living the cheap , student life in Lower East - room - mates , mundane jobs , intoxicating night life , promiscuity ... ""
He was drawn into the arty punk scene , typified by the club CBGB 's , where Talking Heads , Patti Smith , Blondie and the Ramones played .
By day , he studied at the School of Visual Arts or practised his early street art , slapping collages of New York Post headlines bearing subversive messages such as "" Reagan slain by hero cop "" on to news - stands or lamp - posts .
Like Warhol , Haring was initially cold - shouldered by the American art establishment .
( His work was far more popular in Europe . )
"" Haring disappointed the American art world by sidestepping the common means of entry into that rarefied sector , by bringing art to the people without the guidance of an art world savant , "" explains Gruen .
By night , he visited the gay bathhouses , notorious S&amp;M sex club the Anvil , and East Village dives such as Club 57 , the Mudd Club and Paradise Garage .
His relationships were not as successful as his social life .
"" It 's one of my major faults that I pursue physical love with such obsession , "" Haring said .
"" I always felt intellectual stimulation could be provided by others .
From the beginning , this pattern was a source of trouble and frustration . ""
He worried about his weedy , nerdy , bug - eyed appearance - not helped by his clunky glasses and barely mitigated by his hip - hop - lite attire of high - top Nike trainers and baseball cap worn back to front - and tended to fall for stunningly good - looking Latinos .
The emerging overlap between punk and hip - hop , of which Haring was so much a part , became explicit in 1981 , when The Times Square Show , a mammoth art exhibition organised by avant - garde art collective COLAB , brought writers and post - punk artists together , just as graffiti art began to appear in alternative art spaces .
A good example is the video for Blondie 's 1981 hit Rapture , where Debbie Harry struts around a yard , rapping about New York graffiti artists such as Fab Five Freddie , while others spraypaint the walls .
Haring 's graphics , meanwhile , decorated the cover of Scratchin ' - A Six Track Hiphop Party Mix , the 1984 album by ex - punk Malcolm McLaren and The World 's Famous Supreme Team Show .
By the early 80s , Haring 's drawings and paintings were full of twitching , cartoon figures , dogs and TV sets , whizzing flying saucers and throbbing phalluses in Day - Glo colours - the favoured palette of punk and new - wave graphics .
And , in 1982 , soon after his first encounter with breakdancing , some of his characters started to spin and twist on their heads .
Using a fat , squeaky Magic Marker , Haring also drew his figures on New York 's streets .
A central image in his work is the "" radiant baby "" , recalling his love of comic strips with its cartoony motion marks .
To anyone who spotted him perform his next seditious trick ( tagging - scrawling over - the panels of black paper pasted over out - of - date ads in the subways ) , Haring handed out button badges splashed with his radiant baby - a continuation of that very punk fashion for tiny badges bearing the names of bands .
Haring was always a populist .
This is borne out by his graffiti , accessible pop imagery , his many community projects undertaken for free and his Pop Shop boutique , on New York 's Lafayette Street .
Set up in 1986 , in a democratic bid to bring his art within the reach of "" not only collectors but kids from The Bronx "" , the latter sold - and still does sell - T - shirts , badges and all manner of knick - knacks emblazoned with his unmistakable imagery .
This , together with his gargantuan output - he was working right up to his Aids - related death , aged 31 , in 1990 - led to an overexposure that has caused some to write off his work as at best mere graphics , at worst tacky doodles .
His admirers stayed loyal ; William Burroughs said of a show at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery , "" I was knocked off my feet by the large works on show .
They had tremendous electric vitality .
It was a very powerful experience for me . ""
Judging by the current vogue for early 80s street chic , Keith Haring 's image is ripe for a reappraisal .
Graffitied togs are a hot fashion story this summer .
Musically , the 80s electro sound is back , London 's Scala holds monthly hip - hop nights , and S Club 7 's recent Top Of The Pops appearance featured - albeit lamely - breakdancing . ""
Keith 's death led some to condemn , some to canonise , "" says Gruen . ""
But the work survives - and through it his spirit . ""

*
*
* * Â£ 13.99
No artist has ever cashed in his enigma chips with such career - crucifying alacrity as David Bowie ; now he 's floundering in the internet desert and trend - chasing rather than trend - setting .
And yet he has never stopped being interesting .
These mostly enthralling instrumentals ( although "" instrumentals "" is a moot point given the prominent vocals on V-2 Schneider and Warszawa , in addition to the rather fetching humming on Subterraneans ) are so catholic it 's a wonder he has n't had a tilt at Ave Maria .
Naturally , the Low and Heroes albums figure prominently , and if NeukÃ¶ln is Bowie at his avant - garde silliest , A New Career in Town shows he could do jolly , while nothing else in his canon is quite as unsettling as Sense of Doubt .
Indeed , All Saints is confirmation of the hitherto almost unheralded notion that Bowie did not need vocals to paint his pictures .
Most frustrating is Philip Glass 's sweeping orchestral 1991 reinterpretation of the Low outtake
Some Are : its grandiose sense of importance and brazenly amenable melody are exactly the qualities Bowie has struggled to recapture of late .
Two Buddha of Suburbia helpings and Brilliant Adventure from Hours ... do not disgrace themselves , however .
Better yet , there is no Tin Machine .

Down from the Mountain ( Lost Highway )

* Â£ 13.99
First there was the movie , then came the success of the soundtrack album ( well over 1.5 m sold to date ) ; now comes the CD of the live concert by the musicians involved - helped , of course , by a documentary .
The Coen brothers ' film has done wonders for the American heritage / roots music movement , and caused some confusion in country - music circles .
Why should old - style acoustic folk , country , gospel and bluegrass styles suddenly be doing so well ?
The answer , I suspect , is that many Americans are so fed up with bad , bland country - rock that they want to get back to sturdy songs that have survived for decades .
This live set ( bravely recorded in Nashville , the home of country music ) will help edge the music further into the mainstream .
It starts with a rousing work - song from the current line - up of the Fairfield Four ( a gospel outfit that started 70 years ago ) , and continues with a refreshing treatment of the well - worn Big Rock Candy Mountain , sung by the great fiddle player and singer - songwriter John Hartford .
Elsewhere , there are strong performances from Emmylou Harris , the bluegrass star Alison Krauss , and from her guitarist Dan Tyminski , who provided George Clooney 's "" singing voice "" in O Brother , and may become a celebrity of the new US roots boom .

Redman Malpractice ( Def Jam )
* * Â£ 13.99 New Jersey 's Redman is seemingly one of the few rappers who has n't sold a colossal number of records right from the start - his fourth album , Doc 's Da Name 2000 , was the first to hit 1 m .
So he 's had ample time to perfect an uncompromising hardcore style that would set hip - hop alight - if only Missy Elliott had n't corrupted the genre with her fashionable poppy confections .
Well , that 's probably what he tells himself , and at the very least he deserves credit for eschewing the tricksy pop flourishes that even his pals the Wu - Tang Clan employ these days .
Malpractice is a lengthy essay ( 23 tracks , many of which are weed - addled "" skits "" ) on "" what the real is "" , as he puts it .
And "" the real "" , it seems , is the brashest beats , the rumblingest funk basslines and , sadly , the most retro world - view you 'll hear this year .
However entertaining
Let 's Get Dirty , on which he nearly bursts a blood vessel howling like Busta Rhymes , or the infectious rolling keyboard motif of the Missy Elliott duet Dat Bitch , the bottom line is that Malpractice is mindlessly thuggish and sexist .
That 's not clever or "" real "" , just pathetic .
( CS ) Rizwan - Muazzam Qawwali A Better Destiny ( Real World )
*
* * Â£ 13.99
This may be Sufi devotional music , but it is also one of the most exhilarating improvised vocal styles on the planet .
Rizwan and Muazzam are the nephews of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan - the Pakistani singer who proved that spiritual love songs also sounded rather fine when mixed with a western dance beat - and they share many of his vocal skills .
They have continued his fusion experiments in their work with drum'n'bass exponents Temple of Sound ( as featured on their recent collaboration album People 's Colony
No 1 ) , but their improvisational techniques are even better heard here , backed simply by a couple of harmoniums , tablas and hand - claps .
Most of the songs last for 10 minutes or more , and start with passages of repetitive call - and - response chanting before gradually speeding up into to frantic vocal work - outs that are both powerful and mesmeric .
The six tracks here follow much the same format , with Nara Ya Farid showing the brothers at their best .

*
* * Â£ 13.99
The dragon , as Sisqo has subtly christened his favourite part of his body , has been the making of this otherwise unextraordinary R&amp;B princeling .
This follow - up to 2000 's Unleash the Dragon , which produced the ubiquitous Thong Song , charts the dragon 's further adventures via familiar - sounding urban pop .
No doubt the 6 m lady fans who bought the first album will be rapt for the entire 47 minutes ( that 's if they can bring themselves to sit through Dream , an oozily sincere ballad featuring female protÃ©gÃ©e Chinky ) , but the rest of us could have made do with just two songs .
One is the single , Dance for Me , which is packed with both cheery innuendo ( "" Maybe we could do a little ah ah , right before we do the cha cha "" ) and a compelling Latin undertow .
The other , Without You , reunites Sisqo with former group Dru Hill on a big - hearted ballad whose attraction is n't the overworked dragon but the interplay of four lustrous voices .
The rest chugs along competently , all urban - crossover big beats , layered keyboards and - yawn - raging libido .
Please , Sisqo , put it away .
( CS ) Paul Oakenfold Swordfish ( FFRR )
*
* * Â£ 13.99 Without wishing to disparage the noble art of DJing
, it 's indisputable that playing records is easier than making them .
Paul Oakenfold , the Guinness - anointed world 's biggest DJ , is no great fan of knob - tweaking in windowless rooms .
Since a fertile patch in the early 1990s , producing Happy Mondays and remixing the likes of U2 with erstwhile studio partner Steve Osborne , his most notable production has been the Big Brother theme tune .
This soundtrack to a new cyber - thriller is his closest yet to a bona fide artist album ( only three tracks do n't bear his signature ) and it lays bare his limitations in the studio .
Oakenfold 's trademark is sleek , kinetic trance
that evokes images of whizzing down motorways at night , but there 's only so much nocturnal driving you can do before you start to nod off .
Though the rhythms vary , the foreboding tone is relentless .
Thus Muse 's operatically grandiose New Born fares well in remixed form , while Afrika Bambaataa 's cheeky Planet Rock becomes joyless .
Even from the platform of a big - budget Hollywood soundtrack , Oakenfold can only preach to the converted .

When Gerard Starkie sings "" I do n't care what they were doing before "" during the gear - shifting guitar pop of Dividing Line , he could be writing his own review of Under a Sun .
The miserabilism that anchored Witness 's debut , Before the Calm , has vanished to be replaced by boundless energy and optimism ; its quiet moments of dreamy contemplation discarded for a country - flecked , confidence - drenched celebration .
Till the Morning has weary harmonica and tear - stained piano beneath soaring guitar parts that flutter against vocals so uplifting they 're like aural Tunes , helping you to breathe more easily .
The enthusiasm in Starkie 's urgent , plaintive voice silences any misgivings over the lyrical simplicity , and the overlaid harmonies of Closing Up are typical of the love and attention that Witness has paid to this album .
Although it 's the sweet - natured jingle - jangling that propels Witness 's new sound , the big drums , notable on My Time Alone
and You Are All My Own Invention , are responsible for the sense of joy that makes this album a triumph .

But underneath the gaudy make - up is a cast of characters with all the familiar vulnerabilities , coping with all manner of bittersweet experience while unsteadily crafting The Mikado .

For Me ( Clint Eastwood , 1972 ) 10 pm , The Studio Eastwood 's debut as director is a thriller owing much in its leanness and sinewy storytelling to his mentor Don Siegel ( who appears briefly ) .
An early example , too , of Eastwood 's critical examination of his macho image : the assurance of his complacent DJ is whittled away by a hysterical jilted lover with a sharp knife .
There is a nice sense of the storm brewing , and a really menacing finale .

The swashbuckling adventure , directed by LA Confidential screenwriter Brian Helgeland , took a healthy Â£ 1.68 m over its opening weekend .
With a modern soundtrack , featuring music from Queen and David Bowie , it tells the tale of a lowborn youth , played by Australian actor Heath Ledger , who takes on the identity of his master and becomes a prize jouster , falling in love with a beautiful princess along the way .
The historical saga has knocked Tim Burton 's sci - fi spectacular Planet of the Apes off the top spot after three weeks with the animal caper Cats and Dogs falling to number three .

2001-10-21,"It was the night New York City shook off the sombre shackles of 11 September and celebrated their defiance against grief , terrorism and the war with as much noise , glitter and frivolity as possible .
Paul McCartney , Mick Jagger , David Bowie , Eric Clapton , Bono , The Who and Elton John were just some of those who performed on stage at Madison Square Garden last night to give the city 's grieving inhabitants a respite from the litany of memorials and funeral services that have been a daily part of life since the terrorist attacks .
There were so many high - profile names eager to show their support that the concert ran for five hours , making it one of the biggest star - powered charity concerts ever .
As one rock star after another stepped on to the stage , the audience roared support , reserving the biggest cheers , however , for the firefighters seated in uniform at the front of the stadium .
The line - up of singers performing at The Concert for New York was matched by the equally impressive queue of actors flown in from around the world simply to introduce the acts .
Harrison Ford introduced Bowie , who sang ' Heroes ' as a tribute to the rescue workers , while Jim Carrey , Billy Crystal , John Cusack , David Spade , Hilary Swank and Adam Sandler queued to introduce the melange of singers waiting backstage , including Destiny 's Child , Macy Gray , Jay - Z , the Backstreet Boys , Melissa Etheridge , Goo Goo Dolls , James Taylor , John Mellencamp and Bon Jovi .
The concert was the idea of three of New York 's media heavyweights , foremost of whom was Harvey Weinstein , co - president of Miramax , who allegedly buttonholed Sir Paul in the first - class cabin of a plane from New York to London , refusing to let the singer leave the aircraft until he had agreed to take part .
John Sykes , the president of the music cable channel VH1 , which will broadcast all of the concert live and free of advertisements , also supported the project , as did James Dolan , president of Cablevision , which owns the arena .
The hope is that the concert will raise tens of millions of dollars .
Some of the seats are being sold for $ 10,000 each , although 5,000 were given to rescue workers from the World Trade Centre site for free ."
2001-10-22,"Rock music , once the soundtrack for rebellion , rallied to the flag like never before at the weekend with a World Trade Centre benefit concert that was expected to become the most successful charity event ever .
Sales of tickets , which cost $ 250-$1,000 , have raised $ 14 m ( Â£ 10 m ) and donations are likely to take that beyond the $ 125 m raised by last month 's telethon after the US attacks .
The line - up was top heavy with figures from rock 's infancy , including British venerables such as Sir Paul McCartney , David Bowie , the Rolling Stones , the Who and Sir Elton John .
More contemporary favourites , including Macy Gray , Destiny 's Child and Marc Anthony also performed at Madison Square Garden on Saturday .
The rapper Jay - Z , arrested in April for possessing a gun , said : "" I 'm very proud of what the police and firefighters did .
We see it in a different light now .
We have a lot of respect for them and what they did . ""
The biggest welcome was accorded to the 5,000 firefighters , police officers and rescue workers who were there as guests .
Billy Joel , whose New York State of Mind had a special resonance , said : "" You look out from the stage and you see a sea of blue .
You see firemen , you see cops , and these guys risk their lives every day .
To be able to see a smile on some of these people 's faces , they 've gone through so much , they 've lost so many of their friends . ""
Bowie opened the Concert for New York with a version of Paul Simon 's America , followed by Heroes .
Sir Paul , wearing a FDNY ( Fire Department of New York ) T - shirt , closed the show with five songs .

2002-01-20,"He 's morphed himself into more fantastical , androgynous alter - egos than David Bowie and Boy George put together .
Since the 60s , Lindsay Kemp has been trying on personae and putting on shows , from rock concerts ( he orchestrated Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust phase ) to music - hall cabarets and dance - dramas .
He is a travelling player , a licensed jester - like his forebear , William Kemp , Shakespeare 's clown .
Now in his sixties , Kemp is touring a retrospective of his greatest hits .
Dreamdances is a gallery of characters who have fascinated him throughout his theatre life : Salome , Salieri , Nijinsky , Isadora Duncan , La Dame aux Camellias , Federico Garcia Lorca .
Some he has already celebrated ; others are newly reflected in his looking glass , a mirror that can be cruel and enchanting .
Far from being a one - man / woman show , Dreamdances involves many of his long - term collaborators , including Marco Berriel and Nuria Moreno .
Kemp is looking to the future by returning to the simplicity that underlies his most extravagant creations .
Childlike at heart , he longs for truth and beauty , but is disillusioned enough to know how readily dreams can turn into nightmares .
He has convinced himself that Britain did not appreciate his flamboyant sensibilities , and took his troupe off to Italy .
He comes back at intervals - to considerable acclaim - threatening that each re - appearance might be his last .
If you 've missed his shows in the past , Dreamdances is a chance to catch up with the myths and monsters who have stalked his fevered imagination .

2002-01-28,"Companies that have made a fortune selling downloadable ringtones to mobile phone - mad teenagers could collapse if record labels follow EMI 's lead and forbid them from using popular tunes .
EMI , one of the world 's largest record companies with artists including Robbie Williams , Blur , David Bowie and Kylie , has demanded that mobile phone companies stop using some of its biggest stars for ringtones .
The move will worry those companies that have been set up to satiate the seemingly unquenchable thirst for the latest ringtones .
Most of them have business plans that depend on being able to offer the latest chart hits to customers as downloads .
Even larger companies such as iTouch , which recently bought music site Worldpop , rely heavily on ringtone revenues for income .
Sparking speculation that EMI is set to cut out the middlemen by selling its own ringtones directly to the consumer , the label has withdrawn the right to sell popular downloads such as the theme tunes from The Simpsons and Halloween .
When it originally purged a list of artists last December , EMI promised it would not withdraw any more tracks .
By going back on its promise it has enraged companies such as Phat Tonez , which have built successful businesses from the ringtone phenomenon .
"" The first ban came as a shock to us , and certainly dented our profits , "" said James Winsoar , the founder of Phat Tonez .
"" This second ban includes three highly popular tunes that our customers demand and that makes me very angry , because ultimately it is the customer that loses out . ""
Mr Winsoar said the company would now boycott EMI tunes and expected other ringtone providers to follow suit . ""
EMI say that they 're not planning to launch their own service
but I ca n't believe that 's the case .
The tones they 've withdrawn are all the most popular ones , "" he added .
Other record companies are not expected to follow suit just yet , seeing ringtones as a valuable source of royalties and marketing , but if EMI 's move is a financial success they are likely to change their policies ."
2002-01-30,"Lindsay Kemp is not a household name ( except in the most depraved of households ) , but it is the name dropped by any young artiste wishing to invoke a bit of good old - fashioned decadence .
Kemp influenced David Bowie , and thus influenced every pop musician with the possible exception of Paul Weller .
Into the serious world of 1960s and 1970s British theatre , he injected a huge dose of camp , with productions drenched in blood and glitter , full of pansexual orgies and naked young men .
In theatrical circles , respect for this 63-year - old dancer - mime - actor - choreographer - director has reached critical mass .
That said , there are plenty of dance critics who wish that Kemp would simply give up , leaving the stage clear for dancers with perfect technique and no sense of humour .
Sadly for them , Kemp is back in London this week for the first time in six years , presenting Dreamdances , a kind of greatest hits show with extracts from his full - length pieces - Salome , Flowers - "" reinvented "" for a company of three .
"" These are roles I 've been dancing all my life , and they all come from daydreams , "" says Kemp .
"" I first danced Salome in the dormitory of my boarding school , naked except for layers of toilet paper , heavily rouged with the red paint I 'd rubbed off the wall .
The boys in the top bunks played mouth organs , and I danced to entertain them .
I was busted , of course , not for the decadence of my performance but for the wastage of school resources , namely the toilet paper .
"" This is a typical Kemp anecdote , a mixture of hard - knocks realism with erotic flights of fantasy .
In the past , his tendency to elaborate has resulted in a kind of parallel autobiography , a Kemp who was born on a remote Scottish island , expelled from school and thrown to the wolves in London .
The truth is more mundane : Kemp was born in South Shields and went to boarding school in Berkshire .
"" I find myself telling the truth more these days , "" he admits .
"" I hope you 're not disappointed .
One did n't have an exciting history , and so one felt obliged to invent one .
It 's so easy to invent .
Now I tell the truth because , to be honest , I 'm too lazy to exaggerate . ""
Kemp 's mother encouraged her son 's obvious theatrical tendencies : "" We 'd walk down the street looking like a couple of geishas .
During the war you could n't get cosmetics , but you could get stage make - up , so we had dead - white faces with our eyes outlined in burnt cork . ""
He also began attending ballet classes .
"" I 'd dance on the kitchen table to entertain the neighbours .
I mean , it was a novelty in South Shields to see a little boy in full make - up dancing on pointe .
Finally it got a bit too much for my mother , and she decided to send me to boarding school at the age of eight , hoping that it would knock some sense into me . ""
Barewood College , near Wokingham , was a school for the sons of merchant seaman ( Kemp 's father was a sailor ; he was lost at sea in 1940 ) .
Like Scheherazade , Kemp discovered that he must entertain in order to survive .
"" I had a captive audience , and 1001 incredible stories to tell them , and that 's how I got through a very tough school .
And even then , I was recruiting .
My affezionati , I 'd teach them how to do the moves , how to dance .
Well , I had to get my corps de ballet from somewhere . ""
When he left school aged 16 he applied to several stage schools - and was rejected by every one .
"" I got a letter from the Sadler 's Wells Ballet School saying they found me temperamentally and physically unsuited to a career as a dancer .
I suppose that knocked me back for a couple of days , but then I went to see The Red Shoes at the cinema
and I was up on my toes again .
Blame Robert Helpmann .
"" By this time Mrs Kemp had moved to Bradford , where Lindsay befriended David Hockney .
But before long he moved to London and enrolled in classes at the Ballet Rambert .
There was still an obstacle to this budding career : national service .
He managed one year of square - bashing in the Air Force until , on the advice of more seasoned queens at Rambert , he turned up to parade wearing kohl around his eyes and Indian sandals on his feet .
That was enough , in the 1950s , to get a boy invalided out .
With Jack Birkett , the bald , blind , statuesque Rambert dancer who became a primary collaborator as The Incredible Orlando , Kemp pursued work in the theatres and dance groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s .
He presented cabaret in working men 's clubs ( "" I adored those audiences , they 'd always want to dance with me afterwards "" ) and toured Europe , developing a strange hybrid of drag , mime and conventional song - and - dance .
By the time he returned to London , the arts lab movement was in full swing , and Kemp 's time had come .
Work poured in , particularly support slots to left - field pop acts ( the Scaffold , Vivian Stanshall ) on the university circuit .
In 1967 Kemp met and recruited a young singer called David Bowie , who became his lover and collaborator in touring shows such as Pierrot in Turquoise .
After a year or so , Kemp and Bowie fell out ( "" For sentimental reasons , "" says Kemp ; Bowie was simultaneously sleeping with one of the female dancers ) and pursued separate careers .
They worked together again in 1972 , when Kemp provided exotic back - up for the Ziggy Stardust shows .
Fate really came calling on a Sunday morning in 1968 .
"" We had been sitting around listening to Round the Horne on the radio , as everyone did , when my neighbour stuck his head round the door and said , ' Ooh , I think you might be interested in this ! '
"" This was a copy of Our Lady of the Flowers , Jean Genet 's hallucinatory tale of drag queens , pimps , murderers and sailors .
Kemp devoured it in one sitting and immediately planned a show .
Flowers debuted in Edinburgh later that year after Kemp had done some energetic recruiting in the Princes Street Gardens .
"" They were the real flowers in the show - boys who I picked up in the park because they looked right . ""
Flowers is the definitive Kemp work : orgiastic , violent , teetering constantly on the verge of bathos , and thoroughly homosexual .
"" Of course , we were raided time and again .
We had one wonderful scene with a stroboscope , and right in the middle of it the doors at the back of the theatre burst open and in poured four policemen with their dogs .
I think audiences the next night were a bit disappointed . ""
Flowers transferred to London , then New York , Australia , and back to London for a six - month run at the Roundhouse in repertory with Kemp 's new work , a full - scale Salome .
Since then , he has been touring non - stop , sometimes with a company of up to 30 wayward performers , and almost always without grant or subsidy : "" The Arts Council would n't touch us after Flowers . ""
He left England for Barcelona in 1979 ; when the bars and boys became too much for him , he moved to Italy , where he now maintains homes in Rome and in the Umbrian hill town of Todi .
He continued to create full - scale works - A Midsummer Night 's Dream , Alice in Wonderland , Nijinski , Onnagata - well into the 1990s , while developing a parallel career as a teacher and a director of opera .
After Dreamdances , Kemp is returning to Italy to direct Purcell 's The Faerie Queen and Puccini 's Madame Butterfly .
"" I still dance every day , and I teach a great deal , which keeps me in shape .
I do n't have the strength and stamina I used to , but with me it was always more about attitude than technique .
Thank God
I 'm not like poor Nureyev - they 're not checking to see if I can still jump high enough to get out of the window .
My technique , such as it is , is mainly a question of balance .
I try not to wobble too much , and I twirl a lot . ""
Kemp 's greatest technique is in fact a sort of hypnotism - perhaps that 's why dance critics tend to dislike him .
He can win a crowd over with seemingly crass effects .
"" I learned the art of mesmerism very early .
How else do you think I survived the dormitory at boarding school , or those working men 's clubs ?
It was never enough to entertain them .
I had to enchant them . ""

2002-02-10,"David Bowie has been a rock star , actor and internet entrepreneur .
Now the 55-year - old master of reinvention is embarking on a new career : curator of Meltdown , a major arts festival .
The annual event at London 's Festival Hall has established a reputation for staging some of the most eclectic artists of the day .
Each year the programming is handed over to one curator , and Bowie is the highest profile figure yet to take up the baton .
A source close to the singer said : ' He will have a hands - on role and is taking his responsibilities very seriously .
He 'll be personally choosing all the acts and will be putting his stamp on the event .
David plans to use the opportunity to showcase some of the most cutting - edge acts around today . '
Last night Bowie said : ' I 'm very excited about curating this year 's Meltdown .
Fans of the event are in for a few surprises . '
Details of who will appear are yet to be confirmed but Bowie ' hopes to use his contacts to attract some really big names ' , according to the source .
The singer is close to many musicians such as Iggy Pop and Lou Reed , both of whom are being tipped for Meltdown this summer .
Bowie , currently recovering from a severe bout of flu , is also expected to perform .
Meltdown was the brainchild of the contemporary composer George Benjamin , who was fascinated by the connections between different musical forms .
Started nine years ago , previous curators have included Elvis Costello , Scott Walker , Nick Cave , Laurie Anderson and John Peel .
One of the most memorable Meltdown line - ups was Anderson 's War Child Gala in 1997 , featuring Philip Glass , Bill T. Jones , Robert Wilson , Lou Reed and Michael Nyman .
Other artists to have appeared at Meltdown festivals include Damon Albarn , Tricky , Nina Simone and The Leningrad Cowboys .
Brixton - born Bowie , who now lives in New York with his ex - model wife Iman and their 18-month - old daughter Alexandria Zahra , is putting the finishing touches to a new album .
It will be released on his own label later this year following his recent decision to part company with EMI .
Over the past 30 years the singer has been through an array of images , from Ziggy Stardust to the Thin White Duke , before becoming a mainstream superstar in the early Eighties with the success of the album Let 's Dance .
More recently Bowie , who is worth Â£ 100 million , has turned his hand to cyberspace , setting up an internet service provider , BowieNet , and BowieBanc , which issues its own credit cards ."
2002-03-10,"Outer space has inspired hundreds of singers and bands , from David Bowie to the Beastie Boys .
But now a pop star is set to take the ultimate trip - Lance Bass , of the boy band NSync , has been chosen as a candidate to fly on a Russian space capsule this year .
Bass - whose fellow band member , Justin Timberlake , is dating Britney Spears - has been selected to become only the third space tourist in history , following US millionaire Dennis Tito , who flew to the International Space Station last year , and South African Mark Shuttleworth , who is scheduled to make a similar journey next month .
Bass , 23 , who will be the youngest man to fly in space , says he is ' completely overwhelmed ' at the invitation .
His selection has also provoked considerable criticism , however , for NSync have a cloying , clean - cut image that offends rock purists . '
Could n't they come up with someone more interesting ? ' asked David Fricke , of Rolling Stone magazine . '
Why choose to inflict on aliens all the rubbish we have to put up with ? '
The quintet have also courted controversy over their other space exploits , for NSync have been picked , instead of regular actors , to play Jedi Knights in the next Star Wars film , Attack of the Clones .
They are only appearing because director George Lucas 's 13-year - old daughter , Kate , persuaded her father to cast her favourite band .
Their roles should comfort their critics , however , for the group will be blown up by droids during the climax of the film , due for release in May.
Otherwise , Bass 's space credentials are meagre .
He had a brief stint at Florida 's US Space Camp when he was 12 - and that 's it .
To qualify for the flight , which will be followed by a week on the International Space Station , he will have six months ' training at Russia 's Star City .
Bass 's training , launch and flight will be filmed for a two - part TV special , Celebrity Mission : Lance Bass , for Destiny Productions who intend to pay for the flight 's $ 20 million ticket . '
We 've got the sponsorship money on a fast track , ' said Destiny president David Krieff . '
The demographic Lance hits is highly sought after , so it 'll be a little easier to round up funds .
A network deal will get the rest . '
However , Bass faces competition for his place from 39-year - old Polish entrepreneur Leszek Czarnecki , who has also announced plans to secure the trip on Soyuz , which is scheduled for blast - off in November .
A fluent Russian speaker and an experienced deep - sea diver , he is backed by the US company Space Adventures , while Bass is a candidate of the Russian Mir Corp.
The two companies originally co - operated on getting Tito 's space tourist ticket on Soyuz last year .
Now they are interplanetary rivals .
A decision on who will fly will have to be made by May - agreements signed by the space station 's partners require participating nations to name their astronauts six months before their flight .
The prospect of a 23-year - old pop star bobbing about their $ 50 billion International Space Station will not please Nasa chiefs , who have only just agreed , reluctantly , to the concept of opening up space to tourism , following pleas by astronauts including Apollo pioneer Buzz Aldrin .
However , their new guidelines for budding space tourists will not pose much of problem to either Bass or Czarnecki .
All future flyers will need is a smattering of English or Russian and a cleanish criminal record ( NSync 's 10-fold platinum CD No Strings Attached is , perhaps , that criminal record ) .
Apart from that , space tourists will only have to be modestly fit , and will certainly not have to live up to the physical standards of working astronauts .
Nasa has also decided paying guests will have to live up to ' demonstrated performance under stress ' , which presumably means keeping calm during take - off .
Whether Bass will be required to sign a ' no singing ' contract remains to be seen ."
2002-04-08,"When big - time film producers wanted to shoot a Caribbean island scene featuring a sunburnt Jack Palance with a parrot on his shoulder and a wooden leg on Treasure Island , they naturally went to the rainy , windswept Isle of Man .
Filmmakers seeking to recreate Boston , Sydney , or even Brighton are increasingly turning left at Sellafield and shooting in Douglas , the capital of the "" rock "" , where it is becoming common to see Helena Bonham Carter , David Bowie or Christina Ricci tucking into a giant plate of sea bass between takes .
The Isle of Man , best known for kipper - smoking and cats without tails , is this year set to become one of the most important players in the British film industry , boosting its tourist trade by millions and transforming the Manx economy .
Traffic wardens have reinvented themselves as location scouts , sailors are becoming production runners , kennel - owners are launching careers as snake handlers .
Pensioners are swapping the gardening for regular work as film extras , playing corpses and clergy , or passengers aboard Thomas the Tank Engine .
The Isle of Man , which has played host to 39 film productions worth around Â£ 220 m since 1995 , has already poached business from Ireland : the Celtic village in the box - office hit Waking Ned was recreated in Cregneash , after its makers said they could not find anywhere sufficiently Irish in the Emerald isle .
But this month , the Isle of Man - with landscapes to match every county of England , Scotland and Wales - could begin to trump mainland Britain in the race to attract big budget productions .
The Isle of Man treasury has just announced a Â£ 25 m development fund for television and film production , on top of the island film commission 's Â£ 15 m investment pot for the next five years .
Not only is the island offering unique tax breaks and a 25 % investment in films shot there , it now plans to invest in script development and distribution rights as well .
The Isle of Man has already attracted US companies such as Warner Brothers and Fox , and extended its television production with interest from the BBC and Channel 4 - an adaptation of DH Lawrence 's Sons and Lovers is currently in production .
But most important is the fact that the island is attracting bigger and bigger budget productions .
Steve Christian , fund manager for the Isle of Man film commission , said : "" In 1997 , we were looking at Â£ 4 m productions .
This year , we have productions of an average Â£ 10 m .
We hope to generate Â£ 500 m worth of film productions in the next 10 years . ""
In two weeks , the Isle of Man 's first fully soundproofed studio will open - Lezayre studios in Ramsey on the north of the island , with 12,000sq foot of stages worth Â£ 1.7 m .
The social mores of the Isle of Man - waving at the fairies under bridges , calling residents of more than 10 years "" stopovers "" and residents of fewer than 10 years "" comeovers "" - may appear somewhat out of sync with the fast - and - loose ways of Hollywood .
But this seems to be the attraction to big producers .
Stories abound of no - nonsense treatment of stars .
Mel Gibson was told he could not book a table at a local restaurant but must turn up and "" chance it "" like everyone else .
One English taxi driver , who does the Isle of Man airport run , said : "" I genuinely do n't think islanders have a clue who these stars are .
The only person who attracts a glance is Norman Wisdom because he lives here .
We 're very like the people on Jersey , totally nonplussed . ""
Nonetheless , producers report a more open welcome from locals in the Isle of Man than those in mainland Britain , praising the infastructure , and the understanding of transport , production and location needs .
The film industry has transformed islanders ' lives , creating bizarre , if sporadic , employment opportunities .
There is now a hardcore of pensioners who get regular "" extras "" work as clergy , Edwardian gentlefolk or Irish villagers , for around Â£ 65 a day plus as much food as they can eat from catering vans .
"" You can tell the hardened pensioners as they bring a pillow and a paperback and prepare for a nice meal , "" said one seasoned member of crowd scenes .
Islanders are also reinventing themselves .
"" The films are my life , they keep me sane , "" said Alan Rogers , a former publican from Gloucestershire , who said he had done "" eight years on the rock "" , recently turning from cabbie to film extra to film chauffeur to a guide for tourist visits to locations .
He is now a partner in a firm that provides everything from location scouting , taxi accounts and mobile phone hire - a cunning initiative , since most filmmakers ' phones have no recep tion on the island .
"" We have a regular influx of Americans from the Midwest , "" he said .
"" We serve them traditional Manx picnics out of film spool tins . ""
From a restaurant - turned - production office on the top of a cliff , Robin Crane , 35 , told how he left his job as a crew manager on oil tankers after 12 years to become a production assistant , following film - extra work as the half - eaten corpse of an astronaut .
"" I 've been to Hollywood to make contacts , I 've worked on Bafta - nominated films here .
For anyone creative on the island , the film industry is a godsend .
Before , we had the choice of shipping or finance , or we had to leave . ""
The film industry has so far provided 100,000 bed nights for the Isle of Man tourist trade .
"" That translates into millions , "" said Geoff Le Page , director of tourism .
It is a welcome boost after the cancellation of the TT races because of foot and mouth last year .
Productions on the Isle of Man often lead to spin - off work in England , such as railway scenes in Sons and Lovers , which will be shot in Yorkshire .
But the local British film commissions will have to work hard to attract US investment in the light of the Isle of Man 's financial incentives .
Marc Samuelson , producer of the forthcoming film The Gathering , starring Christina Ricci , set in rural England but shot in the Manx countryside , said : "" With the fantastic locations , brilliant crews and financial opportunities , producers have to have a very good reason not to shoot in the Isle of Man these days . ""

2002-05-24,"Twenty - three years after he began the one - man musical project that is The The , Matt Johnson has dug out The The 's original tapes to put together a collection of singles called 45rpm .
He is about to tour again , playing David Bowie 's Meltdown festival in June .
He is also thinking of moving his family from Gothenburg in Sweden back to New York , where he spent much of the 1990s . ""
After I moved to New York , London felt very provincial , "" says Johnson , who has kept a flat / studio in Shoreditch .
"" So as you can imagine , Gothenburg feels like a small town .
I think it 's time for us to move on again . ""
Besides , the winters are too dark , and he still has n't learned how to speak Swedish .
Digging out the old singles has meant a return to the times they came from . ""
Music has an evocative power second only to that of smell .
I was taken back to whatever was going on in my life at the time of recording , and it was quite emotional , really .
I ca n't get into the same frame of mind that I was when I wrote , say , Uncertain Smile [ from 1982 ] , when I was more innocent , and idealistic , but since New Labour have turned out to be pretty much the same as the 80s Tories , I think the songs are still relevant . ""
Johnson 's political edge cuts into his quiet time .
A collection of Great Parliamentary Speeches is one of his favourite CDs , mainly for some of Michael Foot 's finest moments - Foot refers to the former leader of the Liberal party Sir David Steel as "" the Boy David "" before going on to say that Steel has "" passed from rising hope to elder statesman without any intervening period whatsoever "" . ""
Michael Foot was one of the great orators , "" says Johnson .
"" It 's a political skill that he mastered entirely . ""
He also likes listening to talking books .
Favourites include Hancock 's Half Hour and Sylvia Plath reading her own work .
"" Her voice is bizarrely tinny and cold , "" he says .
"" Like a robot .
Strangely , most of the writers reading their own work are rather like that .
Hemingway is very stiff , as if he was intimidated by the recording process .
Dylan Thomas reading Adventures in the Skin Trade is the only one who brings his own writing to life . ""
Wire produced Johnson 's first single on 4AD , and they remain one of his favourite bands .
"" They did a song called The Other Window , which was written by Bruce Gilbert .
It 's about a train journey .
I 've paid homage to it in a song I 've written called Diesel Breeze - partly because they were so encouraging and helpful to me , so it 's a way of saying thank you .
Recently you had bands like Elastica covering Wire songs but passing them off as their own - are they stupid ?
Luckily Wire sued them , and won . ""
These days , however , Johnson 's hours are mostly spent listening to more mellow sounds .
"" Music for Zen Meditation has been my favourite album for the last couple of years , "" he says .
"" It was recorded in the early 60s by a man called Tony Scott .
He went around the world making music and picking up influences , and now the album accompanies me on tour .
I 'll put some coloured silks over the hotel room 's lights , burn this really nice Tibetan incense that is rolled on the inner thighs of virgin nuns , and listen to this .
I heard it first in a Korean spa in New York , where you have to sit in ice - cold pools of water before they walk up and down your back . ""
Jim Thirlwell , the man behind Foetus , has made an album called Volvox Turbo under the name Manorexia .
It impressed Johnson by its use of computer - generated sound . ""
Musicians ' imaginations appear to shrink in direct ratio to the number of tools at their disposal , "" he says , "" but Jim has made something I 've never heard before .
There 's a sound on here that makes me think of a naked man in a room with corduroy walls , running around in circles .
It turned out that it was n't that but some obscure aboriginal instrument .
There are only ever a few people like Jim who are genuinely imaginative . ""
Back in Gothenburg , Johnson listens to recordings by the Estonian composer
Arvo Part quite a bit .
"" The music is very melancholic and sad , which must be a product of living where he does .
Having been through a few of those northern Swedish winters , I can understand how he feels .
You wake up and it 's dark , and there 's only a couple of hours of light .
We live on a hill , and cycling down that hill on a winter 's morning to take my boy to school is not fun . ""
Movies , an album by Holger Czukay , the original member of Krautrock legends Can , is another favourite .
"" I 'm a big fan of short wave radio , and so was he .
On this album , he recorded a variety of sounds and voices from short wave , "" says Johnson .
"" I 'm very dismayed because they 've cut off the World Service short wave transmission to the States .
It 's saved them half a million pounds a year - probably the same as the bill for Greg Dyke 's suits .
"" This is one of the first recordings that used short wave - it 's from 1977 .
Now a lot of the stations are cutting the funding and putting it into digital radio .
Who the hell wants to listen to the radio on their computer ? """
2002-05-30,"Ziggy Stardust , one of David Bowie 's guises , had a band called the Spiders from Mars .
Bowie may have had an inkling of the future , since insect occupation looks more likely than human colonisation , despite Nasa 's announcement this week of what could be evidence of a frozen ocean .
Space researchers are now planning to explore Mars using not spiders , but their common prey , flies .
Man - made dragonflies , in fact .
Science and technology often learn things from nature .
Dragonflies flit around with wingspans of up to six or seven inches , but in the Carboniferous era , around 280 m years ago , they had cousins almost five times that size .
One of the largest early dragonfly fossils , 24 in from wingtip to wingtip , was found deep below ground in the north - east Somerset coalfields , a steamy jungle in those days .
Why do n't such behemoths inhabit today 's swamps and village ponds ?
The favoured answer is oxygen .
The oxygen content of the atmosphere a few hun dred million years ago was around 35 % , compared with today 's 21 % .
Larger insects could thrive .
The reason stems from the way in which insects ( and other invertebrates such as arachnids ) breathe .
Vertebrate land animals such as ourselves repeatedly suck large volumes of air into our lungs , whereas insects depend to some extent upon the rate of diffusion of oxygen within the air .
Flies and the like have spiracles , openings on their bodies through which air molecules can enter , but the rate at which they are replenished ( as oxygen is extracted and carbon dioxide expelled ) is limited , resulting in a maximum size to which insects can grow .
This and other mechanical reasons , such as the weight an exoskeleton can bear without having a prohibitively large bulk , imposes a size limit , meaning that sci - fi movies with giant mutated ants and spiders are just that : works of fiction .
Scientists often claimed it was impossible for bumblebees to fly , but five years ago , its flight was at last explained .
A team under Charlie Ellington , professor of animal mechanics at Cambridge University , worked out how these leviathan bees buzz around .
Now they 're looking at applying this understanding in other areas : in improving the performance of helicopter rotors , for example .
But there are applications that are literally off this planet .
Another limitation on aerial insects is imposed by the viscosity of the atmosphere .
To butterflies , the air is like treacle , enabling them to fly but limiting how large they can grow .
At some finite wingspan , the muscle power needed to beat those wings results in too bulky a body , and so gravity wins .
This would not be the case on Mars , though .
First , Martian surface gravity is only 37 % that on Earth , representing an advantage for a flying machine .
Second , and more significant , the atmosphere of Mars is much thinner , making a robotic dragonfly a feasible tool for the near - surface exploration of that planet .
The essential parameter is what is called the Reynolds number .
This dimensionless number indicates the conditions under which there will be a change from laminar ( or streamlined ) to turbulent flow of a fluid around a solid object , with a concomitant change in the drag .
On Mars , the atmosphere is so thin that the Reynolds number is equivalent to that of an altitude of around 30 kilometres on Earth .
This means we should be able to make artificial dragonflies , or their kin , with wings that will beat fast enough to hover just over the Martian surface .
This would be a huge boost for Mars exploration .
Mapping from orbit is wonderful for wide area coverage , but the detail is limited by the distance of the satellite above the ground .
At the other extreme , a surface rover is able to examine the soil and rocks grain by grain , but only a verysmall region is covered .
To date , the two favoured options , suggested for Nasa missions later this decade , are aeroplanes and balloons .
The aircraft idea suffers severe drawbacks : a speed of at least 250 mph is needed to get enough lift , which necessitates a huge wingspan , and there 's nowhere to land : one strike
and you 're out .
The balloon - borne probe would be easier to implement , but it has no navigational capabilities .
The Martian surface relief is also vast , with volcanoes far taller than Everest and a chasm vaster than the Grand Canyon .
For safety , the balloon would need to maintain a fair altitude , limiting the detail of the data collected .
Proponents of the artificial dragonfly point to its ability to overcome these problems .
Professor Robert Michelson , of the Georgia Tech Research Institute , argues strongly for such a mechanical beast , which he calls an entomopter , after entomology , the study of insects .
As Michelson points out , "" because of its ability to fly slowly , land , and refuel , the entomopter may be the longest lived and therefore potentially the most useful unmanned machine to fly on Mars .
"" It could stop to study specific features , perhaps collecting samples to return to a home base where it would be recharged for its next foray .
Making imitation wings strong and light enough is relatively straightforward .
Michelson 's team has this in hand .
Rather more complicated is driving those wings .
Conventional electric motors and batteries are far too heavy , a problem exacerbated by the gears and cams needed to facilitate the continually changing tilt and drive of the flapping wings .
Again , nature provides the answer .
The entomopter uses what is known as a reciprocating chemical muscle .
In short , these are man - made muscles , and they use chemical energy to generate movement .
Entomopter development has taken off .
An entomopter could easily be tested in a large vacuum chamber at 1 % atmospheric pressure , the same as on the red planet .
Planetary exploration is only one of the possible implementations .
If a model can be built that will fly in our atmosphere , then the surveillance of hostile regions will be revolutionised .
The concept of being buzzed will obtain a whole new meaning .

Bowie Heathen ( Iso )

* * Â£ 14.99
Earlier this month , David Bowie took the surprising step of penning an article for a national newspaper , defending his taste in music .
As artistic director of this year 's Meltdown festival at the South Bank centre , he had been riled by suggestions that his selections - including Suede , the Dandy Warhols , Coldplay and the Divine Comedy - were middle - of - the road .
"" My choice of billing reflects both my populist and fringe tastes in music , "" harrumphed a clearly aggrieved Thin White Duke , accusing his detractors of being fashion victims .
It is difficult to know where to place your sympathies .
On one hand , Bowie 's ire over the mockery aimed at Meltdown is understandable .
Bowie has done more to introduce the avant - garde to a mainstream rock audience than any artist since the Beatles .
The journalist mocking the loudest , meanwhile , was Stuart Maconie , an omnipresent talking head on TV nostalgia shows .
It must gall to be told you 're not edgy enough by a man who makes his living cracking jokes about space hoppers and clackers .
On the other hand , Maconie 's criticism was largely accurate .
With its preponderance of unchallenging indie bands , Bowie 's Meltdown carries a whiff of the Reading Festival .
He made his reputation crashing through musical boundaries and gleefully stamping on sexual taboos , while pretending to be a decadent gay saxophone - playing cokehead alien pierrot with an interest in fascism and the occult .
It 's a bit disappointing when he suddenly reveals a love for Coldplay , the musical equivalent of a semi - detached bungalow in Weybridge .
The Meltdown saga illustrates the dichotomy of Bowie 's career to date .
After 10 years of staggering invention , his recording career went hopelessly off the rails in the 1980s .
Dreadful albums such as Tonight foolishly indulged in slick , shallow pop .
The result was critical opprobrium .
In the 1990s , he attempted to relocate his sense of adventure , trying virtually everything bar strapping a pair of cymbals to his knees and busking in the tube : techno , TV soundtracks , unlistenable Brian Eno collaborations , even hanging out with drum'n'bass nitwit Goldie .
The result was minimal sales .
He has managed just one Top 10 hit in the past 16 years .
As evidenced by the Meltdown controversy , people want Bowie to be weird .
But not that weird .
The one thing Bowie has consistently failed to do in recent years - and what he apparently did so effortlessly throughout the 1970s - is contain his outre leanings within a crowd - pleasing pop framework .
Which is where Heathen , his 27th studio album , comes in .
Heathen achieves a balance noticeably lacking in Bowie 's output of the past 20 years .
At one extreme , it boasts a perplexing "" concept "" ( apparently it involves "" One who does not see his world .
He has no mental light .
He destroys almost unwittingly .
He can not feel any of God 's presence in his life .
He is the 21st - century man "" - that 's that cleared up , then ) , and lyrics that defy explication : "" Do n't forget to keep your head on , twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd , "" runs the chorus of Slip Away .
At the other , it features Everybody Says Hi , a lovely song on which Bowie contemplates his son Joe 's adulthood in the most prosaic terms imaginable : "" I 'd like to get a letter , like to know what 's what , hope the weather 's good
and it 's not too hot . ""
Bowie and co - producer Tony Visconti have come up with a string of fascinating arrangements .
The title track surges erratically .
Pete Townshend contributes noisy scattershot guitar to Slow Burn .
I Would Be Your Slave features a string section hovering unsettlingly above a metronomic drum pattern and electronic pulses .
Yet the settings never overshadow the songs : strident , confident , lush with melodies .
A Better Future is insanely hummable , I Would Be Your Slave romantic and weird in equal measure .
If the cover of the Pixies ' Cactus tries too hard to capture the spooked intensity of the original , his version of Neil Young 's I 've Been Waiting for You is subjected to perfect Bowie - isation , the earthiness of the original replaced by other- worldly alienation .
It would be wrong to herald Heathen as a complete return to 1970s form .
It lacks the thrilling sense of artistic tumult that marks Station to Station , Low or 1980 's Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , albums on which ideas appear to burst forth , barely marshalled .
But those were records made by a decadent gay saxophone - playing cokehead alien pierrot with an interest in fascism and the oc cult .
Heathen is the work of a multi - millionaire 55-year - old father of two .
Packed with fantastic songs , liberally sprinkled with intriguing touches , Heathen is the sound of a man who has finally worked out how to grow old with a fitting degree of style .
When you consider the state of his peers , that is a unique achievement in itself .
It is also a more exciting and adventurous record than anything produced by the bands he has chosen for Meltdown , most of whom are half his age .
A backhanded compliment maybe , but a compliment none the less ."
2002-06-05,"For the first time in two decades , a new David Bowie album is generating a buzz of excitement .
The Guardian described his new album Heathen as being "" packed with fantastic songs "" .
Music Week cited "" a stunning return to form "" , while in the US , Rolling Stone declared that Bowie is "" back to playing Bowie , with class "" .
The common mantra is that the Tony Visconti - produced Heathen is Bowie 's best album since Scary Monsters in 1980 - the last Bowie record produced by Visconti .
It seems unlikely that a career could be revitalised by the simple act of reuniting with a producer , but perhaps not if that producer is Tony Visconti .
Bowie has made great records without his mentor - Hunky Dory , Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane .
But Visconti was at the controls for Space Oddity , The Man Who Sold the World , Young Americans , Low , Heroes , Lodger and Scary Monsters , a string of stunning albums that changed the face of pop .
Since Bowie ditched him for Chic 's Nile Rodgers for the commercially successful but hardly classic
Let 's Dance in 1983 , Bowie 's career has never recovered .
Giving a rare interview from his New York studio , Visconti insists he is not a great rock'n'roll producer .
"" We 're similar in that you ca n't nail us down , "" he says .
"" I 've been trained in classical and jazz .
I 'm a rock musician .
David studied jazz saxophone and theatre .
He listens to classical music .
I 'm one of the few people - possibly including Brian Eno - who can keep up with him , switch genres and roles very quickly .
We have no holds barred .
"" More than anybody else in his career , Tony Visconti understands what makes David Bowie tick .
They first met in 1967 , when 20-year - old Visconti , an in - house songwriter at New York 's Richmond Organisation , moved to London specifically to work with the largely unknown singer .
They lived together at Bowie 's notoriously swinging hippie commune at Haddon Hall .
Visconti ( who also did eight albums with Marc Bolan ) earned Bowie 's trust and respect by getting the singer to stand up to industry figures .
Visconti also had the mettle to argue with Bowie when he believed he was right .
His impact on Bowie 's music was immediate .
Before Visconti , Bowie was producing pleasant , melodic ditties like Love
You
Till Tuesday .
Their first recording was Let Me Sleep
Beside You , which - drenched in the producer 's trademark strings - was simultaneously beautiful and unsettling .
It was the first appearance of the Bowie we came to know .
Visconti 's key technique is to encourage Bowie to give in to his weirder urges ( Heathen features a Theremin , a Stylophone and an oil drum ) , then rein them in with his own spectacular talent as an arranger .
Without Visconti , Bowie was pop but lacking in adventure in the 1980s ; weird but often impenetrable in the 1990s .
Visconti has followed Bowie 's post - Scary Monsters career with frustration . ""
In the 1980s he let other people take control .
In the 1990s there were some great isolated tracks . ""
He sighs : "" I wish I could have been around for those albums . ""
Perhaps Bowie wishes so too .
Apparently , the pair have been discussing a reunion for years , but it never happened .
A year ago , Bowie completed an album titled Toy , turning the final mix over to Visconti .
However , his label , Virgin Records , would not release the album .
Toy - featuring old songs Bowie had written in the 1960s - was always intended as an "" interim "" album , but according to Visconti Bowie was "" hurt terribly "" .
This time , he would do things properly , which meant Visconti at the helm .
Recording took place at an isolated residential studio in the mountains outside New York .
Within days , Bowie was "" writing furiously "" , something he has n't done in years .
Rising at 6 am , he devoured coffee , Air , Moby , Strauss , Mahler and the Comedian Harmonists , a six - part harmony group from the 1930s .
"" We listened to contemporary things to avoid copying them , "" says Visconti .
"" The few times he has copied people you can tell .
He 's always been an innovator .
"" Visconti is still amazed by Bowie 's expertise in "" staging "" an album - "" knowing what characters to put together to make something wonderful and odd "" .
On Heathen , Bowie has combined Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl with old school
Bowie axeman Carlos Alomar , and Pete Townshend , who played on Scary Monsters .
This time , Townshend eventually had to mail his contributions by post , after arriving at the studio with "" bloodied knuckles "" from , implausibly , doing windmills while practising .
The main guitarist on the album , though , is ambient texturalist David Torn , who records as Splattered Cell - a virtual unknown .
Because of their history , Visconti is able to coax performances from Bowie no other producer could .
Bowie has responded by reaching deep into his muse .
The Man Who Sold the World confronted fear of the family line of mental illness .
Low charted cocaine recovery and the securely held conviction that witches were out to get him .
Now , at 55 , Bowie is long since clean , secure and stable .
Heathen explores a preoccupation with his own mortality and what world awaits his new baby .
For the first time in decades , he is speaking from the soul . ""
David was very jovial , "" says Visconti .
"" But he would go somewhere in the mornings when he was writing these songs .
You could see he was really struggling with questions .
After a few weeks I said : ' It seems like you 're addressing God himself . '
The concept of Heathen is a godless century .
He was addressing the bleakness of our soul ... and maybe his own soul . ""
All his life , Bowie has striven for something , from his interest in Buddhism ( which he shares with Visconti ) and extra - terrestrials , to his mid-1970s path to the occult , something that "" terrified "" his producer .
At times , Heathen has an unmistakable air of panic .
Visconti says that they were in the middle of recording on September 11 .
"" At night we could see the flames , "" he says .
"" For that whole day we lost contact with our loved ones .
Iman [ Bowie 's wife ] was very close to it .
He got hold of her for 10 minutes and the phones went down .
My son lived very close .
His business partner lived across the street and managed to get out five minutes before the building collapsed .
All of us have stories like that .
Did it influence the album ?
Undoubtedly , but a lot of those lyrics are very prophetic .
I swear to you only a few lines were amended after September 11 . ""
The first words on Heathen are "" Nothing remains "" .
After being apart for 22 years and having occasionally "" fought "" in the past , Visconti and Bowie are getting on famously .
"" Our past seems to be side - splitting at the moment , "" says Visconti .
"" We used to go out with the same girls .
Before he met me he was into Zen Buddhism .
He thought he understood it clearly and would explain it to anyone willing to listen .
That 's David !
He has n't changed .
He 's still wide - eyed , still thinks things are awesome , and he is a knowledge junkie , which is quite amazing for a 55-year - old man .
"" The pair plan to work again almost immediately , possibly entering the studio as early as September .
Heathen could be a brief new dawn in a career lately littered with false ones , but the Bowie - Visconti track record suggests otherwise .
"" I know what he can do , "" says Visconti . ""
And when he 's in the mood , there is little he ca n't do . ""
Â· Heathen is released on June 10 on Columbia ."
2002-06-08,"' We 've got a request from one of the audience tonight , ' announces David Bowie .
As the band start to play a familiar tune he starts to croon : ' Sometimes you get so lonely ... '
As he brings ' Be My Wife ' to a close , Bowie turns to the audience , grins the widest of grins and leans into the microphone . '
Waddya reckon ? '
he asks . '
Good innit ! '
Awe - struck , the entire audience mutely nods its agreement .
All three of us .
We 're in a tiny Manhattan rehearsal studio
and I 'm sitting 10 ft away from Bowie on a sofa beside Tony Visconti , the man who produced some of his greatest albums , and an equally impressed publicist from London . '
We did good did n't we ! '
Bowie tells his producer and checks the set list to see what 's next .
He runs through a short selection from Low and then moves on to try out some numbers from his new album Heathen , which sees him reunited with Visconti for the first time since Scary Monsters in 1980 and is already being acclaimed as his best since then .
It 's his first ( semi- ) public performance of the new songs .
Even Visconti has not heard them since Bowie left the recording studio , and he 's clapping like a fan . '
Having Tony here is a bit like having your maths master here , ' chuckles Bowie . '
Very weird .
But I 'm having so much fun
I feel like a kid in a candy store ! '
Bowie 's mood of rejuvenation was tangible when we met earlier in the day at a boutique hotel close to the singer 's downtown home in SoHo .
Despite claiming exhaustion after three days of interviews , the voluble and articulate Bowie glows with health and is clearly excited .
He exhibits none of the familiar stand - offishness or control freak- ery of the superstar interviewee .
From the moment he shakes hands he is warm and courteous , retain- ing a remarkable degree of South London matiness considering he has not lived in London for nearly 30 years .
It all conspires to make you feel you 're his best chum within min- utes of sitting down with him ( and may well be calculated to do just that ) .
In conversation he affects a relaxed and charming air , as eager to discuss his work , health and family as his passions for art , literature and music .
An omnivorous reader , consuming several books a week ( Martin Amis and Ian McEwan are particular favourites ) , he has accumulated an impressive vocabulary since leaving school with a solitary O level in woodwork , which can occasionally make him appear pretentious .
He often searches for the right word , occasionally locating the wrong one ( his lyrics are ' internal feelings becoming exteriorised ' ? ) and sometimes correcting himself pedantically : '
That 's my genre - my oeuvre , rather . '
His accent remains immune to his many travels : it 's the same one we remember from ' Laughing Gnome ' .
Whatever his musical relevance in 2002 , in a career spanning 35 years Bowie has forged a trail - blazing path as the most innovative and influential artist in rock history .
He maintained his mystique by constantly reinventing himself with characters such as Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke ; not to mention his forays into theatre , film , art , the internet and the financial markets .
Today , happily married for 10 years to former model
Iman , he stands alone of his generation in continuing to generate eager anticipation for each new move .
In addition to Heathen - his 25th studio recording and the first on his own ISO label - there is another , as yet unreleased , album called Toy , which features new versions of his oldest songs .
More immediately , he is curating the Meltdown Festival on the South Bank , featuring the likes of Philip Glass ( performing symphonic adaptations of Bowie 's Low and Heroes ) , Asian Dub Foundation ( performing a live score to accompany the French film La Haine ) , Coldplay , Suede , Mercury Rev , Television and Badly Drawn Boy , as well as cult artists Daniel Johnston and Bowie 's old stable mate The Legendary Stardust Cowboy .
Bowie will himself appear on the final night to give a performance of Heathen and Low in their entirety on 29 June , with a new live band including old hand Mike Garson on piano , Gail - Ann Dorsey on bass and guitarists Earl Slick , another Bowie veteran , and newcomer Gerry Leonard , an Irishman who creates ambient soundscapes in the style of Eno and Daniel Lanois .
The temperature is soaring into the high 80s in downtown New York as he walks into the hotel at 10 am .
He has already been up for hours - since abandoning drink and drugs in the mid-80s he has tended to rise soon after 5 am - and glistens with perspiration after a sparring session in a nearby boxing gym .
He looks fit , no trace of fat on his 55-year - old frame , salt - and - pepper stubble and blond - streaked sandy hair flopping out of a centre parting .
He is wear- ing unseasonal dark - brown cords , a pale - blue T - shirt and deck shoes , none of designer provenance ; in fact , he cheerfully confesses , his entire ensemble comes from J Crew , a high - street chain store best known for conservative ' preppy ' styles .
Bowie 's career has been as notable for his ever - changing style as for his equally diverse music .
But , in an iconoclastic admission , he is adamant he has no interest in fashion . '
Not at all , ' he insists , ' and I never have done .
I rarely buy clothes .
I wear them well and people give me stuff
and I 'm quite keen to wear it for public shows and albums and all that .
But I 'm not interested in fashion .
And my wife 's the same .
She never goes shopping : she hates shopping with a vengeance .
That 's the second thing that drew me to her - the first was that she got up at 5 am like me .
She can shop faster than any other woman I 've ever met . '
He may not quite be ready for his pipe and slippers but there 's a domestic side to Bowie that one can not imagine in his contemporaries such as Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart , who seem determined to relive their teenage years to the bitter end .
Bowie , by contrast , seems content combining hands - on fatherhood with collecting 20th - century British paintings by unfashionable names like Clive Barnes and Derek Boshier , and popping up every couple of years with a new album .
Perhaps he 's done what rock stars so often fail to do : grown up .
His enduring fitness is attributable to a combination of clean living - the lifelong 60-a - day smoker finally quit last December - and a combination of exercise and meditation . '
I do n't work out , but I quite like being fit , especially since my daughter has been around . '
Alexandria was born in August 2000 and her arrival has forced him to reassess his lifestyle . '
One does think about oneself in a slightly different way , ' he admits . '
My hold on things is less important than her having a good structure with her and around her , so it 's my responsibility to be as good as possible .
I do n't do gym - type things
but I box three times a week . '
Somewhat at odds with his louche image , Bowie has kept in shape by sparring since the 80s when he was ' quite a fitness buff ' .
He 's never entered the ring in anger but says it is the technique that interests him most . '
I 'm fast
and I 'm quite agile ,
so technically I think I 'm pretty good , ' he says , ' but whether I have any power in my punches or any ability to stay away from the other guy I do n't know because I 've never been in a fight .
My trainer is a huge man who would n't dream of even tapping me on the forehead cos it would lay me out . '
He also meditates daily , but says : ' I do find the physical activity helps tremendously in terms of clearing my head .
It really helps me feel quite sprightly through the day . '
Because of his early - rising regime , he finds that parenthood has impacted less on his lifestyle . '
I still get up before my baby does .
It does n't matter what time I go to bed - two or three in the morning - I still wake up at five .
I 'm bloody tired the next day
but it 's like I have an internal clock .
So it 's not really changed our physical sleeping habits , which I know can be very disruptive for some people .
I know some musicians who are used to getting up at noon or 1 pm and when they 've had children it 's totally upset their apple cart
and they are bleary - eyed for the rest of the day . '
He likes waking up as dawn breaks and uses the time to plan his day 's work and to communicate with Europe - which is already up and working - by email and telephone .
But he does n't change nappies . '
No , I do n't !
I 'm quite old fashioned .
I 've done that a couple of times and do n't like it .
Actually I do n't need to cos Iman is a pretty natural mother . '
The couple have a nanny who comes daily , but does not live in , and Bowie sees his role as being more ' educational ' in the raising of his new child . '
I do a lot of reading aloud , ' he says , ' and my wife and I take shares in playing with her .
We 're both active parents and very involved .
We both have previous children and we know very much how we want to bring up our child . '
With his daughter only 22 months old , he has already turned down a world tour this year because he does not wish to repeat parental mistakes he made in the past . '
I do n't want to start doing what I unfortunately did with my son , inasmuch as I spent an awful lot of time on tour when he was a young child .
I really missed those years , and I know he did too .
Fortunately we were together by the time he was six and I brought him up from that point on .
It was a one - parent family .
I do n't want to repeat the same mistakes with Lexie . '
Bowie 's son is now 30 and working in the film industry in London .
He used to be called Zowie but because , understandably , heads turned whenever his parents called out his name , they converted it to Joe , which stuck for many years . '
Then he , at his own compunction , changed it back to Duncan , which is his real name , when he went to university ( in Nashville ) .
So be it .
He 's now Duncan . '
Father and son remain close and Bowie is proud that Duncan is making his own way in the film business , which he is ' really quite obsessed about in the same way as I was about what I do ' , without trading on his father 's famous name . '
He 's doing it all on his own .
He does n't expect anything from me . '
Suddenly , Daddy comes over all misty eyed . '
He 's a very nice man , he 's lovely .
I love him very much indeed , I really do . '
Shortly after the birth of his daughter , Bowie said he could not envisage bringing up his child in America and was contemplating a return to England , where he has not lived for nearly 30 years .
Now he is not so sure . '
I do n't think we 've made the decision , ' he says , but London is unlikely to become home again . '
I go there often enough as a visitor for it to quench my thirst for all things
English and it gives me enough chance to see the people that I miss and love .
However , there are aspects of it I do n't like very much . '
Such as ?
His cheery demeanour disappears . '
I think the absolute awe in which celebrity is held over there is kind of jaw dropping .
I personally do n't want to live like that .
I never really have done and I do n't see any reason to change it now .
And I certainly do n't want my daughter or my wife to have to go through that . '
He adds : ' My wife knows nothing about England : she 's been there on holiday a few times but she does n't know the experience of living in England . '
By that , he presumably means the experience of living in a country with a celebrity - obsessed culture , reflected in - and fuelled by - the tabloid press , though he is loath to blame them . '
I think it 's a national mentality [ in England ] .
They both feed each other - the public and the tabloids . '
When I ask him his views on celebrity he snaps back impatiently : ' I do n't have views on celebrity , I 'm indifferent to it .
I think it 's absolute crap .
I can not understand anybody who wants to be on the front page of a newspaper all the bloody time if they do n't have something to sell . '
Bowie has generally managed to steer clear of tabloid intrusion .
And evidently , that 's more easily done in New York , where he can take Lexie to the park in her buggy without any minders - and without any fear of appearing in tomorrow 's red - tops . '
This town is no problem , ' he says .
' There are certain cities - London , LA , Paris - where I do n't have a good time .
I have a great time here : we can go where we want , eat where we want , walk out with our child , go to the park , ride the subway , do the things that any other family does .
I 'm very happy with that situation . '
He adds : ' I 'd never dream of employing a minder unless I 'm working .
I have always found that that type of behaviour attracts more attention than anything else . '
And when he is spotted in New York , he says , it 's less of a big deal than it is in London . '
In London it 's more excitable and becomes more event - oriented , but here the recognition is almost at a community level .
It 's like , "" Hi
Dave , how ya doing !
"" It 's a very friendly thing over here . '
Despite regular reports to the contrary , his apartment in New York is , he says , the only home he owns .
He 's lived there for 11 years , and with most of his ambitions fulfilled - he rules out having any more children - he finally seems settled , both geographically and spiritually .
What 's more , after a career built on multiple changes in character and personality , he seems genuinely to have reached a point in life where he knows who he really is - perhaps for the first time . '
I do n't find it a problem being old
and I do n't mind not thinking like I used to think when I was young , ' he says .
' I do n't have that thing about ""
I 'm old
but I feel like an 18-year- old inside !
"" I do n't .
I feel like exactly what I am , which is 55 going on 56 , and it seems to be a pretty cool age to be .
I 've experienced a lot and have a sense of who I am that maybe I did n't have a few years ago . '
There are no yearning ambition any more .
There are things I 'd like to do but none are crucial .
I have a sense that I 've become the person that I always should have been .
It 's been a kind of cyclical , almost elliptical , journey at times
but I feel like I 've finally arrived at being instead of becoming , which is kind of how I feel about being young - there 's always a sense that you 're becoming something , that you 're going be shocked by something new or discover something or be surprised by what life has in store .
I 'm still surprised at some things , but I do understand them , I know them .
There 's a sense that I know where I am now .
I recognise life and most of its experiences , and I 'm quite comfortable with the idea of the finality of it .
But it does n't stop me trying to continually resolve it : resolve my questions about it .
And I probably will .
I think I 'll still be doing it - hopefully - like Strauss , at 84 . '
Following on from his last album , Hours , which found Bowie reflecting on his past , Heathen is a rumination on the uncertain world into which he has brought his daughter .
He has said of it that he wanted to write about a world that he felt had let her down , and to plead ' to whoever that higher spirit is ' for a remedy to some of its ills , ' because I want a place where my daughter can grow up safely , walking open - eyed into her ambitions - not having to dodge bullets ' .
One of the new songs states the case openly - ' I Demand A Better Future ' . '
I had rosy expectations for the 21st century , I really did , ' he says sadly . '
The whole idea was lifting my spirits quite a lot during 1998 and 1999 .
But it has become something other that what I expected it to be .
And it 's obviously a pretty typical parental concern to wonder what type of a world you have brought your child into . '
Despite Bowie 's homely preoccupations nowadays , he is still a rock star who revolutionised music .
For what does he think he 'll be remembered ?
He groans in mock embarrassment . '
Nice trousers , I think I 'm supposed to say .
Or silly haircuts ...
Oh fuck , do n't do this to me ! '
he pleads through his laughter .
Remaining ambitions ? '
I would adore to finish writing a book .
I 've started so many books , but I peter out . '
The definitive Bowie memoirs , perhaps ? '
Oh Lord , no ! '
Regrets ?
He fixes me with those eyes - one blue and one green - and declares firmly : ' Absolutely none . '

2002-06-09,"It was the song that set David Bowie on the road to stardom .
When ' Space Oddity ' was released in 1969 , it proved to be the first hit of a career that is still thriving 33 years later .
But now Bowie is facing a lawsuit from the record 's producer , who claims he is still owed millions in royalty payments spanning a 30-year period .
Gus Dudgeon , who produced ' Your Song ' for Elton John and helped guide his sound throughout the Seventies , claims he was only paid a Â£ 250 advance for his work on ' Space Oddity ' .
Royalty investigator David Morgan , who has taken up Dudgeon 's case , said : ' Nobody 's taken Gus 's claim seriously until now .
But I 've seen the contract
and I know he 's got an entitlement . ' '
Space Oddity ' , which introduced the world to Major Tom , was recorded in one day at Trident Studios in London in 1969 .
After the BBC used it in coverage of the first moon landing later that year it shot to No 5 in the charts .
A re - release in 1975 sent it to No 1 .
Dudgeon had already worked with the Rolling Stones and Small Faces by the time he teamed up with Bowie .
Morgan claims he was promised a 2 per cent cut of sales - ' a standard - type deal 30 years ago ' - but never saw a penny . '
When I started producing in the Sixties
I was very green , ' said Dudgeon . '
It was only when I started seeing decent royalties rolling in from my Elton records that I realised the true value of that track . '
The 59-year - old , who lives in a five - bedroom house in Surrey , wants a one - off settlement of Â£ 1 million , or a more complicated cut of earnings , plus interest and damages stretching back 30 years . '
We 've opened a dialogue with Bowie and the record companies concerned , but they 're fighting our claim , ' said Morgan .
The case is complicated by an ownership issue .
Five years ago , Bowie became the first pop star to raise money on the stock market .
The so - called ' Bowie Bonds ' earned him a Â£ 37.7 m advance on the future earnings of his back catalogue . '
Technically , they belong to Bowie , but they have in effect been leased to the New York Stock Exchange through a securities company , ' said Morgan . '
However , the ownership will in due course revert to him . '
Dudgeon says he is a reluctant litigant . '
The business I 'm in is extremely mercenary and has no regard for people any more , ' he said .
' I 've been trying to do something about the situation for years , but I 've always drawn a blank .
Launching any legal action is prohibitively expensive and the record companies count on most people not being able to afford it .
I 'm lucky enough to be able to afford to mount such a legal action . '
Bowie 's new album , Heathen ( released tomorrow ) , has been described as ' his best since 1980 's Scary Monsters ' , and he curates this year 's Meltdown Festival on London 's South Bank , which kicks off this week .
A spokesman for Bowie refused to comment ."
2002-06-09,"DAVID BOWIE Heathen ( Columbia 508222 - 2 )
For the majority of the Nineties , David Bowie seemed to try his hand at virtually every musical genre - mainstream dance , industrial rock and even drum'n'bass .
The experiments - and they sounded like little else - while artistically challenging , seemed to indicate a man in freefall , bored by the burden of his past and perhaps fearful of the future .
Heathen , thankfully , has little of Bowie 's recent reticence about committing himself to the cause .
He has n't sounded as purposeful as this in a long time .
In particular , he avoids the multi - personality transfers of his various dance projects and gets back to what most have suspected he could easily deliver - a mainstream rock album .
The result is little short of revelatory , arriving as it does so unexpectedly .
Heathen is mainly crafted with drums , bass and guitar and seems to indicate Bowie going full circle , or at least acknowledging the one facet of his personality he has been keen to ignore since the Seventies : Ziggy Stardust .
The songs are suitably sleek , and punctuated by simple percussion . '
I Would Be Your Slave ' , trading on whispers of strings , has the singer pronounce : ' Open up your heart to me/ Show me who you
are/
And I would be your slave . '
It 's a simple , elegiac song , and perhaps the finest Bowie has written for at least a decade .
Most of the other material - including ' Slip Away ' , ' Slow Burn ' and ' Afraid ' - is n't bad either .
If the return to rock music has invigorated his lyrical style , it has also done wonders for his voice .
He sounds enigmatic , compelling and confident .
Ziggy Stardust parallels are not entirely unfounded .
On ' Gemini Spacecraft ' , a delightfully throwaway song , Bowie sings : ' Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft/
It was all about you/ I passed through the shadow of Jupiter/
And thought about you . '
It 's as if he 's laughing at his former glories , and realising recent mistakes .
Although Heathen rarely stumbles , there are occasional problems , such as on the title track and ' Everyone Says Hi ' , where Bowie 's arrangements sound a little convoluted in their desire to remain contemporary .
The remaining tracks have a familiar , late - Seventies - era feel .
To that extent , Heathen is not a rebirth but a welcome , if sometimes unsure , rediscovery of former talents . Â·

2002-06-15,"Along with my other deep - rooted fears , such as spiders and actually being asked to do some work , I 've recently acquired a new one - being invited around to David Bowie 's for tea .
While I 'm sure he and Iman put on a nice spread , there would have to come that moment when he invited you into his den to give you the lowdown on what music was ' exciting ' him these days , slipping on a few ' hot ' CDs , and frugging on the mat , to illustrate his point .
The rest of us , who merely enjoy music in that healthy , semi - detached way which does n't interfere too much with one 's day - to - day sanity , have a lot to fear from those like Bowie who take it upon themselves to remain in a permanent teenage tizzy about the latest waxings .
Hopelessly paranoid that they are not ' in touch ' any more , they come down with a bad case of Trying - Too - Hard - itis .
Bearing this in mind , I observed with malicious glee that Bowie had been chosen as this year 's curator of the Meltdown festival , expecting , at the ' groundbreaking ' least , an orchestra comprised solely of grown men attempting to play electro - funk on their genitals .
In this , I was disappointed ( although we do get a Philip Glass symphony , which some might say is close ) .
However , looking at the oddly staid and established line - up ( Suede , Supergrass , Coldplay , Divine Comedy , The Waterboys , Badly Drawn Boy ) , one thought occurs .
Where , once again , are the ladies ?
Now in its tenth year , the Meltdown festival , on London 's South Bank , has a deserved reputation for fusing poppy populism with arty eclectism to mostly good effect .
Less admirably , and far more furtively , it has also acquired a reputation for misogyny - in that , in the main , it ignores female artists from the past and present .
It is quite unbelievable that , in the decade it has been going , there have been nine male honourables ( including Scott Walker , Elvis Costello , Nick Cave and Robert Wyatt ) but only one female curator for Meltdown .
And that was Laurie ' O Superman ' Anderson , who nobody remembers or cares about .
There have also been precious few female performers in the subsequent line - ups .
Indeed , it is as if , over the years , Meltdown has turned into Planet Bloke , a smugly male locker room where the atmosphere has become far too rarefied and masculine for the puny lungs of female creativity to breathe easily .
Something has to explain why , for some years , Meltdown has enjoyed markedly less female activity than a hot night in the Gents on Hampstead Heath .
At least , on the Heath , there 's a chance they 'd have to let in female cleaners in the morning .
Maybe the organisers think that Lilith Fair corrects any imbalance .
And maybe it would if Lilith Fair was n't such a tediously worthy carnival of synchronised menstruation long colonised by demented lute - playing hippies .
And anyway , what exactly is so appalling with the idea of getting a few more women involved with Meltdown ?
For possible curators , why not the likes of Joni Mitchell , Joan Baez , Yoko Ono , Aretha Franklin , Kate Bush , BjÃ¶rk , Dolly Parton , Patti Smith , Debbie Harry , Tracy Chapman , Chrissie Hynde , Joan Jett , Neneh Cherry , SinÃ©ad O'Connor , Polly Harvey , Sade or Tori Amos ?
Indeed , why not ask Madonna , who is so often ignored when it comes to handing out cultural plaudits , despite continuing to out - sell and out - class most other enduring male ' icons ' such as Bowie himself , to richly embarrassing degrees .
The answer , my friends , is blowing in the wind , by which I mean , the rather unfragrant , thoroughly male , after - dinner fart that is , that 's always been , the unapologetically sexist music industry .
The real world has long caught up with the idea of women being Pretty Good at most things men can do , and in some cases , actually better , but not the music business .
Whenever things look like they 're getting serious ( awards ; Top 100 lists ; festivals like Meltdown ) , the male boors in the music business still seem rather too quick to dismiss the ladies and ' pass the port ' among themselves .
And only themselves .
It is as if they do n't want to worry the girls ' pretty little heads with such ' trifles ' as respect , longevity or long - term recognition .
Just as the film industry famously has three stages for actresses ( babe , district attorney , and Driving Miss Daisy ) , the music industry tends to have its own three for female performers : babe , guest artist , and ' who ? '
This is what the Meltdown festival is reflecting , not just this year but every year - the ludicrous , unrealistic , blind masculine arrogance of the music industry .
Meltdown ?
More like ' An Audience With ...
Testosterone ' .
Mind you
, I really do n't know why I 'm so surprised .
After all , this is the industry that thought it was doing femininity a favour by inventing The Groupie ."
2002-06-17,"Thirty years ago , primitive rock'n'roller
The Legendary Stardust Cowboy inspired David Bowie to create his Ziggy Stardust alter ego .
Now Bowie has summoned the so - called Ledge , born Norman Carl Odam , to play a rare British show at the South Bank 's Meltdown festival .
For the first five minutes he is hilarious : clicking his spurs , hollering over his one classic , Paralyzed , with batty gusto , hurling paper plates into the audience .
Alas , the decibel level quickly spirals to distortion and the charm fades .
If an air of affable eccentricity hovers over the Ledge , Daniel Johnston is a more disturbing business entirely .
Clearly fragile , he is a manic depressive whose songs are not so much tales of unrequited love as the nihilistic , obsessive poems of a troubled outsider , such as The Spook , a most aggressive plea for tolerance .
A tubby figure dressed in a baggy T - shirt , sweatpants and what appear to be carpet slippers
, Johnston plays wholly solo , aided only by a guitar and a lectern .
His voice is that of a man much older than his 41 years .
It cracks occasionally , but has the plaintive resonance of Nick Heyward or Stephen Duffy .
Mercifully , though , Johnston is not a freak show .
His songs are conventionally structured and he has a real flair for melody .
Mind Contorted and Casper the Friendly Ghost have dainty tunes , while the despondent Life in Vain trundles along in the merry manner of His Latest Flame .
While Johnston the songwriter needs careful nurturing , clearly Johnston the man could also do with a little assistance .
Eventually his equilibrium is disturbed by a gaggle of insensitive buffoons loudly demanding his best - known song , Speeding Motorcycle ( "" I 'm sorry , I do n't have that one with me "" ) .
The set climaxes with a downbeat cover of Live and Let Die before a brief encore .
The applause then is rapturous , but for Johnston it 's too late .
Although less than an hour has passed , he is gone for good ."
2002-06-21,"It was something of a coup to recruit Television for David Bowie 's Meltdown festival .
The glacial new - wavers made rock history with their 1977 debut album , Marquee Moon , and although they have done nothing to match it since , their aura of chilly reclusiveness has kept their legend alive .
This was the band 's best - known line - up , comprising guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd alongside drummer Billy Ficca and bassist Fred Smith .
Bizarrely , while the other three have aged at about the rate you would expect over the past 25 years , Verlaine seems frozen in time .
He is still pale , awkward and aloof - not exactly a Thin White Duke , but definitely a Man Who Fell to Earth .
Watching the band on stage , it 's no wonder they have never managed to stick together for long .
Verlaine sings and plays as if he were in his own private universe , scarcely acknowledging the audience or even his bandmates .
His detached , squawky vocals tell their own story .
Although Verlaine is the focal point , the others do most of the hard slog .
With Smith steady but unobtrusive on bass , the industrious Lloyd shoulders a sizable burden of lead and rhythm guitar .
His thick , driving tone contrasts with Verlaine 's glassier , more quavering sound - an effect deftly exploited in Little Johnny Jewel , a showcase for Verlaine 's sighing , seagull - like phrases .
Many songs , such as See No Evil and the swaggering Glory , were built on Lloyd 's thrusting riffs in collusion with Ficca 's imaginative drumming .
In an encore of Psychotic Reaction , Lloyd dropped out of the song 's garage - band lurch to fire off a skittering free - form solo in no known time signature .
It is probably because their appearances together are so rare that Television are short on telepathic rapport .
The guitar cascade in Venus had the pedantic accuracy of a training exercise , and there was a collective feeling of relief when they finally got a bit of body movement going in Prove It .
Unsurprisingly , Marquee Moon won the best reception of the night , Verlaine venturing away from the song 's statuesque architecture with a dense monkey puzzle of a solo .
What a shame that Bowie himself , the festival 's absentee curator , could n't have put in an appearance .
Instead we got a whimsical Bowie pastiche for an encore , with Verlaine reciting the titles of his songs while the band improvised noises .
Intriguing , but hardly lovable ."
2002-06-21,"Proving that there is still a little life in that old saw about comedy being the new rock'n'roll , Harry Hill crops up this year as a rare stand - up on the bill of the Meltdown music festival .
He is here at David Bowie 's behest , but loses no time in biting the hand that feeds him .
When Hill bounds on stage he is decked out as glam - era Bowie , squawking the Thin White Duke 's classics through a set of fake buck teeth .
The intro sets the tone for the evening : gleeful stupidity and sly provocation .
The results are never less than enjoyable , even if over two and a half hours the Hill shtick is stretched beyond its ideal limit .
But then , that 's part of the fascination : how long can Hill sustain one of the most emphatic stage personas in comedy ?
He is like a kid in adult 's clothes ( hence the collars ) with an insatiable appetite for mischief .
He pulls it off because he is happy to make himself look ridiculous .
Hill is not bothered with cool ; he knows he 's a fool .
And , like the traditional fool , he spikes his idiocy with shards of subversion .
We are laughing so hard at the convoluted build - up that we hardly notice Hill satirising our attitudes to vagrancy , or testing the context in which he can joke that Nelson Mandela and Trevor McDonald look the same .
What is most impressive about this Meltdown gig , however , is the effort - unusual for a stand - up - that Hill has invested in its construction .
With support from his band , the Caterers , Hill has woven a lattice of musical motifs and recurring gags .
Throughout the evening he tests breakfast cereals for their musical capacity and invites the crowd to suggest tunes to which he can croon , Ã  la Cliff Richard , the Lord 's Prayer .
It is all delivered with frenetic physical energy by the harrumphing stand - up .
The effect is a joyful one .
Hill 's inanity is infectious , whether he is dispensing groansome one - liners , deploying his so - bad - they're - funny vaudeville skills or refining his trademark fusion of surrealism and pop culture .
This is a world where dolphins are threatened by Kinder Eggs and Hill 's left knee impersonates Jim Davidson . ""
Back me up on this , "" Hill is fond of saying as another gag spills over into nonsense .
The Meltdown audience were delighted to do so ."
2002-06-29,"Fischerspooner are either the biggest art joke since KLF burnt a million , or harbingers of a new , brilliant , deconstructivist era in pop .
Either way , the facts are that adopted New Yorkers Casey Spooner ( centre , in scarf ) and Warren Fischer ( above him , holding a bottle ) are fine artists turned pop stars who debuted in a Manhattan branch of Starbucks .
Eighteen months later , the fashion - world darlings signed to Ministry of Sound for a reputed seven - figure sum and joined the bill at this year 's Meltdown music festival , curated by David Bowie . '
We 're going into the pop battlefield , ' drawls striking frontman and one - time performance artist Spooner , who is jet - lagged and laconic in the corner of an anonymous London Bridge bar . '
It 's a fight against the forces of pop culture , and you know what ?
We 're going to kick fame 's ass . '
Weapon number one in their war on pop is their debut single ' Emerge ' .
It is an arch and knowing ( but exceptionally hooky ) moment of hi - NRG electro which is already being drip - fed by Radio 1 and whose refrain - ' sounds good , feels good , looks good ' - could easily double as the duo 's raison d'Ãªtre . '
We 're just trying to tear through ideas as fast as we can , ' agrees Fischer , the musical maestro who met Spooner at art college in Chicago .
' We 're trying to simulate the sheen of Kylie or Britney , but we 're doing it by hand
and we 're making it skewed . '
Aside from their mission to drag pop music into the environs of experimental art , Fischerspooner are the leading proponents of Electroclash .
The movement - cum - music style ( named after the 2001 festival organised by hip New York promoter Larry Tee ) fuses fashion and art with music based on 80s electro , European synth - pop circa Depeche Mode , and techno .
They are not , they insist , symptomatic of the current 80s revival . '
The 80s did n't exist , ' proposes Spooner , who , like Fischer , is in his thirties . '
We 're not inspired by that period because the way people talk about it and the reality are two different things .
It 's an illusion . '
Their shows last May featured Spooner miming in white war paint and a costume of braces and white trousers designed by Jeremy Scott .
He was flanked by dancers in Louis XIV - era wigs , glitter machines and extra band member Peanuts , who headbangs until fake blood pours out of his nose on to his white T - shirt . '
Right now , people really want to be more expressive and colourful and extreme , ' explains Spooner . '
There 's an impulse to live life to the fullest , and that 's where we come in . '
Previously , Spooner ( Fischer does n't appear in the live shows - he 's strictly a behind - the - scenes man ) appeared in a suit made from human hair .
Their opening show , at the ultra - hip Deitch Project art gallery in New York , cost $ 30,000 and attracted a bizarre spectrum of celebrities : Friends star David Schwimmer , Lou Reed , Moby and Jeff Koons all attended . '
New York is definitely more exciting than it 's been for a long time , ' says Fischer , with just the right amount of sneer . '
Pre -
millennium
it was very conservative and drab . ' '
Mmmmn , ' snorts Spooner . '
But I want more still .
It could be funnier , more reckless and more exciting . '
He bangs the table . '
I want more risk taking . '
If Starbucks were ever to ask them back , there 'd be trouble , albeit of an interesting kind . '
I really want to go back , ' smiles Spooner , eyes glinting at the idea . '
Ideally , we 'd instigate a big caffeine riot .
Â· ' Emerge ' is released on Ministry of Sound on 8 July ."
2002-07-01,"This has n't been a vintage year for Meltdown : in fact , it has felt less like an illuminatingly unconventional festival than an elaborate ruse to get David Bowie to play the relatively small Festival Hall ( conveniently in the same month that he has a new album to promote ) .
But , just as the festival has been redeemed by some striking individual performances , so Bowie 's closing gig feels like an extraordinary event .
Thirty years on from Ziggy Stardust , Bowie looks more like an alien being than ever .
It 's not his clothes - in fact , his luxurious white shirt and unknotted tie give him the air of a debauched dandy .
It 's the way he seems so ageless , flashing a toothy grin as he snakes his lithe , angular body about the stage .
His vocals are as spine - shivering as ever .
When he clambers over the line "" Do n't you wonder sometimes "" in Sound and Vision , or quivers through the chorus to I
Would Be Your Slave , his voice appears to emerge from a part of the body the rest of us did n't know existed .
The set comprises two complete albums , 1977 's Low and June 's Heathen .
They go together remarkably well , not least because parts of Heathen reflect Low 's mysterious , otherworldly beauty .
This is particularly true of the fluid , subtle I Would Be Your Slave and 5.15
The Angels Have Gone , where synthesised heavenly chants and a lilting riff slide thrillingly into wild , lurching dissonance .
Sunday
and I 've Been Waiting for You veer dangerously close to anodyne stadium rock by comparison ; someone in the audience even raises a lighter for Slip Away , although Bowie does a marvellous job of countering the song 's absurd melodrama by blithely quoting from Twinkle
Twinkle Little Star .
Whereas Heathen is played in order , Low 's songs are juggled so that the instrumentals are scattered among the songs .
You wonder why Bowie did n't release the album that way : Warszawa , Art Decade and Weeping Wall make far more impact when they do n't melt into one ponderous , droning dirge , and provide an even more startling contrast to the invigorating buoyancy of Sound and Vision and Speed of Life .
Each song contains something remarkable : the swarming , bee - like whirrs of Breaking Glass , the skin - slicingly sharp guitar of Always Crashing in the Same Car , and his impassioned vocal on Be My Wife .
This album is 25 years old , but the songs could have been written 25 days ago .
It is past 11 pm by the time Bowie returns for an encore .
He launches into White Light / White Heat , as his powerhouse , seven - piece band is joined on stage by the Dandy Warhols to create a rock behemoth , and dances amused ' through Ziggy Stardust , then inflicts 1997 's I 'm Afraid of Americans on a grumbling crowd .
He should have simply played the Ziggy Stardust album in its entirety .
Not a soul would have complained . Â·

2002-07-01,"Only the line - up stopped Glastonbury 2002 from being one of the all - time greats .
The festival has a tradition of wooing the likes of REM and David Bowie , but Coldplay and Stereophonics did n't amount to the same coup , and the average festival - goer seemed to regard Rod Stewart 's Sunday headlining slot as comic relief rather than a turn by a living legend : more Rolf Harris than Bowie .
The closest the weekend came to a classic set was Coldplay 's Friday night Pyramid Stage bill - topper .
Two years ago they were languishing in the middle of the afternoon on the Other Stage
but here they came of age before your eyes .
Half of the set comprised songs from the yet to be released album , A Rush of Blood to the Head , but they were delivered so compellingly that they swept the crowd along .
The old hits , meanwhile , provoked some of the gentlest festival singalongs ever heard .
During Trouble , the hushed , high - pitched mass contribution almost brought a tear to the eyes of frontman Chris Martin . ""
Best choir I ever heard in my life , "" he choked .
Otherwise , personality was in short supply .
The Stereophonics , Charlatans and Doves may have the songs but they had the stage presence of nervous roadies and the first two of those never rose above a plod .
An exception was Detroit duo the White Stripes .
Ex - spouses Jack and Meg White delivered their wired blues - rock with more raw charisma than the rest of the Saturday line - up put together .
Elsewhere , Wirral 's deliriously odd
The Coral mixed ska , madrigals and Captain Beefheart , Queens of the Stone Age supplied a mellow weekend 's fiercest rock'n'roll thrills and Glastonbury veterans Spiritualized and Orbital provided the son - et - lumiere spectaculars .
But you suspect in years to come that Glastonbury 2002 will be remembered less for its bill than for managing to reconfigure the festival as safe and comfortable without losing the essential blurry hedonism and hippyish bonhomie .
And that 's a remarkable achievement , Rod or no Rod ."
2002-07-06,"David Bowie Royal Festival Hall London , SE1
After enduring weeks of criticism for his Meltdown Festival -
too safe , too boring , too male - David Bowie takes the Royal Festival Hall stage looking like a waiter who has blown a month 's worth of tips on a haircut .
In fairness , only Bowie could wear a white suit and not appear as if he was about to star in a low - budget Tom Wolfe biopic or sell you ice - cream in the foyer afterwards .
Moreover , only Bowie , of all the pop icons in their fifties , could still convince as a Beautiful Boy , with his shaggy hairstyle , trim physique and skinny tie ( worn undone , hanging loose and flapping in the wind of several outbursts of applause from a sycophantic audience who does n't seem to realise that you 're supposed to clap only when something good has happened , and not all the time like mentally deficient seals ) .
Looking at Bowie tonight , I do n't want to hear any more how Liz Hurley got her figure back after one measly pregnancy , when we all know she probably grew that baby in a plant pot in Elton John 's greenhouse .
What I want to know is how Bowie managed not to blow up like a soggy , wrinkled balloon after all those years of excess ?
What , pray , is Dave 's beauty secret ?
Is there a painting of him in his attic looking as decrepit as Mick Jagger ?
Other questions : is that Bono on the balcony , wearing sunglasses in the dark ?
Is that Frank Skinner sitting with a lady friend ?
Have I fallen into celebrity hell ?
Or is this one of those An Audience
With ...
shows where a favoured few get to ask the questions they 've always wanted to , such as : ' David , now that you look back at Tin Machine , do you ever want to place a loaded revolver in your mouth and pull the trigger ? '
Or : ' Dave , hi , could I possibly punch you in the face for making that "" amusing "" , "" ironic "" Nazi salute at the train station all those years ago ? '
This is n't An Audience With _ , however , but a show that Bowie , aided only by his 347-piece band , gets to do it all by himself .
We start with Low , the ' difficult ' late - Seventies album that Bowie gleefully admits his record company hated and was initially reluctant to release .
This bit is great .
I always rather liked Low , the frenzied way it groped for experimental greatness , failing and succeeding ( and popping out of the studio for burgers and drugs ) along the way .
Then , after a short interval for ice - cream ( not , sadly , sold by Dave , and why not ?
Is n't this supposed to be his festival ? )
, there is a run - through of Heathen , his latest work , which has been applauded as a scintillating return to form .
Which it is -
Bowie 's sense of pop melody has regained its depth of pur pose , with songs such as ' Cactus ' , ' I Would Be Your Slave ' and ' Sunday ' .
It is a world away from other occasions I 've watched Bowie perform ( a drum - and - bass extravaganza that brings me out in a stress rash every time I think about it ; and some arty thing , a few years earlier , which featured Dave mincing about with a dance troupe ) .
At the South Bank , highlights include a frisky ' Sound and Vision ' and a plaintive rendition of the Neil Young - penned '
I 've Been Waiting
For You ' .
Negatives ?
Well , there is a bit too much poncing about behind the synth for my liking , complete with Dave 's trademark agonised face - pulling and gritted teeth ( calm down ,
man , you 're playing an instrument , not performing life - saving surgery ) .
Certainly , for the first time in years , Bowie looks as if he is on fire performing his new material , which makes me wonder afresh at some of the Meltdown Festival 's stodgier decisions .
On this kind of form , he could n't have been anxious about the competition , could he ?"
2002-07-30,"Rock legend David Bowie cemented his critical comeback today as he took his place in the shortlist for the Mercury music prize , which is perceived as the "" eclectic album of the year award "" .
He takes his place alongside a string of acclaimed guitar bands and four female solo stars .
One of the acts , Merseyside 's the Coral , found they were on today 's shortlist only a day after their eponymously - titled debut album hit the shops .
Also on the list is 22-year - old Mike Skinner , who goes under the guise of the Streets , and has picked many plaudits for his first release , Original Pirate Material , which draws on numerous dance genres .
Some critics have dubbed it the album of the decade .
PJ Harvey won last year with the album Stories From the City , Stories From the Sea - the first time a female solo act has won the prize .
This year Joanna MacGregor , Ms Dynamite , Beverley Knight and Gemma Hayes fly the flag for female musicians .
Manchester guitar act Doves , who missed out on the prize two years ago , were installed as joint 4 - 1 favourites to win the title by bookmaker William Hill , along with the Streets .
Simon Frith , who chaired the judging panel , said : "" This is the most joyful Mercury shortlist for years , suggesting a sea change at the heart of British music . ""
British artists are seizing the centre stage of contemporary urban music with snap and swagger , while the next generation of guitar bands mine the musical archives with zest and vigour once only the province of DJs .
"" The nominees are : Â· Who I Am - Beverley Knight Â· Sunshine , Hit Me - The Bees Â· The Coral - The Coral Â· Heathen - David Bowie Â· The Last Broadcast - Doves Â· Holes In The Wall - The Electric Soft Parade

2002-07-31,"Bookmakers yesterday nudged the rock legend David Bowie into joint third favourite place for the album of the year , the Mercury Music Prize , in favour of a Birmingham musician born 10 years after Ziggy Stardust made Bowie a superstar .
In contrast to earlier years - when the prize was criticised for favouring white , male , safe artists - the shortlist released yesterday includes six debut albums , young black artists including Roots Manuva , Ms Dynamite and Beverley Knight , and four solo women .
The biggest surprise was the failure of Badly Drawn Boy to make the shortlist , despite the publicity for his soundtrack for the film About a Boy .
Simon Frith , chairman of the panel , said : "" This is the most joyful Mercury shortlist for years , suggesting a sea change at the heart of British music . ""
One of the debut albums , The Coral , by the Merseyside band of the same name , made it into the shops only 24 hours before the list was announced .
The Streets , which William Hill bookmakers made 4 - 1 joint favourite , is by 22-year - old Mike Skinner , of Birmingham , who released his first album last March .
The judges loved it : "" The album articulates what it 's like to be young and British in 2002 .
"" Skinner is joint favourite with the Manchester trio Doves , who made the list with their album The Last Broadcast .
The band was shortlisted for the prize two years ago for Lost Souls .
David Bowie shares the 6 - 1 third favourite odds with Ms Dynamite , for her debut album A Little Deeper .
Not only is 55-year - old Bowie , who has been performing since the 1960s , older than the 21-year - old north Londoner , he is considerably older than her parents .
His album Heathen was hailed by the panel as "" compelling and intriguing . ""
One of the judges , however , insisting on anonymity , said : "" I have n't a clue what the bloody hell it 's doing on the list . ""
The inclusion of young black urban but distinctively British artists such as Roots Manuva - south Londoner Rodney Hylton Smith - is a breakthrough , Nigel Williamson , a music writer and member of the judging panel , said .
"" This is a genuinely British music - not a copycat American sound . ""
The award ceremony will be on September 17 .

2002-08-12,"Â· Music site Dotmusic.com , snapped up for a song by BT from United Business Media , has landed itself in a spot of bother with former writers from industry bible Music Week .
As a legacy of its UBM past , the site features hundreds of pages of content from the trade mag .
These include interviews with the likes of Iggy Pop , David Bowie , the Spice Girls and Ronan Keating .
But when one of the original authors of these interviews looked at the site he noticed that the bylines on all the articles had been changed to one Sarah Davis .
"" I would n't mind so much but it was me who had to resist Geri 's advances , allow Posh to steal my cigarettes and gum , look deep into Iggy 's craggy face and struggle to decipher what Shane McGowan was saying , "" says our intrepid freelance hack , quite reasonably .
Nor does he remember signing away the online rights to UBM in the first place .
Diary wonders how many other writers have had similiar experiences when sites have changed hands during the recent bout of rampant consolidation .
More importantly , was BT trying to bulk its new music site out with content by pretending it was produced by one of its own staff rather than its original authors ?
Â· There 's always the potential for comedy cock - ups when it comes to captioning pictures on the web .
But , mercifully , few sites get it as wrong as Mirror.co.uk did last Thursday when , following Cherie 's miscarriage , it illustrated a sensitive story headlined A Time to Heal for Blairs with a huge picture of some old duffer that we did n't recognise from Adam .
Even worse was the fact that no one noticed the error until late afternoon , when the picture was unceremoniously removed . Â·
Run for the hills .
Red Herring , one of the last remaining "" new economy "" mags in the US , has just made its third round of redundancies this year and could , suggest some , be not much longer for this world .
Diary , for one , hopes that the doomsayers are wrong and that Red Herring does n't go the way of Industry Standard , Business 2.0 UK , Revolution US et al . Â·
Much as those in our smog - infested capital are loath to admit it , but there is a new media industry outside London .
To prove the point , a new trade organisation - Manchester Digital - has been launched to try to persuade northern e - businesses that they do n't have to up sticks and decamp to London at the earliest opportunity .
It is also taking over responsibility for the annual Big Chip awards , which honour e - businesses in the north west , and is appealing for entries .
( See www.bigchipawards.com for more info ) .
Oh , and e - envoy Andrew Pinder is the guest of honour - although Diary is never sure if that is necessarily a good thing . Â·

2002-08-15,"It is as bizarre a musical collaboration as David Bowie 's pairing with Bing Crosby .
On one side is Phil Spector , the legendary but reclusive American producer who invented the Wall of Sound , hit number one with his very first single and was a millionaire by 21 .
On the other are Starsailor , a critically acclaimed indie band from Chorley , whose biggest hit so far reached number 10 in the UK charts .
The quartet lured the infamously eccentric Spector out of two decades of retirement to record two tracks with them .
He is now discussing producing their next album , the follow up to last year 's Love is Here .
Oddly , the producer initiated the venture when he turned up at a Starsailor show in Los Angeles , declaring himself to be a huge fan .
He spent a week working with them last month , although he is so wary of attention that even the band did not know which studio would be used until the first day of the sessions .
Despite his notorious passion for detail - John Lennon claimed that Spector pulled a gun on him - the two sides seem to have got on well .
Spector inspired the Beach Boys and the Beatles with his early 60s hits such as Then He Kissed Me , Be My Baby
, You 've Lost That Loving Feeling and Da Doo Ron Ron .
He described his music as "" a Wagnerian approach to rock'n'roll : little symphonies for the kids "" and created the overwhelming , sumptuous orchestration dubbed the Wall of Sound by layering instrument after instrument , many played by himself .
But many of his songs had a darker side and he ran into controversy when he forced The Crystals to record
He Hit Me (
And It Felt Like A Kiss ) .
Several countries banned the record because of its lyrics .
Spector retreated to his Los Angeles mansion after the Ike and Tina Turner track River Deep and Mountain High , which he considered to be his masterpiece , flopped in the US .
He later worked with the Beatles on their last group and early solo releases but last produced an album , The Ramones ' End Of The Century , in 1980 .
Despite recording odd tracks with Yoko Ono and Eric Clapton he has largely vanished from the public eye .
After a failed attempt to collaborate with Celine Dion , he wrote : "" You do n't tell Shakespeare what plays to write , or how to write them .
You do n't tell Mozart what operas to write , or how to write them .
And you certainly do n't tell Phil Spector what songs to write , or how to write them ; or what records to produce , or how to produce them . """
2002-09-13,"Observing the shaky performances and cosmic gobbledegook that have marred the solo work of his former Stone Roses colleague Ian Brown , John Squire might well have thought he could do a better job .
On the evidence of Time Changes Everything , the guitarist was mistaken .
While Brown 's safety net is an unfakeable charisma , novice vocalist Squire has the voice of a pub singer who has settled on a grim amalgam of David Bowie and Bob Dylan .
The music is small improvement : at best amiable Tom Pettyish country - rock , at worst Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits .
If it were any more middle - of - the - road it would be a traffic island .
Two touching requiems for the Stone Roses , 15 Days and I Miss
You
( "" Remember when we were heroes ? "" ) , are just enough to make Time Changes Everything a diverting curio for diehard completists but , alas , nothing more ."
2002-09-22,"It has been a momentous week for British urban music .
On Tuesday night , 21-year - old Ms Dynamite won the coveted Mercury Music Prize .
As she collected the award at the Grosvenor House hotel , beating hot favourites
The Streets and David Bowie , her delight and surprise were obvious : ' I have n't got a clue how I came to beat David Bowie .
It 's an incredible feeling . '
Twelve months ago , Ms Dynamite was virtually unknown .
Apart from recording a track with notorious garage band So Solid Crew , few people outside the industry had heard of her .
Since Tuesday her win has been hailed as a giant step for British black music , which has long languished in the shadows cast by American stars .
As the media rushed to analyse the significance of her victory , it became clear that Ms Dynamite 's success had altered the musical landscape .
I met Ms Dynamite - aka Niomi McLean - Daley - backstage at the Urban Music Seminar .
It was two weeks before she was to become the first black female and youngest - ever winner of the Mercury Music Prize .
As I waited in a rear hallway for my interview , I stood and watched her as a steady procession of well - wishers and autograph hunters stuck their heads into the dressing - room .
She greeted them all with a hug and a wide , committed smile .
Unlike most female rap stars , I noted - Missy Elliot , Foxy Brown and L'il Kim - Ms Dynamite did n't dress outlandishly in furs , sequinned tops or diamonds .
She wore a plain T - shirt , jogging bottoms and trainers .
Before Ms Dynamite , British hip - hop was n't really ' about ' anything at all .
British rappers , for the most part , have had whimsical names ; wore whimsical clothes and their records have been filled with whimsical claims .
That stereotype was broken , earlier in the summer with the release of Ms Dynamite 's solo debut album , A Little Deeper .
Clocking in at over 70 minutes and 15 tracks the record has made her the hip - hop equivalent of Ella Fitzgerald .
Ms Dynamite 's lyrics are strident ; defiantly female and well - articulated . '
Tell me who wants to know/ What when who where/ Or how you do your ho?/Certainly not
me/
Cause baby
personally/ I like to be challenged
mentally/ I 've heard it all before/ Gangstas pimps and whores/ Quality is poor/ A girl like me needs more ' .
To the casual observer , it may not be immediately obvious why one rapper is considered better than another .
What for instance , distinguishes Eminem from Dr Dre ?
Ms Dynamite says modestly : ' I 'm not much of singer or rapper , really . '
But , like a previous generation of fans who have dissected Bob Dylan 's lyrics and scrutinised the mumbled deliveries by Joe Strummer , rap fans scour hip - hop magazines for arcana , and squabble over the lyrical prowess of artists online .
A Little Deeper addresses urban poverty ( ' When we were young , life was so unjust/
At times I felt it was just us ' ) ; drug addiction ( '
Fuck powder , fuck pills , see me ' ) ; deadbeat fathers ( ' He do n't even know how 2 b honest/ All he know how 2 do is false promise ' ) ; and black - on - black violence .
While her music is undoubtedly modern - sharp , clipped beats and lustrous keyboard tics - her subject matter does have a historical resonance .
Her pseudo - political approach lends the album a dial - an - issue currency , a fact that undoubtedly influenced the Mercury judges .
In the often testosterone - driven world of hip - hop - most rappers unsentimentally compare themselves with basketball players such as Michael Jordan , and their rhymes to three - point shots - females are often relegated to the role of molls or escorts .
Ms Dynamite came into rap music almost by default .
She originally wanted a career as a teacher or a social worker . '
It was something I really wanted to get into ; I love working with children , ' she said .
She grew up in Archway in north London , born to a Jamaican father and Scottish mother .
Her father , Eyon , split from her family when she was two years old .
Her early years , she remembers , were marked by financial hardship , as her mother , a primary schoolteacher , fell ill with cancer .
She was left in charge of three siblings . '
It was a difficult way to grow up .
My mother was ill .
And I felt I was given the responsibility of raising a family .
Suddenly , I became the parent figure . '
She struggled at school for most of her teenage years , although she later achieved three A - levels and nine GCSEs . '
I went to a really multicultural school .
And there were people in my class who were getting straight A grades .
They had tutors after school ; they had tutors at the weekends .
And the teachers paid them lots of attention .
I could n't do that .
I just was n't interested .
It 's not that I did n't want to learn . '
She pauses to chose her words : ' No one ever sat down to take the time to explain things to me .
I think teachers sometimes do n't pay enough attention to the kids that need it .
That was my experience . '
Frustrated , she eventually left home to live in a hostel : she remained close to her mother throughout her absence from home . '
I was living in this grubby little hostel , ' she says . '
It was a horrible place .
And I think I was depressed , because I started to smoke and drink .
I was smoking all the time .
I 'd go to school , come back , and smoke .
I 'd hardly ever leave my room .
I think the experience taught me to be independent .
I was more focused after a while . '
On A Little Deeper , she describes these experiences in devastating detail : ' I 'm the same little girl that grew up next door to you/ Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through/ Hangin ' out all night breakin
my
curfew/ When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues/ Used to spend my time blazin ' lazin ' days
away./
Thought
I was grown left home at 15 did n't want to obey
/ Had to get my act together could n't take the heat . '
She had always been involved in drama and music at school .
And , after turning down the chance to study for a a degree in social anthropology at Sussex University , she turned to music .
She was offered an occasional guest slot on a pirate radio station .
The stint led to an appearance on So Solid Crew 's breakthrough hit '
They Do n't Know ' , and a one - off solo single , ' Booo ! ' .
Released as a precursor to A Little Deeper , and initially leaked to underground dance clubs , ' Booo ! ' introduced Ms Dynamite as a powerful female lyrical constructionist .
The song was an immediate hit .
It had a unique music and vocal delivery that rarely relies on strict metric conventions .
She often pauses when she should n't ; laughs in the middle of a line ; and verbally thinks something through on record .
It gives her music a sense of intimacy and a diarist 's introspection . '
I 'm not technically great , ' she admits . '
Purists probably think I have my faults .
But there are things I want to say .
And by sheer force of will that seems to come over . '
Her narrative skills , all delivered at breath - taking speed , set her apart from other , more demure , female black British vocalists such as Des'ree and Gabrielle .
It also causes problems : ' Do n't you know there 's no such thing as superstars?/
We leave this world alone . '
' I witness a lot of ignorance in the music industry .
In music , if artists are black women , record companies are more ruthless .
As an ethnic , urban or black music artist , I think record companies across the board , can be patronising .
They say , "" We 'll agree with you now , but when you get to it , we 're going to change you "" .
That 's how the industry works .
I hear things like ""
Wow !
You went to school
and you 're very intelligent "" .
I 'd never think Atomic Kitten , or whatever , were being asked those questions .
I do n't get mad at those people -
it 's just that they 're bombarded with stereotypes . '
While most rap is undoubtedly concerned with themes of avarice , as a recent record by the American star Jay - Z put it simply when he boasted : ' What y' all about to witness is big business , kid '
, Ms Dynamite gives the impression that hip - hop is merely a stepping stone .
On her album , she raps : ' Now who gives a damn/ About the ice [ diamond ] on your hand?/
If it 's not too complex/ Tell me how many Africans died/
For the buggettes on your Rolex . '
Talking about her rapid rise she admits : ' For me to come from what I 've come from in such a short space of time , and get that kind of recognition , is a real big thing for me .
But kids , young people just saying "" I wanna be an MC , you 've inspired me "" , that is what keeps me doing what I 'm doing .
That 's my reward .
Money ca n't buy that .
Children are the future , and I 'd like to work with them . '
Her broad appeal is undeniable .
This year she has enjoyed a brace of Top 10 singles and seen her album sell almost 150,000 copies in the UK alone .
At the Urban Music Seminar , 12,000 paying customers , most of them teenagers , debated the fortunes of black British music with the industry 's leading lights at the event , held at the Royal Festival Hall on London 's South Bank .
For the most part , the audience and the panellists ( the speakers included well - known British luminaries such as Radio 1 's Tim Westwood , members of the So Solid Crew , and Mercury Prize nominated rapper Roots Manuva ) burdened themselves with the conventional issues that dictate any debate on urban music .
Is black British music becoming too American ?
Are the So Solid Crew adequate role models ?
Is ' speed garage ' dead ?
On the second day of the event , however , the questions from those attending took a delightful turn .
During a session on ' how to succeed in the music industry ' , a slightly overweight girl with heavy - rimmed glasses took the microphone and directed her question at Ms Dynamite . '
I really want to get into the music industry , ' she said . '
But I know I 'm considered too ugly .
Is there any hope for people like me ? ' '
You 're beautiful , ' she replied . '
Do n't let anyone tell you otherwise .
There is a problem with the music industry , where labels dictate what female artists should look like .
But look at me : I 'm not particularly good looking .
I hate the size of my arse .
So do n't let anyone tell you that you 're not pretty . '
She proceeded to invite the girl onstage where the duo shared a hug .
Niomi McLean - Daley 's honesty , I thought , was indicative of the frank Ms Dynamite persona she projects in her music and in her videos .
She is , perhaps , the most autobiographical rapper ever to have emerged from the ranks of British hip - hop . '
You have to be honest , ' she told me . '
People see you as a role model .
It 's important that you respect that .
You have to be able to relate to people .
After all , they 're the people who put me here . '
She blushed as she often does , perhaps embarrassed by her own honesty in front of strangers , and concluded by talking about October 's Black History Month
: she often returns to the importance of education in her interviews .
I proposed she chose her own black heroes , luminaries whose history she would have appreciated during her schooldays .
Her response , delivered in her usually candid manner , could have arrived from any one of her records : ' I think we should have a black history year , ' she pronounced . '
And an Asian one .
And an Aborigine one .
Whatever ... to me , the key for getting over racism is to learn about other cultures .
When I was at school , we did only one week of black history .
And there was another thing ; when we learned about the Holocaust , we went into all the details .
When it came to black history , I was told I was a slave .
I was never told that black people contributed anything important to the earth .
I was never told about the ancient Egyptians and the pyramids .
That was it .
It gives you a sense of inferiority : and it meant I had to learn for myself .
It also means that people do n't really get to know about different cultures . '
She worked her way carefully through her list , agonising over each choice . '
I 'd have to pick Nelson Mandela , because he 's someone who made history and is still alive .
I would have to choose someone who was important as a scientist .
I think that 's very important .
You do n't get to see a lot of black scientists , especially in this day and age .
I was n't told of any when I was at school .
And I think lots of black kids would want to be scientists , but they never get examples of someone who has done it before .
I think of Malcolm X in some ways , because of the whole civil rights movement .
Martin Luther King , I think , stood for compromising .
So for me , personally , I 'm more like a Malcolm than a Martin .
And Rosa Parks .
Because she was a woman , and she was strong - minded and stuck to her guns . '
She smiles , and with a handshake , Ms Dynamite was off next door for a photo shoot .
As I milled around the corridor , catching the last guests and autograph hunters , I spotted the young girl who had broken down on stage earlier .
Her eyes were still puffy from meeting her role model . '
I met her , ' she was telling her friends . '
And she was nice . '
She grinned from ear - to - ear : '
I 'm going to do it .
I 'm going to go for an audition . '"
2002-09-23,"Michael Parkinson 's long - running chat show has crashed in the ratings just a week after he lambasted his fellow TV entertainers as "" cheap and silly "" .
At one stage the veteran presenter 's interview with Tom Hanks on Saturday night had fewer viewers than low - budget Brit flick East is East on Channel 4 .
His chat show , the first in a new series , averaged just 3.6 million viewers , less than a quarter of the audience , despite A - list guests in the shape of Hanks and David Bowie .
The audience only crawled above the 4 million mark when Bowie , enjoying an unexpected renaissance in his career , appeared in the second half of the show .
Parkinson was beaten by the news on ITV and had only 200,000 viewers more than Des Lynam 's The Premiership .
The audience was a fraction of the 8.7 million viewers who tuned in for the opening show of last year 's series , although the audience was boosted by an appearance by David and Victoria Beckham .
However , even with guests including Elle MacPherson and Jim Davidson , Parkinson still managed 7.1 million viewers last October - twice Saturday night 's audience .
In an interview last week Parkinson said he was "" totally in despair "" about the state of today 's TV , and criticised the new generation of chat show hosts , such as Johnny Vaughan and Graham Norton , saying : "" It 's folly to believe you can give that kind of job to anybody . ""
His performance capped an unhappy night for BBC1 's Saturday light entertainment slate , which began with a lacklustre 3 million viewers for Ulrika Jonssons ' Dog Eat Dog , and 4 million for The Chair , hosted by John McEnroe .
ITV1 had the better of BBC1 for most of the night , with its ageing hat - trick of ratings winners , Play Your Cards Right , Stars in their Eyes , and a celebrity edition of Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? .
However , Popstars : the Rivals lost a million viewers week - on - week , down to 6.4 million , a third of the audience .
And the channel squeezed the life out of
I 'm A Celebrity ...
Get Me Out of Here ! , which managed 5.6 million , nearly three in 10 viewers at 8.15pm .
On BBC2 , the much - hyped documentary Dancer 's Body , using high - tech gimmicks to explore inside a dancer 's body , could only muster 1.5 million - a 7 % share .
But the channel scored later in the evening thanks to the enduring appeal of Dad 's Army .
A documentary about the classic sitcom was watched by 2.4 million , while a dusted off episode at 10.45pm still managed 1.9 million - around one in eight viewers - at 10.45pm ."
2002-09-27,"David Byrne is the bionic Renaissance man who can do no wrong : there is his Luaka Bop label , collaborations such as Lazy , with Xpress 2 , his books and a flourishing solo career .
His books and movies have the same humour and skewed observation you find in his songs ; he 's speedier and more streamlined than Peter Gabriel , while operating a quality control that most middle - aged rockers ( Paul Weller , David Bowie etc ) lack .
Two new Byrne compilations maintain the standard : The Only Blip Hop Record You Will Ever Need Vol 1 and Cuisine Non - Stop ( Luaka Bop ) .
The former is a collection of electronic music , "" true world music "" as Byrne notes , made "" primarily by Northern Europeans ... accustomed to a monotonous diet and sporadic social contact "" whose bleak lives are leavened by football , discos ... and now laptop funk .
Cuisine Non - Stop examines what might be described as nu - chanson .
These off - kilter French - language songs absorb and re - channel traditional performance modes - florid lyrics , guttural voices , rumpty - tumpty rhythms - pitting them against more contemporary sounds and sonic attitudes .
On BrÃ»lez la MÃ¨che ( Light
The Fuse ) by Lo'Jo , the backing vocals of Nadia and Yamina Nid El Mourid chant gutsily over a sneaky feel , while fiddle and accordion fill the gaps .
Arthur H turns the dubby , hypnotic seven - beat pulse and opaque words of NaÃ¯ve Derviche into a passionate , perverse epic :
C'est comme Ã§a / Que l'on marche droit / Dans cette vie / A l'envers .
( That 's exactly how / One walks there straight /
In this life/ backwards ) .

Despite its grand title , Danny Rampling 's album Turntable Symphony ( React ) is not some magnum opus featuring an orchestra but yet another compilation , of anonymous feelgood dance tracks , each running expertly into the next .

Nordic Nights :

Terje Rypdal , Groupa , Varttina and Ketil Bjornstad make appearances ; even Kimmo Pohjonen , the wild Finnish accordionist , sounds suitably house - trained in this company .

2002-09-27,"Between March 1971 , when Hot Love boomed to the top of the UK charts , and the release of the compilation Great Hits in November 1973 , Marc Bolan was the prancing , strutting face of glam rock .
With his top hat , bacofoil suits and eyeliner , Bolan had just as much claim as his pal David Bowie to be called the Prettiest Star .
Bolan had even played guitar on Bowie 's recording of that very song in 1970 .
"" People are really works of art , and if you have a nice face you might as well play about with it , "" said ex - model Bolan winsomely , understanding better than anyone the combustible effects you could create with a bit of pouting androgyny , some thrift - shop tat and a sprinkling of glittery guitar riffs .
Universal 's four - disc set Marc Bolan and T Rex - 20th Century Superstar
( * * * * ) represents the first credible attempt to tell the full Bolan story .
It runs through the whole of the Hackney - born artist 's life , from his childhood skiffle group through mystical folk and psychedelic gibberish to the boiled - down , raunched - up formula of T Rex in "" electric warrior "" mode .
The collection scores full marks for thoroughness , and has even managed to hunt down two tracks Bolan recorded during a fleeting stint with John 's Children : Midsummer Night 's Scene and Sara Crazy Child ( a copy of the original single is now worth Â£ 3,000 , apparently ) .
But there 's a daunting heap of whimsical fairy - land nonsense and idiotic eastern - flavoured piffle to struggle through before you get to the bits you 're likely to remember .
It is n't until disc three that we find T Rex getting into their rampant hit - making stride with Jeepster , Telegram Sam , Metal Guru and the rest , with Bolan 's trademark bark - and - warble vocals in full spate .
But I suppose there is a seam of hilarity to be mined from hearing the 17-year - old Bolan , originally christened Mark Feld but temporarily calling himself Toby Tyler , strumming folkishly through Dylan 's Blowin ' in the Wind and a thing called The Road
I 'm
On ( Gloria ) , tooting coyly into a harmonica and sounding like an even limper version of the execrable Donovan .
And before we advance to the hippy heyday of the original T. Rex , there 's Bolan quavering uneasily through the bogus American pop of Beyond the Risin ' Sun or the spurious Doug Sahm - isms of The Third Degree .
As for the original Rex combo , it 's amazing to consider the reverence in which their Hobbit - like twitterings were held .
Songs such as Salamanda Palaganda or Once Upon the Seas of Abyssinia would seem , with hindsight , more deserving of demolition by surgical air strike than of acid - addled adoration .
Hence , the pop hits come as a blessed relief .
The band 's bubblegum funkiness bounces undimmed through Get It
On or Twentieth Century Boy ; certainly it was nifty enough for the Stones to steal it for
It 's Only Rock'n'Roll , and for Prince to cash in on with Cream .
On disc four , the likes of I Love to Boogie or Dandy in the Underworld suggest that even if the mid-1970s Bolan could n't quite reclaim his megastar crown , he had not forgotten how to manufacture a serviceable pop hook .
If you want to skip the history lesson and cut straight to the poptastic Bolan , you might consider Universal Music TV 's The Essential Marc Bolan and T.Rex
( *
* * * ) , a 24-song collection of Bolan blockbusters with an additional DVD of performances from his 1970s TV series , Marc .
Possibly all you 'll ever need .
Habitually hailed as the pinnacle of Dusty Springfield 's career ( even if she claimed she could never understand what all the fuss was about ) and a 1960s white - soul landmark , Dusty in Memphis sparkles afresh in a new deluxe edition from Mercury (
* *
* * * ) .
It is still astonishing that the notoriously insecure artist was ever able to command such knowingness and controlled emotional intimacy - not to mention grandeur - in these performances .
Son of a Preacher Man is by the far the best - known track , but its stately tempo , rousing brass fanfares and gospel - inflected backing chorus from the Sweet Inspirations are only part of the widescreen sound - panorama expertly assembled by the unbeatable production trio of Jerry Wexler , Arif Mardin and Tom Dowd .
Each contributes a memoir to the accompanying booklet , with Wexler claiming that Springfield was so fraught that "" I never got a note out of her throughout the entire Memphis sessions "" , and that her vocals had to be recorded subsequently in New York .
Perhaps it should have been called Dusty in Manhattan .
The chemistry between the personalities involved and the inspired choice of songs resonates as powerfully today as it did in 1969 , although British buyers initially missed the point - bizarrely , it was the first Dusty album that failed to chart in the UK .
A glance through the songwriting credits suggests this was always destined to be something special , with Randy Newman 's Just One Smile and
I Do n't Want to Hear
It Anymore jostling alongside
Carole King 's bittersweet No Easy Way Down and So Much Love .
Arif Mardin reckons he wrote "" a string quartet in the style of Ravel "" as a framework for Burt Bacharach 's In the Land of Make Believe , while Dowd and Mardin explain how they conspired to customise Michel Legrand 's billowingly Gallic Windmills of Your Mind to help Dusty 's phrasing .
This reissue also includes mono mixes of eight of the original tracks , as a reminder of what audio used to be .
It 's a priceless fragment of history .
Mod - era hardliners who have grown accustomed to the cheap thrill of hearing the early Who in rattling , crackling mono might have mixed feelings about Polydor 's deluxe edition of My Generation ( * * * ) , with its newfangled stereo remixes .
First released on the Brunswick label in 1965 , the Who 's debut album was originally designed as a collection of Motown and R&amp;B cover versions , but Pete Townshend 's songwriting was developing at such a pace that the blueprint was modified to accommodate a newly penned batch of his songs .
Due to a contractual dispute with American producer Shel Talmy , My Generation has been unavailable in the UK since the 1960s , apart from a limited appearance on vinyl in 1980 from Virgin .
But now a settlement has been reached , and Talmy has remastered both the original album and an extra 18 tracks that were shelved first time around .
The latter are mostly covers , including loud yet funky rampages through Daddy Rolling Stone and James Brown 's Shout and Shimmy .
However , completists will be agog at the inclusion of Townshend 's previously unissued Instant Party Mixture and an alternate version of Anyway
Anyhow Anywhere .
Brighter and cleaner though the stereo mixes are , something of the Who 's original scouring assault has gone missing in action .
That said , the bass guitar barrage from the late John Entwistle on the instrumental , The Ox , could saw through a double - decker bus .
Judging by internet postings , fan reactions are mixed .
"" You 've got ta be nuts not to rock to this great music , "" says one .
"" My first four Beatles albums on disc in stereo were a thousand times more of a treat than this letdown , "" argues another .
Ah , give it time ."
2002-11-05,"Suede 's Brett Anderson has always admitted his debt to David Bowie , but has often appeared to take homage to the Thin White Duke a little too literally .
Bowie professed his bisexuality in 1974 ; when Suede started Anderson claimed to be a "" bisexual who 's never had a homosexual experience "" .
Bowie ended up addicted to cocaine , Anderson to crack cocaine ; it is as if the kid from the suburbs had taken Bowie 's Aladdin Sane era cry of "" Crack , baby , crack ! "" as a pharmaceutical instruction .
Three years on from the depths of his addiction , Anderson is not only clean , but reinventing himself as a singing , dancing and actually highly camp icon .
He waggles his bottom outrageously , uses the microphone stand as a phallic extension and does things with his arms usually associated with wind power and Pop Idol formation dancing .
You can almost hear older Suede fans thinking : "" This is Brett Anderson ? ! ""
Perhaps Anderson has realised that his health and happiness are more important than becoming a lad insane .
Opening song
Simon reeks of Bowie 's early-1970s aftershave , but Anderson seems at ease with himself and all the better for it .
The career pressure may be on ( A New Morning , Suede 's much - vaunted drug - free "" positivity "" album , stalled at 24 ) , but he does n't show it , grinning his way through a succession of perfectly executed moves .
Anderson 's athletic performance is a spectacle , even a miracle , but , worryingly , he 's carrying the band .
With Bernard Butler long gone , Neil Codling now departed and guitarist Richard Oakes still looking like the young hopeful who won a competition to join Suede , the singer desperately needs a foil .
It takes all Anderson 's best mic - twirling efforts to get the band through lumbering efforts such as Roxy Music pastiche Streetlife , and the set is disturbingly high - paced , as if designed to cast off the old , morose , drug - fixated Anderson .
During old favourite
So Young , he does n't sing the narcotic line
"" Let 's chase the dragon "" , letting the crowd do the dirty work .
In general , early songs such as Metal Mickey and Animal Nitrate trounce the later ones , but new tunes Obsessions and Oceans emerge as the best songs of the night .
The latter , a dissection of a stagnating relationship , is sung with real conviction .
A transitional period for Suede , but perhaps the real Brett Anderson is n't such a bad bloke after all . Â·

2002-11-30,"Rock'n'Roll Suicide by PP Hartnett 306pp , Sceptre , Â£ 14.99 PP Hartnett , formerly a clublife photographer ,
does n't mess about when it comes to research .
For Sixteen , his third novel , he wrote to a dozen convicted sex offenders to find out about their methods and mindsets .
For this latest novel , about a suicidal rock idol , Max , who is modelled more on the likes of Richey Edwards and David Bowie than Will or Gareth , Hartnett placed ads in the music press asking hardcore fans to get in touch .
He hung around in ticket queues for gigs in Harajuku , San Francisco and Leeds , talking to the ones who were drooling and twitching .
And in case any obsessives had slipped through the net , Hartnett somehow managed to persuade several official fan clubs to hand over letters that had been written to celebrities - about 3,000 in all .
That 's a lot of "" Yours 4 ever "" and "" I swear I 'll kill myself if you do n't write back "" - laughable perhaps in small doses , unbearable in bulk .
Is it possible to wade through such a flood of angst and stay sane enough to put together a coherent novel ?
Certainly Hartnett has captured the masochistic intensity of adolescent idol - worship - to the point where it has infected his own writing .
Far too much of his narrative is as painfully overwrought as the most excessive fan gushes ( and the worst Manic Street Preachers lyrics ) .
"" Bad thoughts which drive to overwhelming misery , deep brooding sadness , approach stealthily , almost unperceived , active like a virus . ""
At times this lack of restraint leads him into agonising clangers : "" Passing over the roadie 's ceramic teeth was a tongue that would help the man form a single word . ""
At others it just sounds amateurish : "" The cat 's eyes kind of went Boiiing . ""
After a few of these infelicities ( and those are just the start ) , you find yourself yearning for the spare energy of punk .
But without romanticism , this would have been a very short book .
Everything about it is deeply romantic - from the extreme beauty of the loved one , which sends the gazer mad , to the powerful attraction of easeful death , felt by Max and by his equally troubled megafan Angela , with whom he spends a lost weekend .
Here there is purple suede , white silk and black leather .
There are fallacies so pathetic you want to kick them in the teeth : "" With deliberate precision , a black cloud placed itself in front of the sun .
"" There are last - ditch letters and sensual midnight swims , described in florid detail .
There is , crucially , the subsuming of self - in nature , in another , in death .
It would just about work if Hartnett had given Max and Angela the sort of intense , yet - still - thou - haunt'st - me relationship that could carry the overblown writing .
But Hartnett is clear on one point : idol and fan can never really know one another .
Each star is an island entire of himself , so Max 's interaction with Angela is stilted , impersonal , strained by his need to keep things "" normal "" during his few days away from his crazy celebrity world .
While we gaze deep beneath his super - cool manufactured image to the tortured Morrissey beneath , poor Angela hardly gets past making him a sandwich .
That is a courageous move on Hartnett 's part ; he could so easily have cashed in his plot cards and matched up his two lost souls in a satisfying structural symmetry .
( It 's also probably more true to life ; all those unread fan letters must have left him feeling pretty cynical . )
As it is , though , the lack of human feeling that topples the rock god
Max also leaves a hollow at the heart of the book .
This is a romantic novel without a romance , and no amount of glam and adverbs can make up the gap ."
2002-12-01,"The direction of pop music has always been shaped by chance meetings : Paul McCartney swapping chords with John Lennon at a school fÃªte ;
Paul Simon hearing Art Garfunkel singing , eyes heavenward , in morning assembly ; David Bowie locking himself in a bedroom with Lou Reed .
A footnote to this history of cultural fusion , you could say , occurred one afternoon on a local bus in Co Mayo , Ireland , in 1975 .
It was there that Louis Walsh found himself sitting next to Johnny Logan .
Walsh , then aged 20 , was the second of nine children from Kiltimagh , Ireland 's ' original hick town ' .
He had educated himself with Radio Luxembourg and fallen in love with the voices of Wilson Pickett and the Beach Boys , the only other music in the house being his father 's The King and I and Carousel LPs .
An avid viewer of television 's New Faces , he harboured dreams of becoming Mickie Most , shaggy - permed ' brains ' behind Suzi Quatro .
Logan , for his part , was then appearing in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , evenings and matinÃ©es , in Co Kildare .
Somehow , in him , Walsh saw a golden future .
After the ' usual lawsuits ' with Logan 's then manager , Walsh took over the singer 's career and rarely looked back .
He moved to Dublin and became involved on the circuit of show bands - cabaret acts that gave a homegrown twist to American and English pop .
He still talks with some reverence of ' Joe Dolan and Dickie Rock , Ireland 's answers to Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck ' .
Albert Reynolds , later Taoiseach , used to run many of Dublin 's dance halls in those days and Walsh learnt his trade cleaning , making tea and selling tickets .
Walsh 's aim , then as now , however , was cracking the British top 10 and the easiest route to that goal in Ireland , at that time , was the Eurovision Song Contest .
After a few years of nurturing , Johnny Logan won the title in 1980 with his soupy ballad , ' What 's Another Year ' , and gave his manager his first taste of success . '
The record was number one in 10 countries , ' Walsh recalls , over lunch at Dublin 's flash Four Seasons hotel . '
But even though he won it again in 1987 he did not want to be the pop star that I wanted him to be .
I still see Johnny at the airport , coming back from little gigs in Germany with his guitar .
If I 'd have known then what I know now , ' Walsh adds , a little wistfully , ' he could have been Julio Iglesias . '
What Walsh knows now is the full repertoire of cynical skills required to produce commercial pop music .
He can , and does , count these qualities on the fingers of one hand . '
First rule of pop : do n't believe your own hype .
Second rule of pop : do n't believe your own hype .
Third rule of pop
: it 's a fickle business .
Fourth rule of pop : do n't look for credibility .
Fifth rule of pop : resist the urge to write your own songs . '
He can point to the string of number one singles and 15 million album sales from his manufactured bands , Boyzone and Westlife , to prove the effectiveness of this formula ; and has added both teen star Samantha Mumba and ' the greatest female voice in pop ' , Lulu , to his client list .
For the past couple of months , Walsh has been parading his skills alongside Pete Waterman and Geri Halliwell as a judge in ITV 's Popstars : The Rivals .
Last night , the final girl from thousands of hopefuls was eliminated and his group Girls Aloud was born , eyeing the Christmas number one slot in competition with Waterman 's boy band .
Walsh suggests he was a reluctant recruit to reality television , but that now he has got the taste for it .
( Appositely , he admits to falling asleep the night before we meet watching Celebrity Big Brother , and having Les Dennis 's thoughts on voyeurism invade his dreams . )
In the way of these things , to the eight million viewers of Popstars , Walsh is seen as the good guy in his ' strop rivals ' tiffs with Waterman .
These things are relative , however .
It would probably be fair to say that in his professional life , Walsh is not overly troubled by questions of fine scruple . '
Who do you want me to slag off ? '
he inquires , chirpily as we sit down . '
I 'll do anyone you want ... '
In the absence of direction from me , he restricts himself to obvious targets : Robbie Williams , ' a jumped - up karaoke singer , the biggest con - artist of all time ' , and Kylie Minogue , whom he characterises , slightly unfortunately , ' as having just a great ass and a massively powerful machine behind her ... '
Most of Walsh 's cheerful vitriol , though , is reserved for Waterman , another hero of his youth .
When I point out that his fellow judge recently described him in the press , with typical aplomb , as ' a fucking liar and a cheat ' , Walsh takes delight in suggesting that Waterman , in turn , is very likely to ' fuck things up with his band because , you see , he is not used to working with good singers _
this is the man who brought us Jason , Kylie and no end of shite ' - and then to suggest that , anyway , his rival ' is a bit old and tired now , desperately clinging to his last chance at fame ' .
Having got this off his chest , he admits , too , that there is a good deal of pantomime in the posturing : ' Pete is the dame , ' he says , ' and I am the grinning Irish leprechaun . '
Walsh is rather Brian Epstein as if conceived by Flann O'Brien ; a likable and absurd hustler .
He has come close to what many pop Svengalis have attempted : worked out a way of producing risk - free hits .
It costs at least a million pounds , he points out , to launch a new band .
Doing it with the help of Popstars takes the chance out of it .
But it takes the life out of it , too ? '
The danger , ' Walsh concedes , ' is that the girls in my band will have done nothing in their lives but want to be famous .
They will be household names without ever going up and down the M1 in an old van or finding out what it 's like not to be paid or booed off stage . '
Still , it seems , the safeness , the in - built focus group of this project is a large part of the thrill for him .
Walsh is happy to explain why ideal pop songs are really the bland leading the bland : ' Michael Owen would be the perfect pop star for me .
He 's no trouble .
He would n't marry a Spice Girl .
You have no idea what his house is like .
He could walk into Westlife tomorrow . '
How about Roy Keane ? '
No , I could n't control him .
I love him .
But I could n't control him . '
Walsh 's control extends into all areas of his singers ' - ' shite , I almost called them artists ' - lives .
To appeal to their pre - pubescent fanbase , boy bands , the theory goes , must exist in a state of perpetual adolescence .
How easy has he found it to curb the instincts of his young men ? '
Well , they let off steam , of course , ' he says . '
But I make sure my bands do it behind closed doors in hotels .
If they misbehave in the Met Bar they deserve to be in the papers .
If they are caught doing drugs , they deserve to be in the papers .
And I would n't want them in the band . '
In the past , he says , he used to have to make these rules clear , but increasingly , he hardly feels that is necessary .
The kids he sees these days seem to approach their profession with all the anarchic recklessness of trainee accountants . '
They 've watched Westlife and the rest
and they know that what is at stake is too great to risk . '
In the absence of genuine scandal , Walsh feeds ' stories ' to the tabloids .
He helped Boyzone 's Stephen Gately , for example , to lie about his homosexuality for several years .
Did he know he was gay when he selected him ? '
No , ' he says . '
Had I known , I would have had a problem with it because of the way the music business is .
And when I found out , I tried to cover it up for ages .
We used to put him with girls , any girls in pictures .
I 'd put him on Ruby Wax 's lap and there was a story about him going out with Ruby Wax .
We did him with Mandy Smith , too . '
Did n't that make him feel particularly , well , uncomfortable ? '
Not really .
It got him some borrowed time . '
But when Gately came out , even the Sun supported him .
So Walsh would n't have any difficulty with choosing a gay band member now ? '
Well , not so much probably ... '
As with all consumer goods , obsolescence is built into Walsh 's products .
However carefully he manages the talents of Girls Aloud , he imagines there is ' a shelf - life of two or three years possibly , if they are extremely lucky , but then I would say that one of them , Nadine Coyle [ who he has rather fancifully likened to Whitney Houston ] has a shot at a career much longer than that . '
He is equally frank about the abilities of his groups ; he describes Boyzone as ' Ronan , Stephen and three Ringo Starrs ' , and talks about other performers as ' puppets ' in relation to their producers and managers .
The interests of himself and his charges overlap in two ways .
First , he claims , there is the music . '
I mean I really like Westlife 's music .
Really honestly I do .
Truly , honestly .
Really , truly .
I mean they could be the Bee Gees in 20 years ' time ... '
And second , of course , they have a shared interest in money .
Walsh has just bought a new London apartment in the exclusive Yoo building , as well as a private island off the west coast of Ireland , and yesterday added a Bentley to his Rolls - Royce .
He collects art and would love , he says , to have a couple of Warhols .
Money , he claims , though , a couple of times , is only a very minor consideration .
Still , it is also , you guess , the one element of the rock and roll lifestyle he and his bands are most reluctant to renounce ."
2003-01-12,"Moonage Daydream : The Life and Times of Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie and Mick Rock Genesis Â£ 295 , pp346 ' For me
, the Seventies were the start of the twenty - first century , ' writes David Bowie in his introduction to Moonage Daydream , an extravagant coffee - table book that collects Mick Rock 's photographs of the chameleon rock star as Ziggy Stardust , his first , and arguably most successful , artistic alter ego .
Bowie became Ziggy in 1972 , melding the sci - fi futurism of writers like William Burroughs and JG Ballard with a hard - rock sound and a transsexual campery borrowed from Lou Reed .
In a moment of utter reinvention , the erstwhile mime artist and folkie swept aside the hippie trappings that had defined rock music since the mid - Sixties , and underwent the first of many persona changes whose collective impact still resounds 30 years later .
Bowie was Britain 's first postmodern pop star , a man who hid behind image after image and who challenged all the notions of ' authenticity ' that had held sway ever since English white boys with guitars had somehow discovered an affinity with black blues music .
Bowie as Ziggy was an attempt , conscious or otherwise , to make music look and sound not just futuristic but alien .
It was the shock of the new , writ large in 6 in platform shoes , body suits and anorexic cheekbones .
And it was unapologetically white music , fired by cocaine rather than weed or hallucinogenics and echoing all manner of strange precedents , from American rocker Gene Vincent to English oddball Anthony Newley .
Bowie was nothing if not a disseminator : of styles , sounds , ideas .
Everything he borrowed , though , he transcended .
Like previous big , boxed , photo - heavy books on the Stones and the Who , Moonage Daydream is being marketed as an artefact - a limited edition of 2,500 , each signed by Rock and Bowie , costing a cool Â£ 295 - by Genesis , which has sussed that the Mojo generation has loads of expendable dosh to throw away - or invest - on created collectables .
If there is nothing here that really justifies the price , there is more than enough for both the casual Bowie fan and the obsessive .
These photographs trace the birth of one of the biggest , most influential pop ideas ever : the notion that a pop performer could , on record as well as on stage , reinvent himself creatively by inhabiting various personas .
Ziggy preceded other Bowie alter egos such as Aladdin Sane ( who made the 1973 album of the same name ) , and the Thin White Duke ( who made the icy Station to Station in 1976 and then rented space in pre - unified Berlin to record Low and Heroes in 1977 ) .
In between , Bowie found time to produce Iggy Pop 's extraordinary return to form , The Idiot ; star in The Man
Who Fell to Earth , a celluloid version of his stage self ; and indulge in a provocative , but brief , flirtation with fascism .
This book is all about Ziggy , though .
Early on , between photos of Bowie as a fledgling Martian , the man himself pinpoints his major influences : Stanley Kubrick and , wait for it , Professor George Steiner . '
Steiner had nailed the sexy term postculture , ' writes Bowie , ' and it seemed a jolly good idea to join up the dots for rock . '
Kubrick , though , as the singer points out , had already provided the map reference points . '
It was Kubrick 's doing on the whole ...
2001 and A Clockwork Orange ... who pulled together all the unarticulated loose ends of the past five years into a desire of unstoppable momentum .
Both these films provoked one major theme : there was no linear line in the lives that we lead .
We were not evolving , merely surviving .
Moreover , the clothes were fab . '
Likewise , of course , Bowie 's own sartorial take on futurism , which was implemented by one Freddie Burrett , a singular fashion designer who traded under the name Burretti .
His partner , Daniella Parmar , was , as Bowie recalls , ' the first girl I had seen with peroxide white hair with cartoon images cut and dyed into the back ' .
She became the template for Bowie 's own experimentation .
Out of this melange of half - baked ideas , sci - fi theories and full - blown sartorial exploration , the teetering figure of Ziggy Stardust emerged , skeletal , androgynous and iconoclastic .
He conquered England , Europe and , against all odds , America , where Bowie , for a while , was the biggest Britpop export since the Beatles .
It is hard to imagine that happening now .
On stage , in a figure - hugging white jumpsuit , Mick Rock freeze - frames Bowie going down on Mick Ronson 's guitar : male - to - male fellatio , cross - dressing and ear - splitting , apocalyptic rock a full three decades before Marilyn Manson .
Bowie famously retired Ziggy at the Hammersmith Odeon show on 3 July 1973 .
Rock 's images capture the audience melodrama of that heady time , counterpointing it with some almost serene backstage images of Bowie , a man already preoccupied with where he was going next .
( At an aftershow party in the CafÃ© Royal , Bowie sits flanked by a smiling Mick Jagger and Lou Reed , both of whose mantles he had successfully stolen in the previous year . )
In Fred and Judy Vermorel 's prescient mid - Eighties book , Starlust : the Secret Fantasies of Fans , Julie , a 25-year - old Bowie obsessive , wrote : ' When he killed off Ziggy , that really disturbed me ...
I was crying a lot , and everybody was crying ...
the sweat and the smell was really horrible ...
people were sweating and others were wanking themselves off ...
I had to keep watching him ...
I went home sort of shocked ...
it 's a terrible thing he did really . '
That was Ziggy mania in all its intensity , part utter identification , part sexual desperation ..
It is a world away from today 's manufactured ( pre-)teen hysteria .
In this big , overpriced book you can glimpse the madness and devotion that Bowie as Ziggy inspired .
For all its futuristic trappings , though , it looks like an impossibly distant time and place .
It looks like another planet ."
2003-02-05,"Mikhail Gorbachev and Bill Clinton are about to follow in the footsteps of Dame Edna Everage , Boris Karloff and David Bowie as they narrate a new recording of Sergei Prokofiev 's Peter and the Wolf .
The last leader of the Soviet Union will join the former US president in a special performance of Prokofiev 's work by the Russian National Orchestra under the command of the Grammy - winning conductor Kent Nagano .
The recording will be Mr Gorbachev 's English language debut .
"" We chose former politicians , who have a great ability to communicate , "" Nagano said , in an answer that may seem odd to Russians ; when in power Mr Gorbachev was derided for his provincial accent and long , indecipherable sentences .
Sophia Loren joins the two former leaders for the performance of Prokofiev 's tale and a newly written piece , The Wolf and Peter by the French composer Jean - Pascal Beintus , which tells the tale from wolf 's side .
"" We thought it would be interesting to see the story from the point of view of the wolf , "" Nagano said .
"" He 's in the forest but the forest is disappearing , urbanisation is cutting the trees away ...
and we see why the wolf is so desperate .
"" The new version especially appealed to Mr Gorbachev because of its environmental side .
He is donating his fee for the performance to Green Cross International , the environmental organisation he founded in 1993 .
Mr Clinton is donating his fee to the International Aids Trust , whose advisory committee he chairs with Nelson Mandela .

2003-02-18,"Peter Hammill is the great British idiosyncratic vocalist 's favourite idiosyncratic vocalist , feted by David Bowie , Johnny Rotten , Thom Yorke and the Fall 's Mark E Smith .
The attraction is obvious .
Hammill 's career has seen him relentlessly confront the uncomfortable truth about humanity , and , although he has never enjoyed great commercial success , he has never compromised himself .
His favourite themes - futility , time , personal inadequacy and death ( and those are the cheery ones ) - would make Leonard Cohen sound like Jimmy Osmond .
His voice , a howl of hurt and outrage , is an acquired taste but , as the chap in front of me comments : "" Once he 's got you , he 's got you for life . ""
Hammill 's fan base is committed : some fans remain from his early 1970s days in prog - rock outfit Van der Graaf Generator ; others are fresh - faced converts keen to glimpse the man in fearsome form .
Hammill dissects his favourite themes unforgivingly , and his music shifts around them .
He has dabbled with prog - rock and drum machines , and is currently joined by an electric violinist , Stuart Gordon , whose John Cale - ish dramatic swoops are an excellent foil .
Between songs , Hammill , a youthful and dapper 54 , is personable : when the equipment breaks down , the singer and violinist even engage in a Pete and Dud - type routine .
But once the songs begin , they lock into them absolutely , taking the audience on a white - knuckle ride peppered with moments of startling insight and musical beauty .
If I Could is an early highlight ( the killer line "" She 's gon na leave you "" spat out with fury ) , and others wallow in a lack of self - esteem .
Hammill hurls in what he mischievously dubs "" positive "" songs , but moments later , the serene A Way Out is virtually a suicide note set to music .
By the closing Modern , which rages as powerfully as anything by the Sex Pistols , the sense of catharsis for band and audience is undeniable .
Leading us into the blackness and allowing tantalising , uplifting shafts of light , his life 's work is a metaphor for life itself . Â·

Maybe it 's the solitary confinement of growing up in far - flung New Zealand that 's led to Blair Jolland developing multiple personalities , each of them based on a music icon .
Like Wurzel Gummidge trying on different heads , his voice flirts with Scott Walker 's sullen majesty , embraces the weathered beauty of Willie Nelson and chews on the elastic vowels of David Bowie .
And the music is equally transmogrifying .
Arena of My Soul has the skewed delivery of the White Stripes and the spirit of Johnny Cash , it 's backing vocals stolen from 1960s soul classics , while gospel - derived lyrics shine with purity amongst the grubby frenzy .
Jolland does n't believe in subtlety and despite the abundance of eclectic influences , a thread of sparkling campness runs through each song .
Bitter Girl 's dramatic strings mirror Jolland 's high , pained vocals - the song expansive yet slippery .
But it is the rock opera of Killer Landings that proves the ultimate fulfilment of Jolland 's grandiose vision , creating the warped and spacey sound of Bowie 's Major Tom free - falling into a Mexican border town , a pedal steel guitar sighing as it watches his tumultuous crash - landing ."

2003-04-16,"Actor Susan Sarandon is to be honoured at New York 's Film Society of Lincoln Centre 's annual gala tribute , a move which bucks the recent trend of organisations cancelling her appearances because of her anti - war stance .
Among the guests expected to attend the ceremony on May 3 are the actor 's former co - stars Goldie Hawn and Geena Davis , singer David Bowie , directors Paul Schrader and Jonathan Demme and her longtime partner Tim Robbins .
Elsewhere , however , Sarandon remains an object of loathing for pro - war Americans incensed by her outspoken views on the war in Iraq .
Last month the actress 's scheduled speech at a United Way event in Florida was cancelled at the eleventh hour .
Then , last week , Baseball Hall of Fame president Dale Petroskey announced that he was cancelling a 15th anniversary screening of Sarandon and Robbins 's baseball - themed movie Bull Durham in protest at the star 's political stance .
Petroskey , a former press secretary to Ronald Reagan , reportedly told Sarandon and Robbins that their anti - war stance "" could put our troops in even more danger . ""
In the meantime , the actress is finding support in unlikely quarters .
Generally assumed to dwell to the right of Hollywood 's political spectrum , Clint Eastwood spoke out against Petroskey 's decision to cancel the screening .
""
How dare he ? "" said Eastwood , who clearly regards the issue as an attack on the American right of free speech .
"" They have a right to say what they want to say , when they want to say it . """

Hope is a ragbag of covers , new songs and re - recordings of old ones by acts who would normally ignore each other in the Tops of the Pops backstage bar , among them David Bowie , Basement Jaxx , Paul McCartney and someone from Blue .
For the most part , you 'd be better off sending Â£ 13.99 directly to the War Child charity ; some tracks are arresting , though .
Witness Avril Lavigne 's palpable bewilderment as she turns her attention from sk8er bois to Dylan 's Knocking on Heaven 's Door , and Ronan Keating 's uncharacteristic gravitas on In the Ghetto .
Beth Orton makes it through the R&amp;B classic Ooh , Child , but pales next to Travis , whose handsome new song The Beautiful Occupation harnesses their innate poignance .
McCartney and Bowie 's revamped versions of songs from recent albums are functional .

2003-04-23,"Record giant EMI today made the most significant move yet towards selling music on the web , putting over 90 % of its catalogue - including artists such as Coldplay , Robbie Williams and David Bowie - online .
Its decision to embrace the internet comes amid increasing concern that today 's teenagers are accessing more music on the net for free than they are paying for it in record shops .
The company has signed deals with 20 digital music distributors including Freeserve , MSN , MTV , BT 's Dotmusic and retailer HMV to offer more than 140,000 tracks for download .
It is the biggest move to date by a major record company to combat the growing tide of online music piracy that has contributed to a sharp slump in music sales over the past three years .
Record companies are keenly aware teenagers operate a brisk trade in albums they have downloaded from the web and burned on to CDs .
Last year , global music sales fell a further 7.2 % to Â£ 20bn according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , the worldwide music trade organisation .
Online piracy and the widespread use of CD burning technology , which allows computer users to record music straight to CD from their hard drive , were blamed as a major contributory factor .
Napster , the original driving force behind online piracy , was forced offline .
However , a host of sites such as Kazaa and Soulseek have sprung up in its place , enabling users to swap pirated songs directly between their computer hard drives .
The EMI UK chief executive , Tony Wadsworth , said the industry needed "" to use all legitimate means possible to hamper piracy and make as much music available online as possible "" .
"" We are using new technology to benefit artists and consumers by massively expanding the amount of music available securely online , "" added Emmanuel de Buretel , the chief executive of EMI recorded music continental Europe .
Under the deal , consumers will be able to make permanent copies of songs and transfer them to recordable CDs , portable music players and their hard drives .
Consumers can also purchase singles online once they hit the radio airwaves .
Until now EMI and other major labels had placed stringent restrictions on the number of songs available and the manner in which they could be copied , causing web users to seek illegal alternatives .
The lack of choice available online , as well as the patchy availability of the latest chart hits , have been blamed for the lack of popularity of legitimate services backed by big labels .
Mr Wadsworth said the process had been complicated by the complex music publishing deals of many top artists , requiring each one to be negotiated individually for online distribution .
Legends such as the Rolling Stones and The Beatles have so far refused to make their tracks available on the web .
However , Mr Wadsworth said about 90 % of EMI 's current catalogue would now be available though its partner sites .
About 200,000 tracks from major and independent labels will be available through the partner sites , giving users access to most chart hits ."

2003-05-16,"Record companies targeting teenagers with new music download services may be forced to think again after research that showed music piracy is a big hit with the over-45s .
Latest figures revealed that there were as many music fans in their middle ages downloading music as there are those under 24 , fuelling doubts about the wisdom of pushing teen fodder such as Busted over the internet instead of mature acts like David Bowie and Led Zeppelin .
The industry has long believed that the main music downloading population are teenagers downloading the likes of Eminem and Limp Bizkit , but new research shows that around a quarter of those downloading music from the web are over 45 years old .
The shock findings show there is a clear appetite for legal music downloads among all sectors of the population , as shown by the early success of artists such as the Eagles , U2 and Coldplay on Apple 's recently launched iTunes service in the US .
The results suggest record companies should be pushing artists like Tom Jones , David Gray and U2 through legal download services , as much as those who appeal to younger listeners .
The research , by Vivendi Universal - owned legal download service MP3.com , shows that 24 % of its users are over 45 , while a further quarter are aged 25 to 43 and 23 % aged between 18 and 24 . ""
These are staggering statistics and contradict the traditional thinking that teenagers are the largest consumers of music on the internet , "" said Leanne Sharman , vice president of sales and marketing at MP3.com Europe , which recently realigned with its US sister site as part of Vivendi 's reorganisation of its online interests .
"" This is good news for record labels and consumer brands because it shows consumers are retaining youthful interests as they grow older - effectively extending core marketing demographics , "" she added .
Seperate new research from Forrester also provides some rare cheer for the record industry , predicting that online downloads will be worth Â£ 900 m by 2007 , 13 % of the European market , as broadband connections become more widespread and consumers become used to buying tracks online .
But despite legal music downloads finally starting to take off among consumers , thanks to the industry 's belated decision make a wide range of recent tracks and artists available , Forrester predicts that just Â£ 17m - worth of music will be sold through the internet this year . ""
Recent announcements by EMI and Apple show that after a slow start , major music and technology companies are now taking the future of digital music seriously , "" said Forrester analyst Rebecca Jennings .
"" While the US market for legitimate music downloads is already off the starting blocks , the European market lagged .
But over the next few years digital music delivery will ramp up , "" she added .
But the Forrester report warned that the majority of growth would come from customers making individual downloads , as is possible with the new Apple iTunes service , rather than subscription services ."
2003-05-24,"I 've always fancied myself as a bit of a karaoke king .
I like to warm up my audience with a brisk trot through Iggy Pop 's Lust For Life and leave them hungry for more with a soaring rendition of David Bowie 's Young Americans .
Indeed , friends have told me that my grand finale - a blistering encore of Elvis 's The Wonder Of You - has left them close to tears .
I guess the emotion of the occasion must just have been too much .
But take away the Guinness and the shouts of encouragement
and I 'm alone , naked and tone - deaf on a makeshift stage with poor range , worse pitch and a repertoire of lager - fuelled sing - alongs .
If I 'm ever to make the leap from pub singer to someone who can genuinely hold a note in public then I 'll need some intensive coaching .
Step forward Eleanor Madoc Davies , owner of Cwm - moel , the best little singing school B&amp;B in all Wales .
Wales is synonymous with a strong music - making culture - from the small village folk festivals that make up local eisteddfods to the Manic Street Preachers selling out the Millennium Stadium .
Even today , about 200 male voice choirs practise in the back rooms of pubs each week , nurturing a sense of community through song that has been long lost in most places across the UK .
Cwm - moel , a 17th - century stone farmhouse set among the streams and hills of the Edw valley in mid - Wales , is filled with music - from the transcripts of traditional Welsh folk songs on the music stand to the Aled Jones CDs in the lounge .
For the casual weekender , it offers all the usual comforts of a traditional family - run B&amp;B experience : long walks in the spectacular countryside of the Black Mountains , great home cooking using local organic produce and the tranquillity of country living .
But for the wannabe Pop Idol and downright curious alike , Eleanor , the proprietor , also offers guests a chance to gather around the piano in her music room in order to have sweet music coaxed from straining vocal chords .
A former music teacher and conductor , Eleanor studied at the Royal College of Music in London .
Today , she still teaches local children and helps out with community singing projects .
Complete beginners , such as myself , are welcome to join the formal one - on - one classes .
"" I really do believe it is possible to get a tune out of the most tone - deaf guest with a few hours of hard practice , "" she smiles as we talk about my previous experience of music over a cup of tea in her parlour .
But by then , of course , she had yet to overhear my low nasal whine mumbling its way through a few bars of Bob Dylan 's
It 's
All Over Now , Baby Blue while I unpacked my things into one of the seven comfortable but unfussy bedrooms , complete with TV , coffee - making facilities and a private bathroom .
"" I like a challenge , "" she says , through a fixed smile .
The next morning starts with the post - breakfast pep talk .
The keys to vocal training , Eleanor explains , are good posture and proper breathing .
So , after some warm - up exercises designed to stretch my neck muscles and some deep breathing aimed at expanding the lungs , we start with a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday by way of a warm - up . ""
Now , open your mouth wide .
I want them to be able to hear you over the other side of the hill , "" Eleanor says , as I try to strike the correct "" relaxed "" pose - hands by my sides , head up - yet feeling desperately self - conscious in the process . ""
Do n't be shy .
Just centre yourself and imagine you are being held upright from a string in the top of your head , "" she encourages .
The first morning 's session is all about assessment .
My slaughtering of a couple of jaunty Welsh folk tunes suffices to determine that I need to work on my pitch .
We break for a meal of soup followed by organic lamb , served with fresh vegetables and washed down with potent , home - made cider .
As I stroll around the adjoining family - run farm , my inner Tom Jones is fair bursting to get out .
Still , Eleanor insists , I need discipline and practice to ensure I start hitting the rights notes rather than mauling the sounds that are coming from my diaphragm .
To help provide me with some inspiration , I am invited to sit in on a lesson with her niece , 24-year - old Kelly Evans .
Currently studying for the finals of a music degree at Cardiff University , she performs Pie Jesu from Andrew Lloyd Webber 's Requiem and a collection of Schubert 's Leider with professional aplomb .
The valleys are , for once that day , genuinely filled with the sound of sweet music and my Elvis medley is suddenly shown up to be more cabaret pub singer than top - of - the - bill Las Vegas .
Caesar 's Palace , it seems , will have to wait .
"" Kelly has a natural talent that she has developed through sheer hard work , "" Eleanor tells me .
"" Singing is like being an athlete .
If you get out of practice then your voice gets lazy . ""
Suitably inspired by a demonstration of how it should be done , I 'm back at the piano the next morning with a full Welsh breakfast inside me and a new sense of determination .
Sure enough , by the end of the final session , I do feel I 'm making progress , tackling tunes from the West End musicals , learning to recognise changes in key and controlling my breathing instead of running out of puff after a particularly troublesome crescendo .
"" You ca n't learn to sing professionally in a weekend but you can learn how to produce your voice and how to breathe properly , "" Eleanor advises me as I 'm packing up on the last day . ""
Now you need to keep practising and stay relaxed when singing . ""
Back home , I find there 's still a song in my heart - from a quick ditty in the shower to a sly croon on my way to the Tube station .
The big test , however , comes when I take the mic once more for the local karaoke night .
As the regulars run for the bar , I take the stage , centre myself and , with Eleanor 's words still ringing in my head , launch into the first few bars .
The applause is , if I say so myself , thunderous .
OK , so I might not be up to Robbie Williams ' standard yet .
But , after a weekend of fresh air , good food and patient tuition , I reckon I 'm ready to give Gary Barlow a run for his money .

2003-06-13,"Coming across Time Again ( Verve , Â£ 12.99 ) , the new David Sanborn album , is like bumping into an old friend .
More alarmingly , it 's like finding that your friend is still fit and thin , with all their hair and/or teeth , and that when they crack the old jokes they 're still funny .
Sanborn 's unique selling point has always been his attractively abrasive tone on alto saxophone - it blares out from hundreds of R&amp;B , pop and crossover hits by artists such as Stevie Wonder , David Bowie and the Brecker Brothers .
I first heard Sanborn in the 1970s ( courtesy of Charlie Gillett 's Radio London programme ) on the Bobby Charles track Grow
Too Old , on which the saxophonist plays a wildly spiralling solo .
Bursting with Hendrix - like energy , with a hard - edged , rasping tone , it might have been more sax than was strictly necessary for such a good - rockin ' track , but it marked Sanborn as a new voice on the instrument .
It was around that time that he started playing with Gil Evans ( on albums such as Svengali and There Comes a Time ) .
Sanborn sounds phenomenal in this jazz heavyweight context , too , and he continued to play with Evans while his own session and solo career blossomed .
Time Again relates nicely to Sanborn 's achievements as a sideman , rather than reprising the overheated funk of his solo albums .
Familiar jazz - pop standards such as Harlem Nocturne , Comin ' Home Baby and Tequila are vehicles for lightweight Sunday morning jazz of a high standard , with airy , unforced accompaniment from studio stars such as Steve Gadd ( drums ) and Christian McBride ( bass ) .
The Crusaders ' Rural Renewal ( Verve , Â£ 12.99 ) has a similarly easy feel , reuniting founder members Joe Sample ( keyboards ) , Stix Hooper ( drums ) and Wilton Felder ( tenor sax ) with producer Stuart Levine , who also produced the Sanborn album .
Levine was behind a string of attractive , successful Crusaders ' albums such as Chain Reaction and Southern Comfort - although Street Life , whose title track was a pop hit , was produced by the band themselves .
Nothing on Rural Renewal has the ambitious sweep of Street Life ( which featured Randy Crawford on vocals ) ; the 60-something jazz - funk veterans have opted to keep things simple .
Hooper does n't have a Gadd - like technique
but he really cooks .
There 's something very personal about the relaxed , just - behind - the - beat way in which the three principals phrase the licks , riffs and melodies that define the Crusaders sound .
In the long absence of Wayne Henderson ( who has been touring with a different band under their original name of the Jazz Crusaders ) , they have recruited trombonist Steve Baxter , who sounds comfortable barking out the tunes with Felder .
Guitar duties are handled by Ray Parker Jr , Dean Parks , Arthur Adams and guest star Eric Clapton , who plays acoustic on the title track and electric on the sneaky blues groove of Creepin ' .
Rural Renewal is not particularly original , but , like Sanborn 's album , it 's jazz - funk you can relax to without going ga - ga .
The music is soulful while being grounded in the aesthetic and working practices of jazz .
Levine and the Crusaders make it sound so easy that you wonder why so many Jazz FM favourites make a hash of it .
Having said that , I 'm not crazy about the two vocal tracks , which feature Donnie McClurkin : his breathy voice is too cloying for the Crusaders ' grizzled grit .
Sample , one of those pianists who can conjure up music in the most unpromising circumstances , is OK , but the other guys sound like they 're making polite conversation until the real party gets going , with self - explanatory titles such as Shotgun House Groove , Greasy Spoon and Viva De Funk ."
2003-06-25,"The public has always proved curiously resistant to backing vocalists who attempt to take the spotlight for themselves .
For every Luther Vandross , who began his career behind David Bowie , there are 100 Doris Troys , who is doomed to be known not for her own records , but as the wailing woman on Pink Floyd 's dreadful Great Gig in the Sky .
So the news that Martina Topley Bird 's debut solo single , Need One , failed to trouble the charts has a depressing familiarity about it .
Topley Bird spent the mid-1990s as Tricky 's vocal foil : indeed , Tricky 's records have never really seemed right since their partnership dissolved in 1998 .
As tonight 's concert proves , however , writing off Topley Bird would be a hopeless oversight .
British music is not exactly drowning in distinctive female talent at the moment .
Topley Bird is certainly that .
Her voice is defiantly individual : torpid and bluesy , yet somehow very English and pretty .
It fits her music .
Her forthcoming album , Quixotic , comes thick with guest appearances - Tricky , producer David Holmes , arranger David Arnold , even Californian metallers Queens of the Stone Age - but live , the songs are stripped back .
What emerges is a spooky , disjointed sound , driven not by beats but by harmonica and acoustic guitar .
The tempo rarely rises above a languorous slink , but the mood darts about wildly : murky , threatening and discordant one moment , muzzy and sensual the next .
There is much rattling of odd - looking percussion instruments , evoking an anglicised take on both Dr John 's voodoo - obsessed soul and the Nina Simone of African Mailman .
These are lofty influences ; without charisma , the result could sound like wan pastiche , and charisma is not something former backing vocalists are noted for .
Topley Bird barely speaks , but she exudes a heavy - lidded , slightly menacing stage presence .
Tonight , at least , she is impossible to ignore ."
2003-06-27,"One day , all music programmes will be like Armitage and Moore 's Guide to Song ( Radio 4 ) .
Poet Simon Armitage analysed the lyrics and musicologist Allan Moore unpicked the scores .
Their syncopated conversation took in David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust , Morrissey ( "" a superliterate antihero with NHS specs "" ) and Bob Dylan .
Armitage made sure we appreciated that Morrissey 's "" unlimited vocal trickery "" made his competitors sound like Stig of the Dump , while Moore gleefully seized on the fact that the blend of electric and acoustic guitars on Ziggy Stardust underlined the dualism of Bowie 's creation .
Armitage 's dad had his own interpretation .
Bowie , he announced when young Simon came home with his first album , was "" a homosexual "" .
Simon fled upstairs but came down 10 minutes later to exact his revenge . ""
Well , "" he said , "" Beethoven was dead "" .
Barb Jungr 's whisky - and - honey voice singing
Dylan 's I 'll Be Your Baby
Tonight flowed round a discussion of how a performer can transform a song .
It was not quite as beautiful , however , as the moment when Moore and Armitage slipped smoothly from deconstructing Henry Darger into a coruscating examination of Andy Stewart 's Donald Where 's Your Troosers ?
Armitage argued that the narrator was inviting us to question racial identity , in the same way Ali G does .
Moore argued that the unexpected final cadence of the 18th - century chord sequence indicated that polite society ( "" possibly Edinburgh "" ) was the proferred ideal .
It was then that it dawned on you that although Armitage and Moore seem to inhabit the same world as the rest of us , theirs is actually very different .
And more fun .
Nocturne ( Radio 4 ) took us into another world within a world as we followed Chris Yates and his son William on a midnight walk through the woods .
It 's not just the pictures that are better on radio - the darkness is too .
Ostensibly a search for a puma rumoured to roam there , their ramble was really an exercise in seeing the world anew .
The intrepid explorers ' first encounter - tawny owls - enraptured them .
Then a glowing UV light appeared .
A beacon for extra - terrestrials , suggested Yates .
"" I do n't know , "" replied William , clearly preparing for anything .
It was a mothcatcher .
The owner recounted how he , like William , had been afraid of all things lepidopterous until he watched a caterpillar change into a death 's head moth .
His fear may have been reborn as fascination , but for William the process was quite the reverse .
One haunted house , innumerable strange noises , and two ghost stories later and Chris was left to continue alone , until the dawn chorus began .
It was a relief to emerge blinking into the light .
Although , of course , the accompaniment was n't a patch on Andy Stewart ."
2003-06-29,"Armitage and Moore 's Guide to Song R4 Travels of the Mind World Service Masterpiece World Service World Made of Water World Service
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls ?
You 're glad I asked that question .
Come on , admit it 's been niggling you ever since you raced out to buy David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust album in 1972 and pretended that you , too , were a rock alien in a spangled catsuit .
There are some programmes , invariably on Radio 4 , that you never knew you needed until you ran into them .
Armitage and Moore 's Guide to Song fits this slot and sums up why Radio 4 is unique - because , apart from studying for a degree in popular music at Surrey University , where else could you possible get hold of this sort of information ?
Simon Armitage is well known as poet and lyricist , Professor Allan Moore is the lynchpin of the above mentioned degree course , and their cheery collaboration is one of the most entertaining series I 've heard in years .
Last week , they analysed the lyrical and musical merits of Bob Dylan , David Bowie , Natalie Merchant , The Smiths and Andy Stewart 's ground - breaking classic , ' Donald , Where 's Yer Troosers ? ' .
Back to Ziggy - the first album , incidentally , that Armitage , aged 11 , ever bought .
He tried unsuccessfully to smuggle it past his father in the living room . '
What 's that ?
' asked Armitage senior who , when he was told , observed severely : ' David Bowie is a homosexual . ' '
And Beethoven was deaf , ' replied the infant poet .
Moore reckons that ' Ziggy Stardust ' is , in fact , two songs welded together with a bridge joining the two acoustic and electric guitar compositions , thus signifying the dualism of Ziggy 's persona .
Armitage goes further .
It 's a biblical allegory , he says ; the spiders are the Apostles , the ball - breaking fly Judas and Ziggy the misunderstood Messiah .
I 'll buy that
and I 'll also go along with Moore 's masterful analysis of the final chord sequence in ' Donald ,
Where 's Yer Troosers ? '
It sounds like an authentic eighteenth - century Caledonian reel , mused Moore , but it actually echoes nineteenth - century European concert cadences , suggesting that the singer is really satirising the archetypal backwoodsman jock rather than the disdainful Sassenach .
Three programmes encapsulated the richness of World Service broadcasting .
Travels of the Mind had Dr Raj Persaud looking at Third World psychiatry .
When a doctor in rural Kenya described how he prescribed powdered burnt lizard for depression , Persaud replied thoughtfully that it probably contained the same minerals as lithium .
Masterpiece had a journalist from Zimbabwe relocating Orwell 's Animal Farm nearer home .
For Mr Jones , read colonialism , he said ; for Napoleon , substitute Mugabe ; replace the puppies trained as killer bodyguards with the Youth Brigade .
The ruling government private militia and the sheep trained by Squealer to break into a chorus of ' Four legs good , two legs bad ' are mirrored by the Zanu PF Women 's League formed immediately after independence .
As for World Made of Water , I can not think of another programme that has captured the soul of a place or its people more subtly or succinctly .
This was the world of the Tuareg traders carrying salt by camel 500 miles across the Sahara to Timbuktu - creaking leather , harrrumphing camels , belching drivers .
They were all there and so was I."

This is where the trouble starts , and from where the hope springs : it 's impossible to say exactly what Paul the Girl does .
In their freedom and wit , these songs owe much to jazz .
The band ( an unorthodox line - up : drums , double bass , trombone , saxophone and Paul herself playing electric and acoustic guitars ) spin lengthy , intoxicating codas , with sensual blasts of bass saxophone .
Yet another song begins with Paul spilling delicate , silvery peals of electric guitar over an insistent bass , developing into the kind of molten , bluesy playing that most ( male ) guitarists would sell their strings for .
The ornery skronk of Captain Beefheart is here too .
Just when you begin to pin her down , there 's the vaudeville stomp that rises out of Thinking Song , or the macabre cabaret ( macaberet perhaps ? ) of The Phony on the Jury .
Paul 's voice , which could be described as kittenish only if the kitten had very big teeth , soars , screeches and gargles , capable of lulling sweetness and alarming swoops , hiccups and shrieks .
That 's not to say that this is difficult music : enormously sophisticated , yes , but the propulsive clatter of Do n't
You Know
Yet Who I Am and the gorgeous drawl of Electro - Magnetic Blues ( the title track of her new album ) prove she can write addictive choruses , too .
Without management and on her own tiny label , Paul is making the most original music of any British artist , of either gender .
An extraordinary , ravishing evening ."
2003-09-10,"A superstar 's performance in an exclusive London venue is beamed via computer to 68 fan - packed cinemas in 22 countries .
Thirty years ago , David Bowie would have used this scenario as the basis for a concept album examining the alienation of celebrity in a technological dystopia .
Tonight , he is taking part .
Quite rightly , it is heralded as an Innovative Event .
However , as Bowie 's concept album would no doubt have noted , technology is prone to failure .
In Brighton , opener New Killer Star plays so quietly that it is drowned out by the munching of popcorn .
The audience voice their disapproval , which briefly gives the Innovative Event the air of a Saturday morning children 's film club .
Once the sound is fixed , Bowie 's forthcoming album , Reality , is unveiled .
It repeats the guitary format of 2002 's Heathen , with mixed results .
Days of My Life twinkles prettily .
The title track and the melancholy Fall Dog Bombs the Moon are fantastic .
But not even an onstage wind machine can stop The Loneliest Guy , a ballad , sounding overcooked .
Jonathan Richman 's evocation of adolescent snottiness , Pablo Picasso , sounds deeply odd sung by a man knocking on 60 .
Meanwhile , fans ' text messages scroll across the bottom of the screen .
This makes the Innovative Event look more like an ITV telethon than is perhaps intended .
Some pose searching questions : "" Did Heathen reflect Nietzsche 's theory of meaninglessness in the world ?
"" Others do not : "" I LUV YOU SNEEZY XXXXX "" .
Next , there is a Europe - wide Q&amp;A for the fans , which simultaneously recalls the Eurovision Song Contest and a particularly chaotic phone - in on 1980s kids show Saturday Superstore .
Technical hitches abound .
The questions are staggering .
Josephine in Berlin wants to know what happened to a dog
Bowie owned in the 1970s .
Unsurprisingly , Bowie replies that the dog died .
He wears a regretful expression .
Whether he is regretting the passing of the hound or his decision to take part in the Q&amp;A is unclear .
His answers reveal less than his skintight trousers do .
An encore featuring a breathtaking version of 1979 's Fantastic Voyage restores equilibrium .
Bowie exits looking pleased , with good reason .
After all , most of his 1970s peers would be hard pushed to fill a sporty hatchback with fans eager to hear their new material , let alone 68 cinemas ."
2003-09-12,"Like all proper Dave albums , Bowie 's 26th has at its core a concept , around which 11 songs uneasily cluster to articulate the master 's daft vision .
At the age of 56 , he has decided to address the daftest of them all : What is reality ?
( Or , as he chuckles : "" The basis [ of reality ] is more an all - pervasive influence of contingency than a defined structure of absolutes . "" )
Despite this , Reality is touching , intelligent and - a bonus - listenable .
It 's not , as Bowie claims , up there with Low , but the rocking archness of New Killer Star and the haunted , look - back - in - anger mood of Bring Me
the Disco King show why he still merits the consideration not enjoyed by grunts like the Rolling Stones .
A mix of classic - not nostalgic - rock ( the influence , presumably , of producer Tony Visconti ) , ambient duskiness and the electronic furbelows he has embraced since the 1990s , Reality gels unexpectedly well .
Bowie 's striking vocals are royally raging on a bruising cover of Jonathan Richman 's Pablo Picasso , then frail and old as Disco King and Days fade out like wisps of smoke .
As for the "" reality "" business , the lyrics leave you guessing .
That 'll be the lack of defined structure of absolutes , then ."
2003-09-13,"David Bowie , Reality ( Iso / Columbia )
Really , it is rather good .
Of course , virtually every David Bowie album since the Tin Machine dÃ©bcle of the late Eighties has been greeted by the same bit of wishful thinking .
The phrase ' Bowie 's best album since Scary Monsters ' has become an open lie , a cruel clichÃ© on a par with the notion that Botox makes anyone look attractive , or the ' liberation ' of Iraq .
When confronted by a new Bowie set , fans and record reviewers ( the two are often interchangeable ) have tended to tie themselves in knots in an effort to find something - anything - to celebrate in the some times great man 's wildly vacillating latterday works .
But last year 's not - bad Heathen album narrowed the gap between over- enthusiasm and reality .
And Reality itself , Bowie 's twenty - sixth album , shrinks it still further .
Clearly , this is n't a record that will eclipse Bowie 's champion run of 25 years ago ( not many records can ) .
There are plenty of opportunities to cringe , especially when Bowie 's penchant for over - thinking music wins out .
The cover of Jonathan Richman 's ' Pablo Picasso ' is a case in point .
All pro - tooled Spanish guitar and a honking synthetic sax , there is far too much fuss to it - the eternal curse of the seasoned , successful artist who can afford to throw too many instruments at a song .
The title track misfires , too .
The album 's sombre coda , ' Bring me the Disco King ' , meanwhile , starts elegantly enough as a spacious , piano jazz meditation filled with weary feeling .
At eight minutes , though , it begins to feel overwritten and self - important in marked contrast to the rest of Reality .
The best thing about Reality is how wonderfully unforced it all sounds .
The songs just spill out , as though propelled by some hidden boot .
The opening chug of ' New Killer Star ' sets up a loose forward roll that lasts all the way through to ' Fall Dog Bombs the Moon ' , a rattling , low - key pop song spiked with deadpan anger .
And when he does pause , it 's good , too . '
The Loneliest Guy ' ponders the ' pictures on my hard drive ' and ' the errors left unlearned ' with restrained emotion , and barely - there piano . '
Try Some , Buy Some ' is a cover of a George Harrison song best known in its Ronnie Spector guise ; its strings and Beatley harpsichord add a stately sway .
Throughout , Bowie 's tone is reflective and unshowy : the many references to age and time passing ( ' Days ' , '
Never Get Old ' ) feel genuine and wry , as though the man most often described as a chameleon is genuinely a creature of emotion rather than a master of surface and artifice .
Similarly , Bowie 's adopted home of New York fills many songs with poignant landmarks ( the Hudson , Battery Park ) .
It 's a sense of place he has n't really had since Berlin .
Reality still does n't measure up to that hallowed ground , but this is the first sequence of Bowie songs that bears repeated listening in years .
It is a pleasure , rather than a grim duty done out of respect for the memory of Ziggy Stardust ."

2003-10-02,"The ailing music industry is looking for big sales from artists such as David Bowie , Kylie Minogue and Sting to stem the continuing slump in record sales .
Figures released yesterday showed worldwide sales of recorded music tumbled nearly 11 % , from $ 14.3bn ( Â£ 9bn ) to $ 12.7bn , in the first six months of this year .
Last year 's six - month figure was down 9 % on the same period in 2001 .
The International Federation of Phonographic Industries , which compiled the figures , blamed illegal internet downloading - "" unauthorised file - sharing and commercial piracy "" - for much of the decline .
The figures will increase pressure on the industry 's big five - Universal , Sony , BMG , EMI and Warner - to consolidate and cut costs .
EMI said last week that it was in talks to buy Time Warner 's music division in a deal that could be worth Â£ 1bn .
Warner had been linked with Germany 's BMG , part of the Bertelsmann media conglomerate , which is now said to be considering a link with Sony .
The best selling albums in the first half , according to the IFPI , were Christina Aguilera 's Stripped , rapper 50 Cent 's Get Rich or Die Tryin ' and Coldplay 's A Rush of Blood to the Head .
Other top sellers included Celine Dion 's One Heart , Norah Jones 's Come Away with Me , Avril Lavigne 's Let Go , Linkin Park 's Meteora and 200 kmh
In The Wrong Lane by Russian duo t .
A.T.u .
The IFPI collects sales data from more than 1,500 record companies in 70 countries , but the bulk of the damage to global sales is concentrated in the biggest markets .
First half US sales were down 12 % , Japan lost 13.5 % , France 9.1 % and Germany 18 % .
These countries , with Canada , also account for the bulk of internet piracy .
In these markets , the IFPI said , the number of unauthorised downloads and copied CDs in some cases exceeded the level of legitimate sales .
Legal online sales are growing .
There are now more than 300,000 tracks available online and 30 European sites offer pay - per - download or subscription services .
Sales from these are expected to increase rapidly .
In Britain , album sales rose by a healthy 4 % but overall music sales were down 6.1 % as a result of the collapse in the singles market .
There has been growth in some areas .
Within Europe , Austria and Finland showed increases as a result of successful local acts , while singles were "" a great success "" in Spain .
The Russian market is benefiting from a mass transition from cassette to CD , while Asia has surged as a result of some big selling compilation albums .
DVD music sales also grew .
The number of DVD music videos sold was up 46 % on last year , while in value terms the growth was about 55 % .
DVD music videos now account for more than 5 % of the global music market .
Half year sales make up only 40 % of the annual total and the weight of second half buying - together with a strong series of new releases - is expected to offset some of the first half decline .
Last year 's 9 % halfway slump was pulled back to a 7 % decline by the end of December .
Other artists who record companies are counting on to produce big second half sellers include BeyoncÃ© , Dido , Blue , Jon Bon Jovi , REM , Pink , Nickelback , Limp Bizkit and Enrique Iglesias ."
2003-11-18,"The last time Bowie toured UK arenas - with the 1990s Sound and Vision tour - he made the momentous decision to "" retire "" his back catalogue .
It was the last time , he said , we 'd hear him play the hits .
The logic was that he felt constrained by his legacy , although it did n't do ticket sales any harm .
Now they 're back .
He kicks off with Rebel Rebel , dips into funky Fame , before long there 's The Man Who Sold The World and a moderately earth - shattering Life On Mars .
After two return - to - form albums , 2002 's Heathen and this year 's Reality , presumably the thin white duke at last feels he has new material to hold up against the oldies .
And yes , Reality is utterly ferocious .
The swaggering New Killer Star has the indescribable but unmistakable feel of a Bowie classic .
In fact , there are n't nearly enough new songs aired .
Changes , Under Pressure and the rest are delivered to perfection .
Possibly because Bowie has finally given up smoking , or adopted even tighter trousers , he has reawakened a vocal range that has long lain dormant , even reaching the infamous "" vision of swastikas "" line in China Girl for the first time since it was recorded .
If anyone doubts that Bowie looks fantastic too , five TV screens dazzle with his image .
His Low - era haircut has been transplanted onto the body of a 24-year - old , while the creaking jeans reveal the bits that were once hurriedly airbrushed off the sleeve of Diamond Dogs .
What 's been lost , understandably , is any lingering semblance of the psychologically disturbed cocaine and occult crazed madman that delivered his 70s music .
Only rarely does Bowie truly connect with these songs .
However , when the family man touches on post 9/11 fear in Sunday and gives Five Years a renewed air of apocalypse , he taps into a new kind of disturbance .
On the eve of Bush 's visit , the message within I 'm Afraid Of Americans is delivered subtly , but devastatingly .
However , after innumerable chameleonic career twists , he 's mostly back on safe ground as a consummate rock star .
He grins through Ashes to Ashes , recounts the days shopping in Manchester and manages to locate a fan who 's going to the forthcoming gig in Sydney .
Ziggy Stardust completes the air of predictable but glorious entertainment .

2003-12-22,"It is an impressive list of the great and the good , packed with scholars and sportsmen , authors and artists .
Many of the most eminent names of the last 50 years are there .
Yet the leaked Whitehall documents do not detail Britain 's knights and dames , but almost 300 top figures - from David Bowie to Isaiah Berlin and from Helen Mirren to Lucian Freud - who snubbed the establishment by rejecting honours .
"" It 's a very impressive list .
Perhaps we could have an alternative honours list : a roll of honour for all those people who have turned them down , "" said Tony Wright , Labour chairman of the Commons public administration committee , which is to examine the awards system this spring .
"" It 's pretty clear that we need root and branch reform
and I think a head of steam has been building up for some time .
You have eruptions of interest every time the honours list comes out or there are allegations that someone has an honour for unworthy reasons .
It 's usually a five - day wonder and it subsides .
I think now there 's a feeling it 's time to do better than that .
"" It is not simply that the list demonstrates the distaste that many prominent figures feel for the system .
The very disclosure of the documents , to the Sunday Times , is significant .
The honours system is famously , even obsessively , secretive .
It is run by the Cabinet Office 's ceremonial secretariat , but no one knows who sits on the awards committee and - unlike most government documents - its papers are not released even under the 30-year rule .
Those offered awards are expected to remain tight - lipped even if they turn them down .
"" I 'm sure there are people within the system who think it 's time to reform it , "" agreed Mr Wright .
Honours have come under increasing scrutiny .
A report last year by the Social Market Foundation suggested the system was "" too political , too elitist , too uneven and too weighted to military endeavour "" .
Last month the Guardian revealed that Whitehall officials had squashed proposals to make the system more transparent and accountable .
The 1999 report , which was commissioned by the then cabinet secretary but was not even sent to the prime minister , noted that "" honours have proved a general exception to today 's climate of kiss and tell , with remarkably few recipients failing to keep the news of a forthcoming award to themselves "" .
The poet Benjamin Zephaniah made the headlines last month when he broke that rule by explaining why he had turned one down : "" OBE me ?
Up yours , I thought , "" he wrote in the Guardian .
"" I get angry when I hear that word "" empire "" : it reminds me of slavery , it reminds me of thousands of years of brutality . ""
And the secrecy has been blown apart by the leak to the Sunday Times , which yesterday listed an extraordinary array of what it dubbed "" refuseniks "" .
The cook Nigella Lawson , actors Honor Blackman and Alastair Sim , and writers JB Priestley , Graham Greene and Roald Dahl all rejected awards .
While one might have predicted that socialist filmmaker Ken Loach would turn down an OBE , it is rather more surprising to discover that golfer
Peter Alliss did not want one .
Alan Bennett has rejected both a knighthood and a CBE for services to literature , but the most persistently ungrateful nominee was the painter LS Lowry , who turned down five awards , including a knighthood .
Yesterday Claire Tomalin declined to confirm that she refused a CBE for services to literature two years ago , adding : "" If you turn it down you shut up and do n't talk about it . ""
But she said she felt honours were linked to an anachronistic system .
"" I have great respect for the Queen personally , but I do n't believe in the monarchy .
I 'm not a servant of the crown or the empire , "" she said .
"" I 'm a writer and the greatest honour I can possibly have is that people should read my books .
William Shakespeare , Samuel Pepys -
they do n't need to be Lord or Sir . ""
But there 's something built into human nature which likes rewards and prizes .
I would n't like to be too killjoy . ""
John Cole , who worked for the Guardian and Observer before becoming the BBC 's political editor , argued that journalists should be wary of accepting awards from the state . ""
Although I was retiring , there are enough allegations made about bias and so on as it is , "" he said .
"" You do n't want to leave yourself open to people saying ' Oh , he kept his nose clean so he would get an honour ' .
It would give me no pleasure anyhow ; I 'm a republican .
When I was in the Boys Brigade
I was very happy when someone gave me a wayfarers badge , but I 'm a grown - up chap now .
"" I 'd like to see it abolished .
I think Britain suffers dreadfully from an addiction to snobbery .
Anything we can do to dismantle that has to be a good thing . ""
The list was apparently created to warn officials against approaching those who had rejected an honour .
But , intriguingly , a number of those listed later changed their minds and accepted an award .
Some seem to have objected to the government in power ; others have turned down a lesser honour , or one explicitly linked to empire , but accepted a damehood or the Order of Merit , for instance .
"" There may be people who have such a high opinion of themselves that when they are offered a CBE , and were thinking in terms of a knighthood , they may see it as a complete insult , "" said JG Ballard , who rejected a CBE for services to literature .
The author and playwright Michael Frayn - who turned down a knighthood in this year 's new year honours , and rejected a CBE four years earlier - offered perhaps the simplest reason for declining .
"" I have n't done this for reasons of modesty , "" he claimed yesterday .
"" I like the name ' Michael Frayn ' ; it 's a nice little name to run around with .
I 've spent 70 years getting used to it
and I do n't want to change it now . """
2004-02-10,"Looking for a new band that appeals to the dispossessed , alienated audience stranded between the Scylla of crass commerciality and the Charybdis of half - baked obscurantism ?
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain could be the one : they play for everyone , from the dispossessed and lonely to the "" must n't grumble "" - a lost generation seeking to transcend everyday existence through the healing power of the ukulele .
This is not a crowd that buys David Bowie compilations at HMV .
They prefer to hear Life on Mars crooned quietly , backed by seven ukuleles and an acoustic bass guitar , cunningly melded with snatches of My Way , Born Free and Substitute .
Led by George Hinchliffe and Kitty Lux , the UOGB have buffed their act into polished entertainment .
They perform with a diffident , dinner - suited aplomb reminiscent of Flanders and Swann or Instant Sunshine .
Yet they appeal to people who recognise the Undertones ' Teenage Kicks , Jim Webb 's MacArthur Park and Devil 's Gallop after a few bars .
For the UOGB , the medium is the message : the ukulele 's quietude and vulnerability imposes a radical template on every tune .
Yet the easy lope of Ms Dynamite 's hit Dy - Na - Mi - Tee seems tailor - made : Hester Goodman sings lead over the plunky groove with cheerful pathos , while the male backing vocals acquire a weird intensity .
And if Tea for Two reveals their light entertainment roots ( complete with Morecambe and Wise - style dance routine ) their reading of The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , with beautiful whistling from bassist Jonty Banks , makes you realise how beautifully constructed Ennio Morricone 's composition is .
The star of the show is Hinchliffe , who has a self - deprecating authority and a mean technique on lead uke .
His reinvention of Wuthering Heights as a crooned strumalong - complete with a Cab Calloway - style "" Heathcliffe ! "" call and response - returns this epic to its Yorkshire origins .
It 's true that a little ukulele goes a long way , but the UOGB do n't outstay their welcome .

2004-02-15,"Best British Male Otherwise known as The Robbie Williams Award For Being Robbie Williams , the Male category this year will not be going straight to its usual mantelpiece ( he 's won it four out of the past five years ) .
Robbie 's not nominated .
Instead , an on - form David Bowie is tussling it out with youngsters as admirably diverse as Badly Drawn Boy and Dizzee Rascal ( whose sonic creativity puts the others to shame ) .
Will Young , however , could well go home with the gong .
Best British Female
In the bad old days , Annie Lennox won this category every year , even when she did n't have a record out .
She 's the token veteran this year , but up against stiff competition from Dido ( a winner in 2002 ) .
Realistically , it 's hard to see anyone like Amy Winehouse ( loved by journalists , largely ignored by record - buyers ) or the underrated Jamelia derailing the Dido sales juggernaut .
Best British Single Straight - up pop traditionally does extremely well in this category , so this trophy might be one Brit Dido fails to bag .
But it 's an oddly weak field this year .
Gareth Gates ' Comic Relief single was utterly laughable , so the struggle for Best Single could well fall to Rachel Stevens ' '
Sweet Dreams
My LA Ex ' ( foolishly turned down by Britney Spears , according to rumour ) and Mis - Teeq 's ' Scandalous ' .
If ' Scandalous ' does n't win it , it really will be a scandal .
Best British Album Rock bands ( and Coldplay ) tend to come out on top of the albums skirmish , so despite the sympathy factor ( he recently had a serious car accident ) , Daniel Bedingfield has n't got a hope .
Multiple nominee Dido previously won in 2002 , so it 's probably a straight fight between Islington and Hades , as the Darkness wo n't go home empty - handed tonight .
Best British Group Coldplay and Travis usually bounce this one back and forth between them .
But as neither is eligible this year it 's a three - way battle between the might of Radiohead ( who have never won ) , the eyebrows of Busted ( 2003 's pop phenomenon ) and the Darkness .
Taking past performance as an indicator , the serious band of the three - that 's Radiohead by the way - ought to win it .
But the Darkness have cast a spell on both the public and the record industry that should see them struggling under the weight of Brits by the end of the night .
Best breakthrough This year 's most fascinating , and hotly contested category , bar none .
There 's the Darkness , the Mercury - prized Dizzee Rascal , the stadium - packing Busted and Jamie Cullum all in with fighting chances .
As Cullum does n't crop up in any of the categories above , he 'll probably get it .
But Dizzee deserves it ."
2004-03-01,"It reads like a Who 's
Who of British household names : Roald Dahl , David Bowie , Nigella Lawson , Peter Alliss , Alan Bennett , Alastair Sim , John Cole , Michael Frayn , Honor Blackman and Graham Greene .
This is the once secret list , recently splashed across the Sunday newspapers , of prominent people who have turned down honours from the humble OBE to Knighthoods .
Artist LS Lowry turned down five awards , including the chance to become Sir Lawrence .
Some , such as Ken Loach , refuse a gong because they are staunch republicans .
Others on the far more dangerous rationale that the whole pantomime is ridiculous , outdated and discredited .
When Dusty Springfield was told she was going to receive an OBE , she reportedly said : "" Is n't that what they give to cleaners ? ""
When children 's book writers , golfers and celebrity cooks are turning down gongs , and when even William Hague is calling for reform , you know that time is up for the honours system .
The Labour government is addressing the issue : an inquiry , of course , led by Sir Hayden Phillips ( GCB 2002 , KCB 1998 , CB 1989 ) , permanent secretary at the Department of Constitutional Affairs .
Sir Hayden 's deliberations are being helped along by a House of Commons public administration select committee inquiry chaired by Tony Wright MP , a former chair of the Fabian Society and current member of the Fabian executive .
The first inquiry might be expected to look at ways of rebranding the honours system , removing some of the worst excesses of imperial pomp and class - ridden English snobbery , and making it seem a little more palatable .
The latter is taking public evidence and will look at recasting the system to reflect a different set of social values altogether .
The image problem is important , of course .
In 1996 , I wrote in my Fabian pamphlet
Long to Reign Over Us
that : "" The problem is the musty smell of empire which pervades the honours system , the odour of Europeans - only clubs , of soldiers drilling on the parade grounds of Lucknow and Cawnpore , of Pax Britannica , which turns the stomachs of democrats in a multiracial European parliamentary democracy .
There is something faintly ridiculous in conferring the Order of the British Empire when there is n't one .
The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire and the Imperial Order of the Crown of India were abolished , rightly , in 1947 .
The restyling of the OBE is long overdue . ""
But more important is the fundamental question of who gets an award and why .
Currently , the honours system is an excuse for the civil service and military establishments to give themselves a great big slap on the back and sing
For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow in very loud voices .
One in 123 diplomats gets an award , and one in 2,125 civil servants , but only one in 15,500 teachers is honoured , and one in 20,000 nurses .
The head teachers , school cleaners , lollypop ladies , bus drivers , charity volunteers , sporting heroes and "" safe "" celebrities who hit the headlines are merely a smokescreen for thousands more pen - pushers and bean counters who are rewarded for nothing more than not getting the sack for 20 years .
Radical reform should have at its heart a new set of underlying social values - a reappraisal about who matters in British society and deserves national recognition , and who should be satisfied with their huge salary , pension , and a retirement serving on commissions and quangos .
There should be three criteria : contribution to a particular community ( either geographical , or of interest ) ; doing your job in an outstanding way ; or doing something which enhances the standing of your country in the eyes of the world .
But the hierarchy and gradation should be removed from the highest honours .
A single top award should be created , and no more than 500 should be awarded each year .
Other new types of award might be created to celebrate service in particular fields : charity work , teaching , firefighting , the health and social care sectors - even our friends in the civil service .
Nomination should be made only by individual members of the public , and all nominations published .
A randomly - selected panel or "" citizens ' jury "" of 20 members of the public , appointed for three years and rotated by thirds , should decide which 500 people should be honoured each year .
In this way , the honours system becomes a bottom - up process , not a patronising pat on the head .
Honours recipients should then have the right to choose between two ceremonies : one at Buckingham Palace with the Queen ; and one at the House of Commons with the Speaker of the House of Commons .
Often governments fail to take credit for the big things they do ; they are celebrated for the small but important things .
It may be decades before Labour 's contribution to tackling child poverty or investing in schools is fully understood .
A thoroughgoing overhaul of the honours system as outlined above - just like granting the vote to 16-year olds , extending pub licensing laws , reintroducing NHS dentistry , and having more bank holidays - might be a small but important step in Britain 's march towards being a modern , vibrant democracy .

2004-04-23,"I 'd wager even a blind man with a broken Polaroid camera could n't have taken a bad photograph of Debbie Harry at her peak .
American photographer Mick Rock was better placed than most , though , having sharpened his zoom lens on such flamboyant 1970s pop icons as Freddie Mercury and David Bowie .
His images included here - all lipgloss and cheekbones - helped elevate Harry to a similar level of notoriety .
They show her in control of her image : a blonde by choice and , with her cocksure grin , anticipating the effect she would exert on a nation of pubescent boys - and girls , too .
What is most intriguing about this portfolio is the way it follows these early shots with Rock 's more recent portraits after Blondie 's successful reunion in 1998 .
Sure , her body throws all the old shapes and her face defies the ageing process , but her eyes appear curiously lifeless .
She looks unable or unwilling to connect with the camera , like a beautiful girl dressed for a party she does n't want to be at .
The old flirtatious streak may have faded in these later photographs , but that only makes her image all the more compelling .

2004-04-27,"David Bowie , once the benchmark against whom pop 's creativity was judged , has embraced bootlegging , offering up his back catalogue online to be remixed in a showdown of bedroom boffins the world over .
As is often the case when Bowie expresses an interest , it is likely to be the phenomenon 's death knell .
( See also his drum'n'bass album , Earthling , which killed the genre off in one easy stroke . )
The bootleg has long been part of pop 's inventive trajectory .
In the late 80s , the very first superstar DJ , Sasha , used to bring his Saturday night set at The Hacienda to a searing climax by running the vocal track of Whitney Houston 's I Wanna Dance with Somebody over the instrumental of The Associates ' noir pop gem , Party Fears Two .
Inventive DJs throughout the rave era would copy the trick , using soulful vocal tracks over unconnected , bleepy instrumentals to hip - swivelling effect .
At the start of the new millennium , this technique reared its head again with the work of unassuming beat scientists Girls
On Top and Soulwax , who would conjoin two unrelated tracks like Lego , becoming twice the fun for everyone .
It was n't long before the practice became a recognisable commercial force .
American girl group TLC co - opted a little - heard bootleg of their album track , Unpretty , with Dennis Edwards ' terrace casual anthem ,
Do n't Look Any Further , for a b - side .
Sugababes rescued their entire career with Freak Like Me , an old Girls On Top bootleg of Adina Howard and Gary Numan , with its original producer Richard X at the helm .
The music channels MTV and Q regularly feature their own in - house cut - ups of tracks .
Soulwax sold more than a million copies of their jaunty 2 Many DJs album , though disco snobs dismissed the project as club culture 's very own Jive Bunny , surely the unfashionable godfather of all this mash - up madness .
Brian Burton , a west coast production spod calling himself Dangermouse , has caused legal ripples through the music industry this year by conjoining the music from the Beatles White album to the lyrical flow of Jay - Z 's The Black Album , dubbing the ambitious project The Grey Album .
Geddit ?
More than a million downloaders did .
To consolidate his position as embarrassing uncle dancing at a wedding party , Bowie has missed the point of bootlegging .
The software available on his website has made it possible only to download an old vocal over one of the instrumentals from his recent noddingly greeted Reality album .
So Ziggy Stardust can only do battle with some ropey track in which no one was especially interested in the first place .
The whole point of bootlegging is to double the recognition , not halve it .
As if things could n't get more corporate , not only is Dame David attempting to resurrect a forgotten album by embracing an underground manoeuvre that has long since crossed over to the mainstream , but the whole thing is sponsored by Apple , who are making the winning track available for download at its iTunes stores .
The winner will receive a paltry Â£ 6,000 worth of equipment .
This is little compensation for having to sit through the whole of Reality ."
2004-05-08,"Somalian model
Iman is reported to have abruptly ended her contract with the diamond giant De Beers over a conflict of ethics .
Concerns that the corporation is exploiting the rights of the Bushmen of Botswana have prompted Iman , wife of singer David Bowie , to step down , the human rights organisation Survival International said yesterday .
The model , who showcased jewellery at the Cannes Film Festival last year at the diamond company 's annual party , will not be travelling with them this year .
De Beers controls Botswana 's diamond mining through a joint venture with the government .
The company 's desire to have full claims to the deposits under the Bushmen 's land in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve has led to the government decision to evict the Bushmen from their ancestral land , according to charges by Bushman organisations and human rights groups .
Iman criticised the forced relocations of the Bushmen in an interview last month . '
It was clear that the Bushmen were being destroyed - you take people from their element and you end up with Aids , drugs and alcohol in the guise of advancement , ' she said .
Iman 's spokesman at her cosmetics company in New York declined to comment on the Survival International announcement ."
2004-05-10,"Music lovers are familiar with dramatic images of their idols strutting their stuff on stage or perhaps creating another classic in the studio .
But an exhibition opening this week affords some rarer glimpses into the domestic lives of rock and pop icons .
Among the images on display is one of David Bowie , posing splendidly in bright platform shoes in his son 's equally lurid pink bedroom in suburban Kent .
There is also a poignant image of a young John Entwistle , who died two years ago after a night of debauchery with a Las Vegas stripper , strumming a guitar in his mother 's living room in west London as she gets on with her darning .
The exhibition , entitled Thirty Flight Rock ( a play on the Eddie Cochran song Twenty Flight Rock ) marks the 30th anniversary of the foundation of Genesis Publications which specialises in books on rock and pop .
It features the work of some of the most noted rock photographers , including Mick Rock who took the shot of Bowie , which has never been published before in a newspaper .
Rock recalls how he spent an afternoon with Bowie at his home in Beckenham , south - east London , in 1972 shortly before the release of the Ziggy Stardust album . ""
He had no one to do his make - up or hair , and no stylist , "" said Rock . ""
He did it all himself .
"" The shots were taken in the bedroom of the star 's baby son because both singer and photographer adored the pink colour .
The photographer Colin Jones , who took the picture of the former Who guitarist Entwistle , remembers arriving at a council house in Ealing for a shoot .
He said : "" John 's mum was watching the telly and darning his socks so I did the shot of them together "" .
The cosiness of the picture is all the more poignant knowing how Entwistle died .
Also featured in the exhibition are photographs of Rod Stewart reclining in bed at his Beverly Hills house with a cat in 1976 , Pete Townshend sitting in his flat surrounded by smashed guitars , and the Beatles in their early days at a fairground in Hamburg .
The exhibition runs from Thursday until June 2 at The Plattform at Saab Piccadilly , 77 , Piccadilly , central London .
It can also be seen from June 18 - 22 at Park Rock , Castle Boulevard , Nottingham ."
2004-06-19,"Craft costs next to nothing , and you do n't need tons of time .
The materials are all around you - look in the loft or in charity shops for an old table ; search your cupboards for scarves and magazines .
Today 's craft is cool : galleries from Tate Liverpool to the V&amp;A are showing it ; the rebel craft duo behind Tatty Devine have opened a boutique in Soho selling it ; Madonna , David Bowie , Donna Karan and AgnÃ¨s B are all collectors .
"" The silly distinctions between art and decorative arts are falling down , and rightly so , "" says Gwyn Miles of the V&amp;A.
Rarely has the craft scene been so inspiring , nor its make - do - and - mend ethos so appealing : if you want to do your best for the environment , start by recycling old furniture instead of buying new .
But the real joy of craft is its feelgood factor .
Seeing the finished article is like getting a wage rise , having a massage and kissing someone very good - looking , all rolled into one .
Here are two projects to get you started .
Deco chest of drawers Decoupage involves cutting out pictures , sticking them to a surface then finishing with a varnish or lacquer .
( The word comes from the French , which means to cut out . )
It first became popular in the 18th century , when demand for hand - painted furniture outstripped supply .
Ladies began to collage images on their furniture to give the illusion of hand - painting .
It was first seen as a poor man 's art but soon became recognised in its own right .
You can decoupage wood , painted surfaces , walls , even Formica , though this requires speciality paint .
You will need ... Â· Medium - grade sandpaper , a damp cloth and a pair of scissors . Â·
Satin wood acrylic - based paint ( for Formica surfaces , use melamine paint ) .
Â· Soft paintbrushes ( try B&amp;Q
Fine
Finish three - brush pack , Â£ 7.98 ) .
Â· Pictures , postcards , wrapping paper for your image ( Paperchase is good ) . Â· 3 M Photo Mount Adhesive ( available from Paperchase , Ryman or any art shop , Â£ 6.45 for 200ml ) . Â·
A quick - drying , clear wood varnish ( try Homebase Quick Drying Clear Varnish , Â£ 3.49 for 250ml ) . Â·
Shellac ( available from Paperchase , priced Â£ 3.50 for 35ml ) .
The process 1 Find a piece of furniture to work on .
Flat surfaces are best and something small for your first project , such as a coffee table or tray .
Look for an appealing shape and do n't worry about the surface condition .
Beware of chairs as they can be fiddly .
2 Remove any knobs , then sand lightly and evenly with a medium - grade paper .
If working on a painted surface , sand enough to roughen it , so a new layer of paint will stick .
3 Blow off the dust and give it a quick wipe with a damp cloth .
It can be messy so put down newspaper .
4
When the surface is dry , paint using swift , even strokes along the grain of the wood ( or in one direction if it 's a smoother surface ) .
5 Cut out your pictures .
Nail scissors help with intricate shapes .
Any images will do , but wrapping paper is good for repeat patterns .
I colour - copied a secondhand scarf for this chest of drawers .
6 Paint the images with a thin coat of Shellac .
This is a quick - drying lacquer derived from an animal resin , which seals the paper .
If you do n't use it , the paper will stretch and crease when you varnish .
When spraying this or the adhesive , wear a mask and/or work outdoors .
7 When the Shellac and painted surfaces are dry , spray the back of the images with photo mount .
This makes them sticky but moveable , so you can decide where they look best .
As a rule , less is more .
I started off with three times as many flowers ( which looked awful ) before scaling down to three .
Remember where knobs or handles go .
8 Press your images down firmly .
Varnish over the whole surface .
Matt or satin finishes tend to look classier .
9 Leave the varnish until dry .
Then paint five or six layers on at intervals .
The more layers you paint , the smoother the finish will be .
10
It 's worth buying new knobs for dressers or wardrobes .
I used clear glass knobs from Bombay Duck ( Â£ 3.75 each , 020 - 8749 8001 ) .
Vintage scarf cushions Using vintage scarves is a failsafe way of achieving the eclectic look championed by Elle Decoration and Cath Kidston .
It also means you do n't need to finish the edges of the cloth ( less sewing - hurrah ) .
The flimsy scarf material can be stiffened with Vilene , which irons on and stops your vintage rosebuds from sliding about all over the place .
Most compelling of all is the fact that , according to a WI book of the 1970s , making cushions is "" well within the scope of the average needle woman . ""
There you go .
No excuse .
You will need ... Â· Two same - sized scarves . Â·
Lightweight Vilene to cover both scarves ( this is a thin , fusible material which makes delicate cloth more durable , Â£ 2.10 per m from haberdashers , including John Lewis ) .
Â· Pins , a needle ( a sewing machine is handy ) and matching thread . Â·
Matching plastic zip , 10 cm smaller than the edge of the cushion . Â·
Cushion pad ( down filling is best , unless you 're allergic to feathers ) .
The pad should be the same size as your scarves , though your finished cover will be slightly smaller .
This will ensure the cushion looks "" puffy "" .
The process 1 Cut a piece of Vilene the same size as each scarf .
Iron one to the wrong side using a low temperature setting .
2 Place the scarves right sides together and pin around the edges .
You 'll be glad you used Vilene , as the cloth wo n't move around here .
3 Stitch three sides of the cover and 5 cm in on each side of the last edge , leaving about 1.5 cm between your stitch line and the edge of the cloth .
The remaining hole is for the zip .
You can hand sew the lot , using small stitches ( draw a line on the fabric to keep yourself straight ) - therapeutic and possible while watching TV .
( Machine sewing is quicker , but you 'd need to sew in the zip first , then the other seams . )
4
Iron the seams open and iron back the 1.5 cm seam allowance left around the opening , then bag out the cushion cover , poking corners through with a finger .
5
Push your cushion pad through the hole .
Hold it tight
so it does n't stretch the seams .
6
Pin the zipper to the opening
, so the teeth sit on the fold line .
Hand sew both sides of the zip and make sure you are just stitching one layer of the fabric .
7 Fasten the zip , then pat yourself on the back"
2004-06-25,"Diamond Dogs , groaning under its conceptual baggage of mad - dog apocalypse , seemed vaguely unsatisfying on its release in 1974 , but it emerges from this refurbished twin - disc edition as one of the most interesting episodes in Bowie 's career .
The album marked the point where he waved goodbye to Ziggy Stardust /
Aladdin Sane and began exploring a kind of Weimar soul music with lavish theatrical packaging , and the music still has one foot in the glam - rock camp , thanks to the rampant hit singles Rebel Rebel and Diamond Dogs .
But in addition there was the Broadway balladeering of Sweet Thing and Big Brother and the tingling drama of 1984 .
Disc two is crammed with curiosities , like a lewd demo of Candidate , the American single version of Rebel Rebel with wacky Latin percussion , and an incongruous cover of Springsteen 's Growin ' Up ."
2004-06-25,"Remember that fallow period of David Bowie 's , after Aladdin Sane and before the Thin White Duke strolled into view ?
Neither do I , but apparently there was one and during it , he narrated Peter and the Wolf , Prokofiev 's sweet little didactic fairy tale ( pop stars must have thing about Peter - Sting once narrated a puppet version ) .
Prokofiev , of course , wrote it partly to introduce children to the orchestra , so each animal is represented by different instrument .
Peter strings ) is out in the garden and meets the flute singing , the clarinet miaowing , the oboe quacking ; and when he ignores grandad bassoon 's warning , he has a nasty run - in with the big bad French horn in the woods .
Now I can hardly tell my cat from my duck , but Bowie takes his duties very seriously , keeps me up with all the action , and narrates beautifully - imagine what a hammy pig 's ear Mick Jagger would have made of it .
So just think , if he had n't been ravaged lord of rock , Bowie would have been brilliant on Jackanory ; and , in fact , this peculiar little project sits quite neatly in the Bowie oeuvre - his next album after the story of courageous Peter was Heroes . Â·

2004-07-07,"While trekking around the US recently , David Bowie and the Polyphonic Spree hatched a plan to record together .
Apparently Bowie envisaged a "" more theatrical "" version of his Queen collaboration , Under Pressure .
If the thought of anything more theatrical than Queen brings on a migraine , Tim DeLaughter 's acid - pop armada may not be for you .
Their entrance tonight is heralded by both a town crier and a harp solo .
Only after several minutes do the lights flash on to reveal 23 Texans in box - fresh , rainbow - hued robes .
With their white ones mothballed , they resemble less a melanin - deficient gospel choir than a race of beatific beings from an old episode of Star Trek , or the cast of an animated Bible story : Tim DeLaughter 's Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat .
Often a change of wardrobe is a means of distracting from creative stasis , and you 'd think the Polyphonic Spree would be in trouble now their novelty value has waned , but in fact they 're substantially better than before .
The arrangements are more nuanced , the performances more intense , the whole thing more bizarre .
The band 's kaleidoscope - eyed optimism has a delirious , genuinely psychedelic edge , like Syd Barrett or Brian Wilson when they were teetering on the lysergic precipice .
DeLaughter has a touch of Gene Wilder 's sinisterly messianic Willy Wonka , while the trombonist , who resembles a paunchy Jesus , stares at the crowd with an expression that seems to say , "" Stop me before I kill again . ""
Such sinister undercurrents keep kitsch from the door , and the same children on the balcony who are trampolining to ultra - bright favourites
like It 's The Sun are discombobulated by the clanging keyboards of Diamonds .
The longer songs sag , but the full - tilt encore , which bolts together Soldier Girl , Light and Day and Bowie 's Memory of a Free Festival , is overwhelming .
If the Polyphonic Spree are a one - trick pony , it 's one hell of a trick ."

2004-07-09,"David Bowie has undergone an emergency heart operation for an acutely blocked artery , it emerged last night .
The 57-year - old rock star fell ill after playing the Hurricane Festival in Scheessel , Germany , on June 25 , his spokesman said , and and had had an angioplasty procedure at a German hospital .
The spokesman said that Bowie had sought treatment for a pinched nerve in his shoulder but discovered the blocked artery . ""
Bowie , who was able to leave the clinic early this week , is now at home in New York convalescing with his wife and daughter and hopes to start work next month , "" he added .
The singer cancelled the 11 remaining dates on his European tour last month on doctors ' advice ; fans had been told he had a trapped nerve in his neck .
In a statement last night , Bowie said : "" I 'm so pissed off because the last 10 months of this tour have been so fantastic .
Ca n't wait to be fully recovered and get back to work again .
I tell you what , though , I wo n't be writing a song about this one . ""
A week before the heart scare Bowie narrowly escaped injury when he was hit in the eye by a lollipop thrown from the crowd during a concert in Oslo , Norway .
Bowie 's left eye was damaged in a playground fight 42 years ago , leaving his pupil permanently dilated .
His ill - fated 62-date tour was due to include an appearance at Glasgow 's T in the Park festival tomorrow ."
2004-07-12,"It does n't rain over the weekend - although it often threatens to .
The sun peeks sporadically from the dark clouds , and the wind occasionally rises , bringing the delightful scent of the nearby chicken farm to the disused air base that T in the Park calls home .
Combined with the withdrawal of Saturday night headliner David Bowie , the omens do not look good .
Still , while it often feels more like a lager promotion than a music festival - Tennent 's signs are everywhere - T in the Park has grown strong enough to take a few body blows .
Saturday sees the Libertines battle on without troubled guitarist Pete Doherty , Basement Jaxx bring on a catsuited Siouxsie Sioux and a host of party grooves , and the Darkness attempt to rebrand themselves as the new Queen - with some degree of success .
Sunday 's highlights shine more brightly , local heroes Franz Ferdinand packing their early set with angular grooves and real passion and the Killers providing some edgily anthemic thrills .
Sons and Daughters are even more impressive ; the Glasgow boy / girl four piece formed in 2001 , and debut album Love the Cup ( re - released this week ) is a compelling , otherworldly mix of driving new wave and scuzzy blues with an edge like a hacksaw .
Live , vocalist Adele Bethel shakes , dervish - like , while Scott Paterson plays his guitar in simple , sharp movements .
Ailidh Lennon 's scratchy mandolin gives their urgent sound subtlety and spark .

2004-08-16,"The most stupid thing I ever did in imitation of a pop star was putting a load of Uncle Ben 's in the blender in an attempt to recreate the "" rice powder "" with which the glam - era David Bowie allegedly attained his flawless pale complexion .
The resultant mess took a hell of a lot of cleaning up , and pretty much reconciled me to a non - glam healthy glow .
That , however , is nothing compared with the extremes to which fans of Papa Wemba , the Congolese singer who lives and works in Paris , are prepared to go .
Ever since their hero decided , in true Gypsy Rose Lee fashion , that "" you got ta get a gimmick "" , and that his gimmick would be horrible high - fashion clobber , they 've raided every couture house in Europe , and blow the cost .
This bizarre tale was recounted in a quietly brilliant BBC2 film , The Importance of Being Elegant ( Saturday ) .
Now , ripping off a Wilde title is a high - risk strategy , but in this case it was possible to overlook the clumsy pun and revel instead in the strangeness of a world utterly alien .
We met a cast of Francophone Africans with superstar names - The Archbishop , Anti - Gigolo , Poison - it was all very William Burroughs .
These handsome but insecure young men somehow raised thousands of euros each week to buy outfits so ridiculous the shopkeepers were laughing behind their backs .
Eight thousand for something that looked like glamorous roadkill ?
Pas de problÃ¨me .
At night , the Archbishop slunk home to a grotty little hostel in the suburbs , with only his designer threads to keep him warm .
If the fans were weird , then Papa Wemba was even weirder .
With an adoring entourage catering to his every need , he seemed to have confused himself with Jesus Christ , with whom he saw parallels .
He spoke to his followers of the need for religion and prayer , of an awareness of the afterlife , but did not extend this into any hard advice about the way they were living their lives .
He did n't , for instance , say "" stop wasting all your money on clothes that make you look as if you 've run amok in a charity shop "" .
Nor did he suggest that , when you have no job or home , you 're probably not getting your thousands of euros from particularly legit sources .
The Importance of Being Elegant raised more questions than it answered , particularly about money .
The Archbishop and his copains raised funds by "" hustling "" - not in the old - fashioned sense of the word , I suspect .
Details were scant , but Papa Wemba was aware that most of this business was monkey business .
He himself lived in remarkably humble circumstances for an international recording star , despite the massive fringe benefits of an impenetrable ritual of "" dÃ©dicaces "" , sung namechecks which were paid for in presents or cash .
Around the margins of this fragile world , shadows were gathering .
Papa Wemba had recently come out of prison , and awaits trial on charges of smuggling illegal immigrants into France .
The Archbishop , wardrobe or no wardrobe , faces deportation back to the Congo .
It was a mesmerising , not particularly pleasant study of obsession , of the power that leaders have over followers .
Behind the happy , jangly sounds of Papa Wemba 's music , and the jolly bobble hats and comedy clown pants , there beat a heart of darkness .
On a lighter note , Teenage Kicks :
The Story of the Boy Band ( Sunday , BBC1 ) cobbled together a lot of archive footage of grinning young men and the girls what love 'em , to prove ... nothing much , really .
I do n't know how these programmes keep getting commissioned , except , perhaps , as part of a charitable conspiracy to keep Les McKeown and Howard Donald in work .
So we got the Monkees , the ' Rollers , New Kids
On the Block , Take That , East 17 and a lot of very fat controllers , some of who looked as if they might give birth to brand new boy bands any minute .
There was nothing we did n't know already , nor much decent performance material , and I 'm still no nearer a final decision on whether TT or E17 were the best thing about Britain in the 90s .
Funnily enough they looked a lot less dated than John Major waxing prosaic about the ecstasy threat to our nation 's youth .
Everyone agreed that Busted were a good thing , including Lulu , and she should know , as she not only sang with Take That but also "" dated "" Monkee Davy Jones .
I 'd still like to know what Charlie 's hair is made of though , because I 've had Tressie dolls that look more natural ."
2004-09-16,"The BBC could be forced to share with the commercial world its radio archive , which includes treasures such as early Rolling Stones concerts and unreleased songs performed by David Bowie and Genesis in the early stages of their careers .
And if proposals by media regulator Ofcom make it into the statute books , the likes of Virgin , Capital or TalkSport could pick up recordings of classic comedies such as The Goon Show or children 's programmes such as Listen with Mother .
More than 750,000 programmes languishing in the BBC sound archive could be made available to commercial radio broadcasters in a bid to drive the take - up of digital radio , the media regulator suggested today .
In his first major speech on radio since he was appointed head of Ofcom , chief executive Stephen Carter said the proposals would help the take - up of digital radio in the UK by ensuring a "" critical mass "" of content and services .
Although the idea is still at a tentative stage , it is expected to be discussed further in the run - up to the BBC 's charter renewal in 2006 and could form a key plank in Ofcom 's own review of the UK digital radio marketplace scheduled to be published in November .
Under the proposals , local and commercial radio stations could be able to buy programmes from the BBC 's 80-year - old archive and incorporate them into their schedules .
"" Would non - discriminatory , non - exclusive access - for a fair payment - to the BBC sound archive allow commercial services to enhance their offering to the listening public ; and , crucially , do so without damaging the BBC 's ability and commitment to offer a strong digital radio service proposition ? ""
Mr Carter asked the audience of radio professionals .
In raising the question , the Ofcom chief executive said he was aware of the "" contentious "" nature of the proposals , particularly in the light of former BSkyB chief Tony Ball 's 2003 MacTaggart lecture , but said he hoped they would get an "" honest dispassionate appraisal "" , both within the BBC and outside it . ""
Michael Grade , Mark Thompson and the senior team at the BBC that has , rightly , regained its self - confidence , are looking constructively and imaginatively at new ways of releasing the value that is represented by the public venture capital invested in the BBC .
This may be another string to their bow . ""
In his address to the Edinburgh television festival , Mr Ball said BBC TV 's most popular programmes should be sold off to commercial rivals , in a memorable address that provoked more puzzled looks than fevered debate .
Though that idea died a quick death , the concept of making a state organisation share its assets , is already working in two areas , Mr Carter said .
Alluding to the break up of BT 's monopoly on domestic phone lines , the Ofcom chief said "" non - exclusive , fair - priced access "" was bringing greater choice to consumers .
Secondly , he said a successful model based on TV programmes already existed in the shape of UKTV , the joint venture channel between the BBC and Flextech .
Although UKTV was set up as an exclusive deal , with the advent of BBC3 and BBC4 , exclusivity was no longer its defining characteristic , he said .
"" Now , its continuing success is based on differential scheduling and different audience expectations of the commercial channels versus the public service broadcast channels .
That is my point : there is room for the same archive programming on both commercial and public service channels . ""
The BBC director of radio , Jenny Abramsky , said part of the corporation 's remit was to make BBC content available to the licence fee payers who own it .
She said the BBC was already making programming available via its audio - on - demand service and was "" in discussions with a number of other parties "" , about the BBC archive .
Commercial broadcasters , however , welcomed the idea .
Simon Cole , the chief executive of UBC Media , the radio company that owns digital station Classic Gold , said the proposal would help drive the take - up of digital radio .
"" We also welcome his suggestion that we should explore ways of making the BBC audio archive more readily available to other radio broadcasters , he said .
"" It is right that these programmes , which have been paid for by licence fee payers , should not be allowed simply to gather dust in some BBC vault .

The company today confirmed reports that appeared in the US press this morning that New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , who has already taken on the investment banking , mutual funds and insurance sectors , was turning his attention to the music industry .
The London - based record company confirmed today that it had received a request for information "" regarding practices in connection with the promotion of records on New York state radio stations "" .
"" We are cooperating fully with this inquiry , which is at a preliminary stage , "" it added .
Mr Spitzer has served subpoenas against Universal Music Group , Sony BMG Music , EMI Group and Warner Music , according to a report in the New York Times this morning . ""
EMI has a long - standing , strict written policy prohibiting unlawful radio promotion practices , and that policy was reaffirmed internally earlier this year .
EMI has no reason to believe that there will be any material financial impact on the company , "" the company said .
Mr Spitzer has requested information on the companies ' relationships with radio pluggers who serve as middlemen between music companies and radio stations , according to the Wall Street Journal .
US law forbids music companies from making undisclosed payments in exchange for airplay .
The legislation dates from the "" payola "" scandal of the 1960s when a series of DJs were investigated for accepting bribes from record labels to play particular records .
Two of the leading DJs of the time , Dick Clarke and Alan Freed , were implicated in the scandal and admitted to receiving cash and royalties from record companies for playing their records .
It is not the first time Mr Spitzer has targeted the music industry .
He secured $ 50 m in unpaid royalties to thousands of artists such as David Bowie and Dolly Parton in May.

Sir Elton , 57 , is as well known for his luxury lifestyle and temper tantrums as for a 35-year string of hits .
In the past two months he has twice hit the headlines - once for calling a group of photographers "" vile pigs "" at an airport , and later for heckling Madonna at a Q magazine awards ceremony , accusing her of lip - synching on her recent tour and announcing to the audience that anyone who lip - synchs "" should be shot "" .
During the famous fly - on - the - wall documentary Tantrums and Tiaras , made by his partner David Furnish , he stormed out of his hotel on the French Riviera after a female fan dared to wave at him on the tennis court .

2004-11-20,"The English painter William Nicholson deserves to be better - known than he is , but visitors to the current retrospective at the Royal Academy in London are soon confronted by a really famous name .
Below a Spanish landscape is the caption : Collection of David Bowie .
Later on , in another gallery , a vast military portrait is revealed to have belonged to Lord Beaverbrook .
Bowie and the heirs of Beaverbrook , though , are unusual in putting their name in the frame as owners of great paintings .
Unless pictures are on loan from galleries , most of the other white cards on the gallery walls are limited to the admission : Private Collection .
Self - advertisement or discretion is always a dilemma for collectors , and it will be intriguing to see , when the Tate Modern holds a Frida Kahlo show next year , whether Madonna , a significant Kahlo owner , is credited .
I saw Bowie 's name - check at the RA the day after coming back from the Moma reopening this week in New York .
Intending to reflect on the great names of modern art - Picasso , Matisse , Pollock , Warhol - I found myself drawn to the other names on the walls : the ( inevitably ) rich , ( frequently ) dead Americans who are immortalised in artistic institutions .
Reading the cards - "" Gift of Mr and Mrs Alex L Hillman ( by exchange ) and Lillie P Bliss Bequest ( by exchange ) "" - you glimpse the shadowy business of patronage .
The motivations of corporate sponsorship are easy to understand .
JP Morgan Chase and Banana Republic ( among others ) give money to Moma because the connection lends them cultural credibility and a place to host events .
But the thinking of individual patrons is more abstract .
We may guess that David Bowie likes to admit to his ownership of a Nicholson because it adds gravitas to his pop - star image .
The many who choose to keep their connection with pictures private presumably fear inviting the attention of burglars or begging - letters .
But what both "" Private Collection "" , David Bowie and Lillie P Bliss Bequest have in common is access to large sums of money : to become a big name in an arts institution it has been necessary to be a name on a big chequebook .
Even Jack Vettriano , the most accessible and populist contemporary artist , now sells to a rich elite : the People 's Painter is available to the people only through postcard reproductions .
Two current schemes , though , seek to democratise patronage .
Own Art , launched this week by the Arts Council , offers interest - free loans of up to Â£ 2,000 to members of the public who want to own a piece of culture .
The populist dream is that eventually we might see , at the Albert Square Art Gallery , the discreet caption - card : "" Gift of Mrs P Fowler in memory of Dot Cotton . ""
But the small collector would need considerable luck or judgment to buy significant pieces .
The cultural economy is similar to the finances of football in that superior commodities rapidly become available only to a super - rich elite .
An alternative for the smaller player hoping to make a mark on the arts is offered by the Wales Millennium Centre .
If you lack the funds to claim whole buildings in your name , you can name a bit of the new institution for Â£ 75 .
The Adopt a slate initiative in Cardiff offers a little sliver of immortality by buying one roof - tile .
My fantasy was that each slate would have the patron 's name stamped on it - making the Millennium Centre look from above like a version of Tracey Emin 's tent - but the foster - parents , as it were , of each panel will only be identified on a web - map in the lobby .
It 's a psychological commonplace that the motivation of artists is to paint on the great white wall of death some kind of graffiti saying : I was here .
And the patronage of art comes from a similar impulse : if you ca n't get your name on canvas , leave it on the wall or doors of a gallery .
Yet the immortality achieved by artistic patrons is a strange kind of fame .
When visitors to Moma look at the paintings of Pollock or Rothko , they have a sense of the human life behind them , no matter how enigmatic the images .
Captions and catalogues provide biography .
But the patrons and donors hang in space just as names : we know only that they must have been loaded .
But who were they ?
Did they buy from love of art or for investment ?
Modern curatorial techniques - x - rays and infra - red - can reveal almost everything about a painting : underdrawing and overpainting .
But the histories and motivations of the owners remain a mystery that adds another layer to the appreciation of art .

2005-01-31,"In the new Rough Guide to Choreography there 's a handy list of the buzziest , most influential partnerships of music and modern dance .
Michael Clark and the Fall are included , as are David Bowie and Lindsay Kemp .
And so are Shobana Jeyasingh and Michael Nyman for their 1988 collaboration , Configurations .
Now that Anglo - Asian fusions have become such a familiar part of the UK scene , it 's hard to remember how daring Configurations once looked .
Jeyasingh 's dancers seemed to occupy a radical middle distance between Indian temples and Islington , while the Balanescu Quartet belted out Nyman 's score .
At that time , when I talked to Nyman and Jeyasingh , both were reeling slightly from the cultural differences they had had to negotiate to get the work on stage .
But when I met up with them again recently to discuss their new project Flicker , both also acknowledged that the shock of Configurations had been a real turning point - not only for others but for them .
Nyman 's big problem in 1988 had arisen over numbers .
Back then , Jeyasingh 's choreography was still deeply rooted in the traditions of bharata natyam , a form in which the rhythmic structures of dance and music conform to the same strict mathematical sequence .
Even though she had wanted Nyman to compose the music for Configurations in his own idiom , she had , perhaps naively , expected him to pin his score on to the exact mathematical sequences of her choreography .
Despite thinking of himself as a numbers kind of composer , Nyman was shocked at the severity of the structure Jeyasingh had given him .
He still remembers the mix of panic and excitement it engendered in him : "" It was like working in a locked room .
I had to be as creative as possible to write something that was totally mine . ""
He ended up writing a string quartet ; it was , he says , "" the most rigid , unblinking , systematic piece I 'd ever written "" .
And yet for Jeyasingh , the score sounded unnervingly different from anything she had danced to before .
In fact , she was shocked to realise just how far away Indian and western music were from each other .
She could barely hear any of her dance rhythms embedded in its unfamiliar sound world .
"" I was terrified , "" she recalls .
"" I knew the information I needed was in there
but it was in such a strange place , I did n't know how to retrieve it .
My ears could n't pick it up .
"" At the time , Jeyasingh found herself waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat .
Now , though , she identifies Configurations as the moment when her career changed direction .
The process of attuning herself to Nyman 's score helped to inspire profound stylistic changes in her choreography , and gave her the confidence to work with an increasingly wide range of composers and designers .
Jeyasingh 's idiom is now at once so personal and so varied in its influences that the label Indian has become almost redundant .
Nyman , too , has widened his palette over the past 17 years , to include , among other things , collaborations with Indian and north - African musicians .
The new collaboration came about after the duo bumped into each other outside a hairdressers in London last year .
Although they decided to revisit Configurations , Jeyasingh says : "" We knew we 'd be working together in a completely different way . ""
At their first session together they talked a lot about that earlier work , but as they batted around some preliminary ideas about rhythm , Nyman says they realised that "" the numbers had lost their romance "" .
Jeyasingh , however , did have one very important number to give him - a telephone number in Limerick .
The number was for Jurgen Simpson , an electronics composer with whom Jeyasingh had previously collaborated .
Electronic music and imagery have come to play an important part in Jeyasingh 's work : she likes the tension that their speed and lightness create with her flesh - and - blood dancers .
And she feels that new technology is too much a part of her daily world to ignore .
"" For me it 's simply the way we live now , "" she says .
"" I do n't feel it 's a package that you can choose to put in your work or not . ""
Jeyasingh was keen to include Simpson in the new project with Nyman .
For Nyman , though , the idea was "" even more exotic than that list of rhythms she gave me in 1988 "" .
Before Jeyasingh had conned him into contact with an alien classical past ; now she was goading him towards an alien future .
Nyman admits , though , that he has always been interested in electronic music - he just has n't known how to get involved in it . ""
Western music culture is so subdivided into genres that there 's always seemed a huge gap between me and electronic music .
I 've never really understood its physical processes , I 've never known how to make an approach without seeming as if I was jumping on a bandwagon or appearing to lack faith in what I do . ""
Simpson 's telephone number turned out to be the answer .
As soon as the two composers started working together , Nyman was like a boy with new toy .
They began by feeding "" nuggets "" of Nyman 's raw music into a computer ( some taken from the score for Configurations ) ; then they played with the transforming effects that different electronic systems could produce .
"" Just half a bar of my music generated 20 minutes of sound , "" says Nyman , grinning widely .
"" With the material I gave him , Jurgen has produced something wildly beyond anything I could have imagined .
He has reinvented me .
He 's recreated me as a fully fledged electronic composer .
"" What 's more , Nyman 's own voice has been mediated in the finished tape .
"" There 's a kind of Nyman - ness there but the treatment and processing makes it shadowy , takes me somewhere else .
"" This migration of identity is very much what Flicker is about .
Jeyasingh has long been fascinated by the way in which people , voices and styles change over time and place .
This has been true of her own life as an Asian living in London , and as a classical Indian dancer turned modern choreographer .
Nyman , looking at her style 17 years after their last collaboration , is amazed by how different it is : "" All I can see is a vestigial memory of those hand gestures and head movements . ""
In creating Flicker , Jeyasingh has tried to sustain that idea of fluctuating identity .
Early on in the project Simpson and Nyman created a working tape to which Jeyasingh could choreograph .
But while she and her dancers were developing the movement in London , Simpson and Nyman were on the telephone - one in Limerick , the other travelling the world on tour - continuing work on the score .
As the project progressed , the music changed radically and the dance evolved its own "" narrative "" .
Eventually , the two had to meet again .
From that collision of voices more changes had to be accommodated , and a new identity forged .
Nyman , for instance , had ended the final section with a strictly written chorale ; in the meantime , Jeyasingh had structured her choreography so that it would end on a note of irresolution ( "" I wanted the feeling that the piece would carry on if only people were staying to watch it , "" she explains ) .
Nyman agreed to make the necessary change but there were other elements of the music 's voice over which Jeyasingh could have less control .
One strand of the score had been composed for live electric guitar and within certain parameters the musician , James Woodrow , was to be allowed to improvise during performances - something that still makes Jeyasingh feel nervous .
The coming - together of this piece has , Jeyasingh says , "" been a strange sensation .
With all of us being in such different places , all the elements have just been slowly shifting towards each other .
It 's postmodern going on science fiction .
"" This is a pretty good model for how she sees the melting and morphing of modern culture .
The process , she adds , "" has involved us in a lot of risks "" .
But for a couple whose first collaboration was plagued by night sweats and feelings of imprisonment , she and Nyman have come a long way .

2005-02-11,"Two of the best - known names in the UK music industry , PR company the Outside Organisation and former Sony chief Gary Farrow , have held talks about working together .
Mr Farrow , who is married to Sun columnist Jane Moore , left his position as vice - president of communications at Sony Music UK last week and is putting together new business ventures .
One of his business ideas was to buy Outside , founded by his friend of 25 years , Alan Edwards , who counts David Bowie , Paul McCartney , Westlife and Beverley Knight among his clients .
Mr Edwards told MediaGuardian.co.uk that the pair had talked about a deal but that there is nothing on the table right now .
"" I 'm not going to say something like that might not happen , because we 're friends , "" said Mr Edwards .
"" Gary is a friend of mine and we 're always talking about things , but who knows ?
We 've talked all our lives , we go back to when I was the PR for Hall and Oates and he was the promo man . ""
He added that he would entertain approaches for the company , but that it would have to be the right deal . ""
Every now and again someone comes along with a deal .
I have n't got a closed mind .
But it 's the sort of deal you only do once . ""
Mr Edwards added that he intended to continue working at Outside which has existed in various forms for more than 20 years , saying : "" It has been my life really . ""
Outside dominates music industry publicity but became more widely known through its former clients David and Victoria Beckham .
The Beckhams left the company last year , taking their long - standing PR woman Caroline McAteer with them , but she was soon ousted by a raft of other advisors . Â·

2005-02-26,"Tourism , along with its cousins hospitality and leisure , has always been an industry with a strong employer focus . ""
Although I would n't say that a student could walk from a masters degree into a better job straight away , one of the key things postgraduate study of tourism does offer is very close links to employers , "" says David Bowie , MSc programmes director in hospitality and tourism at Oxford Brookes University Business School .
"" In our case , these links are built up through things such as the sandwich placements we organise for undergraduates and masters students , and through the constant visits to the university by top industry players .
Postgraduates can only benefit from this contact .
"" There are around 40 universities offering some sort of postgraduate tourism degree , and as Chris Hall , head of services management at the graduate school of Bournemouth University , explains , the market is divided into two camps . ""
First , there are the small specialist programmes which are built around individual research interests , "" he says , "" and then there are the three or four large - scale players such as ourselves .
Our own position in the market was consolidated when about eight years ago we strengthened our research base by bringing in additional well - known academics .
Because of this we now offer six different MScs which include planning , marketing , hospitality and a specific European programme with a bilingual pathway .
"" This is one aspect of choosing to study tourism in the UK - it is going to be a multicultural experience , with an estimated 90 % or more of students coming from outside the UK .
As Chris Hall explains , with tourism accounting for 10 % of world GDP and providing 8 % of the planet 's employment , students from developing countries are looking to the UK among others to provide the intellectual rigour needed to support their industries .
One of Bournemouth 's major competitors is the University of Surrey School of Management .
Surrey has been offering tourism education for 40 years and offers MScs in tourism development , marketing and management as well as in international hotel management .
Other universities that are well regarded by their competitors in this field include Sheffield Hallam , London Metropolitan and Leeds Metropolitan .
Another major player is the Scottish Hotel School .
This is a major component of the University of Strathclyde 's Business School ( SBS ) and offers three postgraduate diplomas or MScs in tourism as well as one in international hospitality management .
Dr Dennis Nickson , director of research , says : "" At the Scottish Hotel School we have 60 years of developing a worldwide reputation among employers .
As part of SBS we partake of the broader academic reputation of the university as well as being able to bring a broad range of business expertise .
This enables us to focus on areas such as human resources in the tourism industry . ""

2005-03-11,"Win Butler and Regine Chassagne look nonplussed .
Their band , Arcade Fire , is winning praise from every corner .
David Bowie has already seen them play three times , and has declared their debut album , Funeral , his favourite record of the past 12 months .
David Byrne joined them on stage after hearing that they did a cover of his Talking Heads song
This Must Be the Place .
In Britain , critics have declared Funeral "" a masterpiece "" .
Now Butler and Chassagne are fending off offers of up to $ 1 m from record companies - even though they managed to make Funeral for just $ 10,000 .
"" I 'm pretty sure we 'd make a terrible record for $ 1 m , "" says Butler .
He 'd much rather downplay all the attention .
"" This is our first record , so it 's a bit weird .
It makes me suspicious .
A lot of the stuff we like gets panned . ""
He raises a sliver of a smile . ""
So maybe we 're doing something wrong .
"" There may not be anything wrong , but there is definitely something very odd about Arcade Fire .
The name comes from a story a friend told Butler and Chassagne about an inferno that claimed the lives of several children .
( Butler insists that it probably was n't true : "" I 've no evidence it happened , although things like that do , everywhere . "" )
More strangely , they have made a giddy , atmospheric , curiously uplifting album about death .
Real death .
At least three family members died while the album was being recorded ; some articles on the band have placed the body count as high as nine .
Sitting in a cafe in London , Butler and Chassagne betray little of the euphoria of their music .
She is tiny , almost silent but prone to eruptions of excitement .
He is a giant , and has the dry , quiet manner of an undertaker .
Perhaps this is what happens when you make an album about private affairs and emotions and then are faced with the task of repeatedly talking about it in public . ""
The songs were written before [ the deaths ] , so there 's not a one - to - one correlation , "" says Butler .
Bowie told the pair that the album contained a mysterious "" something else "" , but when I remind them of this it prompts one of Chassagne 's eruptions .
She 'd hate it , she says , if people thought the band were freaky : "" We 're not the Addams family . ""
Chassagne 's parents are from Haiti , but fled the country and "" Baby Doc "" Duvalier 's murderous regime for the safety of Montreal before she was born .
She met Houston - born Butler in 2000 .
At the time , she was playing medieval music in a band with recorders ( "" We played weddings , but not funerals "" ) and he was studying Genesis - the first book of the Bible , not the Phil Collins band .
"" It was n't the most popular major , "" Butler deadpans , "" but it is the basis of western civilisation so I thought it 'd be kinda interesting . ""
Butler had seen Chassagne singing at an art exhibition and made it clear he was , as he slyly puts it , "" interested in collaborating "" .
The relationship blossomed at the same time as the music .
Butler was into Dylan , Leonard Cohen and New Order and had already been in a band called the Sleep ; for Arcade Fire , the pair also called on Butler 's brother Will and multi - instrumentalists Richard Parry and Tim Kingsbury .
From the start they were raising eyebrows in Montreal , not only for the music on their demo tape , but because they performed alongside an electrified Christmas reindeer that they bought from K - Mart .
Everything was going swimmingly - and then people started dying .
The first was Chassagne 's grandmother , in June 2003 .
"" She 'd been sick for a long time , "" she says .
"" She had Parkinson 's .
She was mentally there but not physically .
She 'd say ' Come on , why do n't you take me ? '
So it was kind of refreshing when she died . ""
Butler and Chassagne married two months later , went to Trinidad and Tobago for their honeymoon and began recording .
Then Butler 's grandfather , Alvino Rey , died at the age of 95 .
In his life a famous bandleader , Rey is still with the band in a sense : My Buddy , a track he recorded in the 1940s , appears on the B - side of Arcade Fire 's first UK single .
"" It was kind of a tribute , "" says Butler .
"" He 'd grown up with Duke Ellington and when rock'n'roll came out in the 50s he felt the world was ending .
But towards the end of his life I heard him say : ' Bruce Springsteen 's music 's bad
but he 's a great performer . '
So he would have appreciated us ... a bit . ""
A month later , Parry 's aunt Betsy died .
By this point , the band were flitting between the recording studio and the funeral parlour .
Nor is this likely to be the last death :
Butler 's other grandfather - also 95 - is currently in hospital . ""
He was playing tennis until a year ago and he wanted something for the back pain .
The doctor explained that they could give him cortisone but that there 'd be long - term effects .
He said : ' I 'm 95 !
I 'm not worried about long - term effects ! ' ""
Butler bursts into laughter at the thought .
It would have been easy for the album to wallow in depression , but instead the music has something of Butler senior 's defiance of death and lust for remaining life . ""
If people find it uplifting that 's great , "" he says .
"" That 's better than saying it 's sad bastard music .
I listened to my share of early Cure . ""
He plays down the effects the deaths have had on their sound , pointing out that deaths happen around everyone .
But not , surely , with this level of frequency ? ""
One of the first short stories I wrote in school was just after my grandma died
and I went to her funeral , "" he finally admits .
"" I guess being exposed to death at that age has an effect . ""
A permanent sense of loss may explain the eerie vibe of lyrics such as "" ice has covered my parents ' eyes "" .
Chassagne explains that the line "" if all the stillborns formed an army "" in Une AnnÃ©e Sans LumiÃ¨re refers to "" all the babies killed and generations lost , compliments of Duvalier "" .
The character in The Backseat is her mother , another dearly departed .
However , some lines must remain shrouded in mystery , such as : "" Alexander , our older brother , set out for adventure , got bit by a vampire , we caught his tears in a cup . ""
"" Some things are best left unknown , "" says Chassagne .
"" It 's like if you look at a gem or a mirror .
If you turn it around you 'll see different things , different flashes . ""
Butler cheerily asserts his belief in some form of afterlife , pointing out that people are such specific personalities that it 's hard to imagine it all going to nothing .
One thing we wo n't see again , however , is the electric reindeer .
"" We had to leave it somewhere , "" he says with a sigh .
"" It died . ""

I sat in Sadler 's Wells theatre and listened to Roxy Music founder , top disc producer and professional visionary
Brian Eno give an illustrated lecture which included very fluent passages about the curatorial function in a world of increasing information sources , and something a bit hazier about David Bowie 's wedding .

2005-04-15,"Charles Kennedy may well be heading towards getting the musician 's vote .
For a party leader he is young ( born in 1959 , he joined the SDP at the age of 23 ) , his anti - war message has chimed with the artistically inclined , and Brian Eno , the shiny - pated electronic genius who helped give the early Roxy Music albums their decadence and wit , has launched a campaign telling people to vote for the Liberal Democrats .
Eno claims this is because of the party 's libertarian philosophy , but the fact that Kennedy 's favourite musician is David Bowie might have something to do with it . ""
David Bowie was a big adolescent influence , "" says Kennedy on Brian Eno 's old colleague . ""
And Station to Station is the record I would grab in an emergency .
I could n't imagine a day without music .
It relaxes and stimulates me in equal measure and I hate the sound of silence - the concept , I mean , not the track by Simon and Garfunkel . ""
Music has played an important part in Kennedy 's life from the beginning , and he continues to buy CDs - his most recent purchase is Fault Lines by the young Scottish folk singer Karine Polwart .
"" My dad is a prolific traditional West Highlander fiddle player , "" says Kennedy of his father , a crofter from Inverness .
"" So the sound of Gaelic songs and marches , strathspeys and reels were a daily occurrence throughout my childhood .
My mother introduced me to Frank Sinatra and classical music ; my elder siblings helped me discover pop and rock .
My tastes remain eclectic to this day . ""
Whether adolescent purchases of albums such Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield or Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel went on to serve as a key influence on Kennedy 's views on , say , student tuition fees is a moot point , but he does see a connection between his musical tastes and political views . ""
Music and politics are in essence about communication , "" he says .
"" Without over - stretching the analogy I do feel a sense of rhythm is important in getting your message across . ""
Is there music that can break through his statesmanlike objectivity and calm and well him up with emotion ?
"" I 'm not the tearful type as a rule .
The performance of Elgar 's Nimrod at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Remembrance Sunday , however , always brings a lump to the throat . """
2005-04-25,"As a former PR to David Bowie , music writer Chris Charlesworth was more than happy to be interviewed about the star 's career .

2005-05-27,"Any anxieties that Babel , the cliche - free independent , might turn away from the jazz tradition following the unexpected success of Acoustic Ladyland ( with its compellingly raw conjunction of free - jazz sax blasting and thrash - metal propulsion ) can be laid to rest by Partisans ' Max .
It 's as jazzy as a contemporary mixed - genre album can get , being the work of four improvisers determined to make up as much of the music on the fly as possible .
However , Partisans is a composers ' band , too : most of the pieces on Max are written by either saxophonist Julian Siegel or guitarist Phil Robson , with intentional contributions from Wayne Krantz and unintentional ones from Charlie Parker and David Bowie .
Twenty seconds of Parker 's Klactoveesedstene opens the music before the arrival of a fast theme - building conversation between Siegel 's tenor sax in Michael Breckerish mode and Milesian guest trumpeter Chris Batchelor , with Phil Robsons 's wah - wah guitar beneath .
Bowie 's John , I 'm Only Dancing , a Siegel arrangement , sounds like a 1980s Miles Davis fusion band with a D'Angelo rhythm - guitar feel thrown in , with Batchelor 's trumpet ( he appears on three tracks , as does percussionist Thebe Lipere and the excellent Hammond organist Jim Watson ) applying a fierce ascending intensity over Gene Calderazzo 's boiling drumming .
And , as always with Siegel , the restless , slithery melodic atmosphere and displaced resolutions of Wayne Shorter are always hovering in the shadows .
The strengths of this set are not only virtuosity but variety of resources .
The free - funk feel in the later stages of Krantz 's contribution mingles Robson 's metallic guitar sound with Siegel 's bass clarinet .
There 's a furious drive about Robson 's powerful Last Chance , with its heavy rock guitar riff and howling wah - wah break ; the bass clarinet lends it an oddly contrasting sobriety .
Some might find the soloing here a little hyperactively busy , the time - jumping fidgety and the themes somewhat less striking than the playing .
But Max is a different take on 21st - century postbop and fusion , openly declaring its allegiances but just as openly displaying the range of its home - grown alternatives ."
2005-06-24,"Madonna had just enjoyed her first UK number one hit - Into the Groove - only to be ousted by David Bowie and Mick Jagger who were Dancing in the Street for four weeks at the top of the charts .
And the lucky crop of 1985 teenagers heading off to university could illicitly record the chartbusters on a set of TDK blank cassettes handily supplied by Midland Bank as a thank - you for signing up to their student banking service .
Three blank audio cassettes hardly sounds much of a freebie today , but at the time it was quite a daring move - and hailed as "" worth Â£ 6 ! ""
Midland Bank has since transformed into HSBC , and 20 years on , its freebies have revolutionised , too .
This month it became the first bank to offer students a free MP3 player ( or 10 CDs of their choice ) if they sign up for their student service , plus a free BSM driving lesson and discounts on music , film and fashion deals .
Meanwhile , NatWest ( which claims to be the biggest bank among freshers ) is leading with a free five - year young person 's railcard ( worth Â£ 100 ) while Lloyds TSB is chewing over whether to relaunch its two - for - one curry offers .
Every year serious commentators tell students to "" ignore the freebies "" , but it 's advice that 's routinely disregarded .
The blizzard of freebies thrown at students by banks are on offer precisely because the banks know it 's the best way to capture the crucial student account market .
Around two - thirds of the accounts opened by students stay with the bank for life , so it 's no surprise the banks fight hard to grab a share of the market .
Halifax and Abbey steadfastly refuse to play the freebie game - and have been rewarded with a steadfastly small share of the student banking market .
RBS initially spurned the freebie game , but accepted the inevitable and started handing out discounts on holidays , CDs and videos from 1997 .
Every summer it 's the time of the year when the banks try to shed their grey image , get cool with the kids and capture that year 's zeitgeist , with varying degrees , so to speak , of success .
Indeed , the history of student freebies reads like a chronology of popular culture and fads .
In 1988 , with the economy and stockmarket booming , Barclays played the yuppie card with that year 's must - have accessory - a filofax .
The following year it was throwing Â£ 30-worth of Next Directory vouchers at potential student customers .
Then , as the price of electronics tumbled , the banks moved up from blank cassettes to something to play them on - with a host of Sony Walkman lookalikes on offer .
Once the early 1990s recession began to bite the banks cottoned on to what students most crave - a naked cash bribe .
NatWest led the way in 1987 with a Â£ 12 credit to new student accounts .
By 1995 , Barclays had upped that to Â£ 25 , only to be leapfrogged in 1997 by Â£ 35 from NatWest .
In the late 1990s the banks turned to phones .
Midland was first in 1996 with a BT charge card , worth Â£ 40 , while NatWest offered a BT EasyReach pager .
Quite why students would want a pager seemed to have passed NatWest aside ; there was probably a limit to how much a student wanted to see "" Are you all right ?
Love Mum "" displayed on their pagers .
Barclays seemed to capture the mood somewhat better that year , being the first to offer students a free mobile phone in a deal with Cellnet .
Since then , technology has vied with back - to - basics offers , such as NatWest 's 2002 starter kit of a kettle , toaster and alarm clock .
Students today require degree - level skills in financial management to juggle mounting loans and debt , and putting the freebies aside , the biggest worry is whether the bank is going to indulge their overdraft .
Proximity of a branch and cash machines on or near campus is also an important consideration .
This year 's student accounts typically offer either a Â£ 1,000 ( Lloyds TSB , HSBC and Abbey ) or a Â£ 1,250 ( NatWest , RBS and HBOS ) interest - free overdraft in the first year with increasing amounts in each subsequent year .
Barclays , although it has not yet released its 2005 student package , was last year 's laggard ; it does n't immediately offer an interest - free overdraft - the student has to apply in person .
But once accepted , they should get as much as Â£ 1,500 .
What 's really important , however , is what interest rate you 'll have to pay if you go over the agreed interest - free amount .
With most accounts , you 'll pay one rate of interest - the "" authorised "" or "" agreed "" rate - if your account goes beyond the interest - free limit .
It 's vital , though , to contact the bank first before going further overdrawn .
NatWest is perhaps the most indulgent ; it may negotiate a higher interest - free overdraft facility and still charge you zero interest .
The next best for an authorised overdraft is HSBC , which charges 1 % over base rate ( so , currently 5.75 % ) , followed by 7.2 % at HBOS , 7.4 % at Lloyds TSB and 9.64 % at RBS .
If you simply go further into the red without asking first , you will be hit with a punitive "" unauthorised "" rate of interest .
Take a deep breath for the unauthorised rates ; they are 14.8 % at HSBC , 17.81 % at NatWest , 24.2 % at HBOS , 29.8 % at Lloyds TSB and 29.84 % at RBS .
For students on longer courses , it 's worth checking that your bank will allow you to continue with an interest - free overdraft after the first five years .

Three blank audio cassettes hardly sounds much of a freebie today , but at the time it was quite a daring move - and hailed as "" worth Â£ 6 ! ""
Midland Bank has since transformed into HSBC , and 20 years on , its freebies have revolutionised , too .
This month it became the first bank to offer students a free MP3 player ( or 10 CDs of their choice ) if they sign up for their student service , plus a free BSM driving lesson and discounts on music , film and fashion deals .
Meanwhile , NatWest ( which claims to be the biggest bank among freshers ) is leading with a free five - year young person 's railcard ( worth Â£ 100 ) while Lloyds TSB is chewing over whether to relaunch its two - for - one curry offers .
Every year serious commentators tell students to "" ignore the freebies "" , but it 's advice that 's routinely disregarded .
The blizzard of freebies thrown at students by banks are on offer precisely because the banks know it 's the best way to capture the crucial student account market .
Around two - thirds of the accounts opened by students stay with the bank for life , so it 's no surprise the banks fight hard to grab a share of the market .
Halifax and Abbey steadfastly refuse to play the freebie game - and have been rewarded with a steadfastly small share of the student banking market .
RBS initially spurned the freebie game , but accepted the inevitable and started handing out discounts on holidays , CDs and videos from 1997 .
Every summer it 's the time of the year when the banks try to shed their grey image , get cool with the kids and capture that year 's zeitgeist , with varying degrees , so to speak , of success .
Indeed , the history of student freebies reads like a chronology of popular culture and fads .
In 1988 , with the economy and stockmarket booming , Barclays played the yuppie card with that year 's must - have accessory - a filofax .
The following year it was throwing Â£ 30-worth of Next Directory vouchers at potential student customers .
Then , as the price of electronics tumbled , the banks moved up from blank cassettes to something to play them on - with a host of Sony Walkman lookalikes on offer .
Once the early 1990s recession began to bite the banks cottoned on to what students most crave - a naked cash bribe .
NatWest led the way in 1987 with a Â£ 12 credit to new student accounts .
By 1995 , Barclays had upped that to Â£ 25 , only to be leapfrogged in 1997 by Â£ 35 from NatWest .
In the late 1990s the banks turned to phones .
Midland was first in 1996 with a BT charge card , worth Â£ 40 , while NatWest offered a BT EasyReach pager .
Quite why students would want a pager seemed to have passed NatWest aside ; there was probably a limit to how much a student wanted to see "" Are you all right ?
Love Mum "" displayed on their pagers .
Barclays seemed to capture the mood somewhat better that year , being the first to offer students a free mobile phone in a deal with Cellnet .
Since then , technology has vied with back - to - basics offers , such as NatWest 's 2002 starter kit of a kettle , toaster and alarm clock .
Students today require degree - level skills in financial management to juggle mounting loans and debt , and putting the freebies aside , the biggest worry is whether the bank is going to indulge their overdraft .
Proximity of a branch and cash machines on or near campus is also an important consideration .
This year 's student accounts typically offer either a Â£ 1,000 ( Lloyds TSB , HSBC and Abbey ) or a Â£ 1,250 ( NatWest , RBS and HBOS ) interest - free overdraft in the first year with increasing amounts in each subsequent year .
Barclays , although it has not yet released its 2005 student package , was last year 's laggard ; it does n't immediately offer an interest - free overdraft - the student has to apply in person .
But once accepted , they should get as much as Â£ 1,500 .
What 's really important , however , is what interest rate you 'll have to pay if you go over the agreed interest - free amount .
With most accounts , you 'll pay one rate of interest - the "" authorised "" or "" agreed "" rate - if your account goes beyond the interest - free limit .
It 's vital , though , to contact the bank first before going further overdrawn .
NatWest is perhaps the most indulgent ; it may negotiate a higher interest - free overdraft facility and still charge you zero interest .
The next best for an authorised overdraft is HSBC , which charges 1 % over base rate ( so , currently 5.75 % ) , followed by 7.2 % at HBOS , 7.4 % at Lloyds TSB and 9.64 % at RBS .
If you simply go further into the red without asking first , you will be hit with a punitive "" unauthorised "" rate of interest .
Take a deep breath for the unauthorised rates ; they are 14.8 % at HSBC , 17.81 % at NatWest , 24.2 % at HBOS , 29.8 % at Lloyds TSB and 29.84 % at RBS .
For students on longer courses , it 's worth checking that your bank will allow you to continue with an interest - free overdraft after the first five years .

2005-06-26,"She 's been called the ' godmother of punk ' , ' the female equivalent of David Bowie ' and the ' poet laureate of punk rock ' .
And last night , Patti Smith ended 30 years of anticipation when she finally performed her seminal album Horses for the first time at London 's Royal Festival Hall .
Horses has been deemed ' the album which shakes a generation ' , not to mention one of the finest debut albums of all times .
Expectation was high and , unsurprisingly , the show itself was one of the hottest tickets in town ; all 2,800 sold out within two hours of going on sale earlier this year .
Patti Smith herself is nothing short of an icon .
Musician , poet , and friend of William Burroughs , Susan Sontag , Jimi Hendrix and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe - to name but a few .
Opening for Patti Smith was legendary producer of Horses , artist and former member of the Velvet Underground , John Cale , together with his ' special friends ' , including Flea , the bassist with the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Beginning with a reading , Cale launched into some of his best known tracks , among them , Hanky Panky and Over Her Head .
At times eerie , Cale 's powerful , beautiful voice perfectly complemented the eight - piece musical collective he 'd assembled on stage .
And then it was time .
Dressed in grey jeans , an oversized men 's suit jacket , white shirt and tie , and ' new brown boxer boots ' , 58-year - old Patti Smith took to the stage on London 's Southbank to a standing ovation .
She retains her unique sexiness and showed no signs of ageing gracefully , spitting and swearing her way through a 90-minute set .
The crowd went crazy for her .
Smith was joined by a band made up of several members of Television and at times , the ubiquitous Flea .
With this performance , Smith hoped to ' infuse the innocence that was there in its ( Horses ) inception ... with 30 years of experience ' .
She achieved that , and more .
Before her first track , Gloria , had finished , the seated crowd were clamouring at the front of the auditorium and did n't sit down until the lights came up .
The stellar performance marked the penultimate night of the annual Meltdown Festival , supported by The Observer and this year guest - directed by Smith herself - an experience she described as ' the most social of her life ' ."
2005-07-07,"Joseph Arthur 's career has been blighted by an attack of that nebulous thing known as critical acclaim - a back - handed way of saying the records are good but no one 's buying them .
On a new label , his fourth album sees him opening up ; it deserves more concrete rewards .
Arthur shrugs off the restrictive definitions of what a singer - songwriter should do : he draws on grunge but does n't really make rock music ; there are even echoes of David Bowie and Peter Gabriel , his early mentor .
Puppets has a thunderous rolling beat and ethereal choral harmonies ; Ca n't Exist initially seems a self - conscious stab at a radio - friendly single , until its simple , chiming chords rupture in a tenebrous squall .
Echo Park and the spooked ripples of In Ohio and A Smile
That Explodes are folkish and fragile .
If at first the songs feel ordinary , perseverance reveals the haunting quality of Arthur 's imagery , and the rich patina of his careworn voice ."
2005-07-15,"Brian MacLaurin , one of the media 's most well - known public relations men , has joined showbusiness PR agency
The Outside Organisation as a non - executive director .
Mr MacLaurin , who recently parted company with Richard Desmond after five years of handling the Express owner 's PR , will work with Outside chief executive Alan Edwards to build the company .
Mr Edwards - whose clients include David Bowie , Paul McCartney and Beverley Knight - said he was keen to tap the experience of Mr MacLaurin , who built and then sold his own business .
Mr MacLaurin now runs Brian MacLaurin Associates but in 2001 he sold his former business to Hatch Group for Â£ 6 m , pocketing around Â£ 4 m in the process .
Earlier this year , Outside discussed working with the former Sony chief , Gary Farrow , who was looking for investment opportunities following his departure from the record company .
At the time , Mr Edwards said he would entertain approaches for Outside but the company he founded remains firmly in hands .
"" We are a high - profile business because of our incredible client base and we hope to be able to use that profile to move into new areas , "" Mr Edwards said today .
Mr MacLaurin is now free from the significant time demands of servicing Mr Desmond and is once again at liberty to work with his former PR partner , Ian Monk , the ex - Daily Mail and Express executive .
As part of their severance deal from Hatch , the pair - who have acted for high - profile clients such as Wayne Rooney , Chris Tarrant and Cherie Blair 's adviser Carole Caplin - were prevented from joining forces and so set up separate businesses .
They are planning to work together but will maintain their separate companies .

2005-07-16,"When Seu Jorge lopes downstairs , having overslept his afternoon 's press schedule into disarray , the first thought that occurs is that anyone casting a biopic of Ruud Gullit need look no further .
In person , Jorge , 35 , resembles not at all the hapless explosives expert Pele Dos Santos , who spends Wes Anderson 's The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou wearing a funny red woollen hat and crooning old David Bowie songs in Portuguese .
The Seu Jorge that saunters into the hotel lobby is tall , slender , stitched into a tight black suit , and topped with an eruption of dreadlocks more becoming his parallel career as a musician - a musician who , prior to being offered the role of Santos , did not number Bowie among his influences .
"" No , "" he says .
"" I only knew Let 's Dance . ""
Rather charmingly , he sings a bit of this by way of illustration .
The night before , Jorge had played at a party to launch the DVD of The Life Aquatic .
His set had been a mix of the upbeat Brazilian pop that dominates his current album , Cru , and Bowie songs from the film .
Even removed from Anderson 's whimsical parallel universe for which they provided a soundtrack , Jorge 's interpretations sounded lovely - with Bowie 's daft cosmic doggerel removed , and with Jorge 's languid croon added , the tunes assume an otherworldly life of their own , Life On Mars and Rebel Rebel in particular .
I 'd wondered , though , if translation had been a problem ( Jorge does interviews with a translator - his English is better than he thinks it is , but he 's not confident ) .
"" I changed the words quite a lot , "" he says .
"" I wanted each song to be about a different character .
So , Lady Stardust is about Ned Plimpton [ Owen Wilson 's character ] wanting to be a good father , and Changes is about Steve Zissou
[ Bill Murray 's thinly - veiled homage to Jacques Cousteau ] changing himself as a person , although nobody who does n't speak Portuguese is going to know that . ""
Jorge came to the attention of Wes Anderson , and everyone else , via City Of God - the 2002 film set in the infamous slums ( favelas ) of Rio .
For much of the cast , imagining themselves into their roles was n't difficult .
The visceral verite of City
Of God sprang from its deployment of residents of the favelas , of whom Jorge was one .
He has made the leap from Rio 's violent , squalid back - blocks to an A - list ensemble cast - The Life Aquatic starred , aside from Murray and Wilson , Cate Blanchett , Willem Defoe , Anjelica Houston , Jeff Goldblum and Michael Gambon - with remarkable insouciance . ""
The other actors were ... curious , "" he smiles .
"" They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that .
I said unfortunately they 're much worse . ""
He stresses , however , that the past interests him less than the future .
Hyperactively twitchy even as he sits and talks , he has more songs he wants to sing , and more films he wants to make , one in particular .
"" My father , "" he explains , "" is a big fan of westerns .
I 'd love to be able to bring him to the cinema to see a western with me in it . """
2005-08-22,"Online music fans will for the first time be able to legally share tracks by big names such as Oasis , Beyonce , David Bowie and Elvis Presley after the artists ' record label signed a ground - breaking deal with a new internet service provider .
In what some see as signalling a dramatic shift in the way consumers buy music , the provider , Playlouder , has licensed acts from SonyBMG , the world 's second largest record label , and is confident that the other two big record labels , Universal and EMI , will follow suit .
Illegal file sharing , which allows users of software such as Kazaa , Grokster and eDonkey to swap pirated tracks over the internet , has been blamed by the record industry for largely contributing to a 25 % slump in global sales since 1999 , worth around Â£ 1.3bn a year .
The record industry has pursued a "" carrot and stick "" approach , taking legal action against the worst offenders while encouraging the use of legal download sites such as Napster and iTunes .
In June , Sylvia Price , 53 , of Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , was forced to pay Â£ 2,500 compensation for around 1,400 songs downloaded by her daughter , Emily , 14 , on the family 's home computer ; and in March , 23 file sharers agreed to pay Â£ 2,200 each in compensation for uploading their music libraries on to the internet for others to copy .
Playlouder is offering the first legal alternative with a comparable experience to the "" peer to peer "" file sharing sites often used to swap pirated tracks .
Subscribers will be charged Â£ 26 a month for a high speed broadband internet connection , similar to the price charged by BT , with the added attraction of being able to share as much music as they want with other subscribers at no extra cost .
Because there will be no restrictions on the format in which the traded music is encoded , users will be free to transfer songs to any type of digital music player , including the market leading Apple iPod , or burn them to CD .
However , not only will consumers have to pay for music which they currently acquire free , albeit illegally , but they will also have to change their internet provider .
After signing the UK licensing deal with SonyBMG , whose acts also include George Michael , Bruce Springsteen and Dido , Playlouder 's chief executive , Paul Hitchman , is confident that its big rivals will follow suit .
It has already signed deals with dozens of independent labels affiliated to the Association of Independent Music , representing artists such as the White Stripes , Franz Ferdinand and Dizzee Rascal .
AIM 's chief executive , Alison Wenham , said the idea was a "" simple but radically different solution to the means of accessing music on the internet "" .
Because all Playlouder subscribers will share tracks over its own network Mr Hitchman said that the company could track the files and , through digital fingerprinting technology , make sure that record companies were remunerated accordingly from money set aside from Playlouder 's revenues each month .
He said he believed that the service , to be launched next month , "" could well be the most important development in digital distribution since the invention of the MP3 format "" .
Some record company executives have been wary of such deals because they fear it could reduce their ability to market big selling acts on a global basis .
But conversely , it could also increase their revenues from back catalogue tracks .
Playlouder claims that if all ISPs adopted its model , the record industry would make an additional Â£ 300 m a year in the UK alone .
Other companies , including one set up by the former Grokster president Wayne Rosso , have been working on legal versions of peer to peer file sharing .
But Mr Hitchens claimed that while they would allow sharing , if customers wanted a high quality version , they would have to pay extra .
The British Phonographic Industry , which has imposed fines of up to Â£ 6,500 each on 60 file sharers found to be making thousands of pirated tracks available to others and is taking five more to court , welcomed the development . ""
Ensuring record companies are adequately and reliably compensated for the use of their copyrights on the internet is the number one issue for our business , "" said the BPI 's chairman , Peter Jamieson ."
2005-09-23,"Take the Beatles , David Bowie , the Sex Pistols , Oasis and Shakin ' Stevens and get ready to throw them on to the historical bonfire .
According to an announcement this week from the people behind the Guinness Book Of Records , the most successful British rock act of all time is - no , really - Status Quo .
The rather crude yardstick used for this accolade was the group 's number of hit singles , which totals a jaw - dropping 61 .
Just beneath them lurk Queen ( with 52 ) and the Rolling Stones ( 51 ) .
For Mick and Keith , the news must have come with the dull thud of a pyrrhic victory , since they actually finished on level pegging with UB40 .
Somewhere in the hereafter , Brian Jones must have allowed himself a giggle at that one .
But what of the Quo ?
In the minds of the kind of people who bring Talking Heads CDs to parties , their apparent popularity doubtless brings to mind Nietzschean notions of the inanity of the herd and the eternal attraction of bad art .
There may , I suppose , be something to all that -
but I 'd rather set it to one side and consider their unlikely charms .
As it happens , I know a bit about all this , having once spent some time writing a New Yorker - length history of the group for Mojo magazine .
This involved watching the latter - day Quo entertain yuletide crowds in Manchester and Liverpool , and interviewing their dual monarchy , Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi .
I also spent time with their onetime drummer John Coghlan , who these days puts in occasional appearances with a tribute band called "" State of Quo "" , and had a long conversation with their ex - bassist Alan Lancaster , who was forced out of the group in the wake of their show - opening appearance at Live Aid .
He was , by some distance , the most bitter musician I have ever encountered .
"" I still have no idea why it happened , "" he told me , down a phoneline from his home in Australia .
"" It 's like waking up one morning to find that your wife has put a knife in your back . ""
Among other deprivations , his dismissal had meant the end of participation in a charming on - tour ritual whereby the band routinely gathered together to watch porn films projected onto hotel walls and communally indulge in what Rossi called a "" polish "" .
Who would n't be gutted ?
In between piecing together a yarn that sat somewhere between Animal House , Shine On Harvey Moon and Spinal Tap , I also re - acquainted myself with their records .
And rock snobbery be damned : despite never having managed a consistent , well - rounded album , their most productive period was indeed peppered with records that may have shakily walked the line between greatness and idiocy , but usually fell the right way .
It matters not that the likes of Down Down ( 1974 ) , Paper Plane ( 1973 ) and the aptly - titled Again and Again ( 1978 ) are clumsy , repetitious and meaning - free : so are Louie Louie , the Sex Pistols ' Pretty Vacant and Wild Thing by the Troggs .
And who complains about them ?
At the risk of a deluge of emails , I 'd even contend that the Quo 's undying popularity shines penetrating light on our national character .
Their music has long been free of such unnecessary clutter as metaphor , allegory , and poetic conceit .
At their best , their endlessly re - used der - ner - ner riff - the sound of Chuck Berry transplanted to Croydon , kind of - forms the core of music as reassuring and mundane as the scrape of knives on burnt toast and the massed whistling of kettles .
Much more of this column ,
and I 'll probably have to go and have a lie down .
So in closing , consider this : by rights , the Quo should surely be recruited to play at the opening of the 2008 Olympics .
Come to think of it , they could quite easily headline the next Glastonbury .
In which case , as the kind of people who own all 61 of their singles would have it , I 'll see you down the front .
Well , possibly ."
2005-09-30,"Rock musicians have occasionally commented on football - one thinks inevitably of David Bowie 's disgusted dismissal of the Brunton Park catering facilities on Diamond Dogs , "" This is n't sausage roll/ This is genocide "" - but not nearly often enough for me .
So it was that this week I settled down to Martin Scorsese 's Bob Dylan documentary
No
Direction Home - itself a scarily prescient comment on trying to find the M4 from the Millennium Stadium after a Carling Cup final - hoping for at least one reference to what many regard as the seminal experience of the Alan Sunderland - haired singer - songwriter 's life : the month he spent in north - east England in the early 1960s watching Hartlepool United .
Dylan had come to England during the 1963 - 64 season to hang out with the luminaries of the British folk scene such as The Knitters , Bernadette Earnest , Wilf Suffering , The Welsh - Dresser Family and Big Iain Smock .
These folk folk were not interested in football , preferring to spend their Saturday afternoons whittling , weaving and recalling great mining disasters .
Bored , Dylan wandered off on his own in the hope of finding an 18th century miscarriage of justice on which to pen a few bitter stanzas when , attracted by talk of "" some mystery voodoo cat "" named Ernie Phythian , he found himself entering the Victoria Ground .
No novice when it came to soccer , he had briefly been an apprentice with local US League side the Duluth Foot Servants but was not offered professional terms ( an incident later recalled in his song I Shall Be Released ) .
Dylan 's musical roots too had prepared him for what he saw .
Country music had a long tradition of football - related songs though these tended to focus on match officials rather than players .
Johnny Cash , for example , dubbed himself "" The Man in Black "" in homage to his idol , the referee Arthur Ellis , and recorded I Walk The Line , arguably still the classic song about the life of an assistant ref .
Cash wrote from personal experience .
At one time many US pundits considered the man behind hits such as Rock Island Line and Folsom Prison Blues as a future World Cup linesman .
Unfortunately Cash 's Old West attitudes to discipline inevitably led to trouble .
In a Nevada State Cup match he shot a man in Reno just because he did n't retreat 10 yards quickly enough and was stripped of his flag .
Glen Campbell , meanwhile , gave us The Wichita Linesman , the story of an official for the county FA whose weariness toward the end of a long season is palpable .
Indeed the line "" And I need a small vacation "" was one of the first concerted appeals for a mid - season break . ""
Songwriter Jimmy Webb and I both felt it was impossible for the linos to concentrate 110 % over a full nine - month season , "" Campbell would later recall , "" especially given the pressure being applied on them by managers , players and spectators and Fifa 's constant adjustments to the offside laws . ""
Initially Dylan followed a similar route with his first big hit Blowin ' in the Wind , a baroque , metaphor - laden account of Ken Aston 's ineffectual attempts to control the notorious 1962 World Cup clash between Chile and Italy through feverish use of the whistle .
On the terraces at Hartlepool , however , watching Ambrose Fogarty , Bob Brass and Stan Storton , his mind was opened to what his music could become - frenzied , wild , angry and filled with arcane , yelped phrases , "" Work the channels , keep your shape , funnel back , get tight on them , do n't follow leaders , watch the parking meters . ""
The result was an outpouring of creativity the like of which the world has never seen as Dylan penned a sheaf of songs that would shape a generation including 15 Believers All Dressed in Blue ( a reference not as some writers have suggested to the Scotland rugby union team but to the crowd at the Victoria Ground for a Tuesday evening
Durham Senior Cup tie against Easington Colliery ) , Typically Holker Street and Your Brand New Leopard - skin Pill - box Hat , a satirical broadside aimed at Malcom Allison .
Perhaps most splendid of all was a song that looked into Hartlepool 's future with uncanny accuracy , Visions of Joe Allon .
The resonant opening lines sum up the experience of watching football with extraordinary lucidity : "" Ai n't it just like the ref to wave play on when you 've nobody free?/
Your forwards stand there forlorn , gesturing
oh so vacantly/
And a bloke proffers up some midget gems saying , ' Go on , take two or three'/
He says , ' We were rubbish last week an ' all/
And we never even got a sniff of the ball/ When we lost at Roots Hall ' .
"" Of course , the songs were never recorded in their original form which is perhaps why Scorsese chose not to mention them .
The reason for the lyrical changes was simple : Joan Baez .
Dylan 's raven - haired muse and inamorata was a passionate advocate of rugby league and forced him to exorcise all mention of what she termed "" 22 big jessies running round kissing one another "" .
Her attempts to get him to insert references to Hull Kingston Rovers and Billy Boston were less successful , though some Dylanologists insist that the later song Idiot Wind was inspired by recollections of the commentary style of Eddie Waring .
Readers are invited to insert their own Desolation Row/ stadium of hated local rivals gag here ."

Eight of the most important tracks ever recorded get the in - depth treatment : every detail of the recording told by the key people .
The series opened with a stonker of a pairing : Debbie Harry on David Bowie 's Heroes .
Harry did n't say much , really , but her minimal input was suitably cool .

Even if you know the story of the track , this was slick stuff , well told .
I liked Bowie reeling from the lunacy of his move to Berlin ( "" the smack capital of Europe "" ) with Iggy Pop ( "" who was trying to get off smack "" ) to get himself clean .
And Harry , sounding as if she meant it when she said of classic singles : "" these songs can make us dance , cry , love , lust and smile "" .

2005-10-15,"Rock star David Bowie wrote a thoughtful piece in the New York Times in June 2002 about the future of music . '
The absolute transformation of everything we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years , ' he wrote , ' and nothing is going to be able to stop it .
I see absolutely no point in pretending that it 's not going to happen .
I 'm fully confident that copyright , for instance , will no longer exist in 10 years , and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing .
Music , itself , is going to become like running water or electricity ... '
Aeons ago - in 1999 - the then CEO of Intel , Andy Grove , was ridiculed when he declared that in five years ' time companies that were n't internet businesses would n't be businesses at all .
Did this mean that every burger joint and hardware store would have to be on the web by 2004 - that everyone had to get into e - commerce ?
Not at all , said Grove , simply that the net would become a utility like mains electricity or the telephone .
Just as there was a time ( in the 1920s ) when companies used to boast that they were now ' on the telephone ' , there came a time ( 2000 ) when companies used to boast that they had a website .
And now ?
When was the last time you saw a white van without a URL emblazoned on the back ?
Thus was the internet transformed from an exotic add - on to a taken - for - granted utility .
But where does Bowie 's comparison of music to running water fit in ?
To appreciate it , we need to take the long view .
Once upon a time , music was a service .
To ' consume ' it you had to attend a performance of some kind ; you had to be physically present at the place where it was being provided .
The invention of the phonograph in 1887 changed all that .
It transformed music into a product that could be packaged and sold in discrete parcels - initially as wax cylinders , later as vinyl records , and then as tapes , audio cassettes , CDs and mini - discs .
A huge industry grew up around the provision of these packages .
Consumers built up music collections by buying discs , which they stored on shelves in their homes and played on various devices .
The commercial radio industry rode on the back of this packaging business .
It , too , bought packages and broadcast the contents over the ether .
Sometimes consumers taped the music and made their own packages , but in the main they bought them from stores .
As time went on , the packages - and players - gradually became smaller : gramophones morphed into cassette players , portable CD players and mini - disc players .
But throughout this evolutionary process the music - as - packaged - product model remained inviolate .
But then , in the 1990s , three things changed .
The internet began its rise to ubiquity ; MP3 compression technology squeezed recordings into manageable files ; and Napster and its successors made it easier ( and cheaper ) to acquire ( or steal ) the resulting files .
MP3 players and , later , the Apple iPod made it easy to carry huge collections of packaged music on your person , as it were .
And suddenly we had a world in which millions of consumers walked round in personalised bubbles of recorded music .
But this is only half a revolution , because it 's still based on the music - as - product model .
For the record industry , it has been an unqualified disaster , because millions of people are n't paying for their packages .
Legal download services like Apple iTunes are beginning to mitigate the disaster , but it 's not clear that even iTunes can compete with illicit file - sharing .
So what 's to be done ?
Here 's where the water analogy comes in .
It 's as if we lived in a world where water was only made available in Perrier bottles , so that if you want the stuff you have to buy ( or steal ) bottles .
But in fact water is also available as a public service , piped through mains and available by turning a tap .
We pay for this either via a flat tax or a charge based on how much we use , and everyone is ( reasonably ) happy .
We have access to water whenever we need it ; and the companies that provide the stuff earn reasonable revenues from providing it .
As broadband internet access becomes ubiquitous - and wireless - this model suddenly becomes feasible for music .
At the moment , the only way we can have the stuff we crave is to buy or steal the product .
But if we could access whatever we wanted , at any time , on payment of a levy , our need to own the packages would diminish .
We could just turn on the tap , as it were , and get Beethoven or So Solid Crew on demand .

Six years after their famous falling out , the two hacks apparently bonded over tequilas after meeting at Morgan 's book signing .
Touching stuff .
Bryant 's master plan on message Telegraph editor - in - chief John Bryant has only had a couple of days in charge as acting editor following Friday 's abrupt departure of Martin Newland .
But is Bryant already planning three years ahead ?
Monkey only asks after emails to Bryant 's old Daily Mail address elicited the following response : "" I will be out of the office starting 11/11/2005 and will not return until 31/12/2008 . ""
So is he planning a return to Associated by then , or will enough Mail men have transferred to the Telegraph by then that Paul Dacre will be able to engineer a reverse takeover of its rival ?
Another theory , although surely fanciful , is that it 's just an IT cock - up .
Jungle fever
The producers of ITV 's
I 'm a Celebrity ,
Get Me Out of Here ! have warned contestants to "" expect things to be a lot tougher "" than in previous series .
But does the same go for the press ?
Monkey only asks after Fleet Street 's finest were taken into the jungle last week , only for the Daily Star 's Peter Dyke to turn a funny colour after being bitten by a mystery critter .
Funnel web spider ?
Taipan snake ?
Inspection by medics revealed it to be a ... mosquito .
Let 's hope Pete 's been taking the tablets .
With no booze , the journos amused themselves with a game of "" shag or die "" .
The show 's tenor , it seems , has been set .
And finally ... Martin Newland 's exit from the Daily Telegraph was said to have taken management by as much surprise as it did his staff .
Newland announced he was leaving at the end of Friday 's morning conference , with a Columbo - style "" one more thing ... ""
Although he said he would stay until the end of the month , journos expect him to go rather sooner .
Monkey 's biggest surprise was that his resignation statement was not included on the Telegraph 's deadly dull daily podcast .
If Newland was n't around , they could have got an all - action hero to do the voiceover .
Arnold Schwarzenegger , perhaps ?
Half - wit
The battle between Channel 4 and Five to come up with the most outrageous programme title almost escalated to new heights last week .
The latest in Five 's Extraordinary People series , The Woman with Half a Body , was the story of a woman who had brought up a family despite having her legs amputated at an early age , and it was watched by more than 2 million .

The worst offender ?
Stand up , the News of the World 's Katie Hind .
Nutty professor Professor Robert Winston 's St Ivel ads - slogan : "" how to give your kids more Omega-3 without them noticing "" - have got Monkey thinking about BBC editorial guidelines .
The section on - air talent and advertising , sub - heading "" serious factual programmes that are not news or current affairs "" , says : "" The key consideration must be that presenters or reporters should not be allowed to undertake promotions for any product or service related to the subject matter of the programme they present "" .

November 18 Big man in the middle
So Martin Newland resigns as editor of the Daily Telegraph and Roy Keane quits Manchester United , within minutes of each other .
What could it all mean ?
""
Roy Keane was appointed the new editor of the Daily Telegraph today .
Mr Keane took the helm of the shocked Canary Wharf broadsheet this morning delivering a ' welcome to the game ' crunching tackle on Boris Johnson .
He followed up by revealing that he would be reversing the paper 's long - held Eurosceptic leader line , professing that ' the biggest goal for us now is Europe - we need to go as far as we can with it ' , after which Simon Heffer needed treatment from the bench and Matthew d'Ancona had to be administered smelling salts .
It is already clear that Mr Keane has a sharp eye on staff performance , '
You write one piece a week about a fecking hamster and think you are a superstar
' he said in an exclusive Telegraph podcast which was instantly withdrawn as it clearly amounted to a personal attack on Andrew Marr , whose double life as a BBC dilettante is the kind of thing Mr Keane regards a ' unprofessional ' .
He was swift to remind his other big name writers - Jeff Randall and WF Deedes - that he did n't want them ' on the lash ' a night before formulating a big opinion .
In Mr Keane 's inimitable combative style he has already clashed with other senior members of the team - in a boardroom incident the paper is trying to underplay
Mr Keane is believed to have shocked Sunday Telegraph editor Sarah Sands by telling her to ' stick your Croque Langoustine with Cep capuccino up yer bollocks - and yer iPod too ' .
Mr Keane did however have some words of praise for the staff at his new paper : '
It 's great to see so many people available on the subs bench ' he said .
"" Tabloids in glass houses Update on the Sun 's gloating at the Daily Mail 's misfortune yesterday ( see below ) .
An eagle - eyed Monkey fan points out that the Sun neglected to mention that it too had published the story that July 7 victim Garri Holness had been cleared on appeal of a gang rape .
It only appeared in later editions but , even worse , included an extra quote from a "" close friend "" of Garri saying : "" Garri has suffered two major injustices in his life .
One was when he was wrongly convicted of rape and the other was when he had his leg blown off . ""
Funnily enough , that quote did n't appear in the Sun 's glee - fest yesterday .
Monkey invites the Sun to look up the words , "" pot "" , "" kettle "" and "" black "" .
Terry 's all gold Monkey is worried that the excitement of today 's Children in Need might be getting to Terry Wogan already .

November 17 Genuine embarrassment at the Mail
How many Daily Mail reporters does it take to not check if a source is lying ?
Three , it seems .
On Wednesday the paper published a gushing piece - with three bylines on it - about July 7 victim Garri Holness , in which he claimed he had been cleared on appeal of a gang rape . ""
When I was 17 , I was convicted for rape and sentenced to seven years in prison - a conviction that was later quashed on appeal when it was proved that I had not committed the crime , "" he told the Mail 's eager trio .
But The Sun did some checks and discovered he was lying .
Today Holness admits on page 7 of the red - top that he lied to the Mail : "" I told the Daily Mail and they believed me .
I felt under pressure and wanted to nip it in the bud straight away - make it go away .
I realised that I made a mistake . ""
Cue red faces at Derry Street .

As if live cockroach eating and flying arrow catching were not exciting enough , the main event - an attempt to set a new world record by toppling four million dominos - was sabotaged by a sparrow , which flew into the venue on Monday and knocked over 23,000 doms .
The sparrow was shot - a move defended by the show 's producer , Endemol , on the grounds that it had taken more than 100 people weeks to set up the daring domino world record attempt .
Five is just trying to decide whether it can get away with showing footage of the shooting - Five PR man Paul Leather says they may have to "" wing it "" .

Bravo brings back Big Ron Satellite channel Bravo last night reintroduced the disgraced 65-year - old Ron Atkinson to televised football punditry , inviting him to sit oh - so - beatifically alongside presenter James Richardson and fellow analyst Claudio Ranieri for last night 's coverage of the friendly between Italy and Ivory Coast .
Bravo had hired a PR firm to probe the wisdom of such a move , and despite many media insiders suggesting it would reek of bad taste and cheap publicity , they eventually opted to give air space to the man sacked by ITV last year for racist comments about Marcel Desailly .
Big Ron was on his best behaviour throughout though , heaping praise on the Ivorian players at every opportunity - and even scrunching up his face to convey deep emotional agony when his footballing intellect forced him to predict an Italian victory .
But in the end , the only truly offensive , patronising comment came from fellow pundit Andy Burton , who kept insisting the friendly was "" the biggest match in the history "" of Ivory Coast .
Bigger even than the wins that recently brought them World Cup qualification for the first time ever ?
Or their triumph in the 1992 Africans Nations Cup ?
Christmas bashing begins Bit of a kerfuffle in TV PR land , with Channel 4 's Xmas drinkies clashing with a joint BBC2/BBC Sport darts evening on December 1 .

Channel 4 bellyached about the BBC breaking the Xmas drinks armistice , so the corporation has agreed to lay on a minibus to ferry half - cut hacks from its darts do in Victoria to the Horseferry Road mob 's piss - up in Cavendish Square .
Monkey is sure Channel 4 boss Andy Duncan never had this in mind when he floated the idea of his operation getting "" help in kind "" from the licence fee .

Dunne goes free in Scotland
Does the muscular left arm of Associated Newspapers know what its powerful right arm is doing ?
We only ask in the wake of the company 's settlement of a dismissal case with financial journalist Helen Dunne , which dragged on since Ms Dunne abruptly left the Mail On Sunday in February .

Not so good news for Australian cricket
Maybe Aussie cricket writers are n't doing so well , after all .
It has been pointed out to Monkey that Gideon Haigh , cricket fans ' ( second ) favourite cricket writer ( see below ) , may well live and work in Melbourne but was born in England and celebrated with the best of them after England 's summer Test victories .
So Aussie hacks - get back in your box .
Good news for Australian cricket The Aussies might have been beaten in the Ashes ( now is not the time to dwell on England 's defeat by Pakistan today ) but their cricket writers appear to be performing rather better .
In the Wisden Cricketer magazine 's poll of the nation 's favourite cricket writers to be published later this month , Australian writer and author ( and Guardian columnist )
Gideon Haigh is in with a bullet at number two - the newcomer beating former England stars turned scribes Derek Pringle , Mike Atherton and Angus Fraser .
Times and Test Match
Special favourite Christopher Martin - Jenkins has come top of the poll for as long as anyone can remember , but his lead has fallen sharply from 27 % to less than 8 % .
Obviously , Richie Benaud wins the TV commentator poll with three out of every five votes cast .
Will Haigh take the top writer 's spot next time round ?
Just so long as the Ashes do n't change hands as well .
Thompson on technology
A thrilling Q&amp;A with
boss man Mark Thompson appears in this week 's edition of BBC in house rag Ariel , in which he denies he is a geek - but says his 14 year old son is .
Nice one , Mark - you 've just condemned him to years of school yard abuse .
Thommo goes on to say he 's thinking of getting an iPod for his 700 CDs
- bet you 're a big Coliseum fan ,
right Mark ?
However , he already has some "" amazing "" headphones that are "" great for blocking out external noise "" .
Must come in handy during dreary board of governors meetings .
Road rage Is Trevor Eve the proud holder of a new television record ?
No , nothing to do with viewing figures for Waking the Dead , or even the UKTV reruns of Shoestring .
But for managing a record number of bleeps in just 15 seconds of airtime .
The part - time TV detective and full - time smoothie was the "" star in a reasonably priced car "" on the first episode of the new series of Top Gear this week .
Eve was discussing how to swear in sign language with host Jeremy Clarkson .
"" They have got many variations on BLEEP .
You are full of BLEEP .
You 're full of BLEEP .
You are a stuck - up constipated BLEEP
but if you 're a sort of BLEEP who is just a sort of BLEEP ... a diarrhoea ridden BLEEP .
"" Seven bleeps works out at just under one bleep every two seconds .
Clarkson 's three bleeps looked paltry in comparison .
If you know someone who 's gone one better , do let Monkey know .

Mr Jobby Noel Edmonds is back ! ! !
As you would know if you had been watching Deal Or No Deal on Channel 4 at 4.15pm weekdays and 4.25pm on Saturdays .
But for those who have n't , the hirsute one gives an interesting interview today where he says the infamous Mr Blobby could soon be starring in an animated series .
Noel also tells Metro he enjoyed his break from TV and "" was n't interested "" in hosting
I 'm a Celebrity and
Have I Got News for You , both which he was offered .
But then things get slightly out of hand when he jokes about how many crap programmes involving celebrities TV commissioning editors fall for .
"" We 've been thinking about one called New Faeces in which celebrity poo is analysed by a panel of judges . ""
Noel , you do go too far sometimes .
Engleman gets entertaining send - off Tears and cheers last night at the leaving do for ITV entertainment press officer Julia Engleman , who is leaving after 18 years - yes , 18 years - for Channel Five .
Indeed , she has worked there so long that she remembers the first series of Gladiators and , er , its short - lived spin - off , Ice Warriors .
ITV press tsar Zoe McIntyre recalled the occasions when Engleman nearly corpsed as Wolf applied the black mane spray to cover up his bald patch - say it ai n't so , Wolfie ! - and Warrior used yet another pair of socks to make himself look , well , more gladiatorial .
McIntyre and colleagues even sang a song in tribute to Engleman , to the tune of My Favourite Things . ""

November 15 Creepy conundrum Sir David Attenborough has admitted to some considerable headscratching before the BBC came up with a title for his latest natural history epic about ants , beetles , spiders and the like .
No , the studio was n't overtaken by termites .
They just did n't know what to call it . ""
Life of Insects was the obvious title but is also totally inaccurate , "" explained Sir David .
Invertebrates - a lot of which feature in the series - are n't insects , see ? ""
And we did n't want to use baby language , so Life of the Creepy Crawlies was out as well . ""
Cue a hundred and one brainstorms until they finally came up with ...
Life in the Undergrowth .
Well , we suppose that will have to do .
BBC director general Mark Thompson looked delighted with the result , and came up with an unusual technique for introducing members of the press to the delights of the insect world .
"" Rolling key media correspondents in honey ! ""
he joked .
At least we think he was joking .
Saturday night 's X - rating TV Is there any justice left in the world , Monkey asks , after Saturday 's shock X Factor , when judge Louis Walsh voted potential winner Maria Lawson off the show to save fellow Irish act the Conway Sisters .
Walsh told millions of TV viewers to boos and cat calls from the audience that he had to vote with his heart in saving the sisters .
This was despite Maria putting in the better performance .
Now a photograph of the sisters and Walsh at a wedding has surfaced and Maria has claimed that Walsh apologised to her BEFORE she sang her final number , implying that the result was a foregone conclusion , completely against the spirit of the show .
And now the Conway Sisters and Walsh are said to be feuding after they snubbed him at the aftershow party , apparently embarrassed by the whole incident .
Where will it all end ?
In fantastic ratings on Saturday night , that 's for sure .
November 14 Gowers makes a modest exit As tear - jerking moments go , it 's right up there with the death of Bambi 's mother .
Not one for a quick goodbye , former Financial Times editor Andrew Gowers regaled staff with a farewell email a week after his departure .
"" I thought some of you might be interested to learn that this morning , on a purge of my files at home , I found a letter I wrote to my parents in November 1981 while toiling for Reuters in Brussels .
It contains a self assessment of some candour : ' Although my work is pretty prolific and scores well in the papers , there is a sorry deficiency in the realm of figures .
I was recently out by three decimal places on a company 's stock market capitalisation , a sin which can prove to be unforgiveable in Reuters .
Somehow , I do n't think I 'll make the FT ever . '
""
Pass the Kleenex , please .
Art and Archers
To the Bankside Gallery on London 's South Bank , where Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer opened an exhibition of art inspired by the station .
Forget about the paintings , the guests were more interested in finding out from Damazer whether Ed or Will is the father of Emma 's baby in The Archers .
Damazer was n't saying , but did he give away more than he intended when he said : "" I think I can go so far as to say hang on another 10 days and all will be fine ...
Or at least , all will be revealed .
"" Archers fanatics immediately began dissecting the implications of the phrase "" all will be fine "" .
Does that mean it 's Ed 's ?
Or Will 's ?
Or neither ?
Damazer showed his support for the artists by splashing out Â£ 305 on a work called The Afternoon Play , by Anita Klein , the Â£ 750 price tag on a Zandra Rhodes painting proving prohibitive .
Handle with care
"" The real test of any organisation is how it deals with complaints from the public , "" said BBC chairman Michael Grade .
So what to make of the corporation 's response to the legions of viewers who complained about excessive sex and violence in so - bad - it's - almost - good historical drama , Rome ? ""
The real ancient Rome was far worse than anything we are showing on screen .
""
No !
Really ?
Monkey also understands the ancient Romans did n't speak English .
Or have American accents .
Couple of white lies Wicked whisper : which nascent newspaper columnist , who makes great play of the fact she is single and spends most of her time lamenting the dating scene , has had a boyfriend all along ?
Here 's hoping he understands .
Mind your backing
As the Daily Telegraph continues to boost its ranks of highly paid senior executives , Monkey hears the paper came close to backing David Cameron in the race for the Tory leadership .
How then , to explain last week 's editorial in which it said it was too close to call and "" both men would make a canny and attractive leader ? ""
Word has it the Barclays intervened and ordered the paper to keep its powder dry .
Star PR Such are the new - found demands of their celebrity status that Little Britain stars David Walliams and Matt Lucas have thought it necessary to engage the services of Barbara Charone , publicist to stars such as Madonna , as their personal PR .
Ricky Gervais , presumably , will be appalled .
Rolling back the years Monkey enjoyed Arena editor - at - large Steve Beale 's account in the Daily Mail last week of how he had Â£ 20,000 of cosmetic surgery , including "" moob "" job , hair removal and botox .
All fascinating stuff , but Monkey wonders if the technology has n't moved on since then .
After all , Beale had the surgery in July 2003 and wrote about it for the Guardian a full two years ago .

2006-01-20,"David Bowie in The Man
Who Fell to Earth Thanks for suggesting your criminal records ( see what I did there ? ) last time .
However , one reader observed that this blog ca n't go a week without mentioning Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash ( see also :
Nick Cave , Tom Waits , Richard Thompson , The Smiths ) .
Hopefully this week 's theme should give us a sabbatical from the usual suspects and inspire a few curveballs .
The topic is space and sci - fi - that covers any songs about space travel ( real or imagined ) , robots , and aliens , from Bowie 's Major Tom songs and P - Funk 's cosmic fantasies to the burbling futurism of electro and techno and the sci - fi jabbering of Frank Black .
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on ...
Deadline , as usual , is 6 pm Monday . ~

Here 's how it works ."
2006-01-22,"David Bowie flashed a smile at the paparazzi .
Julian Schnabel stood in a burly , hunched - over heap at the door , peering into his mobile phone as if trying to work out how to send a text message .
The elfin Laurie Anderson flitted between animated conversations .
Someone thought they saw Tom Waits , and certainly any number of people might have been him - the Hermes boutique on Madison Avenue ( New York 's equivalent of Bond Street ) was full of party guests who looked as though they 'd had too little sleep and too much of a few other things over the past decade or three .
Was that Pete Townshend in the corner ? '
Nah , ' someone whispered , '
Pete Townsend has n't had that much hair in years . '
This was the opening party for Lou Reed 's first solo exhibition of photographs , Lou Reed : New York .
Split between the gallery at the top of Hermes 's Guggenheim - like shop and the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea , the large - scale digital prints were taken by the former Velvet Underground front man over the past three years ( his first book of photographs , Emotion in Action , was published in 2002 ) .
Set in heavy brushed steel frames to give them something of an industrial edge , the images are nevertheless very traditional , falling roughly where Stieglitz would have met Monet if they 'd only had access to hi - res scans .
Lou Reed 's New York , it turns out , is mainly the view from his apartment .
Looking out over the Hudson River from his place in the Meatpacking District , Reed will , apparently , feel compelled to capture a sunset , or to sit up all night playing with double exposures of nearby strips of neon .
Then he gives the resulting images titles such as The Laws of Physics are Always Graceful and Kierkegaard Sat in His Garden
When Reed 's gallerist Steven Kasher first saw these pictures , he knew he was looking at ' an authentic vision ' .
What 's great about them , he says , is that for Reed there are ' no rules , no boundaries .
It does n't stop him that the sunset has been ... that it 's ...
the sunset .
It really is n't just anybody 's sunset , ' he insists . '
It 's Lou 's sunset . '
Then , thinking about the omnipresent view across the river , he adds : ' I suppose there is an irony in the fact that Lou Reed 's New York is mostly New Jersey . '
At Hermes , above a range of thousand - dollar pashminas and a few shoulders away from the Upper East Side 's most botoxed socialites , the feted insomniac is unsmilingly signing autographs .
Wiry and small , he stands with a battered leather courier bag over his shoulder .
What 's a bad downtown boy like him doing in a nice uptown place like this ?
He does n't even want to get into that .
His trademark black has faded to grey - grey ribbed T - shirt , grey hair , greyish skin .
That an artist should find poetry in a sunset is not exactly groundbreaking , but some of Reed 's blurred nocturnal visions are striking for their downbeat voyeurism .
Among the landscapes and abstract compositions is a self - portrait , an image of the photographer as a single sleepless eye .
Its presence haunts the rest of them , making otherwise unsurprising views seem like the leftover retinal images of a troubled nightwalker .
The reviews , however , are to come .
Kasher admits that his client is ' somewhat nervous ' .
A casual canvass of champagne - toting guests found many unconvinced that Reed should be straying quite so far from the Wild Side . '
The pictures ? ' said one , who confessed he 'd never met the man . '
They suck .
And Lou appreciates honesty . '"
2006-02-12,"The Mighty Boosh New Wimbledon Theatre , and touring With their second television series just transferred to BBC2 , and the launch of a 45-date UK tour , the Mighty Boosh have almost shaken off their reputation as a cult interest .
For those unfamiliar , the television series provides a gentle introduction , but Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding 's world of weirdness is best experienced live , and the new show , at more than two hours , with sets and costumes to rival a Who musical , is a triumphant spectacle .
If there had ever been a collaboration between David Bowie , Anthony Burgess and Maurice Sendak , author of Where the Wild Things Are , it might have turned out something similar .
Here hapless jazz aficionado Howard Moon ( Barratt ) and his electro - poof sidekick Vince Noir ( Fielding ) must travel to the Arctic tundra in search of the fabled Ruby of Kukundu .
Howard is haunted by obscene fan mail from Tom Paulin , Vince is pursued by a giant rabbit and Bollo the Ape is preoccupied with his audition for Peter Jackson .
This is one of the most joyful shows around ; catch it before it sells out .

2006-02-14,"The Modfather , Paul Weller , warmed up for a performance at the Brits with a gig in front of just 100 people yesterday .
Tomorrow he will pick up a lifetime achievement award , following in the footsteps of performers such as Bob Geldof ( 2005 ) , Fleetwood Mac ( 1998 ) and David Bowie ( 1996 ) .
In an interview with Virgin Radio
he said : "" It 's been a long time and I think it 's sort of deserved , is n't it ? ""
Yesterday 's acoustic gig at Gibson 's guitar studio in west London saw Weller perform five songs , including the classic That 's Entertainment and the more recent Savages ."
2006-02-19,"Letter of the month The feature on Gorillaz and Franz Ferdinand was exceptionally good ( The Gang 's All Here , OMM29 ) .
It got me thinking about how proud I am of being 15 years old and growing up in the current music climate .
Before the likes of Bloc Party and Arctic Monkeys , I moaned about how I would have loved to have grown up in the Seventies listening to David Bowie and the Kinks .
But now , when I listen to the amazing Gorillaz , the Go Team ! and the Kaiser Chiefs , I feel proud of the current British music scene .
British music is back on form .
Bands like Blur , Pulp and Bowie led the way for the acts of my generation , like Bloc Party .
It gives me confidence knowing that there are good bands to inspire the next generation of musicians .
Joss Humberstone , Co Durham Letter of the Month win this month 's 10 best CDs , courtesy of HMV Two true Brits
I really enjoyed the profiles of the stars of the upcoming Brit Awards ( Big Gun Salute , OMM29 ) .
But I see no shame in Will Young being discovered on a TV talent show .
Will sang live night after night and won over a huge section of the audience .
Does it really matter where talent originates so long as it is found ?
I think Young is this country 's most exceptional male vocalist since George Michael .
Long may he prosper .
Linda Howard , Surrey David Lines ( A Solid Bond , OMM29 ) brought back great memories of Paul Weller .
My dad worked in HMV in Leicester in the late Seventies and while waiting for him to finish on a Saturday , I would flick through the latest LPs .
In the ' J 's ' one day , I saw this cover with three sharp - dressed punks on , looking mean .
The name had been spray - painted onto the white tiles .
I wanted to be in that picture .
The Jam shoes were bought soon after .
My mum insisted they go back to the shop there and then .
The only reason I was allowed to keep them was a compromise - the white tops were dyed black .
Weller 's music and lyrics are just as strong now , and his Brit is well overdue .
Phill Bateman , Leicester Under the skin Your account of Nazi hate rock
( White off the Scale , OMM29 ) was informative and worrying .
It was remiss , however , not to mention Sharp ( Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice ) and the ' Good Night White Pride ' movement .
You could have even commented on the popular German anti - Nazi skinhead scene where bands such as Loikaemie have been confronting fascists head - on .
I only highlight this as I am fed up with being threatened by people who equate Oi ! with fascism .
Some readers might form the opinion that all skinhead / punk types are right - wing .
They are not .
Bobby Smith , via email Needles and spins Hooray for Paul Morley ( Critic at Large , OMM29 ) .
I recently endured much mickey - taking over my quest to find a new stylus for my record player
but I was heartened by the hi - fi store 's assertion that , actually , it 's selling more turntables than ever .
Surely this ca n't all be down to club DJs ?
Part of the enjoyment of old LPs is from the memories they evoke .
From school discos , swotting for exams , making friends and teenage angst , through first heartbreak , first job , family rows , great parties , awful parties , these records take me back to the days of listening to the Top 40 on a Sunday evening , transistor radio clutched to my ear .
I 'm all for advancement , but why does it have to be at the expense of the past ?
As Morley puts it , vinyl is sexy - do n't let it die .

All apologies I have just sent you a letter correcting Sarah Boden 's Arctic Monkeys lyric ( The First Ten , OMM29 ) .

Where 's the love and the passion ? '
But on the album it 's : ' You 're a Topshop princess , a rock star too/
You 're a fad and a fashion ' .
She was still wrong about ' touch - up princess ' though .

2006-03-10,"After wowing 1970s audiences with Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke personae , in the early 1980s Bowie was as mainstream as he 'd ever been .
This perhaps explains why the "" serious moonlight "" look involved a curly perm and the kind of outfits usually sighted on a Butlins redcoat .
Sartorial comedy aside , the 1983-shot Serious Moonlight documents the beginnings of the modern day world tour - big on stadia , choreography and videos .
Bowie sounds best on the hits of the day , such as the fabulous segue of Fashion and Let 's Dance .
Ashes to Ashes is delivered from within a plastic pod , and at one point he kicks a huge model globe around the stage .
He 's wobblier on more austere Berlin - era tracks like Breaking Glass , which do n't benefit from the Redcoat persona .
The extras are oddly hilarious , not least when a limo - travelling DB chirps , post - gig : "" That was quite a reception was n't it ?
Ta - da - da - di - da ! ""
The cheeky - chappie persona was not long for this world ."
2006-03-10,"Brooklyn art - rockers TV on the Radio have some blue - chip fans .
Two years ago their debut album triumphed over more fancied nominees such as Wilco and the Streets to win the Shortlist Prize , the US answer to the Mercury .
Their next record will guest star David Bowie , and they have been working with Massive Attack , whose Robert del Naja is lurking at the back of the ICA tonight .
Odd and uncategorisable , they are the perfect cult band .
You want brittle post - punks ?
Beardy prog - rockers ?
An avant - soul outfit ?
TV on the Radio are all of the above .
If the true spirit of art - rock resides in bands who find fresh ways to confound rather than those who emulate the pioneers of 20 years ago , then TV on the Radio 's cussed refusal to follow anybody 's templates is admirable , but it 's often not the kind of admirable that 's fun to listen to .
Perhaps frontman Tunde Adebimpe realises this when he says , "" Thanks for staying after the first song .
That 's really cool . ""
Adebimpe is a star , but it 's as if the rest of the band have conspired to make his job as difficult as possible .
He sings with power and vulnerability , hurling his head back and thrashing his free arm as if batting away a cloud of aggrieved wasps , but he 's constantly undercut by the skittering rhythms and queasy keyboard - and - guitar blur , not to mention gloopy acoustics that render almost every lyric inaudible .
Guitarist Kyp Malone is even less help when he joins in on what might be loosely described as harmonies .
Somewhere deep within the mess a great band is buried .
Played as an encore , the eerily beautiful Ambulance sounds like an avant - garde Marvin Gaye ballad set to a human beatbox rhythm .
At last they give Adebimpe , and their sound , space to breathe ."
2006-04-08,"Jake Arnott is tucking into a plate of guinea fowl at St John , his local restaurant in London 's Clerkenwell , and worrying about David Bowie .
The sophisticated fusion of gangsterism , showbusiness , politics and gay culture in Arnott 's ' gangland trilogy ' -
The Long Firm , He Kills Coppers and truecrime - has earned him much acclaim and at least one superstar fan .
On the covers of his novels , there is an approving quote from Bowie : ' Whenever he 's got a new book out , I drop everything , knowing that the next couple of hours are going to be pure gangland bliss . '
Although that summary sells Arnott short - his work is a critique , not celebration , of gangland - that 's not why he 's worried .
Bowie has been ' inspirational ' to Arnott , who is a ' fantastically huge fan ' , and he is n't sure how the singer will react to his new novel , Johnny Come Home , which is set in the early Seventies world of glam rock , the pop phenomenon Bowie pretty much created .
Looking at Arnott , you would n't imagine that much would worry him or that he would be star - struck .
At 45 , he has a confident , relaxed manner - maybe that 's the t'ai chi
he performs every day - but also a somewhat forbidding exterior .
One journalist spoke of his ' brutal good looks ' and although that sounds like gush , he has always struck me as a potential contender to play James Bond .
He combines wariness with frankness , but is easy to talk to and can be very funny .
He says : ' It 's best not to worry about what Bowie might think .
There 's a character in the new novel called Sweet Thing , whose name comes from one of the songs on Diamond Dogs .
It 's one of my many direct steals from Mr Bowie , which is why I think he might not like this book . '
However , Arnott has n't done a Velvet Goldmine and provided a fictional account of Bowie 's life at the time . '
Given my strange proclivities , ' he adds with a laugh , ' I preferred to focus on the seedy end of glam . '
The new novel is more ambitious than anything he has produced to date .
Although it still has his trademark mix of true stories and fictional characters , he has moved away from the obvious attractions of gangland .
While he touches on the early days of modern terrorism in the UK , Johnny Come Home is essentially a sophisticated account of that overheated period in the early Seventies when political radicalism , music and the blurring of sexual boundaries overlapped and sometimes fused .
There 's the rent boy ( Sweet Thing ) , squat - dwelling political activists and a gay , glam - rock star .
This last character is not a Bowie or a Bolan , but one of those late Fifties - early Sixties survivors who changed their names each time they clambered on to the next musical wave .
Johnny Rebel becomes Johnny Savage and almost becomes Johnny Flower before finding fame - in eyeliner , glitter and stack - heels - as Johnny Chrome .
Arnott is quick to say that Chrome is an echo rather than a fictional representation of real glam rockers . '
Certainly not the Unmentionable Man of Pop in a Vietnam prison , ' he says , alluding to Gary Glitter . '
Although there is an edginess about the fact that glam rock was all about teenyboppers - underage girls - screaming at gigs . '
Edginess is a word Arnott uses often .
His fiction operates on various edges , which is why he does n't like to be categorised .
To me , he is the heir to both Patrick Hamilton and Graham Greene in the way that he deals with lives on the margins , shabby glamour , underworlds of different sorts . '
I 'm interested in things that do n't quite fit in , as were those writers , ' he acknowledges . '
It 's a middle - class thing - people terrified of falling through the cracks in the floorboards .
Brighton Rock is an iconic book for me .
Orwell had that too . '
He sees his work in the way that Orwell did . '
This is very old school
but I do think there is a duty to have a sense of political context . '
He shrugs . '
Because it 's going to be imposed on you anyway . '
In his mid - forties , Arnott has really hit his stride .
It has probably helped that he came to fiction late .
Brought up in Aylesbury , the son of a management consultant , he left school at 16 and spent 20 years in a range of situations : mortuary technician , life model , political activist , squatter , agitprop actor .
He was living in Leeds , working in social services , one unpublished novel in his drawer , when he had the idea for The Long Firm . '
Ronnie Kray had just died and everyone had talked about how the Krays looked after their neighbourhood but nobody seemed to look at the gay aspect .
So I wanted to write about someone who was sexually and emotionally involved with an East End psychopath .
I knew I was on to something . '
The book was a huge success , as was last year 's Bafta - nominated television version , and changed his life .
When it became an immediate bestseller in 1999 , two other things happened .
First , he became a poster boy for gay fiction .
Second , his work was lumped in with all the crass ' gangster / geezer chic ' stuff surrounding Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and the lad mags ' fÃªting of Essex thugs who had written memoirs of the good old days of intimidation and violence .
He satirised ' mockney ' gangster chic in truecrime .
His attitude to being highlighted as a gay writer somewhat more complicated . '
I like the fact that The Long Firm was selected as a Big Gay Read because it 's an unexpected gay read
- it turns conventions of gay fiction on their heads .
But I do n't want to be stuck in one category , either as an artist or as a human being .
There are areas where people find their definitions are not enough .
That 's how I feel as a sexual human being . '
He waves his fork over his plate . '
A strange phrase to use over lunch
but I do n't necessarily feel a fixed sexual identity is enough as an emotional person .
I do n't feel I fit in that way . '
I think that 's what is interesting about this glam - rock period .
There was gay lib and women 's lib
but there was exploration of sexual liberation for everyone .
It might seem ludicrous now but it links to the notion I have that rock stars should always have an ambiguous sexuality .
They are appealing to adolescents who are finding out about themselves , so that ambiguity is important .
It certainly was to me - glam rock was a coming - of - age thing for my generation . '
Indeed , Johnny Come Home explores sexuality rather than just homosexuality .
It also has a more complete merging of the personal and the political than any of his earlier novels .
Curiously , Arnott sees glam rock as a form of music hall , though perhaps that just reflects his long - term interest in vaudeville .
( Both his paternal grandparents were in music hall and variety . )
In the novel , he talks of glam rock as ' music - hall futurism ' and ' the lost years of British vaudeville ' . '
I thought of calling Johnny "" Johnny Vaudeville "" but that sounded too American and there is something very English about glam rock .
And music hall or variety is such a defining part of our culture . '
Arnott concludes , pushing his plate away , by noting that even the young David Bowie was strongly influenced by Anthony Newley and the English show tradition .
Maybe he 'll like Johnny
Come Home after all .

2006-04-13,"Can David Bowie make the grade as a world music artist ?
He can when his songs are sung in Portuguese and given a gentle bossa nova once - over by the Brazilian singer and actor , Seu Jorge .
Some of these songs first appeared in the film The Life Aquatic , in which Jorge appeared as a Bowie - obsessed sailor .
They have become a key part of his show , and , finally , a set of 13 Bowie favourites ( and one by Jorge ) appear on this tediously titled album .
Thankfully , the music is better than the marketing .
There 's everything from a languid Rebel Rebel to a thoughtful Five Years .
A gently charming set that could become a cult success ."
2006-04-26,"For me , Brian Eno has been one of music 's most interesting and original thinkers of the past 35 years .
His prodigious recording career and collaborations with the likes of Roxy Music , the Portsmouth Sinfonia , Robert Fripp , David Bowie , Devo , Talking Heads , U2 , James , Derek Jarman and Jah Wobble have sometimes had seismic effects on the course of pop music .
Even his most esoteric experiments have never been less than interesting .
Having followed his career with fascination from afar , I recently managed to record a two hour interview with him for BBC 6 Music - which includes this account of how Eno arrived at the idea of Ambient music : I 'd been very close friends with a painter called Peter Schmidt - we used to compile cassettes of things we were listening to and give them to each other .
One thing we both noticed was that we did n't like variety on our cassettes - so if you had a tape of dance songs you did n't want a ballad in the middle of it , and a cassette of quiet , slow music should all be like that .
We wanted to make tapes for each other that were different from the kinds of records we were buying .
At that time there was an idea in record companies ' minds that our attention span was about three minutes - and then you needed to have the mood change because otherwise we 'd lose interest .
Back then records were always organised as : fast song , slow song , fast song , slow song .
I just hated that and ( when ) copying records onto cassettes I would completely reorganise them .
So I started thinking about music as something functional ... that existed as part of the design of your life .
Just like the way you decorated your room or the kind of furniture you chose or the kind of lights you used .
They were all kind of issues about how you want to feel ...
so I wanted to make things that were panoramic in a certain way .
Things that have a way of existing in the space and you enter them for a while and
then you leave them for a while .
I did n't want this narrative thing to be part of the record so much .
In early 1975 I got hit by a taxi as I was crossing the Harrow Road and was immobilised for a while .
When I was lying in bed Judy Nylon brought me a record of renaissance harp music and put the needle on when she left .
My speakers were a bit dodgy and one of them had broken - and it was also raining quite heavily outside and the volume was n't very high .
I could n't get out of bed and was irritated ,
thinking ' I can hardly hear this music ' .
Then gradually I started to think ' well , there it is -
it 's going to play for the next 20 minutes anyway ' .
Suddenly it started to seem like a really beautiful way of listening to music - instead of dominating the environment it became part of a soundscape .
The rain was hitting the windows and occasionally I would hear the loudest parts of the harp notes appearing like the tips of icebergs in this sonic ocean .
And from that I really developed the whole Ambient idea - which was more an approach to listening than to composing .
It was saying : ' let 's treat music like painting ' .
If you have a painting on your wall you do n't sit in front of it staring at it as you would a television .
It 's there and you sometimes look at it and sometimes look away from it .
Sometimes it will hold your attention for a while and sometimes it 's just a glance .
It does n't make paintings any less important just because they do n't engage your attention fulltime - it just means it 's a different kind of attention .
I have to say , a lot of other people were getting to that idea ( at the time ) with other things they were doing , but I gave it a name .
Muzak was very much talked about at the time and very much disliked .
It was the opposite of what any serious person ought to be doing .
( But ) I thought they had a really good idea in Muzak - I just felt they had really bad taste .
The fact that people use music to make an environment was important because until the mid-70s you had a real disconnection between what composers were doing and what listeners were doing .
Composers were making music as though people were going to sit and listen to it with total critical attention and a furrowed brow , perfectly situated between their stereo speakers .
What listeners were doing however was compiling things on tapes , running them while they were doing the hoovering , or while the kids were watching TV and so on - so listeners were engaging in quite different kinds of behaviour .
Some listeners were still engaging in that older form of behaviour too and I was one of them , but a lot of the time I wanted music to be a world that I immersed myelf in , not a story that I was being told .
So ( the aim of ) ambient was really to try and make an immersive kind of music . ""

2006-05-31,"There were thrills for everyone but the Telegraph after David Gilmour 's Royal Albert Hall performance , and even their excitement was revived by a surprise appearance from David Bowie for the final two songs of the evening .
With comparisons to Pink Floyd dominating most reviews , the Telegraph declared that "" a patchy show miraculously pipped Pink Floyd for drama in the end "" and the Times concluded that it "" not only echoed , but surely rivalled "" the band 's glories .
For the Evening Standard "" the feeling that Gilmour is winning the battle of Pink Floyd hard to ignore : at least until July , when [ founding member Roger ] Waters brings his show to town "" .
In a "" near - perfect "" , "" meticulously constructed "" gig , Gilmour 's emotive dignity in performing from Dark Side of the Moon gave way to the "" balm for the senses "" of his new album , according to the Independent .
The Times , too , praised On An Island as "" mellifluous "" and "" supremely graceful "" and appreciated the "" magisterial performance with an air of calm humility "" of less exposed Floyd songs ( which , as the Standard pointed out , were conveniently all post - Waters . )
But for the Telegraph the repertoire was over - filled with "" obscurities , delivered with a bizarre lack of flair , "" and the album "" tasteful but uneventful . ""
Still , the light show was rather good for everyone ."
2006-05-31,"It has been 30 years since David Gilmour could be considered remotely cutting - edge , yet his pulling power among his peers has not waned .
Tonight 's rare solo show by the Pink Floyd major - domo resembles
a Who 's Who of 1970s arena rock , right up to the surprise
second encore appearance of a grinning , reliably dapper David Bowie .
Gilmour is plugging a new album , On an Island , his first solo set for 22 years .
Largely co - written with his wife , Polly Samson , it 's a well - crafted yet unremarkable set of mildly cosmic soft rock , and a collective sigh undermines the polite applause that greets his announcement that he is to play it in full in the first half of the evening .
Flanked by original Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera , Gilmour remains a fantastically dextrous guitarist .
For the album 's title track he is joined on stage by David Crosby and Graham Nash , yet even they ca n't lift this languid , diffident paean to romantic bliss above the merely pedestrian .
Gilmour 's new music suggests a rich man 's hobby - which it is - and it is hard to imagine anyone returning eagerly to Red Sky at Night , a lounge jazz instrumental on which he plays a poignant sax .
The acid folk - tinged
Then I Close My Eyes is better , Gilmour twanging a banjo before being usurped by Robert Wyatt blowing a mournful , valedictory cornet .
Expectations rise as he opens the Floyd part of the evening , harmonising with Crosby and Nash on Shine on You Crazy Diamond , Floyd 's tribute to their great lost , maverick genius Syd Barrett .
Yet the Wright - sung Wearing the Inside Out from 1994 's The Division Bell is merely dreary , as is the same album 's deliberately opaque Coming Back to Life .
Gilmour locates a killer melody - not always his strong suit - on the touchingly ingenuous Wish
You Were Here , another homage to Barrett .
Yet the night 's jaw - dropping moment is the arrival of Bowie to croon Arnold Layne , the Barrett - penned 1967 exercise in pop whimsy that was Floyd 's debut single and - for its sins - inspired Bowie to write The Laughing Gnome .
Bowie provides backing vocals on the opiate serenity of Comfortably Numb from Floyd 's 1979 quasi - symphonic magnum opus
The Wall , then Gilmour bids the rapt audience a plummy farewell in his engagingly patrician manner .
It 's been a patchy , highly variable evening , but London 's greying baby boomers climb into their SUVs and set their sat - navs for the heart of the suburbs very , very happy indeed .

2006-06-02,"Brian Eno is famously a man of many ideas .
His 1994 diary A Year ( With Swollen Appendices ) is full of them .
When not producing David Bowie , looking thoughtfully at women 's bums or struggling to get his VCR to play a video called Big Bodacious Babes , he dreams up fantastical schemes : a pressure group obliging dog owners to clean up their pet 's mess called the League Against Street Shit in England , or Lassie ; greetings cards that celebrate how many days you 've been alive ; car horns that can be tuned by their owners to say "" you first "" or "" I 'm sorry "" .
He also suggests he should set himself up as a consultant in Harley Street , dispensing advice to the musically sickly .
The latter is the only of Eno 's 1994 ideas that shows signs of coming true .
He may not have the Harley Street practice , but recently the celebrated producer and "" non - musician "" does seem to have been employed as a kind of sonic doctor , trying to diagnose what 's up with ailing artists .
He 's currently working with Travis , usurped from their role as Britain 's leading providers of inoffensive stadium rock by Coldplay .
His other recent big - name patient is Paul Simon , whose standing as a solo artist has been in the doldrums ever since his disastrous 1998 musical
The Capeman , which took 11 years to write , cost $ 11 m to stage and lasted less than three months on Broadway .
The doctor - patient relationship was not without its storms - the former is credited not as producer but as provider of "" sonic landscapes "" , and the pair disagreed so much that Eno apparently told Simon to leave the studio and go shopping .
Listening to Surprise , you wonder what Simon might have objected to .
It 's not as if Eno turned up and tried to encourage the venerable singer - songwriter to make a death metal album : his contributions run a gamut of sounds you would describe as , well , Eno - esque .
He swathes instruments in disorientating echo and reverb , provides vaporous ambient washes and the occasional lovely synthesized counterpoint , cranks up the distortion on opener
How Can You Live in the Northeast ?
until the guitars vaguely resemble those on the title track of Eno 's debut solo album
Here Come the Warm Jets .
The co - written Outrageous has a scratchy funk feel about it that recalls Eno 's late 1970s collaborations with Talking Heads .
The problem with Surprise is the songs Simon has chosen to undergo the Eno treatment .
As with its predecessor , You 're the One , anyone scouting for a memorable tune may as well pull up a chair - you 'll have to wait until track eight , Another Galaxy .
The lyrics are similarly opaque : the shadow of war and a divided America haunts the songs , but it 's a bit difficult to work out what Simon thinks about either .
How Can You Live in the Northeast ?
settles for a why - can't - we - all - get - on ?
stance that veers dangerously close to platitude .
Sure Do n't Feel Like Love starts out with someone registering to vote , but meanders off into vague stream - of - consciousness rambling , albeit with the occasionally great line : "" I remember once in August 1993 , I was wrong , and I could be wrong again . ""
Beautiful concerns itself with couples who adopt children from strife - torn foreign countries .
It 's a bit difficult to work out what Simon thinks about that as well .
Perhaps he is unwilling to offer polemical answers to complex issues , which is admirable , but with few melodies to grasp on to and Eno adding a further haze , the overall effect is like looking at a mist through a gauze .
It 's even more frustrating when you catch a glimpse of the collaboration genuinely sparking , as on the gorgeous
Once Upon a Time
There Was , where Eno 's electronics support a beautifully - turned song .
For all its shortcomings , you leave Surprise with a certain respect for Paul Simon .
He belongs to a select and shrinking band among his 1960s peers who decline to take the easy route : hook up with young musicians influenced by your early work , make an album in what is deemed to be your "" classic "" style , reap the inevitable critical and commercial acclaim .
There 's a sneaking suspicion that his refusal to countenance the latter option may have less to do with high morals than it does with not wanting to spend time in a confined space with Art Garfunkel : understandable , given that Arty is rock 's own answer to Fraisier Crane : he compared himself to the man entrusted to burn Franz Kafka 's manuscripts on the back cover of 1964 's Wednesday Morning 3 am , and seems to have got steadily more insufferable from thereon in .
But whatever the reason , Simon seems intent on taking risks , making every album different from the last .
It 's laudable , but as Surprise proves , sometimes the best intentions do n't make for the best albums ."
2006-06-03,"Sir Paul Smith , multi - millionaire clothing impresario , avid art collector and honorary member of the rock aristocracy ( Eric Clapton and David Bowie are friends ) , is having a whale of a time .
While tearing about his London office , where I meet him to talk about his clothing empire 's expansion in Japan , he tells me he was recently described as ' dotty ' by a friend .
It 's a term he confesses he rather likes and one , I have to agree , that 's pretty accurate .
He impishly tells me of his ' day trips ' : ' I go to my office in Delhi , just for the day .
I also went to the Great Wall of China and Vietnam for the day .
My favourite was a day trip that took in Moscow in the morning , St Petersburg in the afternoon and New York at night .
I 'm busy - I have to visit places briefly . '
He goes on to encourage me to embrace a large brown cuddly monkey , which he refers to as ' the office manager ' , before diving into a walk - in store cupboard to find a suitable gift ( it happens to be my birthday ) .
His employees look on with affection as Smith bounces off the walls like a kid in a candy store : at 59 , he obviously still loves what he does .
Behind the playful personality , Smith is an astute businessman .
He remains chief executive , principal shareholder and chief designer of the eponymous fashion brand he started in 1970 , a company that now turns over Â£ 280 m a year if you add the wholesale , retail and licensing revenues together , and boasts more than 230 stores worldwide .
There are 18 in the UK and 2006 will see three more , in New York , Paris and Russia .
Smith occupies a place in British fashion like no other .
Born in Nottingham in 1947 , he dreamt of being a professional cyclist , but a bad accident made it impossible .
In 1969 , he met Pauline Denyer , an artist who would later - in 2000 - become his wife , and has been a driving force behind his fashion business .
His cuts of suits and patterned fabrics went on to revolutionise British tailoring .
Interestingly for such an archetypally British label , the majority of Paul Smith 's business takes place in Japan , where the label enjoys a cult status .
There are 165 stores there alone that contribute Â£ 177 m each year to the brand 's turnover .
Aside from the obvious financial rewards , Japan is also a country that has long been close to Smith 's heart . '
I was invited there in 1982 , which was only three years after I opened my second Paul Smith store in London , ' he says .
He is a good model for his designs , on the day we met he was wearing a beautiful gingham cowboy shirt , trousers and brown suede shoes with lilac socks . '
A Japanese licensing scout - someone who looks out for burgeoning businesses that would work well there - had been watching me .
Japan was hungry for young European designers .
I was so excited to be travelling to this place called "" Japan "" .
I was humbled just by being invited . '
It was a timely move .
The 1980s saw a fashion explosion in Japan .
The rise of youth movements in the country and an economic boom meant that opportunities were plentiful for these young European designers . '
Loads of designers were invited out to Japan in the Eighties , ' he says . '
But they were disrespectful and looked at the country as something of a cash cow .
They wanted the first - class air travel , chauffeur - driven cars , the works .
I was the opposite .
I 'd only been in business eight years , it was a phenomenal opportunity .
I took Pauline and we went to visit the licensee in Osaka . '
Paul was surprised at what he found there . '
That first visit was daunting .
There were only three people working in the company .
They 'd never owned or ran a shop , they did n't advertise , did n't know about getting editorial in magazines - all the things that are key to running a fashion business in Europe .
They 'd never made socks or shirts - they were tailors .
This company made older men 's fashion , pure and simple . '
Japan proved too attractive an opportunity to pass by for Smith and it was at this moment he began his lifelong relationship with the country : ' I was young and very keen .
I 'd make visits to the factory several times a year , which I believe was key to our success .
I also designed pieces for the Japanese market from scratch ; they were getting pure "" Paul Smith "" .
I was daunted - there was a tremendous amount to learn , but they also had a lot to learn about me and the modern fashion market , which gave us some common ground . '
I could n't speak the language , but I could communicate .
I 'm very animated , which breaks down barriers . '
You believe him .
He 's given to wild gesticulations and vivid facial expressions , complementing a keen sense of humour inherited from his father .
It 's hard not to be enthralled by him : ' The Japanese had , and still have , a love of British culture .
Japanese people have a close relationship with British music ; they were aware I knew David Bowie , David Hockney ...
so when Japanese people met me , or latterly , bought Paul Smith , it almost enabled them to plug into that European scene somehow . '
The first Paul Smith store opened in Tokyo in 1984 . '
The licensee lost money on Paul Smith for the first three years , ' he says . '
But it did n't really matter to them .
The way business relationships work in Japan is completely different to here .
It 's not all about making money - though it is an important factor , of course .
The Japanese get into business relationships for the long - term to give you time to understand the market .
Once you 've proved you know what you 're doing , they really trust you and are more willing to invest in your ideas .
By our fourth and fifth years in Japan , Paul Smith had started making money . '
Neither Paul Smith the man , nor the manufacturing licensees - now number ing eight in different sectors of the business , from men 's and womenswear to accessories - have looked back .
In 2004 - 2005 , Paul Smith Japan saw an increase in retail turnover of 10 per cent . '
I 've been to Japan more than 80 times now , ' he says .
' I 've got my own office there .
It 's completely independent from the licensees , which means Paul Smith is in control of its own destiny .
We 're constantly policing our brand and our image , looking after the location of new stores , the advertising we do etc .
It 's unique . '
After opening in Japan , Paul Smith Ltd went to Korea and Singapore : ' We 've now got 12 shops in Korea , which are worth a few million .
Then there are two in Singapore and two in Bangkok .
We 've got six stores in China . '
Despite being located in more than 50 countries , every Paul Smith store is individual .
The LA store is a bright pink - painted modernist building ; the ' Shop of Heavenly Peace ' in Osaka was built in 1956 and used to sell Buddhist shrines ; in Beijing , Paul Smith sells old vinyl - ' loads of old Stones records , and back copies of Melody Maker and NME ' .
As for the Big Apple : ' When we opened in New York 14 years ago , all the expat Brits used to come in and ask if we sold Mars Bars , but we could n't due to local health and safety regulations . '
With all this success in Asia , where next for Paul Smith ? '
The big three - Russia , India and China - are the places everyone wants to be .
India is a very young market .
China is changing rapidly ; in theory , mainland China has great potential for us , but it 's still early days .
Fashion brands which have opened there - Zegna and Dunhill - are starting to do well .
Louis Vuitton will do well because of its logo .
Because Paul Smith do n't really "" do "" branding , it will take us longer to grow . '
Where does Smith get the energy ? '
I just love life .
I like to be interested and interesting .
I go swimming every day at 6.30am , then on for toast and Marmite at the same cafÃ© .
Walking to work I stop and talk to the road sweeper in Old Compton Street , he 's a great guy .
He 's Polish and got married three weeks ago .
We 're all the same .
I do n't see myself as just a brand , Paul Smith is more than that . '
He 's certainly right about that ."

2006-06-17,"Brooklyn 's TVOTR were courted by David Bowie after he heard their 2004 debut , Desperate Youth , Blood Thirsty Babes .
He stuck with them : as well as advising them to release their own anti - Bush song online , he turns up here on the memorable ' Province ' , which sounds more like the galaxy expanding than a conventional pop song .
The band - ex - film student Tunde Adebimpe ( who once worked as an illustrator on MTV 's Celebrity Deathmatch ) , visual artist David Sitek ( who has a trend - popping CV featuring production for Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the Liars ) and electric - haired Kyp Malone - are natural Bowie allies : they 're experimental and summon the spirit of Spiritualized , Lee Perry , the Beach Boys and Radiohead into a glorious , life - affirming entity .
The latter reference is particularly relevant - if only to mention the knowing title of the group 's debut EP , ' OK Calculator ' .
Return to Cookie Mountain , which was recorded ad hoc at Sitek 's New York studio over 12 months , is a warmer , more linear record than their debut , dissolving and expanding through occasionally irritating production ( how wonderful could they sound with a producer who was n't in the band ? ) into moments of fabulous surrender .
And they 're one of few groups who could toss a word like ' unconjoined ' into their lyrics without sounding like tossers .
When the band decide to propel their songs forwards they even come close to the kind of indie - pop that has been fuelling dancefloors everywhere this decade . '
Wolf
Like Me ' , which features Celebration 's Katrina Ford , might slow down in the middle - this is TVOTR and there must be a twist - but it is after - midnight mayhem incarnate .
Spellbinding , frustrating , wonderful .
Download : ' Province ' ; ' Wolf Like Me '"
2006-06-23,"Stop , children - what 's that sound ?
At least once a day , as ITV begins its World Cup coverage , the viewing public is subjected to a snatch of David Bowie 's "" Heroes "" ( the quotation marks are meant to be there ) , suddenly robbed of its chord structure , central riff and air of profound majesty .
At first , its indie - rock flimsiness threw me a curve .
Was it the work , perhaps , of those stage - school fakirs the Kooks ?
Given its underlying sense of trying a bit too hard , could we blame Johnny Borrell and Razorlight , the 21st century 's own Boomtown Rats ?
But no
: we can actually thank Leicester 's designer oiks Kasabian , a band for whom I have usually had quite a lot of time , in a slightly arch kind of way .
Before their people begin sending in irate emails , I understand at least some of the thinking at work : the undercarriage of their treatment is a homage to Neu ! , the DÃ¼sseldorf avant - rock gods who were such an influence on Bowie and his collaborator Brian Eno during their time in Berlin .
Woo !
Meta - rock retrospective MÃ¶bius strip reglueing , or what ?
Well , no .
As Mancunian slang would have it , the result is actually bobbins .
Given the history of "" Heroes "" covers , this is no great surprise .
There is , for example , a live version by Blondie , put to tape in early 1980 , in which Debbie Harry can not make up her mind how to sing it , and the whole band seem to crumble in the face of the task before them .
Noel Gallagher had a very ill - advised bash in 1997 , Oasis 's pointless version appearing on the B - side of D'You
Know
What I Mean ?
There are equally unsatisfactory renditions by talents as diverse as King Crimson , Nico , PJ Proby and the Magnetic Fields .
Apparently , erstwhile Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan delivered a version at Dennis Rodman 's 36th birthday party , which - and if I 'm wrong , please send in the evidence - was surely not much cop .
The reason is down to what might be rather pretentiously termed authorial specificity .
No one apart from Bowie has ever been resident in Berlin with Iggy Pop , drugged to the gills and convinced they might alchemise their own self - importance , the thrilling melodrama of the cold war and humankind 's empathy with dolphins into a six - minute song .
Thinking about it , few producers have ever matched Tony Visconti 's inspired idea of setting up three microphones in front of his charge , and taping the loudest verses through the one that was 50 ft away , so they sounded like the work of someone bravely yelling into the historical void .
And what of the genius wheeze of recording it in three different langauges ?
In English , "" Heroes "" is great .
Bowie 's French version may be even better .
But , as with Kraftwerk 's The Model and Falco 's 1986 hit Rock Me Amadeus , my favourite version is in German , proving that language can actually sound like the perfect rock medium .
The way Bowie yelps the key lines , all of a tremble at the wonder of it all - "" Dann sind wir Helden !
Nur diesen tag ! ""
- is really a treat .
This next bit will sound ludicrous , but whatever : despite the fact that "" Heroes "" only reached No 24 in the charts , I have a dream of the UK 100 years hence , in which the monarchy has been toppled , military bands have disappeared , and it is the national anthem ( chiefly , I think , because there is something very British about the fact that the song 's titular ambition can only be realised "" just for one day "" ) .
If you doubt that could ever be a good idea , go down to the video shop and get out the otherwise unsatisfactory Steve Coogan vehicle The Parole Officer , and watch the strangely moving closing credits , in which what looks like the entire population of Manchester dance and mime along .
Massed national choirs would probably serve to underscore an inescapable fact .
Only David Bowie - at a very specific phase of his progress , on very specific substances , with very specific friends - could do this .
The rest of us ( and that includes you , Leicester chaps ) should really leave well alone ."
2006-07-02,"TV on the Radio Return to Cookie Mountain ( 4AD
) Brooklyn 's partly deserved reputation as home to New York 's hapless fashion victims is overturned by the sheer talent of local band TV on the Radio .
The five - piece manage to be arty while steering more clear of pretension than their mates the Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
Their second album features highprofile TVOTR fan
David Bowie on backing vocals : rather aptly , as this is precisely the kind of album he ought to make himself . '
Province ' ( on which Bowie co - stars ) and ' Wolf Like Me ' are ceaselessly inventive but tuneful enough to win them an audience who would usually avoid ' art rock ' like the plague .
Lynsey Hanley
The Divine Comedy Victory for the Common Muse ( Parlophone ) Neil Hannon and cohorts took a fortnight to record this , his first outing since the absorbing Absent Friends in 1994 ; its 11 tracks in 44 minutes sounds all the fresher for it .
Opener '
To Die a Virgin ' bounds along , like the Beatles mixed with latterday Madness ; '
Mother Dear ' mixes stirring strings and a tidy bit of banjo ; new single ' Diva Lady ' has a Sixties Latin feel coupled with a cheesy synth line that recalls Pulp . '
A Lady of a Certain Age ' , a slightly spiteful lament for an uppermiddle - class embalmee , is a great song .
Molloy Woodcraft Love Is All Nine Times
That Same Song ( What 's Your Rupture )
Love Is All lie at the heart of a Swedish scene that makes Abba seem like a very bad dream .
Formed from the ashes of John Peel favourites Girlfrendo , the collective came up with a plan : up sticks to New York and play insane live shows in the hope of getting a record deal .
Their debut encapsulates the passion they needed to succeed .
It 's a perfectly ramshackle , post - punk affair . '
Talk Talk Talk ' demands your attention ; ' Turn the Radio Off ' is a glorious singalong .
The thrilling double act of Josephine Olausson 's shrieks and Frederick Eriksson 's haphazard saxophone will leave you buzzing .
Sarah Phillips
Various Rough Trade Shops :
Singer Songwriter 01 ( Mute )
Always a genre to attract accusations of self - indulgence and miserabilism , ' singer - songwriter ' now means the dull platitudes of James Blunt .
Fortunately , the High Fidelity - style obsessives at Rough Trade 's shops have other definitions - 39 of them , drawn mostly from the 1990s and all from the British / American independent sector .
Alongside the fey confessionals come splendid examples of the song as revenge ( Franklin Bruno , Elvis Costello ) , alienation ( Elliott Smith ) and idiosyncracy ( Vic Chesnutt , Daniel Johnston ) .
It 's lo - fi at times , but never phoney , never Blunt .
Neil Spencer Gil Evans Complete Pacific Jazz Sessions ( Blue Note ) Recently discovered master tapes produce a spectacular new edition of two late-1950s classic albums , New Bottle , Old Wine and Great Jazz Standards .
Several editing cuts have been restored , too .
Evans was then at the peak of his career , having just recorded two famous albums with Miles Davis , and the band here includes such stars as Cannonball Adderley and Art Blakey , but the greatest revelation is the sadly overlooked trumpeter Johnny Coles .
His unique combination of strength and delicacy shines through on every track .
Evans 's orchestrations are every bit as dazzling as on his better known work .
Dave Gelly Various Africa Calling : Live8 at Eden ( Real World )
While Hyde Park staged a concert for Africa that marginalised African musicians , Cornwall 's Eden Project hosted a celebration of the continent 's talents .
The euphoria of the occasion crackles from this live album , which lopes from the flamenco / Arab fusion of Algeria to the mesmeric mbira sounds of Zimbabwe by way of Senegalese hip hop .
Unlike its rock counterpart , the show blended electric and acoustic , putting incendiary performances by Angelique Kidjo and Somali rap star Emmanuel Jal ( a former child soldier ) alongside thrumming Somali chants and the eerie fado vocals of Mariza .

2006-09-08,"HMV is to launch a national advertising campaign featuring David Bowie , Ozzy Osbourne and Razorlight among other stars in a bid to emphasise its specialist music credentials .
The campaign , called "" My inspiration "" , uses 10 artists and a lyric from a song that has inspired each of them .
David Bowie has chosen a line from Syd Barrett 's Gigolo Aunt , while Sir Elton John selected the Scissor Sisters ' Take Your Mama .
Other artists include Ozzy Osbourne , who chose Bruce Springsteen 's Working Class Hero , Paul Weller , who selected the Beatles ' Strawberry Fields
Forever , as well as Razorlight , Richard Hawley , The Killers and The Fratellis .
The campaign begins next week and will appear in titles including NME and the Guardian .
In a departure for HMV , the ads will feature no price promotion or product shots , instead focusing on reinforcing the HMV brand and raising awareness of its hmv.co.uk and hmvdigital.com websites .
HMV has struggled against competitors , including supermarkets , and the growth in music downloads .
In September last year , HMV ploughed Â£ 4 m into launching its own download service , HMV Digital , in conjunction with Microsoft to belatedly try to retain customers flocking to Apple 's iTunes and other such providers .
It has recently overhauled the service .
HMV this week launched a television campaign using the tagline "" Be inspired "" , which features a scene from The Wizard of Oz with the yellow brick road changed to HMV 's signature magenta .
Other ads yet to air will feature the "" Play it for me "" scene from Casablanca and the famous "" Here 's Johnny "" scene from The Shining .
After a poor Christmas sales period , the HMV chief executive , Alan Giles , announced he would step down , admitting that a key factor in his decision was the "" quantum jump "" in online spending that he had originally thought would not surpass 10 % of all sales .
In the nine weeks until the end of June , HMV announced a 16 % decline in like - for - like sales .
The campaign has been created by Quiet Storm .

2006-09-27,"Nokia is launching a global music service , fronted by David Bowie , in the first stage of its strategy to take on the might of Apple 's iPod .
The service , called Music Recommenders , brings together tips and new music downloads recommended by 40 independent music stores across the world .
It has been masterminded by media planning agency Naked and music strategy agency Frukt , and will initially offer downloads at 89p a track - 10p more than Apple 's iTunes - in the UK and Australia only .
The service is powered by Loudeye , the music download provider that acquired Peter Gabriel 's OD2 service and was subsequently bough by Nokia for $ 60 m ( Â£ 31 m ) earlier this year .
The main aim is not , however , to sell downloads .
A full - scale download music service is planned for launch by Nokia next year .
Nokia is aiming to build credibility as a music brand and develop a community around the Musicrecommenders.com website , which will include content such as features and podcasts by David Bowie .
Bowie is not thought to be appearing in advertising for the service , but has been signed on to help build brand credibility .
A short film by Wim Wenders , the director of Buena Vista Social Club , promoting new music and filmed at a variety of the record store partners , will also be available online .
Ultimately , Nokia , which has sold 80 m music - enabled phones this year alone , is aiming to move people away from iPods .
Once registered for Music Recommenders , users can receive a once - a - month playlist of 30-second samples to listen to and purchase tracks they like .
The system enables users to download tracks to their PCs and then transfer them to their mobile phones .
Through the website , users can browse music and read interviews with artists . Â·

Webcameron.org.uk , which launched last week , features the Conservative leader talking politics from his kitchen and hotel rooms .
However , a rival site with a similar internet address , webcameron.info , appeared two days after the launch of the official Conservative site .
Internet users looking for webcameron who go to the .info address find a link through to a YouTube page where the spoof video is available .
At the foot of its homepage is small print stating : "" ( c)1996 New Labour .
All words , hand gestures , insincere facial expressions and media stunts used strictly under licence from the Labour Party 's mid-90 's ' Spin your way to the top ' guide .
"" The spoof video comes from Iannucci 's recent BBC2 show , Time Trumpet , and features footage of Mr Cameron speaking , intercut with snippets of speeches by the prime minister , Tony Blair , in which he uses exactly the same phrases .
Towards the end of the spoof video , the two leaders become synched with Bowie song Changes .
So far around 7,000 people have viewed the clip .
According to domain name management company NetNames , the web address is registered to UKIPhome , a support group of UKIP that claims to be the "" unofficial , unauthorised but proudly pro - Ukip voice for positive , progressive , small government reform "" .

Another website with a similar name , webcameron.com , run by an Australian poet called Cameron M Semmens , crashed following the launch of Mr Cameron 's website , after UK users went online to try to find the video blog .
The poet has since put a note up on the homepage of his website stating clearly that it is not Mr Cameron 's weblog .
According to Mr Cameron 's first video post , on September 29 , the website is intended as a "" really good way of communicating directly with people about what the Conservative party is doing and what we believe in "" .
Mr Cameron has also not registered the webcameron.eu domain name .

2006-10-16,"David Bowie 's Life on Mars is to provide the soundtrack to a television advertising campaign for mobile phone company 3 .
Promoting 3 's new music download service , 3MusicStore , the ad is the third brand in little over a month to use the iconic rocker in a music - focused campaign .
The commercial , which breaks tonight , features a man and child sitting around a campfire on a beach singing a cover of Life on Mars , to highlight the possibility of downloading music anytime and anywhere .
3MusicStore allows customers to buy over 500,000 tracks online and straight from the handset .
The company claims it accounts for around 75 % of the mobile music download market in the UK .
Last month , Nokia launched a global music service , Music Recommenders , using Bowie to promote the initiative although he is not thought to be appearing in ads for the service , but rather is helping the brand build credibility .
And HMV launched a campaign last month that featured a number musicians , including Bowie , citing their career influences .
The poster ads formed part of a wider campaign , called ' Be inspired ' that HMV hopes will claw back music sales which have nosedived due to the rise of online music downloading .
The new campaign for 3 , by ad agency WCRS , will also include outdoor , radio , online and instore advertising .

2006-10-27,"In the 16 years since splitting his great 1980s band , the Replacements , Paul Westerberg has become alt - rock 's David Bowie : every album sees hopeful fans proclaiming his latest record "" his best since ... ""
His new one sees Westerberg in his most unlikely guise yet - soundtracking a kids ' cartoon - so hopes for an artistic revival are redundant before one even turns on the CD player .
In fact , it 's a perfectly serviceable record of eight Westerberg songs - think an edgier Tom Petty or John Fogerty - augmented with four tracks by other artists .
The problem is the saminess .
While the crunch of Westerberg 's guitar satisifies when the album opens , by the fifth mid - paced , drive - time rock number , one craves variety .
And when it comes , in the form of the ballad Good Day , it does n't work : Westerberg 's refrain of "" A good day
/ is any day that you 're alive "" loses any emotional impact when you remember he 's singing about cartoon animals escaping cartoon hunters ."
2006-11-10,"Christopher Nolan 's own prestige takes a knock with this fantastically boring and self - important movie about two stage magicians in Edwardian London , starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale .
There 's a reliably eccentric cameo from David Bowie , playing the maverick inventor Nikola Tesla , investigating the magic of electricity in his secret lair , surrounded by what looks like a couple of dozen giant - sized Van de Graaff generators , all zapping unsafely away and looking like they might at any moment incinerate
Bowie 's splendidly contoured moustache .
Scarlett Johansson plays an unfeasibly sexy magician 's assistant with a cock - er - ney accent that makes her sound like Martine McCutcheon 's Canadian cousin .
Jackman and Bale play Angier and Borden , two magicians consumed with fanatical rivalry and hatred .
Jackman is the debonair stylist addicted to applause ; Bale is the pugnacious wide - boy with the genuine vocation for magic .
Michael Caine is landed with the supremely dull role of the "" ingeneur "" - the backroom boffin who has to listen to , and deliver , explanatory speeches .
""
Prestige "" , a magicians ' technical term invented by author Christopher Priest for his original 1995 novel , means the crowning moment of a trick .
It 's the gasp - inducing climactic flourish , the moment whose devastating impact has to be guarded as closely as possible before detonation .
So it is odd that the prestige of this film , the trick ending , is gradually given away over the final 40 or so minutes in a series of extended takes and giveaway closeups .
Why ?
Because the director figured we were going to guess anyway ?
Christopher Nolan is not striving for his own narrative conjuring trick in the style of M Night Shyamalan or David Mamet .
Nor is he in the business of deconstructing the tricks of the magician 's trade : a little exasperatingly , he declines to reveal how a young woman can be magicked out of a tank of water and be completely dry with not a hair out of place .
The drama is supposed to reside more in the human battle , the deadly duel between these two illusionists , and the disturbing suspicion that Angiers has made a Faustian bargain with Tesla to create some genuine occult magic on the frontiers of what is scientifically thinkable .
How startlingly dull it all is .
The vital elements of wit , of insolence , of light - footedness and light - headedness that make magic so compelling - and incidentally , also made Christopher Nolan 's first two films so compelling - are all neglected in favour of a desperately humourless and unsmilingly acted contest , with borrowings from David Cronenberg .
Unexpectedly , the frisson of interest is from Bowie , who - with his patina of strangeness and awkward reticence , almost ventriloquising his lines from a near - immobile face - does indeed seem like a man with a hint of craziness , or genius .
The movie 's opening and closing images are of a hillside covered , surreally , in top hats .
There are no rabbits to be pulled from any of them ."
2006-11-12,"The Prestige ( 130 mins , 12A ) Directed by Christopher Nolan ; starring Christian Bale , Hugh Jackman , Michael Caine , David Bowie , Scarlett Johansson
There are few more enjoyable experiences in the cinema than seeing a director make a highly promising first feature and rapidly follow it up with something truly accomplished - Martin Scorsese 's Mean Streets coming a mere few months after Boxcar Bertha , for example , Neil Jordan going straight on from Angel to the extraordinary The Company of Wolves and , at the cusp of the century , Christopher Nolan proceeding directly from the shoestring Following to the mesmeric Memento .
Nolan kept up the momentum with Insomnia and Batman Begins , the one a Hollywood remake of a Norwegian film , the other a revival of a franchise .
In both , he pursues themes from the earlier movies that continue to preoccupy him in his outstanding new picture , The Prestige , among them the nature of time and perception , dangerous rivalries and serious game - playing between men and the changing , doubling and questioning of identities .
In The Prestige , which is co - scripted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from a novel by Christopher Priest , the rivals are stage magicians in late Victorian London , Robert Angier ( Hugh Jackman ) , a smooth American , and Alfred Borden ( Christian Bale ) , a rough - hewn cockney .
We first see them together dressed as working men planted in the audience to be brought on stage to assist a magician performing a trick that involves a woman being bound with ropes and locked in a glass box filled with water .
Their employer is , in fact , the celebrated real - life illusionist Ricky Jay , a regular collaborator of David Mamet , a writer fascinated by confidence trickery .
The woman in the act is Angier 's wife .
In a voice - over commentary , Cutter ( Michael Caine ) , an elderly deviser of magic equipment and a respectful , very knowing artisan among artists , explains that a magic performance unfolds in three stages .
The first is ' the Pledge ' , wherein we 're shown something ; the second , ' the Turn ' , centres on a disappearance ; in the climactic third part , ' the Prestige ' ( a term deriving from prestidigitation , but also implying respect and admiration ) , a person or object is miraculously brought back , leaving the audience stunned and delighted .
This sequence of events informs the structure of the film as well as the tricks , the most significant of which is known as ' the Transported Man ' .
Angier and Borden come to have different , competing versions of this legendary trick .
The two men begin as friends , then , when an act goes lethally wrong , they become rivals and increasingly deadly enemies .
The movie beautifully creates the world of stage illusion and the workshops in which the tricks are created , as well as looking at the ethos , the ethics and the ambitions of the performers .
Angier is a second - rate magician , but a brilliant showman ; Borden is a magician of genius , but poor at presenting himself .
Their relationship in some ways resembles that between Salieri and Mozart in Amadeus .
The rivalry drives both men towards acts of madness and the film asks what it is that produces this urge to deceive and to puzzle , and why the public delights in being manipulated , fooled and astonished .
This being a Nolan movie , the film does not proceed chronologically .
It moves around in time and among the various narrative strands are the story of the evolving relationship between the two men , the reflections of Cutter as the crucial observer , the Old Bailey trial of Borden for murder ( though the identity of his victim is concealed ) and a visit to Colorado Springs in the Rockies made by Angier .
During this sojourn in the States , Angier is reading Borden 's encrypted diary and secret notebook , which he has purloined , but the purpose of his journey is to see the fabulous maverick scientist Nicolai Tesla ( 1856 - 1943 ) , the movie 's only real - life character , inventor of alternating current and radio .
In the film 's scheme of things , Tesla is working in an isolated laboratory on scientific projects that go beyond the ken of his former employer , Thomas Edison .
Angier 's ambition , we infer , is to transcend humanly created illusions by drawing on the powers of advanced science , and this takes us into the realms of science fiction and Frankensteinian hubris .
The reserved , immaculately dressed Tesla is magisterially impersonated by David Bowie .
After a single viewing , I 'm not sure I could describe the order of events in Nolan 's film .
Yet though one may be puzzled , just as one is by an illusionist , everything seems lucid and leads to a succession of revelations that left me stunned .
I was still working out their implications long after leaving the cinema .
The Prestige is a dazzling piece of work that left me eager to see it again and to read Priest 's novel .
The film is immaculately assembled with magnificently stylised sets by production designer Nathan Crowley , acute editing by Lee Smith and wonderfully atmospheric but wholly unaffected photography by Wally Pfister .
They 've all previously collaborated with Nolan , in Pfister 's case on all his pictures since Following , which Nolan himself photographed .
The performances of Bale and Jackman complement each other superbly and Caine brings a seriousness and dignity to Cutter , a role that combines the best aspects of his theatrical agent in Little Voice and his butler in Batman Begins .
As in earlier Nolan films , the women 's roles are unrewarding , though Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson do well enough as Borden 's naive wife and Angier 's duplicitous stage assistant .
If I have given the impression that the film is unduly cerebral or opaque , let me say that in addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders , The Prestige is gripping , suspenseful , mysterious , moving and often darkly funny ."
2006-11-15,"Here 's a nice idea from Nokia - music recommenders , a service where they bring together recordheads to point out new music for you .
Among the recommenders are David Bowie ( he 's the one on the left , kiddies ) as well as music maestros from some of the world 's best music shops such hip - hop mecca Fat Beats in New York .
I spoke to Nokia 's David Robertson earlier , who assured me that it 's not part of a revenue sharing deal - so the recommendations are purely altruistic .
If you 're the kind of person who trolls Last.fm for new music , or spends an inordinate amount of time in record shops , it could come in handy .
I already keep my eye on David Byrne 's radio playlist , which has thrown up a few gems , and so getting recommendations from someone like Bowie would n't be half bad .

2006-11-24,"A plastic Christmas tree , a homemade bread bin and a wheelbarrow hauled from the garden shed , all at one time owned by Syd Barrett , the founding Pink Floyd member who died a recluse , will go up for auction next week .
The list of possessions , including a guitar , speakers and furniture came to light as Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour announced an EP tribute to his former bandmate , who died of pancreatic cancer in July aged 60 .
The three - track EP will feature a live version of Arnold Layne , recorded by Gilmour and David Bowie at the Royal Albert Hall in May.
Available by download before Christmas , it will include Gilmour 's acoustic version of Dark Globe , a track from Barrett 's solo debut , The Madcap Laughs .
From Boxing Day it will be available on CD and vinyl but only for three weeks .
Barrett , credited by many as the genius behind Pink Floyd , spent 30 years living modestly in a Â£ 300,000 suburban semi following a breakdown , but left more than Â£ 1.2 m in his will .
The auction is at Cheffins in Cambridge on Wednesday .

2006-12-08,"In May this year , David Bowie was a surprise guest at one of David Gilmour 's three Royal Albert Hall shows , joining the Pink Floyd guitarist for a rendition of the band 's debut single , Arnold Layne .
Just a few weeks later , the writer and original singer of the track , Syd Barrett , passed away .
Gilmour has decided to release Bowie 's version as a single in tribute to Barrett , and the live video from the Albert Hall show is currently airing exclusively on Radio 2 's website ( www.bbc.co.uk/radio2 ) .
As ever , Bowie looks five years younger than the last time you saw him , delivering an icily confident performance punctuated by a breezy organ wig - out from Richard Wright .
You can tell from the audience reaction it was great to be there , but watching at home it does feel a little chummy and safe compared to the snappy psychedelic energy of the original .
More rewarding is the song 's original 1967 video ( search "" Arnold Layne "" on YouTube ) , a surreal slice of Beatles - esque silliness that features the four original members larking about on a beach with a mannequin .
Arguably more adept at bringing a 60s sound into the new millennium is rising Scouse songstress Candie Payne .
The 24-year - old is tipped for big things next year with her modern day twist on classic soul - pop .
Payne 's MySpace page ( www.myspace.com/candiepayne ) cites influences including "" Dusty in Memphis , Marlena Shaw , Billie Holiday , Serge Gainsbourg , John Barry and Peggy Lee "" .
If that gives you a pretty impressive notion of how Payne might sound , the joy of the songs on her MySpace player is that they match it .
Draped over richly orchestrated productions , Payne 's warm , expressive voice recalls Sandie Shaw and Francoise Hardy as she sings songs that flit deliciously between joy , melancholy and pain .
Signed to Sony imprint Deltasonic - home to the Coral and Payne 's brother 's band the Zutons -

2006-12-15,"Steeleye Span are survivors .
Thirty - five years ago , when the band included Martin Carthy and Ashley Hutchings , they competed with Fairport Convention in the vanguard of English folk - rock .
Then they became massively commercial , working with everyone from David Bowie to Peter Sellers .
And after that ... well , they just kept going , decade after decade , and fell from fashion partly because they were always around .
The new album is a reminder that they should n't be ignored , even when they dare to revive the classic Cold , Haily , Windy Night , which originally featured Carthy on vocals and unexpectedly loud electric guitar , and is now an easy - going rocker .
There are few surprises here , but it 's encouraging to find that founder - member Maddy Prior is still in excellent voice , fellow veteran Peter Knight is still playing great fiddle , and the distinctive Steeleye harmonies are still in place on their sturdy new songs ."
2006-12-31,"When I was four , I was convinced that David Bowie was from outer space .
He was number one with his single ' Ashes to Ashes ' , the video for which featured his haunted , feline form in a number of settings : crouching in a padded room , hanging mid - air in a dungeony purgatory , sitting helpless and miniaturised in a Formica kitchen .
I watched that clip on Top of the Pops and could n't believe he was real .
Since then , that 's been pretty much my definition of a great pop star .
It took me years to register Bowie as someone fully human : so strange were his looks , mannerisms , songs and general way of being that even now I find myself wondering about him .
For this man , who spent years of his life single - nosedly supporting the Bolivian economy and subsisting on small pieces of cheese , to reach 60 - which he does in eight days ' time - makes you wonder whether some people really are immortal , or simply not of this world .
Bowie was the first star to make idolisation - the idea that his fans would place him on such a high pedestal that he could never again be ' one of us ' - part of his act .
It began in 1972 with Ziggy Stardust , a character whose rise , fall and rapid obsolescence was built by Bowie into the very songs his alter - ego sang .
He had witnessed the hysterical fandom inspired by Elvis and the Beatles and saw that a single inspired creation could make people believe that he was like no one else on earth .
Which is more than can be said for Ronan Keating .
Ziggy , channelled through Bowie , was the ultimate pop star : he was polymorphously perverse , had a messiah ( or , more precisely , a Nietzschean superman ) complex , and was convinced the world was about to implode .
A more combustible mixture of teenage preoccupations is hard to imagine .
He represented all the parallel universes you could step into just by listening to a record and turning your hair an unnatural shade of orange .
Which I did , though not until I was 18 .
The 14 years that had lapsed between my early sighting of him and my adolescent obsession were spent loving acts that were indebted to the flame - haired apparition : Duran Duran , Japan , the Pet Shop Boys , and later Suede , the Britpop - inventing band who started out brilliantly , but alas - unlike Bowie - got worse , not better , the more drugs they took .
( Another reason to wonder whether he was made of actual human flesh . )
What these bands shared with their hero was a love for making pop as elevated and dramatic as any opera , and the knowledge that style meant nothing without content .
The sheer speed with which he passed through his later incarnations - a pirate from space in 1974 , a bequiffed soul boy in ' 75 , a creepy Thin White Duke the following year , an adoptive Berliner the year after that - and musical styles suggest a man of superhuman imagination .
One year he was an acoustic - strumming hippy , the next he would corral the Spiders From Mars as his band and create some of the most explosive rock'n'roll of the 1970s .
I often wonder what it must have been like to have been a Bowie fan at the time that he was releasing an album every year and , seemingly , changing the course of music with every record .
He was , in his own words , ' a fly in milk ' , absorbing influences and throwing them back out , which is why he made a soul album , the wonderful Young Americans , within months of moving to the US in 1975 and used the bleak sights of divided Berlin to create his introverted masterpiece Low .
All the while looking and sounding not quite human , he managed to write hits that were n't only memorable but had mass pop appeal : ' Life on Mars ' , ' Jean Genie ' , ' Fame ' , ' Heroes ' and ' Ashes to Ashes ' - the strangest number one ever released .
He seemed to be able to change his very being just by changing his clothes and hairstyle , which suggests to anyone that they can do the same thing to the same effect .
I ca n't say I developed immortal powers by having my hair styled in the same way as his character Thomas Jerome Newton in his one good film ,
The Man Who Fell To Earth ,
but it gave the experience of selling doughnuts in a Birmingham branch of Greggs in the early 1990s a subversive frisson .
The customers would peer at the bright - red strands poking out of my hygienic hair - cap and wonder what sort of weirdy was serving them a steak bake .
I felt as though I 'd been touched by the hand of Bowie , which gave every second of my life a special significance .
Since the 1990s Bowie has been less of a trendsetter and more of a mentor and icon to the many who took his cue and decided to invent and reinvent themselves : not so much out of the loop as existing in a loop he created all of his own .
It was Suede who sent me headlong into an obsession with their forebear that - at the risk of sounding like a prime candidate for psychological help - has made a large segment of my adult life feel like one endless , excitable daydream .
My parting gift to my parents as I left home for London was a colourful mural of Bowie 's various phases along one side of my bedroom wall .
It 's still there : every time I visit , a little more poster paint has cracked off the lightning flash across Aladdin Sane 's face , which I trace with my finger for good luck .
What makes this Pooterish story slightly more credible is that , unbeknown to me , the man who was to become my husband was painting exactly the same thing on his bedroom wall 200 miles away .
How many pop stars are there , truly , who have inspired such feats of devotion ?
We were n't so unusual .
A litany of Bowie fans , their lives and careers transformed by his music , turn up on Mark Radcliffe 's Radio 2 documentary , which airs next Saturday at 8 pm , two days before Bowie 's 60th .
Its title , Inspirational Bowie , sums up everything about a man who , in his own words , was long troubled by ' a repulsive need to be something more than human ' .
Bowie 's youthful belief that he felt ' puny as a human ' ended up persuading not only himself but millions of others that they could be touched by a bit of space - dust and make anything seem possible .
You 're not going to become a better person by listening to someone who , raddled by cocaine and sent to the edge of madness by his fans (
' We 're just the space cadets , and he 's the commander , ' said one wide - eyed LA girl in Cracked Actor , Alan Yentob 's 1974 film about Bowie ) , started talking up Hitler as ' the first great rock star ' .
Neither would it be a good idea always to take Nietzsche literally .
But what Bowie did , and continues to do , is to exert a hold over people who are open to the idea that you can go far beyond what is expected of you in life .
It 's not an exaggeration to say that I owe the life I have now to him and to the artists he inspired .
It 's a lot to ask of our pop stars , but in my experience it 's what they 've proved to be best at .
Inspiring others to try and fulfil their potential is n't superhuman : it 's mere , mortal humanity at its best . Â·

2007-01-01,"Incredible but true : David Bowie turns 60 in just over a week 's time .
For many of us , he 'll always be a whippet - thin , ageless , sexually amorphous creature from the outer reaches of the universe who transformed the face of pop and whose legacy , even if he never makes another record , is assured .
To others , he 's simply an overrated musical magpie who never had an original idea in his life .
( Genius steals , that 's what I say . )
In the Observer Review , we pay tribute to the Dame and examine his lasting influence on today 's music stars .
In advance of that , we hereby humbly suggest five Bowie albums you should n't live without .
We 'd like to hear from you , whether it is to tell us what your favourite album is or - if you dare , for I will smite your face with an indelible bolt of lightning
- you want to explain why you 're not a fan .
1 .
Low ( 1977 ) Alienated , withdrawn , detached , deluded :
that 's the state of mind
Bowie had reached when he extricated himself from Los Angeles and cocaine addiction in 1977 , moving to West Berlin , where he could lie low - hence the title - and make use of the city 's famous Hansa by the Wall recording studio .
Ever curious , he absorbed the city 's isolated feel and expressed the withdrawal from his old life through a mixture of bombastic , emotion - stripped rock and subdued electronic instrumental music .
A true example of pop as art .
2 .
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars ( 1972 )
I defy anyone not to punch the air the moment
Bowie , as his wild and bendy alter - ego Ziggy , sings "" Aaaaah , wham - bam , thank you ma'am ! "" on this album 's thrilling climax , ' Suffragette City ' .
It could have been seen as a horrid rock opera , or worse , a concept album , yet , Bowie managed to suspend disbelief in his invented character , a doomed rock star whose fame sent him mad , through the sheer quality of the songs .
Glam rock was invented and never bettered here , and can you think of a better song than ' Starman ' to sing along to ?
3 .
Station to Station ( 1976 )
You would n't want to have been Bowie when he made this record , which remains among the most compelling documents of what drugs can do to your head .
By 1976 , Bowie had fallen deeply for cocaine , whose attendant sensations of omnipotence and grandiosity led him to "" become "" the Thin White Duke , a staring - mad aristocrat with shades of Oswald Mosley .
This is an album of long , demanding tracks that , lyrically , alternate between ice - faced posturing and desperate cries for help .
The music is taut funk rock that never lets up and never quite lets you in , which is the source of its creepy magic .
4 .
Young Americans ( 1975 )
Bowie 's worldwide success in the early 1970s was cemented in the US by the 1974 "" Philly Dogs "" tour , which began as a stiffly theatrical performance , but - a prime example of Bowie 's industrious curiosity - swiftly became a soul revue after he picked up on the disco and r'n'b hits coming out of Philadelphia .
Young Americans is soulful insofar as Bowie quickly mastered a raspy , yearning singing voice , backed up with the exquisite vocals of Luther Vandross and Ava Cherry , but is a gauche , poppy version of Philly
soul - Bowie himself termed it "" plastic soul "" - that has a great charm of its own .
5 .
Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) ( 1980 )
With the 1970s over and his ' Berlin trilogy ' of experimental albums completed , Bowie could have eased towards a quiet , if horribly early , retirement .
Instead , reinvigorated and inspired by both British punk and the US take on punk provided by bands such as Television and Talking Heads , he steamed right in and created the most political album of his career to date .
Determined to rectify the lingering stain on his character left by the Thin White Duke , he stated his disgust with fascism on the songs '
It 's No Game ' and the huge hit ' Fashion ' ( the anti - Nazi song you can dance to ! ) . '
Ashes to Ashes ' is unique in the pop canon : sad , reflective electronic pop of as - yet unmatched depth .
Honorable mentions : Heroes ( 1978 ) - a worthy follow - up to Low ,
its title track being one of the greatest - ever pop singles - and Aladdin Sane ( 1973 ) - a mature , sensual companion to the Ziggy album ."

Juliette Lewis and the Licks .

An actor 's announcement that he or she is set to release an album is almost as dismal and heartbreaking as news that David Bowie is about to act again .
So when it was revealed this week that John Simm , star of Human Traffic and the BBC 's excellent Life on Mars , intended to make a go of it in the music industry , I was disappointed to say the least .
Mercifully Simm , whose band Magic Alex release an album this week , is not fronting the venture .
Indeed it is probably unfair of me to call Magic Alex Simm 's band since all he does is play bass and provide backing vocals .
Indeed perhaps because Simm takes a comparatively modest role , Magic Alex turn out to be pretty damn good , sounding a little like Echo and the Bunnymen ( who they once supported ) and early Jesus and Mary Chain .
This makes Simm all but exceptional if compared with other actors who have picked up guitars .
Recently for instance Juliette Lewis , who I had always thought had exactly the sort of sexual charisma and sneering insolence rock'n'roll demands of its women , appeared in a Native American headdress with her band Juliette and the Licks .
Those who had been expecting Riot Grrl instead got a stodgy version of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts .
A few years back Keanu Reeves spent almost as much time promoting his band Dogstar as he did hyping the Matrix trilogy .
Keanu did n't quite get the whole grunge thing , thus a list of Dogstar 's unimpeachably punky influences also included absurd proto - Oi band
The Exploited .
It 's almost as if they had Googled "" the best of punk "" and unquestioningly reproduced the first thing they came across .
Then there 's Steven Seagal 's new album Mojo Priest ( his second ) , which includes such future classics as Talk to My Ass , Alligator Ass and Dust My Broom .
Worse than Juliette and Keanu , however , worse even than David Soul and Hasselhoff , is Russell Crowe .
Crowe 's desire to get his band Thirty Odd Foot Of Grunts off the ground has gone from pathological to the pathetic .
Most recently he badgered an Australian journalist into listening to some demos .
When the journalist finally succumbed he had this to say : "" It 's fair to say Russell 's music was a surprise .
Where I had expected a lumpen , tuneless racket , what I heard instead was something far less remarkable - the colourless strums of a subway busker glazed with the deodorised slick of Christian rock .
The most charitable thing I could feel about it was that it was n't complete crap . ""
Maybe Crowe wants to take his hellraising into an arena where such behaviour is not just sanctioned but celebrated .
Or perhaps it has something to do with a feeling that his day job is fake .
But music throws up just as many fakes as acting does .
Sting , Robbie Williams and Bono all seem to be acting rather than singing .
And David Bowie literally made his career by hiding behind various highly contrived personae .
So why do so many actors want to become singers ?"

By circumstance if not by design , it 's one of pop 's great expressions of fraught fraternal love , capturing the way a throttlehold can rearrange itself into a hug , and vice versa .
The chemistry between siblings can be as complex and volatile as that between lovers ( calm down Liam , I 'm not implying anything ) , but , apart from David Bowie 's recurring fascination with schizophrenic half - brother Terry ( Aladdin Sane , The Bewlay Brothers , Jump They Say ) , it 's rarely examined in song .
You 're more likely to encounter erotic fascination with other people 's sisters ( Pulp 's Babies ) or , on a few rum occasions , the narrator 's own ( Palace Brothers ' Riding , Prince 's Sister ) .
"" I was only 16 but I guess that 's no excuse , "" begins Prince .
No , Prince , I guess not .
In our first two songs , a sister is an obstacle or a go - between .

"" I 'm in love with your brother , "" Karin Dreijer urgently confides .
"" You 'll pass this on , wo n't you ? ""
Curtis Mayfield 's Beautiful Brother of Mine distinguishes the soul brother from the biological kind - "" We are not of the same seed /
Although we are both the same breed "" - but Marvin Gaye 's
What 's

Based on the experiences of his soldier brother Frankie returning from Vietnam , the cry is universal .
Now for three brothers in trouble .
Free 's amiable underachiever
Jake has it easy compared to the crackhead sibling of De La Soul 's Posdnuos .
For all the music 's rainbow - hued vibrancy , the sense of countless chances granted and wasted is heartbreaking .
Springsteen 's Nebraska album ploughs such desolate terrain that when lawman Joe Roberts begins solemnly recounting a run - in with his bad - seed brother , it bodes ill for all concerned .
So here 's a surprise : a moment of compassion , a second chance .
Elsewhere , plenty of siblings are less fortunate , whether real ( the Kinks ' Come Dancing is a fond tribute to Ray Davies ' older sister ) or imagined ( serpent - related tragedy stalks My Sister 's Tiny Hands by the Handsome Family ) .
In the latter category , Tindersticks ' My Sister is a tongue - in - cheek hard - luck tale , with Stuart Staples piling misery upon misery in a lugubrious murmur .
Mark "" E "" Everett 's loss , however , was hideously real .
The lyrics to Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor were assembled from his sister 's diary entries , discovered after her suicide in 1996 : "" My name 's Elizabeth /
My life is piss and shit . ""
Joanna Newsom uses her astrophysicist sister 's words in a less grim context on the 12-minute familial fantasia , Emily .
In the extraordinary chorus , a disquisition on the difference between meteors , meteorites and meteoroids , one sister 's scientific prose is refashioned into another 's giddy poetry .
Touchingly , Emily sings harmonies .
Finally , the disco - tabulous Sister Sledge .
They are family .
They 've got all their sisters with them .

2007-01-21,"The Man Who Fell to Earth directed by Nic Roeg , starring David Bowie ( Optimum ) Â£ 17.99 4 stars ' David Bowie is n't a great actor , ' says screenwriter Paul Mayersberg , ' but he is a brilliant amateur . '
In fact , Bowie had effectively been rehearsing the title role of The Man
Who Fell to Earth for years , his androgynous alien pop persona dovetailing perfectly with this tale of a stranger in a strange land .
Adapted from a novel by Walter Tevis , Mayersberg 's script ( which he penned to the strains of ' Space Oddity ' and ' Life on Mars ' ) posited a starman who comes to earth in search of water and winds up succumbing to the evils of drink .
Peter O'Toole was briefly considered for the lead role , but director Nic Roeg saw Bowie as the natural choice after witnessing him in the documentary Cracked Actor
The combination of frailty , charisma , and exotic other - worldliness seemed a perfect fit for the enigmatic Thomas Newton , with Bowie 's mismatched eyes merely adding to the mystery .
Bowie immersed himself in the role , allowing Newton 's extraterrestrial reflection to filter back into his pop career , with images of him featuring on the cover artwork of both Station to Station and Low - the latter featuring music inspired by the film .
As co - star Candy Clark observed : ' David really was the man who fell to earth . '
Thirty years after its first release , and in the month in which Bowie turns 60 , this remains a heady , adventurous oddity .
His fan base may have been young , but , like Roeg 's Performance and Bad Timing , this was X - rated fare , sold to the public as ' a shocking , mind - stretching experience in sight , in space ... in sex ! '
This DVD includes the succinct 2003 doc Watching the Alien in which the significant players ( but , sadly , not David ) recall the creation of an off - kilter Seventies sci - fi classic ."

There is currently a rash of bestsellers by American authors about their appalling upbringings , each pushing the envelope of horror a little further to feed a misery - hungry public .
Rash is the operative word , and this unpleasant business resembles a deadly earnest version of the Monty Python sketch in which Yorkshire business tycoons compete with each other over brandy and cigars to give the most appalling account of their deprived childhoods .
One of the most successful of these books , Augusten Burroughs ' Running with Scissors ( over two years on the New York Times bestseller list ) , has now been filmed with the author 's collaboration .
In the final credits he appears ( now on the brink of seedy middle - age ) alongside the actor Joseph Cross , who impersonates him as a 15-year - old .
Augusten was born in New England in the mid-1960s and , after a prelude in 1972 when he 's seven , most of the film is set in the late Seventies .
His mother Deirdre ( Annette Bening ) is a neurotic , self - pitying writer of no discernible talent , author of an unpublished work called A Poet 's Struggle , who models herself on the confessional poet Anne Sexton .
Her estranged husband is an alcoholic maths professor with little interest in a son who bunks out of school and aims to be a major league hairdresser like his hero Vidal Sassoon .
The uningratiatingly dotty Deirdre falls into the hands of a mad , exploitative shrink , Dr Finch ( Brian Cox ) , and his dysfunctional family .
After this implausible lunatic has officially adopted him , Augusten is seduced by another of the doctor 's adopted children , the crazy homosexual would - be author Neil ( Joseph Fiennes ) .
It 's Neil who comes ' running with scissors ' towards the sleeping Dr Finch with homicide in mind .
Sadly , the heroine of Dial M for Murder handled the domestic shears more effectively , and the movie goes on for another tedious half hour .
I did n't believe a word of this ridiculous film , could n't give a damn about what happened to these tiresome people , and ended up entirely unconcerned about Augusten and his future .
All things considered I 'd as soon spend two hours in the company of Pete Doherty and Kate Moss .
I 've thought of adapting a key on my computer so that I just have to bang it
and it types out the words ' plays an idealistic disciplinarian who becomes the football / basketball / baseball coach to a team of losers in a ghetto / prison / small town / dispirited high school , and turns them into a team of winners ' .
The subject of the sentence this week is Dwayne Johnson , the former wrestler with the nom de guerre ' the Rock ' ; the game is American football ; the place a juvenile detention centre in Los Angeles ; and the film Gridiron Gang , directed by Phil Joanou who 's most famous for a timid documentary glorifying U2 .
It 's based on a true story , and like Running with Scissors , it ends with authentic documentary footage featuring the real prison coach , who - unlike the Rock - is small , unprepossessing and white .
Welcome to Dongmakgol sounds like a whimsical Celtic musical set in a charming fairytale town , Glocca Morra in Finian 's Rainbow , say , or Brigadoon .
In fact Dongmakgol is a sort of Shangri - La in the mountains of Korea where shortly after the US marines landed at Inchon in September 1950 , two South Korean soldiers , three North Korean soldiers and an American naval pilot find themselves stranded .
In this idyllic corner of no - man 's land , untouched by war or rumours of war , these six would - be belligerents square off against each other before being won over by the simple life of the peasants , the philosophical headman and the sensible village schoolteacher .
After neutralising an invasion force , they unite to create a diversion to save their hosts from destruction .
It 's a kindly , well - meant , sentimental picture that , no doubt because of the current crisis provoked by Kim Il Sung , has proved a big popular success in South Korea .
There are several excellent variations on this theme , among them the Sanders brothers ' A Time Out of War and John Boorman 's Hell in the Pacific .

David Lean 's 1946 Great Expectations , the best of four sound versions of Dickens 's wonderful novel , is back for a run at the National Film Theatre , which is shortly to be renamed BFI : Southbank .
It competes with Lean 's Oliver Twist and George Cukor 's David Copperfield for the title of the cinema 's best Dickens adaptation .
If you want to see how Dickens anticipated the cinema , consider how little had to be done to bring the graveyard meeting between Pip and Magwitch to the screen .
If you ever get the chance , do n't miss the 1935 Hollywood version of the Mystery of Edwin Drood ( starring Claude Rains and Valerie Hobson ) where the novel 's strikingly visual opening is precisely realised on the screen ."
2007-02-09,"David Vandervelde is a 22-year - old Chicago native who appears to have slipped through a gap in the space - time continuum from an episode of Top of the Pops circa 1973 .
In thrall to the stardust fantasies of Brit glam icons such as Marc Bolan and David Bowie , Vandervelde plays every instrument on this dexterous debut : the Moonstation House Band is a Spiders from Mars - style creation .
He deliberately utilises early 1970s production techniques , and the bawdy electro - stomp of Wisdom from a Tree could be a revivified ELO , but Vandervelde is essentially a one - man tribute band to pop 's original imp of the perverse , Marc Bolan .
The LSD - pop of Feet of a Liar and prick - tease boogie of Jacket sound like long - lost cuts from T Rex 's 1972 classic , The Slider .
It 's ultimately a period piece , but one of no little power and panache ."
2007-02-18,"Columbia Records released Iggy and the Stooges ' third album Raw Power in May 1973 , but now the band had been dropped by David Bowie 's management company , MainMan , the label made little pretence of commitment .
Vice - president Steve Harris still persevered , concluding that the only way to make New York radio stations take notice of the Stooges was to underwrite a series of shows that he termed ' Iggy at Max 's at Midnight ' .
At first band manager Jeff Wald was suspicious - ' You expect me to send Iggy to New York ? '
he roared . '
It 's junk city out there ! '
Once Harris assured him he would watch the singer 's every move , it was agreed the band would start a four - night residency on 30 July .
The Max 's dates were strung together with a few Midwest and Canadian shows to make a ramshackle tour .
New keyboard player Scott Thurston 's first meeting with the band came on the ride to a show at the Ice Arena on Lake St Clair , just north of Detroit ; that night he shared a stage for the first time with Iggy , who was dressed only in kneeboots and bikini briefs .
It was a baking hot day and the band had been eating watermelons backstage .
As the Stooges blasted out the opening chords of ' Raw Power ' , Iggy ran out on stage and hurled a watermelon into the crowd ; it hit a girl in the audience , who was apparently concussed , causing ructions with the promoter later .
A few songs in , Iggy felt an irresistible urge to empty his bowels and ran behind the Stooges ' Marshall stacks to take a dump ; Michael Tipton , a friend and fan whose tapes documented many of the band 's final shows , watched Iggy run back on stage and start throwing ' stuff ' at the crowd .
Once he 'd exhausted his ammunition , Iggy took a cup of ice and emptied it down his Soho briefs , then fished it out piece by piece , sucking it provocatively or throwing it at the audience .
Thurston was shell - shocked , transfixed by the power of the band in performance and appalled by the increasingly obvious hopelessness of their predicament once they left the stage .
He would hang with guitarist James Williamson , the one band member attempting to be positive . '
He was circling the wagons , like we were under attack in a Western .
The kind of Western where everyone gets a bullet , but maybe you can shoot somebody on your way out . '
But no one , not even James , could change the path down which the Stooges were heading . '
Nobody was in control .
It was complete anarchy . '
The opening night at Max 's Kansas City in New York was packed , with old friends like Lenny Kaye , Alice Cooper and rock writer Lisa Robinson in attendance , and a huge queue outside the club .
There were problems with the PA , which meant Iggy 's voice was swamped by the huge wall of sound generated by the rented guitar amplifiers , and James 's guitar was occasionally out of tune , but the band was magnificent .
Bob Czaykowski - Nite Bob - was hired for the Max 's shows to look after the amplifier backline ; his job was to get ' the clang ' : the ringing , physically brutal noise that would help beat the audience into submission .
In the confined space , the New York crowd was transfixed with both excitement and fear , for as Bebe Buell , the Ford Agency model and celebrated girlfriend of Todd Rundgren , points out , ' There was that element of danger , because everybody had heard about his antics on stage . '
The second night , the club was again jammed , and as Iggy walked over the tables and chairs , glaring at the crowd , one chair either wobbled , or was pulled from under him ; he slipped and fell onto a table top full of glasses , which shattered under his weight .
As Iggy got up again , Nite Bob saw cuts on his chest and chin , and a puncture wound by one of his ribs ; as Iggy staggered to the side and crashed into him , Bob noticed his own shirt was covered in blood and shouted , ' Let 's pull it .
Let 's stop it , man .
You ca n't do this ! '
Iggy kept singing , the blood dripping down his chest .
He discovered that if he pulled his left arm back , blood would spurt out in a continuous stream . '
It was horrible , like a Roman arena , ' says Wayne County , Max 's DJ who later became an unlikely punk star .
Nite Bob recalls , ' We had this saying that a piece of Gaffa tape will fix anything , but he was bleeding so bad the tape would n't even stick . '
The singer 's injuries meant that the next two Max 's shows were postponed , but rather than recuperate , he wandered off to see the New York Dolls at Madison Square Garden 's Felt Forum the next evening .
The Dolls were fast emerging as claimants to the Stooges ' status as pre - eminent icons of decadence , and that evening Iggy looked a forlorn figure ; he collided with a glass door , cutting his head , and New York 's glitterati were literally stepping over him , laughing at his condition .
Fortunately , Bebe Buell had persuaded Rundgren along to see the Dolls and she saw the stricken hero leaning against a wall .
She kneeled down to minister to him , tenderly wiping off the blood with a towel , while Todd was plainly irritated .
His concern was justified , for by now Buell had concluded that Iggy was ' totally fucking gorgeous .
Built like an Adonis .
Plus , he had these big blue eyes which were like saucers .
He was a walking sex machine .
Maybe a fucked - up one , drooling and falling down , but any girl would wonder , "" Hmmm what 's he like after a shower and a good night 's sleep ? "" ' Rundgren finally tugged Buell away from the scene , but in their brief conversation Bebe had mentioned where she and Todd lived , confident that in his confused state Iggy could n't possibly remember .
The next day , moments after Todd stepped out of their Greenwich Village apartment to replenish his sock supply for a trip to San Diego
, Bebe heard a knock at the front door and there , bouncing with vitality , was Jim Osterberg , Iggy 's alter - ego . '
You said 51 Horatio , right ? '
He explained , with almost excessive politeness , how he had no money and needed a place to stay .
The returning Rundgren was rightfully suspicious , but it was too late to cancel his trip .
Unable to do more , he issued a stern order to Bebe : ' Do not , under any circumstances , leave him in the place by himself .
He 'll steal everything we 've got to buy drugs .
And whatever you do , lock up the third floor , and do n't let him anywhere near it . '
For their first couple of days together
Bebe and Jim simply talked and talked , as he acted cute in his puppy dog way , treating her as if she were some pure - blooded Scandinavian princess .
Then the inevitable happened and Bebe embarked on what would be her first affair since she 'd moved in with Todd : ' When we finally made love it was , I do n't want to sound like a sap , but it was incredibly beautiful , storybook .
Then we were like , "" Oh my God !
All we did was shag , seven times a day , everywhere , anywhere . "" '
In the mornings Bebe would sit on the huge round waterbed with him , admiring his ballet dancer 's body - ' breathtaking , like a work of art ' - while he would improvise songs , serenading her with smoochy lyrics in his best Frank Sinatra baritone .
Over those waking hours , Jim Osterberg was the most considerate house - guest - cooking omelettes , vacuuming , keeping the place tidy , attending to Bebe 's two dogs - although as time went on , Bebe noticed that sometimes after Jim disappeared in the afternoons for an unspecified rendezvous , Iggy would return in his place .
And Iggy could be ' creepy and mean and nasty ' .
It seemed to Buell that Jim could switch on his Iggy persona easily enough , but he could n't always switch him off .
One morning she rose early for a modelling assignment , leaving Jim asleep , alone in the house .
On her return that afternoon she looked around , but Iggy had obviously left for one of his assignations .
Seizing the opportunity , Bebe walked up to the second - floor bedroom , sprawled out over the big round water - bed and within moments was fast asleep .
Not long afterwards , she was woken by the insistent splashing of water dripping on to the bed , and realised that water was seeping through the ceiling .
Running up the stairs to the forbidden third floor , she entered the bathroom to see Jim fast asleep in the tub , his head resting gently on an inflatable pillow , his toes blocking the overflow , with Bebe 's two dogs cradled one on each shoulder , both of them out cold .
Bebe pulled Jim 's toes away from the overflow , then noticed a neat little row of blue pills lined up on the toilet cistern .
She shook him awake . '
Jim , what have you done ? ' '
Nothing , ' he replied , dreamily , ' just a little Valium , relax ! ' '
So what 's wrong with Puppet and Furburger ? '
' I just gave them a little Valium ... ' Incandescent with rage and fear for her dogs
, Bebe slapped Iggy hard , before gathering Puppet under one arm , Furburger under the other , and running out of the house .
It was a two - minute sprint to St Vincent 's hospital , up the ramp and into the emergency room . '
Help !
Help !
My dogs have OD'd ! ' '
Miss , we do n't treat dogs here .
This is the emergency room .
This is for people ...
What did they take ? ' '
Two and a half milligrams each of Valium . ' '
Do n't worry , they wo n't die , ' the helpful ER medic assured her . '
Take them home , and they 'll wake up . '
Back on Horatio Street , an angry Bebe berated Jim , telling him he could have killed her precious dogs . '
I 'm a dog lover ! '
he replied , soothingly . '
I know a lot about animals . '
Within a day or so , Jim had left for a string of Stooges shows in Canada and Arizona ; the two kept in regular touch , planning a rendezvous before the gig at the Kennedy Centre in Washington DC on 19 August .
Unfortunately , Bebe arrived with Alice Cooper 's girlfriend , Cindy Lang , and another friend of Cindy 's .
When the friend walked into the dressing room , Iggy snarled , ' What the fuck are you doing here ? ' at her .
She doled out a huge line of what looked like cocaine to placate the irate singer , who hoovered it up , not realising it was THC .
He collapsed within seconds , occasionally burbling semi - consciously in response to who - knows - what visions as the powerful synthetic hallucinogen took effect .
Bebe and road manager Chris Ehring slapped his face and attempted to walk him around the dressing room or get him to drink some liquid .
Eventually , Jim told them he was capable of singing , and the band rushed out on to the stage and started hammering out ' Raw Power ' , playing the opening riff again .
And again and again ; Thurston believes they repeated the opening chords for a full 15 minutes before Ehring carried Iggy on stage and dumped him there .
Eventually Iggy managed to sing , mumbling the words at half speed , then walked out into the audience before attempting to climb back onto the stage .
His band laughed at his pathetic efforts until Thurston walked over to help him up - and then recoiled in horror : ' I saw his chest , it looked like he 'd cut himself up really bad , there were bits of flesh hanging on him , it was ugly to see . '
Disgusted , Thurston turned back to his piano as Ehring rushed over to investigate .
A few minutes later , Thurston saw Ehring laughing as he discovered the gaping wound was in fact a peanut butter and jelly sandwich someone had crushed onto Iggy 's chest .
The incident became yet another surreal episode in the Stooges ' increasingly doomed drama .
It contributed to a reputation for excess that meant they 'd soon be thrown off tours for such minor incidents as eating a cake meant for the J Geils band .
For all the chaos - much of which was n't totally Iggy 's fault - the Stooges still had a hard - working , Midwestern ethos , but , little by little , the number of venues willing to book them was dwindling .
The band returned to their Detroit home turf for two shows at the Michigan Palace , starting on 5 October .
There was something about the venue 's atmosphere that the band disliked , but the once lavish , now decrepit theatre was packed , and that night they received a raucous reception , with the audience invading the stage .
At some point , Iggy invited the crowd back to the band 's hotel , the Detroit Hilton , for what might well have been the band 's most gloriously depraved night in the city .
Michael Tipton and Natalie Schlossman , two of the band 's closest friends , were staying at the Hilton but , like most of the hotel guests , got little sleep that night .
At one point Michael Tipton was chatting with Scottie Thurston in his room when James Williamson knocked on his door , walked in with two friends , one male , one female , explained that his own room was packed with people , asked if he could use Tipton 's bathroom , and the three of them disappeared inside .
Twenty minutes later , Natalie Schlossman arrived in search of James , and knocked on the bathroom door ; after a pause , James and friends emerged , apologising to Tipton for the mess .
Tipton looked in the bathroom and saw the walls were splattered with blood .
When Natalie and Michael called at Iggy 's room later that morning , they saw around 20 people in various sexual combinations once he opened the door .
Politely , he told the pair : ' Sorry , I 've changed my mind about breakfast .
I think I 'm going to crash . '
That night 's show was triumphant ; one Detroit fan , photographer Robert Matheu , remembers : ' We all loved "" Cock in My Pocket "" , it became quite a local anthem for a while . '
A few days later , the band settled into a residency at a small club in Atlanta , Georgia , for what James Williamson regarded as a string of their best performances .
Several of the band 's fans , including Ben Edmonds of Creem magazine , conspired to raise their morale with an endorsement by Elton John .
Elton was sweeping across the US on a hugely successful stadium tour and he decided to signal his support for the band , plus his own general zaniness , by renting a gorilla suit and planning a one - ape stage invasion during the Stooges stint .
Creem had prepared a photographer for the stunt .
Unfortunately , no one had prepared Iggy .
Indeed the previous night he had disappeared with the usual local ' Rich Bitch ' , to use the Stooges ' term of endearment .
Early in the morning she brought him back to the band 's hotel unconscious ; he had gobbled down her entire supply of Quaaludes .
Drummer Scott Asheton and a friend of the band , Doug Currie , were called to lift his dead weight out of her Corvette ; carrying him into the hotel , they dropped him and were overcome with a giggling fit , seeing him peacefully sleeping , sprawled over a spiky Mediterranean bush .
He was still hardly conscious that evening when Doug and Scotty carried him into the club , and after a quick discussion of what to do , Doug announced he had some speed .
James Williamson managed to find a syringe , and they duly shot their singer full of methamphetamine sulphate in order to get him on his feet .
For a couple of seconds , as Elton emerged from the wings in his gorilla suit , Iggy thought he was hallucinating , or else a real gorilla was raiding the stage .
The Creem photograph documenting the event is hilarious , showing James Williamson transfixing the uppity ape with a malevolent glare that signals , he says , his intent to ' take him out .
He lucked out , because he was smart enough to take his head off to let people know who he was , just in time . '
The encounter failed to lift the Stooges ' spirits .
Soon the band were becoming more obviously frazzled and many of them seem to have clung to pathetically poignant lucky mementoes .
Iggy had a pet cuddly rabbit .
Drummer Scott had a lucky towel , which he would wrap round his head in times of stress .
Guitarist Ron Asheton had a treasured pillow which his mum had embroidered - if any of his fellow band members hid it , he had a panic attack .
By the end of the year bookings had started to fizzle out , and the dark mood was intensified by the news of the death of Zeke Zettner , the Stooges roadie - turned bassist , who died from a heroin overdose on 10 November .
Ron Asheton describes those last months as ' never - ending torture ' .
Jim Osterberg today displays very little emotion about his physical and mental travails .
But by January 1974 , this ambitious , driven man was regarded by everyone , even his closest bandmates , as a failure and a liability .
And whatever drugs he was taking , says Michael Tipton , Jim knew exactly what was going on , and was suffering greater mental torture than any of his bandmates could comprehend . '
Everybody thinks he 's not 100 per cent - but even when he 's high , the little man thinks a lot .
He knew . '
Over the following weeks , the Stooges continued zig - zagging across North America , from Wisconsin to Toronto to Long Island .
On Monday 4 February 1974 , the band was booked into a tiny club on the far West Side of Detroit , on the way to Ypsilanti .
The Rock and Roll Farm , in Wayne , Michigan , was a tiny bar , with a capacity of 120 or so , that normally hosted blues or rock'n'roll revival acts .
The road crew started complaining the moment they realised how difficult it would be to cram the Stooges ' amplifiers onto the tiny stage .
Bob Baker , a Stooges fan , had arrived early and started feeling uneasy when he saw how many bikers were filling the bar .
There were several dozen scattered around the audience , with a huddle of six or seven at the edge of the dance floor ; heavy - set bearded guys , aged around 30 , most of them in dark denim jackets , several of which were decorated with the colours of the Scorpions , a West Side Detroit biker gang .
Even as the Stooges launched into their set - now augmented with more new songs , including another poignant doomed anthem , '
I Got Nothing ' - there were scuffles at the back of the venue .
At some point , the bikers produced a carton of eggs and started throwing them at the stage .
What happened next would be heavily mythologised by the Stooges .
As Bob Baker watched from a couple of feet away , the flurry of violence seemed more hurried , nastier and brutish . '
Iggy came into the audience , went right up to one of the bikers .
This guy was big and heavy .
And the biker just nailed him right in the face and he went flying backwards through the crowd .
It 's just a law of physics if you weigh 300 pounds and you punch somebody , that punch carries a lot more wallop than a 100-pound guy punching you .
So when he hit Iggy he just flew backwards through the room , like something in a movie .
And then they all just laughed . ' '
I 've heard how the biker was supposed to be wearing studded gloves or a knuckle - duster , ' says Skip Gildersleeve , another Stooges fan who saw his favourite singer being punched out . '
He did n't .
He did n't need one . '
As Iggy staggered back onto the stage , he shouted , ' That 's it , we 're gone , ' and the band scrambled out of the venue .
Speaking today about the scary confrontation , Jim sounds philosophical , as if conscious of the inevitability that one day his confrontation of the audience would invite revenge .
But to his fellow Stooges , who had come to believe in his invincibility , the shock seems more profound . '
It did change everything , ' says James Williamson . '
The invincibility of the band was shattered .
Think about all the gigs we played and Iggy always did this crowd interaction thing .
Then somebody just knocked him down . '
The Wayne show was on a Monday .
It had been a mere stopgap to earn a little money before the Stooges played a much bigger show at the Michigan Palace , a decaying 1920s movie theatre on the Saturday , 9 February .
Phone lines around Detroit burned red - hot with conflicting rumours : predictions of Iggy 's suicide , boasts that the Stooges would enlist another biker gang 's assistance , speculation that the Stooges would n't show .
In reality , every member of the band and crew desperately needed the $ 5,000 plus share of the gate they were being paid for the performance .
What would later look like heroism was , in fact , more like simple destitution .
The band was upset , scared and simply fed up ; but that did n't stop them from appearing on Detroit 's WABX radio station and challenging the Scorpions to show up at the venue .
There was defiance as the Stooges took the stage , following a support band named Aerosmith .
Nothing would change about their act ; James still wore his slightly camp Star Trek costume , but by now it was dirty and a little threadbare .
Jim wore his leotard and ballet shoes , with a shawl wrapped round his waist .
The evening was dank and depressing , with the sidewalks of Grand River Avenue coated in dirty slush , but still the hall , of around 1,200 capacity , was full , ensuring the Stooges would at least command a substantial fee .
No Scorpions seemed to have turned up ; so for their final show , the band would n't even have the dignity of meeting a formal enemy who 'd set out to destroy them .
Instead , those who came to mock did so purely to indulge Detroit 's traditional ' fuck you ' attitude . '
It was nuts , ' says Skip Gildersleeve .
' There were people that you thought lived out in the woods and only came out once in a while .
It was like Charles Manson 's followers . '
Michael Tipton was taping the evening and was convinced that Iggy knew it was all over . '
That 's why he had fun with it , antagonising the crowd . '
Over the last few months , if a record company executive was in the audience , Iggy could be guaranteed to fuck up .
Now , with maybe half the audience baying for his blood , he revelled in the moment as he prowled the stage in his ludicrous costume , soaking up the hate .
The sound was often ragged , the singing just a shout , much of the music simplistic aural thuggery , but the real performance was in Iggy 's incessant insulting of the audience .
The banter was drawn out , and any odd projectile - a coin , ice cubes , an egg - launched in his direction served only to prolong his speeches .
Watching Iggy confront this hail without flinching , a few audience members thought this meant the band would survive .
Others , like Bob Baker , who 'd also seen the violence at the Wayne show , were convinced it was over . '
I was extremely depressed .
You got the feeling that it was his farewell concert , although you did n't know for sure .
It was such a hostile environment , people were obviously trying to mess with his head ...
I thought , This guy 's not going to live to be very old . ' '
I thought they 'd given up , ' says Skip Gildersleeve . '
It was the end of something really good . ' '
Part of you was sad , ' remembers Scott Thurston , ' and guilty that you 've seen something that probably was worthy of some respect [ being ] degraded .
Otherwise you were just worried about getting hit with a bottle . '
After leaving the stage briefly , the Stooges returned for their last number , ' Louie Louie ' - the song 's message was that anything more sophisticated would be lost on such a deadbeat audience .
Iggy improvised new , obscene lyrics to this garage band staple that he 'd sung once with his first band , the Iguanas .
And as the song reached its conclusion , more missiles showered onto the stage , one of them a large Stroh 's bottle that shattered on Scottie 's piano . '
You nearly killed me , but you missed again , ' sneered Iggy , ' so you 'd better keep trying next week . '
But there was no next week .
Â· This is an edited extract from Iggy Pop : Open Up and Bleed , published by Sphere at Â£ 18.99 b&gt;Older and wierder : The Stooges return Next month , the Stooges release The Weirdness , their first album in the 34 years since the disintegration in Michigan .
Over the intervening period , Iggy has maintained that no one nails the sound of those old songs quite like the Asheton brothers , Ron and Scott , so when they were lured back together for some live shows in 2004 , it seemed to be a chance for fans to catch up with , and probably bid farewell to , the nastiest band of them all .
But the gigs worked on more than a nostalgic level - they have now played 74 shows in the past three years - and Ron got in touch with producer Steve Albini early in 2006 to make tentative plans for a new album .
But can it sustain the intensity that marked the band 's classic album Fun House ? '
We have a civilised aspect to us now , ' Iggy told Billboard . '
A lot of my life is lived as an elderly gentleman of means .
And that suits me just fine .
But then there 's the other part ... '"
2007-03-02,"An Oxford education gave Ben Hudson the confidence to think big : the English lit graduate wanted his first album to sound like nothing less than "" Dr Dre producing David Bowie "" .
So saying , he deftly slots together his own effete singing voice and cracked hip - hop beats , and invents the next best thing .
The result is fresh and vivid .
Over the course of 10 originals and a couple of covers ( including a gorgeous version of On the Street Where You Live ) , Mr H makes the point that brash beats and received pronunciation need n't be mutually exclusive .
Though limited to a single register , he sings like a languid angel - apt , given the lovelorn tilt of his lyrics - and then scuffs things up by ladling on crunchy percussion , electronic dribbles and deceptively jaunty steel drums .
This album is proof that terrific English dance music does n't always come from the streets - or for that matter , the Streets ."
2007-03-02,"Jarvis Cocker , national treasure and former Pulp frontman , is to curate the Meltdown festival at the South Bank Centre in London this June .
The week - long event , previously directed by artists as diverse as David Bowie and Louis Andriessen , will feature concerts , performances and visual art chosen by Cocker .
Although it was too early to reveal details yesterday , he hinted at an eclectic range of offerings .
"" I think the main thing is to mix things up ; things that maybe should n't go together , "" he said .
"" I 'm hoping to get a weird mix of contemporary things and revivals of old stuff ; and as much as possible that involves audience participation to a degree .
I 'm hoping to get some film stuff together .
There will high culture there , and low culture ; some very low . ""
Last year Cocker released a highly regarded solo album and a compilation which included everything from Carl Orff to the Beach Boys .
His interests include outsider art , minimalism , and social realism .
He has also written music for Nancy Sinatra and Charlotte Gainsbourg , and last night duetted with Beth Ditto , lead singer of The Gossip , at the NME awards .
He comes from Sheffield but now lives in France .
He regarded the Meltdown opportunity as "" a bit like being asked to do Desert Island Discs : I jumped at the chance "" .
Of the sometimes derided South Bank Centre , he said : "" I 've always liked the look of the place ; concrete is very under - rated as a building material .
I love the idea of going back to the Festival of Britain and all that . ""
Cocker gained nationwide notoriety - and a good deal of praise - when he invaded the stage to protest at Michael Jackson 's performance of Earth Song at the Brit awards ceremony in 1996 .
Glenn Max , producer of contemporary culture at the South Bank Centre , said : "" Jarvis seemed such an obvious choice .
He has the right temperament ; he pays the right kind of attention to the world , and has championed many different things .
He has the right sense of humour , playfulness , and mischief . ""

Life on Mars , which took its name from a David Bowie song , became one of BBC1 's biggest new drama hits of recent years , with its two series regularly pulling in six million viewers .
The drama , made by independent production company Kudos , the firm behind fellow BBC1 dramas Spooks and Hustle , followed the fate of modern day detective Sam Tyler , played by John Simm , who was knocked unconscious in a road accident only to wake up in 1973 .
Teaming up with the unreconstructed DCI Hunt , played by Philip Glenister , he continually tried to answer the question : "" Am I mad , in a coma or back in time ? ""
- a conundrum he , and viewers , finally got an answer to in last night 's finale .
The new eight - part sequel , Ashes to Ashes - named after another Bowie song - will be set in 1981 , and will catch up with DCI Hunt as he deals with the start of a new decade , and a move from Manchester to London .
Simm wo n't return , but another police officer will be transported back in time .
The fact that the officer is a woman - and a single mother - is likely to annoy DCI Hunt even more .

According to the series ' producers , friction builds up between her and DCI Hunt , which is "" more than just a professional tension "" .
The action will also transfer from Manchester to London , while the 70s music and cultural references that added to Life on Mars ' success will be replaced with a soundtrack of Adam Ant , Roxy Music and the Human League , along with two tone and new romantic fashions .
Ashes to Ashes , which begins filming in London this summer , will air next year .
The show 's co - creator , Matthew Graham , said Ashes to Ashes would carry on from Life on Mars and put an emphasis on a "" revelation "" about DCI Hunt .
"" If we can get a couple of series of Ashes to Ashes under our belt , we can unravel a really big mystery about Gene Hunt that was n't relevant to Life on Mars , "" he added .
Graham said it had been decided to end Life on Mars after just two series in order to stop it becoming like US drama Lost , which was "" beginning to outstay its welcome "" .
"" We did n't want to be like Lost where you have to come up with increasingly bizarre storylines , "" he added .
Mr Graham put the success of the show down to nostalgia for the past but mainly for the characterisation of DCI Hunt and Simm 's Sam Tyler .
"" People just love spending time with them , "" he said .
The Life on Mars franchise has also proved lucrative for the BBC , with sales of the series to a number of countries including the US , where the original show airs on BBC America , while broadcaster ABC is developing its own version .

2007-04-13,"Thirty years have passed since Bernard Pomerance 's dramatic portrait of Victorian "" freak of nature "" John Merrick debuted on the London stage .
David Bowie famously played the part on Broadway in 1980 ; in the same year , John Hurt endured countless hours in makeup and delivered a heartbreaking performance in David Lynch 's spellbinding film .
Bruce Guthrie 's revival , seen last month at the New Wimbledon Studio and now running at the Trafalgar Studios , has failed to convince critics .
First , the good news : Marc Pickering 's Merrick has been almost universally praised .
The Guardian 's Lyn Gardner applauded his "" powerful , dignified performance "" and The Stage 's Mark Shenton was also impressed by the actor 's "" selflessness and dignity "" in the role .
Sam Marlowe at The Times thought Pickering "" riveting "" and was impressed by his combination of "" childlike innocence and emotional fragility with an entirely adult intellectual sophistication "" .
However , the Evening Standard 's Kieron Quirke was distinctly nonplussed : "" he imbues his mangled speech with none of the soul we hear so much about , slipping into a monotonous melancholy from which the play takes its pace . ""
Ah yes , the play itself .
Here comes the bad news : Lyn Gardner feels that the years have n't been kind to Pomerance , and that his drama is "" now looking creaky and old - fashioned "" .
The Times bemoaned Natalie Powell 's clumsy design ; the Evening Standard diagnosed the flaw as over - ambition .
Time Out 's Robert Shore deemed the production "" efficient if slightly underwhelming "" ; Kieron Quirke was less kind , dishing out some damning elephant - inspired dismissals : "" A jumbo failure ...
Stampede to avoid it . ""
Critics also managed to find some surprising points of comparison for the play .
Sam Marlowe likened its study of the doctor - patient relationship , and the tensions between art and science , to Equus ; Mark Shenton pitched the production as My Fair Lady - meets - Phantom of the Opera ; and Robert Shore , after detecting a whiff of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , even managed to find shades of Austin Powers ' Dr Evil in Pickering 's performance ."
2007-05-05,"' It 's about time silver trousers came back again , ' muses Mick Rock , the British photographer who qualifies as a ' rock legend ' .
In London last week to promote a fresh collection of his most famous pictures , Rock is benefiting from a revival of interest in glam rock .
Often referred to as ' the man who shot the Seventies ' , Rock was David Bowie 's official photographer and took most of the famed images of the star , including shots of him making up and on stage in Ziggy Stardust guise .
But then , almost any of the well - known images of Lou Reed , Bryan Ferry , Mick Jagger , Iggy Pop , Alice Cooper and Freddie Mercury were taken by Rock .
He shot the cover for Reed 's album Transformer , for instance . '
People sometimes say to me it was lucky I could be there to take these pictures , ' Rock said . '
And I say it was just a bloody good job that someone was there , because nobody else was taking anything . '
Rock , who grew up in London , studied modern languages at Cambridge , and has lived in New York for years , has the gravelly voice of a survivor of the rock era - a mid - Atlantic mix of Cockney , educated southern English and laid - back American . '
I turned into a cliche , ' he admits . '
How did that happen ? '
Now he works with fashionable acts such as Scissor Sisters , The Klaxons and Kassabian , but he started taking pictures when he met the late Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd in 1966 .

2007-05-19,"How many bands can you name who have been cited as an influence by heavyweights including U2 , David Bowie and the Chemical Brothers ?
Only one .
That would be Swiss outfit the Young Gods .
When they first emerged in the late Eighties there was no band like them : a power trio who played heavy rock without using guitars .
Their music was built around a sampler ( still a novelty back then ) , a live drummer and group founder Franz Treichler , a frontman with a voice like gravel and penchant for penning cod - mystical lyrics .
They graced the covers of UK music weeklies and were feted as ' the first 21st - century rock band ' .
In truth , they sounded futuristic and primitive at the same time , deconstructing rock down to its constituent parts then building it back up again using discrete elements ; distended riffs and loops lifted from classical music and classic rock were reconstituted into a carnivalesque industrial sound all their own .
Later albums incorporated elements of techno , ambient and musique concrete Possibly because so much music today seems stuck in a run - out groove endlessly re - treading the same tired formulas , on this , their ninth album , the Young Gods stick to their template and still manage to sound ahead of the game .
Much like the Prodigy , who should probably be collared for grand larceny of their sound , the Young Gods have an innate understanding of dynamics : when to crank it up and when to pare it down through degrees of speed and volume .
It 's staggeringly simple but brutally effective .
Super Ready / FragmentÃ© delivers on all 12 cylinders , from the rush of ' I 'm the Drug ' , which kicks off with clipped power chords pitched up and down on an adrenal scale , through to the epic - poetic title track .

2007-07-12,"There are four kinds of pop stars : the ones that work hard at remaining cool and stylish and vaguely hip long after their careers have plateaued ( David Bowie , James Brown , John Lennon , Cher ) ; the ones that gracefully enter middle age and assume the role of living legend / elder statesman ( Neil Young , Aretha Franklin , Bob Dylan ) ; the ones who never understand that it is time to get off the stage ( Paul McCartney , Rod Stewart ) ; and the ones who simply lose their grip and drift off into the void ( Elvis Presley , Michael Jackson ) .
Members of the latter group often become so strange , so pathetic , so self - destructive that it is hard for people who come after them to believe that they were once colossi who ruled the world .
But Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson were indeed colossi , and they did once rule the world .
For around seven years , Michael Jackson was the most luminous , powerful , influential star in the music business , and no one else was even close .
During that period , before his bizarre antics and legal problems turned the public against him , Jackson enjoyed the kind of international fame experienced only by the likes of Muhammad Ali , Greta Garbo and Lord Byron .
He was so famous that if you cut his fame in half he would still have been eight times as famous as the next most famous person , whoever that may have been .
It may have been Tom Cruise .
All this began with the 1983 hit single Billie Jean .
Though it may not sound like it today , Billie Jean is one of the most revolutionary songs in the history of popular music .
This is not , however , because its lyrics tell the story of a well - meaning paranoid being stalked by a woman who claims that he has impregnated her , although that in itself was certainly an unusual theme for a pop song at the time .
No , Billie Jean was groundbreaking because it introduced the idea that a single must be accompanied by a high - production video - preferably by someone who is a bit of a hoofer - thereby transforming a run - of - the - mill song release into an "" event "" .
Billie Jean transformed MTV from a mere diversion for young people into a cultural institution that society at large paid attention to .
It introduced the pasty - faced number - crunchers who ran MTV to the concept that white viewers would respond enthusiastically to videos featuring a black performer , something they had not previously believed .
Back in those days , a lot of people in the entertainment business were still racists .
Thank goodness that 's over .
Billie Jean 's greatest importance is that it launched the Michael Jackson era , a period in which the entire population of the planet made a group decision to follow the career of one star and one star only .
This was an era in which a fabulously gifted performer like Prince was forced into a distant second - fiddle role , because even though Prince could dance , he could n't dance like Michael Jackson .
Jackson 's all - encompassing appeal was something that had never happened before in the history of pop music : Frank Sinatra , Elvis Presley and the Beatles were preposterously famous in their time , but their appeal was still basically limited to white people .
Michael Jackson , during his Thriller LP era , had everybody talking about him .
Cute and cuddly as front man / child for the Jackson Five , Jackson had been trying for several years to reintroduce himself to a public that was ill prepared to view him as anything other than a charming has - been .
To shatter this perception , Jackson created the flashy , enigmatic , vaguely dangerous persona who appeared in Billie Jean , Beat It and Bad .
At a time when most music videos were either primitive or stupid , Jackson made a video that was clever , original , visually opulent and mysterious .
This was the first time that a song had been upstaged by the performance of a song , creating a peculiar situation where no one really had any interest in hearing the song unless they could simultaneously watch the song being performed .
Other bands - ZZ Top , the Police , Cyndie Lauper , the Bangles - were putting out amusing , entertaining videos at the time , but no one was watching them because of Sting 's dancing .
Michael Jackson 's footwork was the central conversational theme of Planet Earth throughout the 1980 's .
Not until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 did mankind move on to another topic .
Billie Jean , which has nothing to do with the tennis legend Billie Jean King , was recorded on a specially designed set to capture the muted sound of the snare drum that Jackson insisted upon .
It was produced by the legendary Quincy Jones , who wanted Jackson to change the name of the song and also to shorten the improbably lengthy 29-second introduction , during which Jackson does not actually sing .
More thought went into the production of this single than would go into the entire recording careers of Axl Rose , Coldplay , Shania Twain or Gwen Stefani .
The song stayed at the top of the charts for more than two months and propelled the album Thriller to its iconic status as the biggest - selling record of all time .
Because no one buys albums anymore , and because high - concept music videos are a thing of the past , and because low - key , hybrid songs like Billie Jean sound anachronistic in the coarse hip - hop era , Michael Jackson 's achievements now seem as remote and inexplicable as those of the pharaohs .
But , if you 're in the myth - making line of trade , the pharaohs are good company to be in ."
2007-07-28,"From Iggy 's ' crowd walk ' in Cincinatti , to Joy Division playing an Altrincham pub , to David Bowie having a karate lesson , YouTube is full of great glimpses of pop history - fragmented , often grainy , utterly captivating .
In the last year , I have received regular emails from friends alerting me to the presence of yet another extraordinary music clip : Neil Young busking , Gram Parsons and the Burritos out in the desert for the ' Gilded Palace of Sin ' photo shoot , even the elusive - to - the - point of legendary Greenwich village folkie , Karen Dalton , singing her stark songs of love and loss .
It 's these often extraordinary clips that prompted my piece in the Observer Review this week .
Where does this stuff come from ?
Who posts it on YouTube ?
Why have we not seen it before now ?
Mostly , it comes from the vaults of long - lost television shows , the archives of record labels .
Some of it is posted on YouTube by fans who secretly filmed gigs long before mobile phones with cameras were invented , or by insiders who filmed bands in rehearsals and during live shows , and sometimes by ordinary people who filmed their favourite pop group by pointing a camera at the television .
It is appearing now because the internet , and YouTube in particular , is the perfect medium not just for inspired amateurs who want to parade their otherness , but for the kind of pop cultural excavation that would have been prohibited - or punished - by the major record labels in the days before the coming of the world wide web .
These clips are an antidote to the vast oceans of trivia and idiocy that appears on the web these days .
This is my current Top ten , though it changes all the time ( an early Johnny Cash and Joni Mitchell duet has just appeared recently ) .
Feel free to add your favourites .
1 .
Chuck Berry introduces the Ronettes on his Sixties tv show .
The godfather of rock'n'roll , three foxy chicks , one epic song ( ' Be My Baby ' ) .
And , some of the best frugging you 'll ever see .
2 .
The Cake : ' You Can Have Him ' 1967 .
The grooviest chicks on YouTube .
The Cake were a truly fab sixties ' three - piece girl group , comprising Chelsea , Barbara and Jeanette .
They looked like they had an expense account at Biba , and sang like angels .
The late Jeanette Jacobs Woods is the one who stands stock still throughout this teared - stained melodrama of a song .
What a gal !
3 .
A very stoned Bob Dylan shares a taxi with John Lennon 1966 .
An out - take from DA Pennebaker 's legendary and little - seen Dylan documentary , Eat the Document .
A strung - out Bob barely holds it together as John looks on bemused .
Dylan : ' I wish I could speak English , man ' .
Lennon : ' Me too , Bob . '
At one point , Dylan seems about to throw up . '
Come , come , boy , ' chides Lennon , ' pull yourself together ! '
4 .
The Grateful Dead play the Playboy Mansion , 1969 .
Surreal moment when the Dead and their entourage pitch up at Hugh Hefner 's house and regale the bow - tied guests and Bunny Girls with a rousing ' St. Stephen ' .
Later , a cigar - totin ' Hef interviews a very stoned Jerry Garcia .
Very odd indeed .
5 .
The Flying Burrito Brothers : ' Christine 's Tune ' 1969 .
Ultra - rare footage of the late Gram Parsons , country - rock pioneer and legendary dissolute .
A live performance of ' Christine 's Tune ' interspersed with footage of the group hanging out in the desert with the girls from the cover of The Gilded Palace of Sin album .
He 's wearing that famous marijuana leaf - embossed Nudie suit .
6 .
Iggy and the Stooges : Live in Cincinnati , 1970 .
The famous show where Iggy walks on the audience 's hands .
The Stooges grind out ' TV Eye ' , while Iggy disappears into a sea of bodies for ages , then reappears holding a large jar of peanut butter , which he proceeds to smear on his torso .
It feautures a blow - by blow , sports ' style commentary by a very straight and utterly bemused tv presenter . '
That 's peanut butter ? ! '
7 .
Neil Young busking in Glasgow , 1976 .
Neil takes time off from his touring schedule to go walkabout in Glasgow .
Ask directions of a businessman to the Bank of Scotland , then entertains bemused passers - by with his trusty banjo and a stark version of ' The Old Laughing Lady ' .
Grainy but engrossing .
8 .
Joy Division : a pub in Altrincham , 1979 .
Malcolm Whitehead 's dark and evocative Super 8 film of an early Joy Division gig captures Ian Curtis at his most mesmerising . '
She 's Lost Control ' and ' Shadowplay ' in their entirety , plus Barney 's floppy fringe and Curtis dancing like a marionette on speed .
Mesmerising .
9 .
David Bowie is given a karate lesson on the Dinah Shore show , 1975 .
One of those surreal clips that make YouTube unique .
Bowie in his cooler - than - thou ' Thin White Duke ' phase somehow ends up having a karate lesson on American TV .
A black dude in full karate outfit throws shapes and asks Bowie what he 'd do if ' I was coming at you to choke you ' .
Bowie says , ' I 'd scream very loudly . '
Priceless .
10 .
Nirvana rehearse in a garage in Aberdeen , Washington , 1988 .
An early Dave Grohl - less Nirvana let rip in the garage of Krist Novoselic 's mum 's house . '
Love Buzz ' , ' Scoff ' and ' About A Girl ' all get a right good kicking .
Kurt sings into the wall .
The grassroots of grunge ."

When it comes to media hype and bluster regarding the merits of one musician or band against another - Blur vs Oasis , Kanye vs 50 - I often prefer to watch the circus unfold from afar .
However , a response from jasonaparkes to my last blog really did get me thinking about an issue that has been bandied about in the music press for months .
He claimed that Damon Albarn has attempted to "" do that thing Bowie does - ripping off someone until it sounds like himself "" .
True enough , what was "" unique "" about Bowie was the combination of influences he had : What was Ziggy Stardust
if not a composite of ( among others )
Anthony Newley , Lou Reed and Andy Warhol , with a generous theatrical makeover inspired by Noh and Kabuki theatre ?
The only thing that was Bowie in Ziggy was the combination itself .
Albarn has also been known to make his influences obvious .
The 60s rock canon ( the Beatles , the Kinks , the Who ) but chiefly Syd Barrett 's influence was highly evident as the verse of Villa Rosie and the whole of Miss America ( from Modern Life
Is Rubbish ) are transparent rip - offs of the verse of Apples and Oranges ( done with Floyd ) and Terrapin ( solo ) respectively .
Then there 's Blur 's MOR from their self - titled album , the songwriting credits for which were shared equally between and band and ( oh , yes )
Bowie and Eno for "" borrowing "" from Boys Keep Swinging .
Then with Blur 's self - titled album , Gorillaz and The Good , the Bad and the Queen came the influence of more varied sources such as Pavement , Beck and world music .
Whereas the ever - changing Bowie wrote a concept album inspired by Nineteen Eighty - Four and experimented with electronica , soul and jungle , Albarn is head of the constantly reinvented Blur , the brilliantly entertaining Gorillaz and has formed The Good , The Bad and The Queen .
And been in an East End gangster flick ( but let 's forget that minor detail ) .
So , at the risk of incurring more opprobrium than usual , I put the question to you :
Is Damon Albarn the new David Bowie ?"
2007-08-30,"Who dunnit : Rumours scotched .
Photograph : Martin Rickett / PA Not much to do with technology , this one , but you might be interested in it anyway .
This morning 's Sun claimed that David Bowie - the original star man - was being lined up for a cameo appearance in Doctor
Who .
I nearly wet myself .
Unfortunately , it all looks like a bit of space oddity , as a statement on David Bowie dot com says there is no foundation in what we commonly call "" truth "" .
David Bowie is not planning to star in Dr
Who and the whole story is "" absolute tish and tosh "" .
Whatever the intention behind The Sun 's story , it certainly would n't be the first time that Dr Who producers have approached Bowie to appear in the show .
If memory serves , he spurned their advances in the eighties too .
I mean , personally I 'm very sceptical about the fact that Catherine Tate , will take over as the Doctor 's companion in the next series ( I thought Freema Agyeman was awesome ) and the forthcoming appearance by Kylie Minogue has n't got me salivating .
But Bowie ?
He would have been out of this world -
I mean , look at him in Labyrinth !"
2007-08-31,"A movie kind of love ...
David Bowie in The Man
Who Fell to Earth
In the business they call "" show "" , a good - natured optimism prevails .
Despite the patchy - at - best record of musicians trying their hand at acting , they still keep lining them up and casting them .
This week alone , David Bowie looks set to appear in Dr Who as an alien , while the makers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin - off Ripper are lining up Peter Doherty to play a zombie , presumably after watching a Babyshambles gig .
Bowie of course is no stranger to the dramatic arts .
Last seen abusing Ricky Gervais in song , he made his bones with The Man
Who Fell to Earth , although the undoubted pinnacle of his acting career was voicing a character for SpongeBob SquarePants .
The 80s saw a telling performance from David Essex in Silver Dream Racer .
Whatever our feelings on his performance , his stunt double certainly knew how to ride .
Your musician often has difficulty grasping the concept less - is - more when it comes to acting , something illustrated by the tragic case of Kyle MacLachlan murdering little - known rocker
Sting for overacting in Dune .
And who can forget Jason Orange 's performance in Lynda La Plante 's critically panned Killer Net ?
Everyone apart from me , apparently .
There are the successes , of course .
Mark Wahlberg was a lousy rapper yet proves himself an increasingly impressive actor , and his Three Kings co - star Ice Cube has a series of strong performances under his belt .
Indeed , rappers in general seem to make the transition better than rockers , with Mos Def , Tupac Shakur , Sticky Fingaz , Queen Latifah , Will Smith , LL Cool J and Ice T all putting in highly creditable performances .
I 'll be honest - I admire any musician willing to put their reputation on the line in the name of expanding their artistic horizons .
It 's well - known that we journalists are filth who hate life and ourselves , and there 's nothing we like better than when a Shanghai Surprise or Under The Cherry Moon falls into our lap for a critical mauling .
If shooting fish in a barrel were an Olympic sport , we 'd sweep the board .
So , let 's hear it for the men and women who put down their instruments and pick up a script .
I 've got Cher winning an Oscar for Moonstruck as the most impressive acting achievement from a musician .
What about you ?"
2007-09-06,"Alas , American viewers will never experience the rapture of watching one rock titan singing Happy Birthday to another .
Tonight , with a live appearance at the Odeon in Leicester Square , David Gilmour , Pink Floyd singer and guitarist , will launch the DVD of his extraordinary night at the Albert Hall .
All manner of odds and sods from his long and winding life dropped in , including David Bowie and Robert Wyatt - who recalled that the last time he was in the hall , as drummer with Soft Machine , he nipped out for a fag and the doorman refused to readmit him : "" He said , look son , we only have proper music in here . ""
Several Floyds turned up , but not Roger Waters : the two put aside one of rock 's most obscure feuds to reform the band for Live 8 two years ago , but Gilmour later warned it would never happen again - "" enough is enough "" .
Rick Wright did turn up , and Gilmour sang the little tribute to his implausible 63rd birthday - but it has had to be edited out of the American version of the DVD , because they have n't been able to get clearance for the copyright of that immortal anthem .
Now for a real star .
Muriel McKilligan , who cooks for the 22 fortunate children at Easterfield primary in Aberdeenshire , has been voted the best school dinner lady in Scotland .
She says the children like her homemade lentil soup best , which is not just admirable , it 's breathtaking .
Expect nothing but positive , happy statements from architect Piers Gough , now he 's been appointed - along with Nick Johnson of Urban Splash regeneration consultants , and engineer Hanif Kara - as commissioner at Cabe , the government 's advisers on architecture and the built environment .
He once said of protests : "" The deification of the destructive whinge culture is incredibly bad for us , spiritually and physically . ""
You might want a lemon to bite on for this , the nation 's choice of its cuddliest , most diddumsy stars .
In a poll for Trident chewing gum ( yes , it 's soft ) the top soft celebrities were TV presenter Fern Britton , singer Mark Owen and , er ,
Mr Jordan , Peter Andre .
The competition was fiercer in the secret softy tough guys category : Arnold Schwarzenegger made the cut , as did Simon Cowell turning to mush over dear little Connie , the six - year - old contestant on Britain 's Got Talent .
But the clear winner was Steve McFadden , or rather his EastEnders alter ego , the serially thumped , shot and misunderstood Phil Mitchell .

2007-09-20,"When the news reached us here at Guardian Unlimited Music that Radio One were going to celebrate their 40th anniversary by releasing a compilation of exclusive cover versions , we may have reacted somewhat unenthusiastically .
After all , for every Maximo Park covering Timberlake 's Like I Love
You , there 's Corinne Bailey Rae doing the Raconteurs ' Steady
As She Goes .
But news reaches us of one unusual collaboration : Franz Ferdinand have enlisted the help of Girls Aloud for their cover of David Bowie 's Sound and Vision .
According to our source , the collaboration came about after Girls Alouder Sarah Harding met Franz Ferdinand 's Alex Kapranos at the NME awards in March .
But while Girls Aloud covering David Bowie excites us muchly , the news we 're most excited by is that , according to our source , Franz Ferdinand are working with pop production team Xenomania on their new album .
Xenomania , in case you do n't know , are responsible for this .
And this .
And just about every song that Girls Aloud have ever done .
In other words , they 're the Stock , Aitken and Waterman
it 's OK to like .
We 've never been so excited about the prospect of a new Franz Ferdinand album before .
In fact , we 've never been excited about a new Franz Ferdinand album at all before , but now we ca n't wait for the Tony Lamezma remix !"
2007-09-27,"This year 's most titanic album will be released next week , and the corporation responsible must surely be cancelling staff leave and paying double - time to cope with the demand .
But then again , as Elton John once put it , no .
The CD in question is prosaically titled The Very Best of Mick Jagger , and counts as one of the pointless artefacts ever conceived - up there with reissues of 1980s
David Bowie LPs and the great lost Shed Seven live album ( really - it exists ) .
Feel the shudder as you process the titles of those long - forgotten solo works : She 's the Boss , Wandering Spirit , Primitive Cool , Goddess in the Doorway .
Could there be anything worse than Joy , a 2001 piece built around a duet between Jagger and the venerable Bono ?
Actually , yes : God Gave Me Everything , a 2001 piece built around a duet between Jagger and Lenny Kravitz .
What about Let 's Work , the brazenly insensitive 1987 hymn to paid employment that sounded rather like a record commissioned by Norman Tebbit ?
Who needs to be reacquainted with this stuff ?
Our survey said : uh - urrrr !
Not to cast doubt on the miracle and wonder MJ once achieved with the Rolling Stones , but his solo adventures surely prove that 1 ) he embodies all the ersatz , market - chasing , expensively produced , studio - in - the - Caribbean aspects of music 's DNA that can occasionally make mainstream rock such a pain in the bum , and 2 ) by almost polar contrast - and despite his increasing inability to play the guitar very well - Keith Richards represents the elemental , devil - may - care , whisky - breathed bits that can occasionally make it such a thrill .
By way of hammering the point home , listen to Talk
Is Cheap , the 1988 album that Richards reluctantly made while Jagger toured the world with a backing band who sported mullets and sparkly tailcoats .
It 's not great art , but a likable testament to rock 's crude glories worth playing at least once a year .
And so to the crucial part of this week 's text .
These words were written in a chintzy hotel in Bournemouth , where I am being paid to witness and report on the rally - cum - media - bunfight that is the Labour Party conference , which rather put me in mind of one of our culture 's iron rules : most public figures can be compared with either Jagger or Richards , and thereby put in their rightful place .
The aforementioned Bono once made the claim that Gordon Brown and Tony Blair were the "" Lennon and McCartney of world development "" , which struck me not just as excruciating , but way off the mark .
Better , I think , to think of them as Mick'n'Keef : one a hopelessly affected , glottal - stopping , fashion - following lightweight , the other a firmly grounded , instinctive operator who knows what he likes and tends to stick to it .
There again , I ran this theory past a colleague who told me that if we were going to get into Rolling Stones analogies , Brown 's conference speech was surely so achingly competent that he should actually be thought of as the political equivalent of Charlie Watts .
We began to speculate about who might be the cabinet 's Ronnie Wood - the defence secretary , Des Browne ?
But that 's enough of that already .
Anyway , a random list of Mick - esque gadflies and opportunists proves the essential point , so here goes : David Cameron , Chris Martin , Richard Archer , David Walliams , him out of My Chemical Romance , Ricky Gervais , Tom Cruise .
And so to a representative selection of Keiths : Dave Grohl , PJ Harvey , John Humphrys , Jamie T , Amy Winehouse , Simon Pegg and Sean Penn .
To get dialectical about it , we are talking about the difference between Lily Allen ( Keef ) and Kate Nash ( Mick ) , or those one - time bandmates Pete Doherty and Johnny Borrell
( no explanation needed , surely ) .
Talking of whom , the Razorlight frontman seems to me to be such a one - man crystallisation of the perils of Mickery that he will surely fall victim to the same pratfalls .
So , as a closing and very nightmarish thought , imagine : 2037 , and the unexpected release of Johnny Borrell 's greatest hits .
Uh - urrrr !"
2007-10-07,"The sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll story of Ian Curtis , the lead singer of post - punk band Joy Division , who committed suicide in 1980 at the age of 23 , was one of the strands in Michael Winterbottom 's 24 Hour Party People , a lively , semi - fictionalised portrait of the Manchester music impresario Tony Wilson .
The story gets another airing at greater length in the sombre , monochrome Control , the directorial debut of the Dutch photographer and graphic artist Anton Corbijn , who started out chronicling the rock scene .
It 's a fairly minimalist account of a bright , dreamy working - class lad ( Sam Riley ) growing up in a brutalist block of flats in Macclesfield with copies of Ginsberg 's Howl and Ballard 's Crash on his shelves , and posters of David Bowie on his walls .
At 19 , he marries a local girl , Deborah ( Samantha Morton ) , works as a clerk at an employment exchange ( where a job - seeker has an epileptic fit , thus inspiring his song ' She 's Lost Control ' ) , and forms the band that would become Joy Division after meeting his three fellow group members at a gig in Manchester .
There is little sense of fun or elation in the band 's success , first playing locally and then touring after being signed by Wilson 's Factory label , and maybe the squalid life lived in a haze of booze and drugs was rather dreary .
Moreover , the combination of an affair with a Belgian beauty , who was evidently attracted by the little - boy - lost side of Curtis ( he looks a lot like Pete Doherty ) , his epilepsy , increasing fear of public performance and the break - up of his marriage led almost inevitably to his suicide .
He killed himself shortly after downing a bottle of scotch while watching Werner Herzog 's depressing movie Stroszek on television .
The movie , produced by Deborah Curtis and the late Tony Wilson , is curiously flat and unrevealing , and only truly comes to life when the punk poet John Cooper Clarke takes the stage .
It does , however , look rather good in the manner of Shane Meadows 's dour black - and - white TwentyfourSeven and is rather like flicking through an album of still photographs .
The final image is a panning shot up the chimney of a crematorium to reveal the black smoke bellowing forth , and one wonders whether this is an image of life 's tragic transitoriness or a reference to the band 's name , a ' Joy Division ' being a brothel staffed by female Jewish inmates of Nazi concentration camps for the use of guards and German soldiers ."
2007-10-24,"Re - release me ...
David Bowie performs on The Reality Tour .

Earlier this month , David Bowie released his best album for 25 years .
OK , I 'm exaggerating .
He re - released his best album for 25 years .
You 'd be excused for not being entirely overwhelmed by that sentence ; particularly since every new release by The Dame seems to come with a similarly hyperbolic statement these days .
But 1993 's The Buddha of Suburbia is different .
Bowie 's soundtrack to the TV series of the book by Hanif Kureishi was largely ignored at the time of it 's release - something Bowie blames on the fact that it was designated as a soundtrack album and so consequently "" got zilch in the way of marketing money "" .
Despite Bowie himself once claiming it was his favourite album , it did n't exactly trouble the charts - peaking at number 87 in November 1993 .
Which probably explains why it was swiftly deleted and remained little more than a curio for completists until its recent re - release . ""
The album itself only got one review , "" Bowie laments .
"" A good one , as it happens . ""
Well , make this the second .
Buddha ticks every box .
Even the appearance of Lenny Kravitz on the single version of the title track fails to upset the apple cart .
It may be predominantly instrumental , but then so was Low .
I 'll spare you a track by track account , but his list of influences in the liner notes will please any Bowie fan - not least the fact he summarises them as "" residue from the 1970s "" .
Here are a few specifics he mentions : Roxy Music , Philip Glass , New York clubs , Pink Floyd , drugs , Neu , Unter den Linden , Pet Sounds , Prostitutes and Soho , Loneliness .
Better yet , his best album since 1980 's Scary Monsters was written , recorded and mixed in little over a week .
He sings about South London in a mockney accent .
It contains one of his best ever rhyming couplets : "" Sometimes I fear / That the whole world is queer "" .
It 's experimental and occasionally very pretentious .
What more could you ask for ?
And yet , weeks after it reappeared in the shops , it still is n't in the Top 100 UK albums .
It 's still Bowie 's great lost album ."
2007-11-13,"As one of Britain 's bleakest urban jungles , it might seem an unlikely site for a green utopia of hanging gardens , flowing rivers and rolling parks .
But Croydon will not be deterred .
Later tonight the much maligned town , once described as a "" complete concrete hell "" by David Bowie , will announce a multibillion - pound regeneration plan that will , potentially , turn it into a beacon of sustainability , drawing on ideas from other European cities including Barcelona .
The architect Will Alsop , who once tried to reinvent Barnsley as a walled Tuscan hill town , is to mastermind the transformation , which has as its centrepiece "" a vertical version of the Eden Project "" rising more than 30 storeys in Park Hill Park .
Effectively a giant greenhouse in the form of a skyscraper , it would become Croydon 's primary visitor attraction with different species planted in "" sky gardens "" on each floor .
Alsop has proposed hacking back "" a forest of car parks "" choking the town centre , shutting eight - lane highways to through traffic and building a pedestrian - friendly "" emerald necklace "" of parks .
The river Wandle is also to be brought back to the surface 40 years after it was buried in culverts and Alsop hopes to revive fishing for Wandle trout .
His vision - dubbed "" Third City "" - is part of Croydon 's attempt to persuade the government to grant it city status .
Since 2000 , ministers have overlooked its claim while allowing Preston , Newport , Lisburn , Newry , Inverness , Stirling , Wolverhampton and Brighton and Hove to qualify .
"" Everything in our town centre demands that we are considered a city , "" said a spokesman for the council .
Under the plan , 20,000 new homes will be built to increase the town centre population from fewer than 5,000 residents to 50,000 .
Glass apartment blocks will be connected by high - level covered walkways crossing the main Wellesley Road , which will be reduced from eight lanes to two .
Pod - shaped buildings will rise up on stilts and scores of public squares and miniature parks will be built throughout the town centre , inspired by the regeneration of Barcelona after the 1992 Olympics .
It will correct what Jon Rouse , chief executive of the council , described as Croydon 's failed attempt to build a successful town in line with the modernist principles of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier . ""
Croydon was a prosperous historic town in the 19th century and the history books show that it was a really pleasant place to come , "" said Rouse .
"" The second world war completely blew it to bits .
What grew up in the 1960s was one of the most wholehearted developments of Corbusian modernism .
At the time it was seen as very exciting and pointed the way to the future .
But it did n't work and it became seen as an alien structure imposed on the historic settlement .
Now Will Alsop is trying to bring the historic urban pattern back . ""
Alsop 's plan was drawn up after a series of workshops with local residents , whose ideas included creating a beach and bringing the Wandle back to the surface .
By 2010 Croydon will be hooked up to the London Underground network via the extended East London line . ""
This marks a new beginning , "" said Alsop .
"" Developers are lining up their money to invest and I have faith that the people of Croydon are behind what we are planning to do .
We know London is under housing pressure but rather than building new estates in the Thames Gateway area , we should be looking to build ... in places like Croydon . ""
The attempt to rebrand Croydon - currently best known as the headquarters of NestlÃ© UK and the birthplace of Kate Moss has raised eyebrows in rival cities .
"" All I know about Croydon is that you go through it on the way to Gatwick and there 's lots of 1960s municipal architecture there , "" said Peter Saville , the creative director at Manchester city council who produced a brand vision of Manchester as "" the original modern city "" .
"" When you hear they are rebranding Croydon you ca n't help but smile in a cynical way .
I am very sceptical about the notion of rebranding places .. ""
Alsop 's vision is largely reliant on private investment .
It will be started by a Â£ 450 m urban regeneration vehicle set up by the council , which is planning to develop Â£ 89 m worth of council property that will be boosted with private investment and loans .
Separately , around Â£ 3.5bn in private investment has already been earmarked for projects including an arena for 12,500 spectators and a 44-storey residential tower .
Slough , Reading and Basingstoke - Croydon 's closest competitors for investment - have already launched city centre building projects and Gateshead , Stockport and Barnsley are also following their larger neighbours with strategies to improve their tired centres .
"" This is Croydon 's turn , "" said Rouse .
Crocus valley Â· The name Croydon is thought to be derived from the Anglo - Saxon for crocus ( "" croh "" ) and valley ( "" denu "" ) Â·
Croydon is home to 342,700 people - but just 4,400 live in the town centre Â·
David Bowie used Croydon as an insult , as in : "" God , it 's so Croydon "" Â· In the 1960s , it became known as the Manhattan of south London , as skyscrapers , underpasses and flyovers attracted American - style corporate headquarters Â· People born in Croydon include Kate Moss , Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Kingsley Amis Â· Croydon aerodrome opened in 1920 and was the main airport for international flights from London .
It closed in 1959 Â· Beanos , on Middle Street , claims to be the biggest second - hand record shop in the world Â· The town gave birth to its own hairstyle - the Croydon facelift - where hair is scraped back from the face , pulled tight and tied in a pony tail or bun Â· The local council is controlled by the Conservatives"
2007-11-14,"In case you were ever in any doubt that David Bowie is , was and always will be the hippest man ever to walk the earth , behold this 1976 mugshot , currently for sale on eBay , taken by the New York police department after his arrest for possession of marijuana in Rochester .
If you did n't know it was a mugshot , you could easily mistake it for an album or magazine cover - a carefully contrived assemblage customarily requiring the efforts of dozens of modern artisans labouring under hot lights and cool attitudes , rather than a quick Polaroid snap by a desk sergeant with , presumably , much better things to do than process potheads , however androgynously beautiful they might be .
It flies in the face of all celebrity post - arrest pictorial traditions , whereby the great and good stand before us stripped of make - up , money and flattering lighting , suddenly revealed as mere mortals after all .
Homeless mere mortals usually - Dennis Hopper looks like a belligerent down - and - out in his 1975 shot , taken after he was arrested for reckless driving in Mexico , and Nick Nolte in his 2002 version could n't look more dishevelled if he had asked the police to drag him through a variety of hedges backwards before taking the picture for their records .
The Thin White Duke , by contrast , looks immaculate .
He has even avoided the pitfalls presented by the to - camera stare .
Hugh Grant went for knowing ruefulness after he was picked up for fumbling with Divine Brown on Sunset Boulevard , which makes him look both guilty and crushed .
Mel Gibson aimed at apologetic twinkling after being stopped on suspicion of drunk driving and disbursing an anti - semitic tirade against the arresting officer .
He missed by a mile , ending up somewhere between fear and desperation .
Both would have been better off following Bowie 's example - an unflappable level gaze that admits nothing , but with the hint of a smile that suggests all sorts of ongoing exotically depraved activities whose existence the authorities do not even suspect ."
2007-12-06,"In 1971 , I got a call from a little magazine called Disc and Music Echo , who I was desperately trying to get work from at the time - not that they ever paid you much in those days .
They said they wanted David Bowie photographed .
So I went down to Bowie 's house in Beckenham , Kent .
It was a Victorian semi as far as I remember .
I had photographed him before , at a small club in Aylesbury , when he was wearing a catsuit in a very tasteful shade of lime - green .
When I arrived at his home , there he was : on the top of a ladder , painting his ceiling with a can of Dulux , and wearing the same catsuit with a matching hat .
He also had these long , white boots on .
I thought it was very funny .
It was obviously an outfit he wore all the time .
The journalist I was working with was called Rosalind Russell , who was a huge fan of Bowie .
She was really happy to be there and ran the whole show , as I remember , while I just took pictures during the interview with a Nikon F camera and using only the available light , probably with either a 50 mm or an 85 mm lens .
I did n't have to work hard to get the pictures , it has to be said .
If you look at the contact sheets now , he was a bit affected , with quite flowery hand movements , and his catsuit hung open just perfectly .
I just thought the curve of the fabric was nice , and I was aware that I was photographing his nipple .
Today , the breast - like shape on his chest almost looks like it was quite a clever way of reflecting his androgynous sexuality .
But things were very different then , and I do n't think it even occurred to me that he was bisexual at the time .
It was just the way he was .
To me , he was simply an ordinary bloke at home .
I shot him putting his paint away at the end .

On Trial sees Stuart Maconie debating the best musical decade , Pop Britannia reveals the inner workings of the managers and producers behind our greatest bands and in How Pop Songs Work the classical conductor Charles Hazlewood explores the mechanics of a hit song .
What Heston Blumenthal is to food , David Bellamy is to the undergrowth and Trinny and Susanah are to underwear , Charles Hazlewood is to classical music .
He 's an enthusiast , an expert and part of that fine tradition of well - spoken BBC boffins from David Attenborough to Evan Davis .
He 's someone who takes pleasure in thumbing his subject matter apart like the layers of an onion to show us how it all works .
On his Radio 3 show Discovering Music he performs what he calls "" open heart surgery "" on a famous piece of music "" examining all the guts and tissue that go into it before stitching it back up again and doing a complete performance "" .
It 's a great approach and one that makes the intimidating world of classical music accessible .
How Pop Works essentially does the same thing but to Amy Winehouse and Rhianna instead of Wagner and Ravel . ""
My fundamental belief is there are only two types of music - great music and terrible music , "" says Charles Hazlewood .
""
The very idea that if you like drum and bass you wo n't like Wagner and if you like Wagner
you wo n't like Aphex Twin is bollocks .
"" Hazlewood 's passion is bringing together the two cultures of classical and popular music .
He 's taken the National Youth Orchestra to Glastonbury , invited grime artists to rap to the BBC Concert Orchestra and is working on a sampling project with the Super Furry Animals .
"" I hate this word fusion , "" he says .
"" Fusion is when you get someone like Elvis Costello wanking around at the front of the stage looking smug and a poor old orchestra at the back playing gloopy chords . ""
He 's equally damning about Chris Martin ( to blame for a generation of male singers who "" shoot up into falsetto when they want you to feel sorry for them "" ) , Joss Stone ( "" an empty vessel to pour soul - like gestures into "" ) and artists like Sting who "" sellotape something hip on top of their music in a desperate attempt to appear current "" .
He is , though , a big fan of Deep Purple , the Who , Radiohead and Kylie whose songs , like all great pop work , in a similar way to classical music .
With his piano and turntable an arm stretch away , he demonstrates the parallels in some of his favourite songs ...
Arctic Monkeys -
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Best bit :
Alex Turner brilliant debunking of looking cool with the line "" dancing like a robot from 1984 "" .
Autopsy : "" What 's so clever is it starts with an absolute deluge of F sharp minor .
Then finally when Alex Turner comes in it 's actually on a C sharp major chord , which is what 's known as the dominant chord in music theory .
Then you 're made to wait to get that big deluge of that tonic chord again until the chorus which is a brilliant way of building your expectation , holding you back like an elastic band and then letting you ping . ""
Dizzee
Rascal - Paranoid Best bit :
The way Dizzee rhymes "" East "" with "" beef "" .
Autopsy : ""
I was dropping my daughter off at nursery this morning
and I was listening to this .
What 's interesting is it starts with the chorus
( "" Rinse me out , use me up , cast me down , fuck me up "" ) and that there 's this rolling bass line that underlines all the verses .
That makes me think of Henry Purcell , one of our greatest composers from the 17th century who was part of a time when an awful lot of music was written over the top of what was called a ground bass .
The idea was that one wrote music over one recurring bass line that 's on a loop and here I am listening to Dizzee Rascal and thinking "" blimey there 's a ground bass . ""
Radiohead - Paranoid android Best bit : When the maudlin , moaning section lurches back into the world of crashing guitars .
Autopsy : "" There are parallels between them and composers like Pierre Boulez or Maurice Ravel - people who have an extraordinary ear for colour and harmony .
Paranoid Android is a post - progressive rock symphony in three movements ; it 's got these three sections that have only a small amount of family connections .
Add into the mill their extraordinary sonic imagination and the way they chose to grind in a very hard electric guitar sound just on one syllable of one word of one line of a lyric and then its gone again . ""
Amy Winehouse - Back to balck Best bit : Amy wailing "" black ... black "" not unlike Johnny the Fast Show painter who fell apart at the very mention of the word .
Autopsy : "" It 's all built around one D minor chord with a lovely , really loose swung bass .
The combination of the bass and the repeated chord - which might be on the beat or off the beat depending on which way you view it - is fantastic .
There 's something very powerful about songs that are built out of a very concentrated tonality .
Back To Black never deviates from it and it forces you into a very narrow tunnel .
When it does go to a different place there 's an almost seismic sense of relief . ""
John Lennon - Imagine
Best bit : Phil Spector 's big pillowy piano echo and the opening line "" imagine there 's no heaven "" .
Autopsy : "" An absolute classic song with a classic song structure .
What 's lovely is you get those beautiful piano chords in the introduction and the voice grows organically out of that .
It 's not like Arctic Monkeys where the verse is saying something then the chorus catapults you somewhere else .
Instead , it 's the very idea that you can start a piece of music rolling then very organically the vocal line emerges from it .
The chorus gradually amasses potency and once you get to the line "" I hope one day you 'll join us "" there 's an enormous sense of release .
We 've been in C major so that E major chord is quite an alien place to go .
It comes as a real bolt out of the blue . ""
The Prodigy - Poison Best bit : Keith 's man - possessed - by - evil - demons scream .
Autopsy : "" What Prodigy are doing is some fantastic old - as - the - hills form of music called counterpoint - which is one of the most mathematical constructs in all music .
It centres on a type of music called a fugue .
The basic way it works is you set out your melodic idea then , once that idea is being aired , another voice comes in with the same idea but a different pitch , then the voice that had the initial idea has to make accompanying material to decorate the original idea .
It 's done with the most amazing amount of sophistication but at the same time it 's a rebel rousing , terrifying piece of poisonous music .
Someone like Mahler built up the same high velocity but he 'd then give you a portion of time when you can regroup .
The Prodigy are just about pushing you further to the abyss . ""
Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
Best bit :
The mental operatic section , obviously .
Autopsy : ""
It always amuses me that when you watch the video it seems as if all four of queen are singing all those harmony lines but
in fact when you listen carefully you can tell it 's Freddie Mercury looped on top of himself .
If you look at in on paper you say to yourself that it does n't make a consistent musical narrative
but it does just hang together
and it goes through a multitude of different keys .
That 's very weird for a pop song to do because invariably you 're in a tonic key and that 's where you stay .
You go to some related place but basically you do n't leave the continent .
Whereas Bohemian Rhapsody goes to five different continents within the course of six minutes ! ""

2008-01-08,"What got you started ?
Hearing David Bowie sing Starman .
It came on the radio one morning before school , when I was 12 , and I knew straight away that was what I was going to do .
From that moment on , music absorbed every second of my life .
What was your big breakthrough ?
The Bunnymen 's first gig at Eric 's Club in Liverpool in 1978 .
We only had one song , and the drum machine did n't work for the first 10 minutes , but that was the night a star was born .
Who or what have you sacrificed for your art ?
There are people I 've let down or not given my complete self to .
But all those people have gained by being in my songs .
Which songs would feature on the soundtrack to your life ?
Bowie 's Starman , because that 's where it all began ;
The Killing Moon , because that 's the Bunnymen 's best - known song ; and Nothing Lasts Forever , because it 's possibly the best song I ever wrote .
What 's your favourite cultural haunt in Liverpool ?
The Pier Head .
It has the Liver Building , with its birds protecting the city , and the wide Mersey stretching out before it like a sheet of silver .
Are you fashionable ?
I am fashion .
What 's your favourite film ?
Midnight Run , with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin .
It 's about everything - man 's soul , his honour and his dignity .
I watch it and think , that 's how I want to be .
What 's the greatest threat to music today ?
People thinking that songs are something to listen to while they 're doing the dishes .
How can the lyrics not be the first thing that grabs you ?
Complete this sentence
: At heart I 'm just a frustrated ...
Black soul singer in a white man 's underpants .
What was the last album you enjoyed ?
Want One by Rufus Wainwright .
I thought nobody would be able to reach the places I went to with The Killing Moon , but every track haunted me .
What advice would you give a young singer who is starting out ?
Never be afraid to find your voice .
I listen to old Bunnymen records now and think I sound cringe - worthy and over the top .
But that 's a process a singer often has to go through .
Is there anything about your career you regret ?
Slagging people off : I was really good at the one - liner putdown .
I realise now that I was applying too much criticism to other people , and not enough to myself .
In short Born : Liverpool , 1959 Career :
Co - founded Echo and the Bunnymen aged 18 in 1978 ; released his first solo album in 1989 .
The reformed Bunnymen play in Liverpool : the Musical at the Echo Arena , Liverpool , on Saturday .

2008-01-11,"Abandon all thoughts of minimal outsider art : the only thing this Danish five - piece have in common with Yoko Ono
is that she 's a classically trained pianist and album opener
The Strawberry Festival tinkles the ivories in grand , gothic style .
From then on , this debut is an amalgam of synth - funk on a spin cycle and new romantic pop played with neu - rave impatience .
At first , it 's surreal , dance - floor filling fun , with singer Malthe Fischer taking euro politics to task while channeling David Bowie on The Shock of the Real and sneering "" It is time to decide why trees are making fun of me "" on The Only Undead .

2008-01-12,"It was never going to be an easy relationship : hard - nosed City financiers and businessmen working alongside songwriters and musicians .
The men in suits reckon that working together they can revitalise EMI , the struggling group which has been a key part of the British pop industry for more than 40 years .
It is the label behind the Beatles , Queen , Pink Floyd , David Bowie and more recently Radiohead , Coldplay , Kylie and Robbie Williams .
But just six months after Terra Firma , a private equity group , acquired the label for Â£ 3.2bn , the signs are not good : Radiohead have quit , describing the new regime as like "" a confused bull in a china shop "" and this week Williams has gone on strike , refusing to deliver his new album .
Kylie and Coldplay are said to be considering their options and Tony Wadsworth , the man in charge of the UK arm , has been ousted after 25 years .
Now it is understood that 1,000 EMI staff are to lose their jobs .
A look at 2007 's biggest - selling albums puts EMI 's woes in stark terms .
The top 100 features a mere six from the label - and three are compilations of old material by Cliff Richard , Phil Collins and the Spice Girls .
EMI 's highest - placed album is only the 26th biggest seller of the year - Lily Allen 's Alright , Still , which came out in 2006 .
Overall , 2007 saw EMI 's share of the albums market fall 2.5 percentage points to 15.4 % .
Williams 's strike is more bad news .
While Rudebox , released last Christmas , performed relatively poorly , his new album is being recorded with Guy Chambers , who co - wrote his biggest hits , and Mark Ronson , who produced much of Amy Winehouse 's Back to Black , which was 2007 's best - selling album .
Tim Clark , of IE Management , which represents Williams , said the singer would not release another EMI record until the management 's plans became clearer .
"" We 're led to believe there is going to be a new and wholesale cutback in staff .
Tony Wadsworth has left , we understand other long - serving employees will be leaving too .
We wo n't deliver an album to a company where we do n't know what their structure will be or how they will handle things . ""
Next week Terra Firma is to say how it intends to turn EMI into a lean , mean music machine .
Its plans focus on "" efficiencies "" - those job cuts .
A source close to the private equity group said : "" Workers need to spend more time servicing their artists and less time going to whizzy parties and travelling the world . ""
Terra Firma is run by Guy Hands , 48 , a one - time bond trader who is not exactly rock and roll .
William Hague was best man at his wedding .
Over his career he has acquired businesses ranging from pub companies to railway rolling stock leasing .
He bought thousands of Ministry of Defence homes and controls the Odeon and UCI cinema chains .
Since buying EMI - which he intends to turn around and sell for far more than he paid within about five years - he has called in several other traditional business executives with no music experience to help with the task .
Post Office chairman Allan Leighton has become an adviser , as has former BBC director - general Lord Birt and former BAA airports boss Mike Clasper .
The bands and their management are far from impressed .
As Radiohead 's manager , Bryce Edge , said : "" When you 're dealing with creative talent , there 's a lot of risk - taking that goes on .
That 's where Terra Firma is going to struggle .
"" Hands has uncovered all sorts of costs he has never seen before , from multi - million - pound "" hand out and hope "" advances to artists to a Â£ 20,000-a - month bill for candles .
He is said to have been astonished by EMI 's Â£ 200,000-a - year spend to keep its Hammersmith head office in flowers and fruit .
Seasoned industry executives , however , know that "" fruit and flowers "" is shorthand for artists ' partying requirements .
But this is n't just a flabby , badly run business which Hands will easily be able to lick into shape .
The entire industry has been battered first by piracy and now by legitimate downloads which , while growing fast , are not offsetting the fall in CD sales .
The big moneyspinner is now touring , which labels generally do not get a slice of - although EMI is said to want in on the act .
At the same time , the artists are becoming more powerful .
The internet has given them more control .
Clark said : "" There really are other people , very good people , that can do the finances , do the press , market , promote and so on - and do it hugely competitively . ""
Artists also want to control their back catalogue and if they are unhappy can walk out - as Radiohead have done .
As singer Thom Yorke explained on the band 's website : "" What we wanted was some control over our work and how it was used in the future by them - that seemed reasonable to us , as we cared about it a great deal .
Mr Hands was not interested .
So neither were we . ""
One EMI executive said Hands is still convinced that he can turn EMI around , but needs to get rid of entrenched interests , like Wadsworth .
And not everyone thinks he will fail , or that the end of the major label is nigh .
EMI 's Lily Allen has attacked Radiohead , which allowed fans to pay what they liked for a download of their latest album , for "" devaluing music "" and Pet Shop Boys ' Neil Tennant said he had no interest in marketing and distribution :
"" I just do n't want to be in that business .
I 'd rather complain to EMI if it goes wrong . ""
Peter Ruppert , who runs music consultancy Entertainment Media Research , said Hands could turn EMI around by treating it like an independent label but sticking to strict business rules : "" In the past it was about who had the biggest chequebook
but it 's really about who works the smartest at it and who can make the music business work , and work for the artist . """
2008-01-19,"The UK company Chrysalis , one of the world 's leading independent music publishers , could launch an auction for its business thanks to a growing list of trade and private equity bidders .
It emerged yesterday that EMI , under its new venture capitalist owners , has tabled an indicative bid for the publisher , whose catalogue goes back to the 1960s and includes Jethro Tull , Blondie , David Bowie and more recently Gnarls Barkley and Blur front man Damon Albarn .
Terra Firma - owned EMI , where new boss Guy Hands is shaking up the struggling recording arm with thousands of job cuts , will face competition for Chrysalis from Warner Chappell , the music publishing unit of Warner Music .
It is also thought that Sony / ATV Music Publishing , a joint venture between Sony and trusts set up by Michael Jackson , could be interested .
The publisher is headed by Martin Bandier , the former boss of EMI 's music publishing business .
Chrysalis has also seen interest from private equity groups , attracted by its dependable cash flows .
Earlier this week it confirmed it was still "" in negotiations with a number of interested parties "" .
The City predicts the business could fetch between Â£ 160 m and Â£ 190 m .
Patrick Yau , a media analyst at Ingenious Securities , said a realistic value would be 210p to 260p a share . ""
Ultimately , we expect that the music trade buyers will have the greatest interest and most flexibility on price , as they will be able to achieve a higher level of cost - saving than the private equity players , "" he said .
EMI , Terra Firma , Chrysalis , Warner and Sony / ATV all declined to comment ."
2008-01-20,"I do n't know about you , but I 'd love to devote this month 's column to that diabolical , deranged and yet entirely reasonable moment in Tim Burton 's film version of Stephen Sondheim 's Sweeney Todd when Johnny Depp ( pictured below ) starts singing .
I do n't want to ruin the surprise , but you wo n't know whether to laugh , cry , leave the cinema , or just marvel at the uncanny combination of sound , eye shadow and meaning , and the way reality is sliced mercilessly from ear to ear as soon as Depp drops , fantastically , into what might be called melody .
I think that I could write a book about the way that Depp suggests from the moment he starts to sing that the greatest album ever made is The World of David Bowie , and that the greatest pop performance of all time is Anthony Newley 's ' Pop Goes the Weasel ' , and that when you sing every word should sound like it derives from a foggy , frisky Englishness that possibly only ever existed in the mind of Wilfred Hyde - White .
He 's also worked out a vocal sound that dreams what Damon Albarn might have done as Doctor Doolittle , which is his gift to us , the fans , who have kept the faith even as he did that toothless pirate thing .
The first chapter would be all about how Depp imagines the swinging 1860s creature that is going to perform this ripe , post - modern Victorian pop will look like a stoned showbusiness hybrid of Marc Bolan , Quentin Crisp , Eleanor Bron , Charlie Chaplin , Gene Wilder , Mary Poppins , Mozart and himself , and lurk in a murky cobbled London midway between Disney 's 101 Dalmatians and David Lean 's Oliver Twist .
He ingeniously implies that Jack the Ripper might have been the laughing gnome .
The trouble is , I ca n't give as much attention to Depp 's voice as I would like as I 've got other things on my mind , dark , scheming , revolting , sleazy , seedy things that always tend to take the smirking form of Simon Cowell , pop 's great charmless , morally shrunken villain .
Much as I would like to savour the sweet , demented magic of Depp 's singing , I just ca n't get out of my mind the way that Cowell is single - handedly poisoning pop , turning it into a kind of dirty joke where the blank , flat punchline is merely the amount of money he makes .
He makes it by controlling a talent show that is broadcast to millions who fall for the calculated soap / reality elements , as if there really is a competition , but who never get to see the extent of Cowell 's involvement in the whole fiasco .
The show ends up selecting largely amateur acts that are signed to his label and processed into slick commercial entities that for a while dominate the charts - not least because of the weeks of exposure they have had on his talent show , a monstrous souped - up advertisement for his own label and its mundane acts .
One of the by - products of his tyrannical need to control what 's left of the traditional pop charts is the way that he has ruined the Christmas No . 1 - now there is no race between a possible unexpected seasonal treasure or a fresh , ludicrous novelty song , with the occasional cameo from Cliff looking more and more like a saucy , depleted mate of the singing Depp , but the inevitable instant dumping of the dull , bewildered winner and some sick sentimental nonsense right at the top of the charts .
I tried ignoring Cowell , thinking he might go away to enjoy his shocking , Goldfinger - like wealth , or be eventually found out by whoever should be monitoring these things , so that the ridiculous power he has amassed to control minds with spit , shine and shit is taken away from him .
But no , he 's still there , and even as I try simply to enjoy the moment when the powdered , poignant Depp starts to sing for queer life in the new Sweeney Todd film , I ca n't shake off the spectre of Cowell .
He rises up out of the swirling fog of his grim , bland ambition , looking like the kind of sly , jaded villain we can only hope soon meets a gruesome showbiz end ."
2008-01-22,"Pop has always been full of chameleons : artists who constantly reinvent themselves to keep us guessing ( we guess ) .
Examples include Bob Dylan , the Beatles , Madonna , David Bowie , Beck and McFly .
Desperately seeking entry into this prestigious club is a certain rapper and producer named Sean Combs , who has previously assumed the guises of Puff Daddy , Puff , Puffy , Diddy and - in a burst of linguistic cunning reminiscent of TS Eliot - P Diddy .
And the reinvention continues with an announcement - sure to cause as much of a furore as Dylan going electric - that he is changing his nom de plume yet again , this time to Sean John .
This particular name change is very much a back - to - basics transformation for Combs as Sean and John are his first and middle given names .
The maverick hip - hop mogul has used this alias for his clothing line and is now using it for his latest fragrance .
"" I have always evolved and taken a different name each time , "" P Diddy / Sean John is quoted as saying in the Sun . ""
Right now I want to be Sean John because that 's where I am right now . ""
However , the change of pseudonym might also be the result of difficulties regarding his previous nickname , P Diddy , which has caused him financial grief .
In 2006 , British courts ordered Combs to pay "" significant damages "" to London DJ / producer Richard "" Diddy "" Dearlove and he was also restricted from trading under the name of Diddy in the UK ."
2008-01-25,"Johnny Depp sounded like Keith Richards in Pirates of the Caribbean .
In this movie , he actually has to sing and the result is a jaunty mix of Anthony Newley and David Bowie .
Depp stars in Tim Burton 's screen version of Stephen Sondheim 's neo - Victorian horror panto Sweeney Todd , for which critical superlatives more appropriate for the Sistine Chapel ceiling have been lavished .
I have to admit to being agnostic ; for me , Sondheim 's music , though forceful and fluent , slides through the mind leaving me with a faint hankering for the vulgar satisfactions of memorable tunes .
Depp plays the malevolent serial - killer barber of legend at large in a gloomy and sepulchral CGI - London of the 1800s or thereabouts ( not dissimilar from the London he inhabited playing the copper on the trail of Jack the Ripper in From Hell ) .
Fifteen years before , his name was Benjamin Barker , a timid , law - abiding hairdresser arrested and sentenced to transportation on a trumped - up charge by the creepy Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ) , who was infatuated with Barker 's comely wife .
Now he has escaped , fetching up back in London and intent on discovering the fate of his wife and daughter .
Vowing revenge on Turpin and an uncaring world , he sets up shop once again under a new moniker , slitting customers ' throats and shoving the bodies downstairs where they make up the secret ingredient in the "" Meat Pies "" offered to the public by Todd 's ally and lover , the hideous Mrs Lovett , played by Helena Bonham Carter .
Depp 's Todd is credibly older and careworn , with dark circles under the eyes , a Cruella De Vil skunk - stripe of grey in the hair , and in general a Scissorhands - y look .
Bonham Carter looks sallow and dishevelled in a similar way .
They are not lovers so much as quasi - siblings , like the White Stripes .
Depp never smiles , is given to gazing broodingly into the middle distance and never seems to make eye - contact with anyone .
It is lively , and there is one tremendous fantasy sequence , brilliantly lit with hyperreal sunshine , in which Mrs Lovett daydreams about a life together with Sweeney by the seaside as a married couple .
But I was repeatedly disconcerted by how muted and even oddly tasteful the proceedings were .
The moment Sacha Baron Cohen came on , playing Todd 's hated enemy , the grotesque Italian barber Signor Pirelli , I grinned with Pavlovian anticipation , and yet there just were n't any funny lines for him to say - or sing .
And there is always something Lionel Bart - ish about quaintly imagined smudgy - faced "" urchins "" played by child actors who look as if they would be more at home taking the opening solo verse of Once in Royal David 's City for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King 's College Cambridge .
There is something in the flattening effect of the CGI work that abolishes the sense of space - and with it , the sense of danger .
The one genuinely unpleasant image comes when we are looking down Todd 's death chute at one of his bodies , which lies broken and spreadeagled below , eyes staring , and arranged asymmetrically in the frame .
For the rest : well , it 's an entertaining , unscary digital ride through the London Dungeon , accompanied by classy music .
Likable : but no masterpiece ."

Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street .
Photograph :
Leah Gallo Something troubled me when I staggered out of Tim Burton 's new film , Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street .
It looked fantastic ( all that smoky Victorian fog is a gift to someone of Burton 's neo - gothic sensibilities ) ; Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter managed to get away with their wafer - thin singing voices ( the former principally by channelling Hunky Dory - era David Bowie ) ; and the fountains of arterial gore did n't bother me at all .
No , what I really hated about Sweeney Todd were the songs .
It was n't what I was expecting .
I 'm no Sondheim maven , nor am I much of a fan of musicals in general .
In fact , the only Sondheim tune I know I 've heard is Send in the Clowns .
But I really was n't prepared for the cavalcade of horribleness that was the Sweeney Todd music .
( I 'm presuming , rightly or wrongly , that it 's been lifted pretty much intact from the stage show . )
Sweeney Todd the film pretty much grinds to a halt whenever the music starts swelling ; the plodding melodies and uninspiring lyrics seeing to that .
( Even the celebrated line "" There 's a hole in the world like a great black pit , and it 's filled with people who are full of shit "" boasts a rhyme that a 10-year - old could have thought up . )
In retrospect , I 'm surprised that Burton left the songs in at all .
The Todd story is colourful and gory enough , you 'd have thought , without the need for such pedestrian warbling .
( Once again , I stress this is not the fault of the performers , who acquit themselves perfectly well .
It 's the songs themselves . )
Burton has grappled with the musical format before , with mixed results : his kiddy animations , The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride , and the Oompa Loompa bits in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory .
Singing brings out the weird , glutinous side of the Burton universe ; it 's as if he ca n't escape the legacy of his former employers Disney , who are of course notorious for foisting terrible Tim Rice tunes on otherwise highly watchable cartoons .
If I 'm being honest , maybe I just do n't like musicals much .
I do n't go and see them on stage , and I only watch the film ones if I absolutely have to .
Occasionally , of course , it 's useless to make the effort to resist .
Stuff like Grease has entered the culture in a big way , and Baz Luhrmann 's Strictly Ballroom ( is it strictly a musical ? ) is a masterpiece of unembarrassed high - camp satire .
Emma Brockes has persuasively put the case for the song - and - dance extravaganza , but I still find the genre difficult to like , especially in its modern incarnation : for every toe - tapper like Cabaret or Bugsy Malone there 's a stinker like Rent or Evita .
People tell me Sondheim has done great stuff in A Little Night Music and Sunday in the Park with George .
I would n't know , but the idea that Sweeney Todd is "" operatic "" , as I have heard some claim , merely demonstrates how low standards in musical theatre must be .
Personally speaking , I still enjoyed Sweeney Todd the movie a great deal .
Edit out the songs and there 's plenty to get excited about .
Every frame is so scrupulously designed that it 's impossible to look away .
Helena Bonham Carter is continuing her experiments in cadaverousness that began so memorably in Fight Club .
Johnny Depp is cementing his place as the best fake Englishman on the planet .
And Burton 's nightmare visions of Victorian London thoroughly overshadow the shambolic efforts of From Hell ( another Depp teabag role , as it happens ) .
Be warned though - bring the earplugs ."
2008-01-26,"Just as the Golden Globe and Oscar noms are being posted for James McAvoy 's breakout hit Atonement , the film that will inevitably catapult him into the stratosphere , some opportunistic distributor has found an embarrassing old unreleased movie called Penelope from his days as a cheapish jobbing actor , and with perfect timing , smeared it all over the screen , guaranteeing maximum embarrassment .
Call it the Laughing Gnome Syndrome : for David Bowie , that was the humiliating rerelease that put a momentary blip in the inexorable rise of Ziggy Stardust .
But Sylvester Stallone might call it the Italian Stallion Syndrome , after the disinterment - precisely during his moment of triumph with Rocky in 1975 - of an old softcore porno he 'd made years earlier to pay the rent .
Penelope 's not the worst picture ever made , but any movie in which Christina Ricci gets to wear a prosthetic piggy - snout is bound to put a ceiling on our expectations .
McAvoy will survive it , but I think a great many actors might actually benefit from having their moments of triumph spoiled by the release of some old dog .
In a week with two new releases about people being haunted by ghosts or memories ( Over Her Dead Body , Things We Lost in The Fire ) , this is the kind of haunting I prefer .
Think of the damage you could do to Things We Lost in The Fire if you were to remind everyone that David Duchovny once appeared in Beethoven ( and not as the dog , sadly ) , or that Benicio Del Toro once toiled as Duck
The Dog - Faced Boy in Big - Top PeeWee .
There 's little we can do to embarrass co - star Halle Berry that she has n't already done ( Gothika ? ) , but elsewhere this week we find a slumming
Jason Lee doing voicework in Underdog , a dreadful movie we should hold back for now , and rerelease when Lee next appears in something half decent .
Underdog is his Laughing Gnome - why waste it now ?
Perhaps the star this week with the most embarrassing blot on his resumÃ© is Alain Delon .
He shows up as Julius Caesar in Asterix At The Olympic Games , but the next time he releases a big star - vehicle of his own , he should be shamed with a revival of the loudest barking dog of his career , The Concorde :
Airport 79 .
So ridiculous and surreal is the cast - the scrag - end of the Arthur Hailey franchise - that you could shame a dozen of its participants by rereleasing it at le moment juste .
It 's sad enough that Delon co - stars with Sylvia Kristel , but the cast is filled with the likes of Robert Wagner , George Kennedy , Eddie Albert , Ingmar Bergman regular Bibi Andersson , Latina icon Charo , gameshow host John Davidson , and real actors like David Warner and Mercedes McCambridge , whose agents deserved the firing - squad for getting them work like this .
At least Delon got to be the pilot .
On the brink of becoming a bonafide movie star , poor McAvoy has suffered the ignominy of playing the love interest to a pig - faced heiress ."
2008-01-26,"Just as the Golden Globe and Oscar noms are being posted for James McAvoy 's breakout hit Atonement , the film that will inevitably catapult him into the stratosphere , some opportunistic distributor has found an embarrassing old unreleased movie called Penelope from his days as a cheapish jobbing actor , and with perfect timing , smeared it all over the screen , guaranteeing maximum embarrassment .
Call it the Laughing Gnome Syndrome : for David Bowie , that was the humiliating rerelease that put a momentary blip in the inexorable rise of Ziggy Stardust .
But Sylvester Stallone might call it the Italian Stallion Syndrome , after the disinterment - precisely during his moment of triumph with Rocky in 1975 - of an old softcore porno he 'd made years earlier to pay the rent .
Penelope 's not the worst picture ever made , but any movie in which Christina Ricci gets to wear a prosthetic piggy - snout is bound to put a ceiling on our expectations .
McAvoy will survive it , but I think a great many actors might actually benefit from having their moments of triumph spoiled by the release of some old dog .
In a week with two new releases about people being haunted by ghosts or memories ( Over Her Dead Body , Things We Lost in The Fire ) , this is the kind of haunting I prefer .
Think of the damage you could do to Things We Lost in The Fire if you were to remind everyone that David Duchovny once appeared in Beethoven ( and not as the dog , sadly ) , or that Benicio Del Toro once toiled as Duck
The Dog - Faced Boy in Big - Top PeeWee .
There 's little we can do to embarrass co - star Halle Berry that she has n't already done ( Gothika ? ) , but elsewhere this week we find a slumming
Jason Lee doing voicework in Underdog , a dreadful movie we should hold back for now , and rerelease when Lee next appears in something half decent .
Underdog is his Laughing Gnome - why waste it now ?
Perhaps the star this week with the most embarrassing blot on his resumÃ© is Alain Delon .
He shows up as Julius Caesar in Asterix At The Olympic Games , but the next time he releases a big star - vehicle of his own , he should be shamed with a revival of the loudest barking dog of his career , The Concorde :
Airport 79 .
So ridiculous and surreal is the cast - the scrag - end of the Arthur Hailey franchise - that you could shame a dozen of its participants by rereleasing it at le moment juste .
It 's sad enough that Delon co - stars with Sylvia Kristel , but the cast is filled with the likes of Robert Wagner , George Kennedy , Eddie Albert , Ingmar Bergman regular Bibi Andersson , Latina icon Charo , gameshow host John Davidson , and real actors like David Warner and Mercedes McCambridge , whose agents deserved the firing - squad for getting them work like this .
At least Delon got to be the pilot .
On the brink of becoming a bonafide movie star , poor McAvoy has suffered the ignominy of playing the love interest to a pig - faced heiress ."
2008-02-15,"A dark flipside to Britpop that proves more influential by the year , a political edge , and a tradition of ambitious live events have catapulted Massive Attack into new territory - that of first band to curate the Meltdown Festival .
Yesterday the chance to be the festival 's artistic directors - following in the footsteps of John Peel , David Bowie , Morrissey , Scott Walker and Jarvis Cocker - was described by founder member Robert del Naja ( alias 3D ) as a "" once in a lifetime "" opportunity .
The nine - day festival , running from June 14 - 22 at London 's newly renovated Southbank Centre , is , says its artistic head , Jude Kelly , a "" live , unhinged version of Desert Island discs "" .
Curators have often used it to honour their heroes .
Last year Cocker had Iggy Pop and the Stooges on his bill ; Morrissey , in 2004 , had Nancy Sinatra .
Massive Attack , whose era - defining 1991 debut , Blue Lines , helped alter the course of British music , have assumed an increasingly political stance , working closely with the Red Cross , Stop the War Coalition , and Oxfam .
Recently band members collaborated with Reprieve , which provides legal help to prisoners .
The band has also has a history of staging gigs in innovative ways , turning them into multimedia events .
Those principles would be applied to the 15th Meltdown , said Del Naja , a founder member of the band with Grant Marshall ( Daddy G ) .
Del Naja suggested the line - up - to include Massive Attack themselves ahead of the release of their fifth album - would hark back to the influential parties their Wild Bunch sound system threw in Bristol in the late eighties .
While their political side would be evident , he said , they were "" slightly concerned about overloading that at the front end - we want every night to be a bit of a party "" .
He added : "" The trick is to balance your own obsessions with the broader appeal . ""
Glenn Max , producer of contemporary culture at the Southbank Centre , said : "" Theirs is a world where psychedelia and punk align , where sensual sophistication and urban grit share equal ground .
All this would be enough , but equally important ... few artists could throw a better party . ""

2008-02-20,"Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner has revealed details of his new project , called the Last Shadow Puppets , and confirmed the group has a debut album ready for a spring release .
In tandem with Miles Kane ( Little Flames , the Rascals ) and with Simian Mobile Disco 's James Ford as producer , Last Shadow Puppets claim inspiration from Scott Walker , David Axelrod and the early work of David Bowie , and their songs are what Domino Records calls "" bold and brassy , full of drama , wit and melody "" .
The Age of the Understatement was recorded near Nantes , France in the summer of 2007 .
Canadian wunderkind Owen Pallett , maitre d ' of Final Fantasy and sideman for Arcade Fire , arranged orchestration for the songs and then conducted recordings by the London Metropolitan Orchestra .
A video trailer for the project shows cluttered , over - exposed film footage over the sound of wind , mumbles and a rising tide of strings .
In short , more art film than Arctic Monkeys .
The album 's title track will be released as a single on April 15 , with the album to follow six days later .
Judging from the disclosed song titles , it does not sound like it will be the soundtrack to a very good dance party .

When I was very small , Top Of The Pops was n't just a chance to hear the latest pop hits but was a visual feast - a weekly parade of stars in increasingly preposterous outfits .
Roy Wood 's Wizzard musicians donned gorilla suits for Top Of The Pops while their leader donned red hair , a big beard and giant stars scrawled across his face .
Slade 's "" Super Yob "" Dave Hill wore a succession of wonderfully daft costumes including one that was described by bandmate Jim Lea as looking like a "" metal nun "" .
Routinely , we would gather around the television to cheer , while parents were generally so appalled at what was on the screen they would consider phoning the police .
Until this week , I thought those days were gone for good , but no , on Sunday night at Leeds Cockpit
I enjoyed a rare sighting of a pop pantomime loon .
His name - or at least his stage name - is Red Dog Consuela .
The keyboardist in bonkers electro - guitar band
Late of the Pier plays a synthesizer on a silver box mounted on an ironing board , performing ballet twirls while wearing a billowing - sleeved silver outfit that makes him look like a cross between pre - outrage Gary Glitter and an oven - ready turkey .
There will surely be some who consider De Consuela to be a living embodiment of the need for National Service .
But for me , Red Dog Consuela is a prince among men , an artist who is not afraid to walk tall - in platform shoes , if need be - and hold his pampered , ridiculously soft rock coiffured head high in the face of ridicule : a peacock of pop .
Pop music has a noble tradition of producing peacocks - easily lampooned , ludicrously outfitted characters who wade nobly into the fields of mad styling so the rest of us can have a thrill and a bloody good laugh .
Almost as pop began , exhibitionist nutters like Screaming Lord Sutch and Little Richard were cavorting in public in various combinations of glitter and sequins , leopard skin jumpsuits and tottering on high heels .
But everything went really peacocky in the glam mad 1970s .
De Consuela 's role model is clearly Roxy Music 's Brian Eno .
The entire Roxy lineup was hardly visually sedate , but Eno went beyond the call of decency by standing beside his VCS3 synthesizer , decked out in blue eye shadow , stack heels , diamante studded dog collars , leopard skin feminine clothing and , not least , feathers that did actually originate from a peacock .
Everyone thinks of David Bowie as the king of all things visual , but compared to some the Thin White Duke was actually quite tame .
Yes , he wore a dress on the cover of The Man Who Sold The World album ( virtually an arrestable offence in 1971 ) .
Yes , he revealed genitalia bulges ( subsequently hurriedly airbrushed out ) in a catsuit on Diamond Dogs , generally looked like an alien and was even singing perched atop a giant spider at the age of 40 .
But he was n't Peter Gabriel of Genesis , who dressed as a giant flower and once went onstage "" wearing "" a papier mache city .
When I was growing up , even the most mainstream stars routinely looked like something from last Christmas 's pantomime season .
Elton - a man who still occasionally flies the peacock flag , dressing up as King Louis the XIV to ceremonially bond with the relatively restrained David Furnish - wore giant spectacles and three - foot - high boots .
Abba looked like they 'd been blasted from an Oxfam outfitters on Mars .
Even during punk - an individualist movement that ironically spawned an identikit sea of leather jackets - there were pantomime loons such as Boomtown Rats ' Johnny Fingers ( pyjamas worn all hours ) and Captain Sensible ( bobbly jumpers that looked like they were made from bathmats , when he wore anything at all ) .
New Romantic threw up Boy George and Steve Strange , who together looked like a cosmetic animal experiment gone wrong .
They looked ridiculous .
I loved them .
I miss those days , when pop was a competition to see who could sound best and look the most daft .
For at least 20 years , give or take the odd Andy Bell in a tutu , Flowered Up 's Barry Mooncult dressed as a daisy or Daft Punk in a spacesuit , it 's been mostly T - shirts and jeans or identical record company stylist - provided "" cool looks "" .
Do n't get me wrong , some of my favourite bands wear nondescript clothing , and the music should come first ( I also really would n't want to see Nick Cave in a tutu , or
The Fall 's Mark E Smith in lurex ) .
But where 's the sense of individualism , or fun ?
This is why De Consuela is arguably one of the most important figures to hit pop since Eno - or at least Mud 's Rob Davis , ( now a top songwriter but once a proud wearer of trousers so wide they resembled a dress .
A genuine character , De Consuela looks like he has rejected all hope of styling in favour of the difficult option of spray painting his pyjamas and adopting a haircut that would have been deemed inadvisable after 1975 .
In the coming months , he will be lampooned , booed , perhaps pelted with urine and almost certainly beaten with a wet fish , but for me - and I hope , many others that will follow his lead - he will be a hero and will hopefully inspire new generations to don their Auntie Elda 's curtains and boogie .
Red Dog Consuela , pop peacock

There are certain artists , like David Bowie and Paul McCartney , who are forever damned with faint praise whenever they release a new album .
Bowie has even joked how everything he releases is greeted with the news it 's his "" best since Scary Monsters "" , while McCartney must be sick of his otput constantly being compared to 1973 's Band on the Run ( not to mention his former band 's output ) .
Much the same can be said of Stevie Wonder .
His last truly critically - acclaimed album was 1980 's Hotter Than July - and even Wikipedia dismiss the years 1979 - 1990 as his "" commercial period "" ; which is clearly intended as a pejorative term , given the preceding years are described as his "" classic period "" .
But hidden amongst the schlocky hits and bizarre infomercial singalongs of that period was the sublime 1987 Characters album .
The album 's main single , Skeletons , was an obvious nod to the synth - driven funk of Superstition , and even appeared on the soundtrack to Die Hard .
Sadly , the attempt to relive past glories was lost on his 80s audience ( despite the rather obvious lyrical theme , one commentator on YouTube seems to have taken the song at face value :
"" It seems like this song would be played on Halloween because of its title .
It 's a good song though for any season . "" )
Despite good reviews and a duet with Michael Jackson (
Get It )
the album was a flop .
In the US , it was his first album for 15 years to miss the top five .
Just as galling , a second Wonder / Jackson duet , Just Good Friends , appeared on Jackson 's Bad - the biggest selling album of the year ( it 's now shifted over 25 m units ) .
Characters contained a number of other compositions that have now become live staples for Wonder - You Will Know , Dark ' n ' Lovely
, My Eyes Do n't Cry - but he 'd learned his lesson .
A proposed Characters Vol 2 was shelved and , according to sources , he 's still working on his best album since Hotter Than July ..."
2008-03-14,"Scarlett Johansson , star of Lost in Translation and Girl With a Pearl Earring , reveals her debut album ....
of Tom Waits covers .
Johansson was in London recently to launch Anywhere I Lay Me Head , which features a guest appearance from David Bowie .
Speaking in a candle - lit room at private members club the Hospital , a surprisingly nervous Johansson ( right ) explained to us how she was offered the chance to record an album after joining the Jesus and Mary Chain on backing vocals at last year 's Coachella festival , and , toyed with various ideas , including Cole Porter covers , before settling settled on a set of Waits covers .
Initial recordings with a group of session musicians were aborted , she said , as ' they sounded terrible , like fake Tom Waits records with my voice on it ' .
A mutual friend then put her in touch with David Sitek , from Brooklyn band TV on the Radio , and the pair decamped to Louisiana with the aim , as Sitek puts it , of creating something ' that sounds like we drank a lot of cough medicine and saw Tinkerbell ' .
Anywhere I Lay My Head , is billed as a collaboration between Johansson and Sitek , and of the 11 tracks , ten are written by Waits ( below ) , or Waits and his wife , Kathleen Brennan , and one track , ' Song For Jo ' , is an original track written by Johansson and Sitek .
The result is a pretty leftfield album , with a layered , cinematic sound reminiscent of the late Eighties output of British label 4AD , on which Johansson 's voice evokes Cocteau Twins ' Liz Fraser .
David Bowie , who starred alongside the actress in The Prestige , contributes backing vocals on two tracks , Â­'Falling Down ' and ' Fannin ' Street ' .
Writing on his blog , Bowie enthused about Johansson 's album : ' The songs are great , and the songs are great , really good Tom Waits stuff , and Scarlett 's performances are mystical and twice cool .
She creates a mood that could have been summoned by someone like Margery Latimer or Jeanette Winterson . '

2008-03-16,"The Clash at the original Rock Against Racism Carnival in 1978 Three decades after it politicised a generation of music fans , Rock Against Racism is returning next month with the biggest anti - racism concert ever held in the UK .
The huge gig will be restaged at the same venue as the original festival - Victoria Park in east London - on Sunday 27 April and expects to attract 70,000 fans .
Rock Against Racism was originally conceived as a one - off concert in response to alleged racist comments by David Bowie and Eric Clapton 's declaration of support for Enoch Powell .
The 1978 concert featured the Clash , the Buzzcocks , the Tom Robinson Band , X - Ray Spex , the Ruts , Sham 69 and Steel Pulse .
The 2008 line - up is still being finalised , but confirmed acts as OMM went to press include Babyshambles , the Paddingtons , Roll Deep ( who released ' Racist People ' last year , as part of the LoveMusicHateRacism campaign ) , Patrick Wolf , Nihal and Benga .
A few of the old guard will also be returning to the stage , including original headliner Tom Robinson , and the Specials ' Jerry Dammers , who will be pulling together a band including former Sham 69 frontman Jimmy Pursey .
Lee Billingham , national organiser for Love Music Hate Racism , told OMM : ' Thirty years on from the original event , we wanted to celebrate what was achieved .
Rock Against Racism was a very underrated political movement , and was hugely influential , along with the Anti - Nazi League , in stopping the rise of the BNP in the late Seventies .
Unfortunately , we 've actually got a bigger problem than we had then , with the rise of fascism over the past five years , and it 's vital that we have a huge event in London , prior to the London Assembly Elections , to send out a message . ' '
It may be easy to be complacent , ' says Pete Doherty , who will appear with Babyshambles , ' but we need to encourage people to fight racism with words or actions . '
Entry to the carnival is free , but donations are welcomed .
More headliners will be added in coming weeks .

2008-04-13,"My mum died at Christmas and , right now , I do n't recognise the world .
We were a very close Jewish family and she was the linchpin .
Women are a fairly necessary part of a man 's life .
My dad still lives up the road , in Wembley , north London , and I 'm teaching him to cook and generally cope without her .
I 'm just pleased we were together when she died .
I sang David Bowie 's ' Wild is the Wind ' and stroked her belly as she went .
It was our favourite Bowie song .
I think that 's probably as lovely as death gets .
Oddly enough , my first celebrity crush was n't a girl .
It was David Bowie .
I used to go to this fish shop in Nottingham when I was an art student there .
It had an orange wall , like the colour on the Low cover .
I 'd sit for hours in profile at this table waiting for a girl to come in , buy a bag of chips and think I was Bowie .
He 's a beautiful man .
I loved him .
Then there was Linda Green .
I took her to see Grease on our first date .
I had braces and I could feel a snog coming
so I ran to the loo and never came back .
To this day , I have only ever seen the first 10 minutes of Grease .
I was terrified she was going to rip her tongue .
She got into Queen
so I went off her pretty quickly .
My twin sister is an hour older and fantastic .
We used to dress up as geisha girls and go to taboo clubs because we looked the same , lots of make - up and long hair .
Then I started shaving .
But she got to snog Bowie .
I could n't believe it .
We 'd got tickets for a concert in 1982 .
I was ill
so I gave mine to her boyfriend .
After the show they followed his car , shouting his name down the street .
He walked over , sat on the car bonnet and French - kissed her .
She sat by the phone for six months waiting for him to call .
It completely screwed her up - she was about to do her A - levels and she went mad .
All in all , a bad time for us both .
Luckily , he did n't ring otherwise she would n't have met her husband and we would n't be talking .
I 'm married now , so sis is off the hook .
I fell for my wife after seeing her being thrown out of a dining room by her father for being drunk and disorderly .
We were 18 and both living in a Jewish kibbutz in Tel Aviv .
I started leaving paintings and twigs outside her door like a daft teenager and , one day , I came back and found a little soldier , suited and booted , in my cupboard .
She had run away from the army .
We got married and came back to England .
Nine years later , after our first kid was born , we split up .
Then , seven years ago , we got back together .
The split was very acrimonious but during the gap we got our careers together .
We never divorced ; I do n't think we ever stopped loving each other .
We 're very happy now .
I love the idea of love .
I went to Venice as a teenager and took a copy of The Magus .
I spent the whole time lying around looking ridiculous , as if I was in the book .
I do n't see a divide between life and art .
When I started doing my Dennis Pennis character on TV , it felt like an extension of my life .
He was my psychic bin and , as I was having some problems in Tel Aviv , it seemed like a good idea .
But I hated doing it .
Now it 's family , sanity and work in that order , especially since my mum 's gone .
My wife 's mum 's a widow and still lives in a kibbutz in Israel 's Negev Desert .
She has a golf caddie cart for visiting her husband 's grave and is always up there , rain or shine , cleaning it .
I think that says so much that , after death , the women of the kibbutz will always make the stones of their loved ones look respectable .
That 's a good metaphor for relationships .

2008-04-15,"Chrysalis , the music publisher of works by Estelle , Gnarls Barkley and David Bowie , has allegedly rejected a bid from EMI and ended talks with other potential buyers , blaming the credit crunch for hampering suitors ' ability to offer good enough bids .
The 40-year - old company had attracted interest from a host of trade and private equity predators keen to tap into the least volatile sector of the music industry .
It told the market yesterday it had rejected an offer from one unnamed party for 155p a share , or Â£ 104 m , because that bid had "" significantly undervalued "" the business .
The decision to reject the offer came after discussions with shareholders in the firm , which analysts had said could be worth as much as 230p a share .
Chrysalis shares fell 15 % to 115.25p .
The offer was understood to be from EMI , the record labels and music publishing firm run by the venture capitalist Guy Hands .
He was keen for Chrysalis 's collection of back catalogues , including works by Blondie and Jethro Tull , to be added to EMI 's vast collection of song rights .
Chrysalis explained that potential suitors had been unable to raise enough money to pay a fair price to co - founder Chris Wright and other shareholders owing to the turmoil in the money markets .
Sources indicated there was no shortage of funding options , but that EMI believed 155p was a fair price .
Last year , Chrysalis sold its radio arm , which includes the Heart brand and London talk station LBC , to private investors led by the former ITV head Charles Allen .
It said then it would focus on the music labels and publishing business remaining , but in December announced it was in discussions with "" select parties "" - thought to include EMI , Warner Chappell , the music - publishing unit of Warner Music , and Sony / ATV ."
2008-04-17,"For decades fans have been trading bootlegs of David Bowie 's October 20 , 1972 gig at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium .
Now , at last , they 'll have the chance to pay him for a copy .
David Bowie , Live Santa Monica ' 72 will be officially released on June 30 on CD and double vinyl .
The concert catches the Ziggy Stardust era at its highest clamour .
"" I can tell that I 'm totally into being Ziggy by this stage of our touring , "" Bowie said in a statement this week .
"" It 's no longer an act ; I am him . ""
Note to Bowie :
It was still an act .
You were never , we 're afraid , an actual Martian .
And yet you certainly knew how to rock out .
The bootleg has been a favourite among Bowie collectors as it was the first concert to be broadcast live on FM radio in the US , attracting attention well beyond the 3,000 fans in attendance at the arena . ""
This would be around the 10th American show for us and you can hear that we are all pretty high on ourselves , "" Bowie said .
"" We trainwreck a couple of things , I miss some words and sometimes you would n't know that pianist Mike Garson was onstage with us but overall I really treasure this bootleg .
Mick Ronson is at his blistering best . ""
Besides a raft of Ziggy songs , the gig also features a cover of the Velvet Underground 's
I 'm Waiting for the Man , and Jacques Brel 's My Death .

2008-04-19,"The death warrant was signed last month on another of London 's old music haunts , the Astoria .
After more than 30 years steeped in musical history , the knell sounded for the venue , which has hosted everyone from David Bowie to Nirvana to Radiohead , when the Mayor of London confirmed that the construction of a Crossrail terminal at Tottenham Court Road meant the Astoria could not be saved .
Conciliatory noises have been made about a new , bigger , better and cleaner venue in the station complex .
What 's not needed , say fans of the Astoria , is another homogeneous box in which to listen to bands while sipping over - priced beer .
What is needed is a little more respect for the spit ' n ' sawdust venues of old that are thick with a satisfying fug of spilled beer , sweat and rock history .
This is just the latest instalment in a sorry story of decline ; it is the obverse to the much - vaunted success of the O2 .
Also last month , the tiny , sweaty and much - loved Bull and Gate pub in north London was put up for sale by the owners who are retiring , and in February the Marquee Club was finally put out of its misery - it had in recent years been practically nomadic and successively replaced by upmarket eateries and shopping centres wherever it went .
In the East End , the Spitz above the Old Spitalfields Market was ejected in October last year and is currently homeless .
The singer Beth Orton makes a point on the venue 's website that could be generally applied : ' In these days of bland , wholesale corporate homogenisation we need truly independent music venues like the Spitz more than ever .
If the Spitz closes it will be ... a sure sign that London is on the way to becoming a glorified shopping mall . '
Beyond London , the Point in Cardiff , which has played host to the Stereophonics , the Manic Street Preachers and Super Furry Animals , is under threat after complaints over noise from inhabitants of new luxury flats nearby means the venue 's owners must go to court .
This follows the closure of the Coal Exchange and Toucan Club in the city .
In Glasgow , the Riverside Club , an alternative music venue in which Mylo put on his early nights , closed last year .
It 's not entirely doom and gloom though , as Be Rozzo , managing director of promotions at the Mama Group , which owns the Barfly venues , the Jazz CafÃ© , Hammersmith Apollo and the Forum in Kentish Town , points out . '
Venues come and go all the time , ' he says .
' We 're refurbishing the Forum , which is a listed heritage building ; we 've replaced all the seating and put in a state of the art PA .
We 've also purchased the old Caledonian Picture House in Edinburgh where Pink Floyd , Mott the Hoople and Genesis played in its heyday , and the Institute in Birmingham , formerly the Sanctuary . '
The final gig , by the Fall , at the Hammersmith Palais in April 2007 in many ways prefigured the new broom sweeping through Britain 's venues .
The building was condemned and demolished to make way for an office and shopping complex .
As the Clash sang in 1978 's ' ( White Man )
In Hammersmith Palais : ' The new groups are not concerned / With what there is to be learned /
They got Burton suits , ha you think it 's funny / Turning rebellion into money . '"
2008-04-26,"It is likely to be one of the oldest casts ever assembled for a British stage production , featuring a subject not normally broached when life in an old people 's home is tackled : sex .
All that with a soundtrack of songs by Nick Cave and David Bowie sung live by a choir with a combined age approaching 1,000 .
Love , a musical , is the latest work by one of Europe 's most exciting theatre ensembles , the Icelandic company Vesturport .
They have previously dazzled UK audiences with an aerial Romeo and Juliet , an underwater Woyzeck and an upside down Metamorphosis , and next month return with a new co - production with London 's Lyric Hammersmith which examines passion and romance and sex among the over-70s .
As well as a core professional team of veteran character actors including 75-year - old Dudley Sutton ( perhaps still best known as Lovejoy 's sidekick Tinker Dill ) and 78-year - old Maria Charles ( Maureen Lipman 's overbearing mother in the sitcom Agony ) , there will be a 15-strong choir which has been brought together from local residents in Hammersmith .
"" They all have great voices , "" said director David Farr .
"" They 've been coming to coffee mornings for the last three months and going through songs with two guys in their 20s .
They 're absolutely vital to the production . ""
The choir , whose ages range from 62 to 83 , were recruited after the Lyric put up adverts in community centres and old people 's homes .
They will be on stage the entire time , although the size of the choir might change night to night - it is a 24-performance run .
Farr was reluctant to give too much away but he did confirm they would be singing songs by the likes of Cave , Bowie and the Rolling Stones . ""
The show is a celebration of the things old people are still denied , like desire and sex , "" said Farr .
That area of life still seems to be a taboo in this country , more than Iceland .
"" It 's about two people who fall in love , a kind of Romeo and Juliet in reverse .
Against the wishes of their family they start a romance and sexual relationship .
"" Love has been written by Vesturport actor and director GÃ­sli Ãrn Gardarsson who worked in an Icelandic old people 's home in the 1990s .
He said : "" It is one of the most important shows I have done because the issues are real .
It was all there in front of my eyes .
And it celebrates life .
What if you experience the greatest love of your life when you 're 70 ?
What else can you do but sing about it ?
"" It is the second co - production between the Lyric and Vesturport following Metamorphosis in 2006 .
The Guardian 's theatre critic Michael Billington gave the radical staging of the Kafka classic five stars .
It featured an acrobatic Gardarsson hanging from the ceiling .
"" It 's pushing and exploring something else in terms of what theatre can be , "" said Farr , who has been artistic director at the Lyric Hammersmith for nearly three years .
"" We want to break the boundaries of what people expect . ""
A version of Love is already a hit in Iceland and an adaptation is about to open in Korea .
There are fans of Vesturport across the world , including Mexican film star Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal .
He reportedly liked Metamorphosis at Hammersmith so much he agreed to appear in Gardarsson 's staging of Together , an adaptation of the Lukas Moodysson film , in Reykjavik and then Mexico earlier this year . Â·

2008-05-22,"I think we can all take the rest of the day - hell , the rest of the fricking MONTH off because , truly , a great event has transpired :
David Bowie and Paul Weller have ended their long - running feud .
Children , take to the streets with your Union Jack flags , it 's like VE Day round here !
That certainly seems to be the consensus over at the Sun where the unfailingly insightful Bizarre leads on the story with the headline "" Bowie Buries Hatchet "" , which must rank up there with "" War Declared "" and "" America Attacked "" in the school of truly historical moments captured by journalism .
Apparently the two have slagged each other off in the past .
But in this month 's issue of rocker dad mag , Mojo , Weller says something nice and - oh , I really ca n't go on with this .
Did anyone know that they were fighting ?
Did anyone care ?
Does anyone care about either of these persons anymore anyway ?

2008-05-22,"A quiet legend before he was even out of his teens , Steve Winwood is one of a handful of musicians who shaped the way rock sounds .
His hits with the Spencer Davis Group , Traffic and Blind Faith repurposed blues and soul with pop tunes and structures ; his influence can be heard in anything from Prince to Paul Weller .
Yet unlike peers such as David Bowie , Eric Clapton , or Lou Reed , he has never been public property .
Now 60 , he just gets on with making music .
His latest release , Nine Lives , is an album with the feel - good looseness of his 1960s heyday and the melodic appeal of his 1980s solo hits .
Winwood takes the Scala stage with a band diverse in age and race .
Brit - jazz saxophonist Paul Booth is the rookie , turning in gutsy performances on tenor and taking over Winwood 's keyboards when the leader plays guitar .
Their set includes a generous dose of new material written with former Metro lyricist Peter Godwin : the African - influenced Hungry Man , the backyard guitar blues of I 'm Not Drowning , the jazz - dance groove of Secrets , the mellow , radio - friendly Fly , and the slow and heavy Dirty City , with guitarist JosÃ© Neto happily blasting out the parts that Clapton plays on the album .
Drummer Richard Bailey ( once Jeff Beck 's secret weapon ) switches easily between rock , Afrobeat and Caribbean rhythms , while Karl van den Bossche 's congas supercharge the grooves .
Winwood rocks , but there is always space to breathe .
There is something magical and spine - chilling about the blend of his high voice - raw but never ragged - with the swelling richness of his Hammond organ chords .
The simple , thrilling techniques that worked in early hits such as Keep On Runnin ' still sound sweet in the new songs .
And the closing Gimme
Some Lovin' brings the house down ."
2008-05-26,"Jorge MÃ¡rio da Silva , aka Seu ( "" Mr "" )
Jorge , may be the only man in the world who looks cool playing a flute .
Back in London after a two - year absence to herald the release of both a new album , AmÃ©rica Brasil , and a film , The Escapist , in which he stars alongside Joseph Fiennes , the Brazilian musician and actor did much to retain his reputation , first mooted by Brazilian Vogue , as "" the coolest man on the planet "" .
Jorge leapt to international recognition in the 2002 film City of God , while a turn in Wes Anderson 's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and its soundtrack - featuring his Portuguese cover versions of David Bowie tracks - kept him in the public eye .
Loping on stage in a slim - fitting velvet jacket and checked yellow tie , his dreads pulled into a ponytail , Jorge began on semi - acoustic guitar .
His covers of Bowie 's Rebel Rebel and Life on Mars were intense and impassioned , proving that his laidback style does not rob him of emotional conviction .
Backed by a seven - piece band - tight - knit , funky and beaming - came AmÃ©rica do Norte , a track from the new album : a rolling , blues - tinged hoedown featuring both violin and squeaky Brazilian culca drum .
Jorge took up the flute for Mina do CondomÃ­nio , a slice of exuberant samba - funk , and a reggae - tinged rendition of Mas Que Nada soon had the predominantly Brazilian audience on their feet .
Jorge then disappeared while two of his drummers kept the audience entertained with a virtuosic percussion display .
On his return , he never quite regained that Mas Que Nada high .
Some sexy , louche samba kept the Brazilians whooping and shimmying , but Mariana edged too close to middle - of - the - road .
For tonight 's audience , to whom he gave three ecstatic encores , he could do no wrong , but the world 's coolest flute - player may have to work a little harder to win new fans ."

2008-06-16,"The moment when the mud stuck to talk of "" change "" and "" choice "" in politics was in mid-2006 , when Armando Iannucci 's Time Trumpet synched speeches by Tony Blair and David Cameron to David Bowie 's Changes . ""
Change "" and "" choice "" had become the c - words of Labour 's early reign , and they are now slapped on to any initiative or policy the government or the opposition wish to sell .
If you really want to effect change , you have to let things happen that are outside your control .
If you really want to give people "" choice "" , some of those choices must be things you do not , yourself , favour .
Labour has proven itself incapable of recognising these simple truths .
Take eco - towns - the germ of a visionary and wonderful idea that many communities would seize on .
They would challenge the basic premise , take different approaches to solve the same problems - why are some of the proposed sites on greenfield and protected land ?
Why do they have to be new developments at all ?
How will the inhabitants of existing towns get to work ?
When you question an idea , you uncover its flaws , fix them , and make it stronger .
But because eco - towns will spring up fully formed as the result of central edicts , local environmentalists , retired headteachers , wildlife trusts and even Lib Dem parliamentary candidates have had to take up arms against them .
Take the case of Micheldever in Hampshire , described by the Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Winchester , Martin Tod , as an "" un - eco eco - town "" , a greenwash proposal instantly taken up by local developers in a scramble to revive a failed 1970s project , which would put huge pressures on the existing transport networks of the region .
After four months ' intense campaigning , including the largest anti eco - town petition in the country , the government dropped Micheldever from its proposal list .
Outcomes : a washed - up project , a lot of angry people who wo n't be so sanguine about "" environmental "" causes next time , and private developers deterred after nearly a year 's encouragement .
Labour has managed to turn some of the most environmentally aware demographics in the UK against an environmental project .
Deprived of the opportunity to question and amend , they had no choice but to oppose .
This is an absurd triumph for authoritarian centralism .
Labour has come to believe that the imposition of Westminster bubble solutions will provide change and choice .
Look at the stark difference between Ed Balls ' enthusiastic embrace of localism in 2002 and his heavy - handed school reform package announced this week .
Anything goes , so long as we 've thought of it first and provided guidelines for its implementation .
Pick a choice , any choice , so long as it 's this one - eco - towns , primary care trusts , PFI , city academies , special status schools , polyclinics ...
The point is not that any of these things are bad ideas .
Some are good ideas , in whole or in part .
Nor is the point that private provision is always a disaster .
It is n't .
The point is that a dangerous belief in the virtues of uniformity drives each and every one of these initiatives .
Labour will never perceive the subtle irony of a system that purports to provide "" choice "" being imposed on people who do n't want that system .
The two boxes none of us are ever allowed to tick are the ones that say "" YES "" or "" NO "" , which is why we 'll have to do it at the next election instead .
And the truly heartbreaking thing is - whisper it - we do want change .
That current of feeling that Labour picked up on over the mid-1990s is still there , and all the stronger for being unsatisfied .
It 's just that Labour 's methods for providing it have frightened us off .
We 're in danger of electing a Conservative party for whom change means reversal .
They cling to comfortingly retro policies like enforcing the wearing of blazers in schools , and make mumsy - sounding pronouncements on the state of the economy that , frightened by 10 years of "" change "" and "" choice "" , we are meant to find soothing : "" They did n't mend the roof when the sun was shining "" .
It 's change as restoration rather than advance .
The Tories ' bossiness might be a mirror image of Labour 's micromanagement , but at least they have the decency to keep the velvet gloves on .
The language of change and choice is used to market the same tired old top - down dogma , which leaves those advocating genuinely radical and experimental measures with some delicate semantic line - walking to do .
For all that I wince when Nick Clegg mentions the word "" change "" , there really is no other way of putting it .
The only way to guarantee the change and choice we aspired to in the 1990s and still timidly aspire to now , is to devolve , devolve and devolve again .
Give individuals and institutions spending power and let them think for themselves about their own circumstances and problems .
This leads to natural experimentation and improvement , a proper socio - political ecosystem as opposed to a hothouse .
Yes , it would result in some areas pursuing policies inimical to Labour- say , a locally elected health board keeping small GP surgeries open .
And yes , it would also result in some places pursuing policies inimical to many CiF commenters - sorry , guys - say , a hospital engaging a private company to provide some of its services .
In both cases , good .
Today 's public services are the outcome of 30 years of "" We need ... ! ""
thinking .
The only way to break the cycle is to stop telling health and education institutions how to run themselves , to fund them amply , and to let them get on with it .
And that requires - well , the c - word ."
2008-06-26,"The famous 1972 Ziggy Stardust tour was the moment when , according to Bowie 's sleevenotes , the former Brixton boy called Jones is no longer playing his legendary character : "" I am him . ""
This requires a pinch of salt until you hear this extraordinary former radio broadcast , now issued in a lovely box with original reviews .
With guitarist Mick Ronson in his pomp and the band racing on adrenaline , many of the superbly recorded 17 songs atre at least equal to their studio versions .
The occasional unwelcome tape splice does n't stop Bowie sounding thrillingly possessed , whether reaching out in Rock'n'Roll Suicide to tell an alienated generation "" You 're not alone ! "" or asking for "" pliers , or a strong hand "" in a voice so unearthly it could be from a seance ."
2008-06-26,"Seu Jorge is a curiosity .
He 's one of Brazil 's finest singers but is becoming better known for his second career as an actor .
And though he 's an impressive songwriter , he 's famous for his highly individual treatment of David Bowie songs in Portuguese .
Now , for those confused about his identity , comes a new album that is both inventive , commercial and still distinctively Brazilian , despite the title and despite the blues , rock and funk influences mixed in with the samba .
The opening America do Norte shows what he can do .
It 's a furious , stirring song driven by a simple but effective rhythmic backing from the ukulele - like cavaquinho and squeaky cuica drum , with some wild violin work from Jr Gaiotto , who calms down a little to provide the bluesy harmonica on the second track .
Jorge 's vocals are languid and gently gutsy , and his songs range from the light and funky Mina do Condominio to the gently laid - back ballad Mariana .
There are moments where he veers towards the mainstream , as with the easy - going Seu Olhar , or sounds so laidback that he 's almost off - key , but this is his best album to date ."
2008-07-06,"Pop stars reinventing themselves is not a new phenomenon .
David Bowie relaunched himself as Ziggy Stardust and then became the Thin White Duke .
Kylie Minogue was the girl next door who suddenly acquired a taste for black basques .
But few transformations have been as total as the one that has taken Katy Perry to the top of the US singles charts .
Perry , 23 , began her career with a collection of Christian gospel songs .
Her parents are both Protestant pastors , so many of her former fans are astonished to find her topping the charts now with a single celebrating the pleasures of a lesbian kiss . '
I Kissed a Girl ' is poised to be the hit of the American summer and is the 1,000th number one since Bill Haley and His Comets ' shocked the music business with ' Rock Around the Clock ' in 1955 .
The lyrics are mild enough : ' I kissed a girl / and I liked it ...
Us girls
we are so magical / Soft skin , red lips , so kissable / Hard to resist so touchable / Too good to deny it . '
Perry 's background has led to consternation from the Evangelical Christian community . '
What a sad picture of a lost child who has been swept away by the carnal pleasures of the world , ' reads one entry on the Christian website Planetwisdom.com . '
We need to be lifting this gal up in prayer .
While we 're at it , let 's toss up a prayer for her parents , too .
Not to mention the countless young girls who will buy into this lesbian chic message . '
Perry says her parents , who once banned rock music from the home , are now supportive of her despite the new musical direction . '
Well , I 'm not strung out on crack and doing centrefolds , ' she said last week .
This is not the singer 's first foray into edgy areas of sexuality .
Perry 's last single , ' Ur So Gay ' , poured scorn on effeminate metrosexual males and , in particular , on Perry 's ex - boyfriend who ' wore more make - up ' than she did . '
I hope you hang yourself with your H&amp;M scarf , ' was one of the more memorable lines .
In an interview with the New Gay magazine , she described the dilemma for girls dating in 2008 as comparable to being thrown into a lion 's den of ' who 's on this team and who 's on that team ? ' '
I was dating this boy who was very metrosexual , I always end up with these guys who are very sensitive and good - looking and clean - cut and smell good .
But this one in particular , I thought , "" In another life , you are a gay man "" . '
It is all a long way from the Santa Barbara church where she got her first taste of performance .
In 2001 she released Katy Hudson - her real name - on a Christian music label .
She was judged by religious groups to be an ideal vehicle for reaching out to teenage girls with songs of faith and devotion .
But she soon came to the attention of The Matrix - the managers behind stars Avril Lavigne and Ricky Martin .
Overnight Katy Hudson became Katy Perry , described recently by Sheila Marikar of ABC News as ' a hip - shaking , lingerie - wearing , pseudo - lesbian pop star ' .
Joe Levy , the editor of Blender magazine said : ' She did n't transition - she stopped dead , reinvented herself , became an artist who has nothing to do with Christian music .
It looks like who she is now is who she wants to be , slightly outrageous and very cute . '
Some gay activists are less enthusiastic . '
I Kissed A Girl ' should not be considered third - wave feminism , but ' good , old - fashioned woman - using ' by a woman who ' feminises and demonises men who drive electric cars and do n't eat meat ' , says Fatemah Fakhraie of the magazine Feministe .
Perry is unfazed by the criticism and has a simple explanation for why she wrote the song : ' The fact of the matter is that girls , a lot of the time , smell much better than boys .
We smell like vanilla .
We smell like watermelon .
We smell like strawberries .
So , duh !
One day I was with my boyfriend and I opened up a magazine and realised , "" You know what , honey , I would probably make out with Angelina Jolie if she wanted to "" . '
It does n't matter if you 're female or male , if the right woman walks through the door , everybody 's jaw is going to be on the floor . '"
2008-08-05,"Many great cities are celebrated for their art and culture but only a select few come with their own soundtrack .
From Kurt Weil to Bertolt Brecht , Lou Reed to Iggy Pop , Nick Cave to the minimal techno DJs currently ruling the roost , our image of Berlin is shaped by the ambitious music created there .
But for a generation of music lovers , the spirit of David Bowie bestrides the landscape of Berlin more than any other musician .
At the peak of his career in the mid - to - late seventies , Bowie lived and played in the city , working on three albums .
Those three years , when Bowie lived in a flat with Iggy Pop have passed into rock folklore , and yet despite the massive changes undertaken in the preceding decades , much of Bowie 's Berlin remains , while the adventurous spirit that drew him there is as strong as ever .
What to see : Hansa Studio Tour Bowie recorded at the famous Hansa Studios , not far from the reconstructed Potsdamer Platz .
The studio - which used to overlook the Wall - remains operational and it is surprisingly relaxed about letting people visit .
Small tours take you into the oak - panelled Tonstudio 2 , where Bowie recorded Low and Heroes , and produced The Idiot for Iggy Pop .
You are invited into a back room to examine a book of newspaper cuttings and to chat with the staff .
The place is no museum , however .
It 's a working recording studio : Supergrass recorded there last year and Snow Patrol were upstairs during my visit .
How to see it You can also visit the Hansa Studios with Fritz Music Tours ( prices from â¬ 15pp ) , a four - hour drive around the city conducted by the effervescent Thilo , a former recording engineer .
In a six - seater minibus , Thilo careers around the city , talking at a mile - a - minute , while playing you snatches of Bowie and Iggy on the way to the pair 's old flat ( Hauptstrasse 155 ) in ShÃ¶neberg ( where he tells you the delightful story of the current occupier who has never heard of the famous duo ) before taking you for a swift drink in Neues Ufer - formerly
Anderes Ufer - ( Hauptstrasse 157 ) , the legendary gay cafe where the pair used to hang out and where a portrait of Bowie remains .
Thilo 's a passionate guy , he knows most of the people who helped produce the soundtrack of Berlin , and he 'll give wry advice on where 's current in the city 's ever - changing scene .
Where to stay The Hotel Ellington has experienced as many ch - ch - changes as Bowie himself .
Built in the 1920s it has hosted an infamous Weimar - era nightclub , entertained the Nazis , been bombed to hell and been the offices of an insurance company .
But it also has a musical heritage to rival any hotel in LA .
In 1949 , when the surrounding area was occupied by US troops , the cellar played host to the Badewanne club , famous for its regular performances by Count Basie , Dizzy Gillespie , Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington ( their black and white photographs now adorn the hotel ) .
In the seventies , it reopened as Dschungel , Berlin 's answer to Studio 54 , replete with female bouncers ( who once turned away Sly Stallone ) and a regular clientele that included Bowie , Iggy Pop , Lou Reed and , later , Nick Cave .
The fall of the wall and the rise of techno left Dschungel behind , and it closed in 1993 .
The Ellington then lay vacant until it re - opened as a chic design hotel with many of the art deco features intact , including a magnificent green and white tile staircase .
True to its roots , it hosts regular jazz concerts in the bar ( doubles from â¬ 90pn ) .
Where to hang out Little has changed since the days of Iggy and Bowie in S036 , the legendary venue in Kreuzberg the pair often frequented .
Then the club rivalled New York 's CBGBs as one of the finest new - wave venues in the world .
It remains a fixture on the Berlin music scene championing new artists , while staying true to its punk past .
Today the area around Oranienstrasse , east of Moritzplatz and down towards Kottbusser Tor , is redolent of those heady days , when Kreuzberg was a Turkish enclave behind the Wall .
Artful graffiti sits alongside designer shops as surviving examples of the district 's working class roots .
There 's also a palpable lack of anything too corporate and an admirable collection of old fishmongers , button stores and a delightful shop selling objects made by the blind : all wooden cabinets , baskets and brushes .
Where to go drinking Kreuzberg remains a place of punks , graffiti and politics ( handbills emblazoned with signs shout "" Stop gentrification ! "" ) and it 's also home to many communities of gays and Turks , trendies and crusties , thinkers and drinkers .
Most meet at Luzia , ( Oranienstrasse 34 ) , a converted butcher 's shop , where to my delight they were actually playing Iggy Pop at volume .
Luzia is decorated with wall paintings , thrift - shop furniture , and crystal chandeliers .
Aside from the old Iggy records , it serves an extremely eclectic programme of DJs and live acts .
The musical programme crosses techno , bluegrass and indie .
Where to eat For such famous people , Iggy and Bowie lived relatively modestly in Berlin .
When they wanted to push the boat out , they often ate at the Paris Bar , an expensive French cafe in upscale Charlottenburg .
The restaurant is the scene of an infamous Rolling Stone interview where the journalist described the cafe as a scene from Degas ' The Absinthe Drinkers and Iggy got so drunk he ended up rolling around in the ice outside .
You will spy few absinthe drinkers at the bar today â it is far more glamorous â but the place retains an air of bohemian bliss .
Thanks largely to the art collection donated by Martin Kippenberger , himself a famous painter .
In 1993 Kippenberger chose the bar ( and his collection ) as the subject for this painting , now owned by Charles Saatchi .
Where to buy the soundtrack For Bowie - era records , head back west to Charlottenburg for Rock Steady Records and its archive of over 10,000 vinyl LPs .
It 's just two blocks from the Ellington .
Kreuzberg 's Hardwax is the place for the minimal techno and microhouse , and also has a huge back catalogue of Chicago house and dub reggae .
Back on Oranienstrasse , Core Tex approximates the punkier sounds coming out of S036 , while the more boutique Downbeat Reggae Store ( Oranienstrasse 44 ) offers an excellent selection of rare groove and mixtapes .
Where to go clubbing The clubs may have changed but the city 's nightlife is no less vibrant than in Bowie 's heyday .
Yet , despite its musical heritage , Berlin is the least showy of cities .
You have to actively seek the coolest places in town , like some urban equivalent of an orienteer .
Nothing is obvious .
Take the best club at the moment .
There are no neon lights , no red velvet rope , no carpet outside Weekend , a 15th - floor club atop an anonymous office block in Alexanderplatz , the Soviet - era square in the centre of the former east .
Instead , there is a small queue at ground level leading to a set of lifts that whisk you up 15 floors .
They open practically straight on to the dancefloor , which is dominated by a massive electronic screen .
On the 17th floor is a roof terrace overlooking Alexanderplatz and the tall and elegant TV tower .
Alternatively , over on the western side is the more lounge - like Solar , a 15th floor restaurant and club with panoramic views over the floodlit ruins of the Anhalter Bahnhof : once the largest train station in Europe .
Again , it takes some finding : hidden down a side courtyard it sits above an apartment block .
The music is more mainstream house , but the bar mixes a mean mojito .

2008-08-23,"In 1975 , Paul Beahm , a 17-year - old , high - school dropout from West Los Angeles , whose brother had been murdered over a drug deal and whose stepfather had died unexpectedly three years earlier , devised a plan to make himself immortal .
The plan would have the timeframe of his hero David Bowie 's apocalyptic anthem ' Five Years ' .
It went like this : Beahm would form a band with his mates , spend a couple of years making it a cultish , outrageous live act , release one great album and then commit suicide to secure his legend .
Beahm proved himself as good as his word .
His band , the Germs , with Beahm performing under the name Darby Crash , were , for a while , the most infamous punk band on the West Coast .
By 1978 , their appearances were occasions of such mayhem that they were routinely broken up by riot police .
The Germs ' only album , ( GI ) ( Germs Incognito ) , released in 1979 , was widely acclaimed as a brutal masterpiece ( an ' aural holocaust , ' the LA Times suggested ) .
And , as planned , on 7 December 1980 , Darby formed a suicide pact with his then girlfriend , Casey Cola .
They lay down together in her mother 's back room and injected themselves with the $ 400-worth of heroin they had bought with the last of their rent money .
Crash died , Cola survived .
The one thing that did not go according to plan , however , was the timing of Darby Crash 's self - mythologising exit .
Icons are not supposed to be upstaged , but on the day after Crash killed himself , John Lennon was murdered in Central Park and the world found a more genuine legend to mourn .
Crash 's designs on immortality were subsequently put on hold , but they have been revived in a film that retells the story of the ultimate live fast , die young life .
Twenty - eight years on , Darby Crash may yet take what he always saw as his rightful place as a rock'n'roll martyr somewhere in the junkie 's pantheon between Jim Morrison and Sid Vicious .
The film , which opened in New York earlier this month , takes its name from one of Crash 's characteristic pieces of paranoid lyricism '
What We Do Is Secret ' .
It has been a rite of passage for writer and director Rodger Grossman , who has spent the best part of 15 years , since he left film school , trying to get it made .
It began , he explains on the phone from LA , as a personal quest . '
I grew up in west Los Angeles and I used to go to punk shows with my friends to see bands like Black Flag and the Meat Puppets .
They were great shows .
But the bands we never got to see were the first - generation punk bands .
Our greatest regret was never having seen the Germs . '
He vowed to put that omission right .
Not long before he died , Darby Crash 's stage show had been preserved on film in The Decline of Western Civilization , Penelope Spheeris 's documentary about LA punk , a more theatrical , decadent relation to its slightly more venerable New York and London cousins .
Grossman and his friends had watched that footage over and over .
Crash , he suggests , was not only the most extreme but also the most romantic figure of that time and place .
He had literally been the poster boy for Spheeris 's movie , pictured on the film 's promotional fliers passed - out drunk on stage , prefiguring his death mask by a couple of months . '
Darby , ' Grossman says , ' was at or very near the heart of a very important scene .
He drew people to him .
It 's an overused term but in the Los Angeles I grew up in he was a living legend . '
In his efforts to resurrect that legend , Grossman initially set about trying to interview all the people who had known Darby .
He started with Crash 's mother , Faith , apparently the root of much of the singer 's angst and self - loathing ; when she gave her blessing for the film , he went on from there . '
People were still deeply emotional and wounded by what had happened , ' he says .
' They still are .
I carried that with me through the whole process . '
The movie is , necessarily , pitched somewhere between myth and reality .
The Germs had been a polarising force and Grossman discovered that everyone he spoke to ' had a different perspective and everything was always heightened when they remembered Darby .
People cared a great deal that I got things right ' .
No one cared more than the surviving members of the Germs , who had been rechristened by Crash : bass player Lorna Doom , guitarist Pat Smear ( who went on to play with Nirvana and currently plays with the Foo Fighters ) and the crazed drummer Don Bolles .
All of them make large claims for Darby Crash , but none more so than Bolles . '
With a little more luck and concentrated effort , ' he suggests , ' Darby could have fulfilled his plan to be the new Jesus / Bowie / Manson / Hitler / L Ron Hubbard ...
he was a natural messiah type , whose heroic consumption of LSD helped make him the most psychedelic prankster I have ever known . '
It is hard to get that kind of persuasive anarchy on film and because he pursued his subject from the perspective of a fan , Grossman 's movie suffers from the curse of all biopics : it never quite lives up to the mythology of the real thing .
Even so , enough of Crash 's unhinged charisma survives in the performance of Shane West , last seen playing Dr Ray Barnett in ER , to have allowed the actor to be paid the ultimate compliment by the survivors of the band : West is now touring - as ' Shane Wreck ' - with the re - formed Germs as a replacement for Crash .
When I speak to Lorna Doom in LA , she is just back from the film 's premiere in New York .
Watching it was , she explains , her weirdest emotional experience ( and she no doubt has plenty to choose from ) . '
It was like seeing this intense portion of my life rerun up there - lots of happy memories , some bad ones . '
She had replayed a lot of that footage over and over in her head in the past and the film has been a way of exorcising it .
Now it 's out there , she feels she can finally move on from those days . '
I think the movie has pretty much put all those feelings away for me once and for all .
It was very cathartic . '
Equally therapeutic has been the opportunity to re - form the Germs with Shane West .
By the end of its original life , the band had not so much fallen apart as been made redundant - no venue would risk booking them .
Three days before he died , Crash had ended their last show , itself a desperate reunion effort , with the words : ' You will not see this again . '
The revival ( and the film ) has in some ways proved him wrong .
How does that feel to Lorna Doom , now 50 ? '
It was totally surprising to get the band together again , ' she says , ' but it 's also the most comfortable thing in the world . '
In her view , the new Germs exceed the original in the fact that they can now really play their instruments ( when they went on stage the first time in 1977 at the Whisky a Go - Go on Sunset Boulevard , they had never really picked up guitars - Crash
had designed the band 's T - shirts and put up posters before they had got around to learning any chords ) .
Don Bolles agrees that the second coming of the Germs has an eerie symmetry . '
We are the first band to embrace the actor from the biopic as their singer and then go on to perform together like nothing happened , ' he suggests .
The audience these days consists of some old faithfuls and a new generation that knows more about the history of the Germs than Lorna Doom does .
There is , she says , with some relief , a lot less carnage than there used to be . '
It all got terribly violent and extremely frightening towards the end when there was this influx of punks from southern California who latched on to our gigs and basically made it impossible for us to play without a riot happening .
That was the beginning of the end . '
As Grossman 's film makes clear , it had n't always been like that .
To begin with , it was all a laugh .
The best scenes from the film are The Commitments - like early days when Crash and Smear put out an ad for ' two untalented girls ' and Lorna Doom and her flatmate Belinda Carlisle applied ( Carlisle was in the original line - up , as ' Dottie Danger ' , but soon left to form the Go - Go 's ) .
Though Darby had his death wish , part of the reason for starting the band was , as Smears has recalled , more innocent : it lay in the shocking discovery that one of their heroes , Alice Cooper , enjoyed a round of golf .
If they formed a band , they were not going to fake it . '
Whatever we were going to be , we were going to be the most .
If we 're gon na be punk , then we are gon na out - punk the Sex Pistols !
If we are gon na be the worst band ever , then we are gon na be the fucking worst band ever ! '
At first , the anarchy was all contrived ; doing a deranged cover of ' Sugar , Sugar ' , Crash would chuck bags of the stuff at the audience ; later , when the drugs got harder and things took a predictably darker turn , the chaos was for real .
Crash was happy to borrow any punk cliche he could import from London or New York and give it a personal twist .
The Germs became a resident band at the Masque , the hippest of all LA 's underground clubs , run by a Scottish expat called Brendan Mullen .
With bands like the Screamers and the Weirdos they would try to out - shock each other .
Apeing Iggy Pop , Darby Crash took to cutting himself on stage , generally making a bloody sphere on his chest that signified ' Circle One ' , a cultish idea that he wanted the band and its followers to indulge in ( Germs fans identified themselves with a cigarette burn on the inside of their left wrist ; the burn had to be created by another fan ) .
Borrowing wildly from Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler , David Bowie and Freddie Mercury , Mussolini and Dianetics , Crash came up with a narcotic kind of lyric that he believed might be a form of mind - control laced with despair and self - parody .
A closeted gay and , for a long time , in the proper Warholian tradition , a virgin , he portrayed himself as a ' Sex Boy ' : ' I like it anywhere any time that I can/
I 'm the fucking son of superman ' and , toying with fascistic imagery as a second coming : ' I 'm Darby Crash/ A social blast/ Chaotic master .... '
The chaos quickly mastered him , however .
One friend , Rik L Rik , recalled how , by 1979 , his stage show ' had just become a kind of Evel Knievel spectacle .
But the thing was , Darby never made the other side of the canyon ' .
Shane West captures some of that sense , without ever making it wholly credible , though the end , even though expected , still comes with a sense of shocking waste .
Hardly a day went by without Crash telling anyone who would listen of his five - year plan , but he was so full of life that people hardly believed him .
As Pat Smear subsequently recalled : ' Darby was very specific about how and when he was going to kill himself .
When we were rehearsing for the reunion show he said , "" The only reason I 'm doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with .
"" He 'd said that so many times I just said , "" Oh , right ... "" and did n't think about it any more . '
Crash 's Nancy Spungen was Casey Cola .
In a book about his life that Brendan Mullen put together , she remembered that last night with a horrible kind of teenage naivety . '
Both of us were like , "" Are you sure ? ""
"" Are you sure ? ""
"" Yes , I 'm sure , if you 're going to do it .
"" It was like putting two kids in a room and they end up maybe doing something they would n't do alone ... he hit me up first and he said , "" Are you OK ? ""
and I said , "" Um ...
yeah .
"" I was sitting up and he put his hand at the small of my back and said , "" Just hold it , stay there - just wait for me OK ? ""
He held me up for a second , then he hit himself up ; then he laid himself against the wall and pulled me to him .
It was almost like he forgot what he was going to do
and then he realised , and he said , "" Wait a minute "" , then he kissed me and said , ""
Well , bye .
"" Everything was cool , both of us were in agreement and we were happy with what we were doing . '
Cola 's heart stopped for a while in the night , but she woke up with Crash 's body in her arms .
She was subsequently committed to an asylum .
The day she heard the news , Lorna Doom recalls that she was about to board a plane to New York to start a new life .
When she landed , she discovered that John Lennon had been shot . '
It made it all worse in a way , ' she recalls . '
We just wanted to mourn Darby and all this other stuff was going on . '
Some friends from the old days put on a show .
David Brown , co - founder of the Screamers , the band that had rivalled the Germs for outrageous headlines in LA , sat at a big white piano and John Morris of Black Randy and the Metro Squad took to the stage wearing a hippie wig , little , wire - framed glasses and a Germs armband with the trademark Circle One on it .
He opened , on cue , with the line : ' Imagine there 's no Darby . '
It was , Brown recalled , ' sort of made up on the spot , but one of the few things we ever did that actually came off ' .
He resisted the idea , however , that ' Darby Crash was the Queen of the Prom , or whatever .
That misses the point of what a great guy he was .
I remember him as somebody who was fun to sit up all night and take drugs with ; he was actually sort of low - key .
I do n't really remember this heavy - duty poet and the rest of that crap ' .
Disciples , however , are always likely to mythologise .
Low - key guys quietly taking drugs do n't make for tortured biopics .
There are plenty of followers , still brandishing their Germs burns , who will line up to say that Rodger Grossman 's film is not the way it happened at all .
Jenny Lens , a photographer who captured the rise and fall of the Germs in stills , warns ' not to believe one word of the movie ' .
But Grossman is happy to defer to those who were closest to the story .
Lorna Doom tells me that in whatever kind of anarchist 's heaven Darby is now watching from , he would be loving it .
It is , after all , what he always dreamed of - though once again you have to say the timing could have been a little better .
Box office has been slow , so far , the film 's producers admit , because the launch of What We Do Is Secret coincided with the launch of the greatest show on earth , the opening ceremony of the Olympics .

Our pop critic on the germs Uncouth and deafening
, American punk was never intended to become an heirloom genre .
Some bands have stood the test of time regardless - the Ramones and hardcore heroes Minor Threat are two whose recorded works are undiminished by time and taste .
Like their LA peers the Circle Jerks and Fear , the Germs were an influential band , but their music was n't nearly the most resonant thing about them .
They were lurid , out of control and funny , as anyone who has seen Penelope Spheeris 's landmark film , The Decline of Western Civilization , will attest .
The Germs ' only album , ( GI ) , in 1979 , remains a landmark record for what it meant , not for what it sounded like .
Its speed and sense of mission would influence the next generation of hardcore punks and its visuals almost singlehandedly kicked off the revolution in punk graphics away from London 's ransom - note template .
To the meaning - hungry , secrecy - loving , symbol - embracing punks , the Germs 's enigmatic blue circle came to represent both the band 's simplicity and complexity .
Produced by Joan Jett , ( GI ) sonically documents the LA scene 's relatively late punk flowering , sneering and sniping to a breakneck garage - punk squall .
Guitarist Pat Smear ( a pun on pap smear , the American term for the gynaecological examination ) went on to play in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters and his capable , thuggish riffs anchor the outpourings .
Singer Darby Crash - almost certainly gay , conflicted about it , full of scorn , bile and drugs - had a way with words that made his lyrics worth tuning in to ( he often sang off - mike ) .
The barely disguised autobiography ' Richie Dagger 's Crime ' offered up a picture of ' a remnant from an outbreak past/
Wore something in his ear/
And boy was he a sass ' .
Really , though , the Germs were less a band than a black hole around which sticky chaos could orbit .

A Bowie compilation released earlier this year as a free CD given out with the newspaper will now receive a general commercial release â bolstered with two semi - exclusive tracks .
iSELECT : BOWIE is a collection of his own songs that he "" never seems to tire of "" , originally included with the June 29 edition of the Mail on Sunday .
The edition quickly sold out and Rolling Stone dubbed it a collector 's item â even if the CDs sell on eBay for less than Â£ 1 .
Still , fans who do n't want the cheapo Â£ 1 version will soon be able to buy a full - packaged Virgin / EMI release .
The new iSELECT : BOWIE will be issued on October 14 , with Bowie 's own notes about the songs .
About Lady Grinning Soul , Bowie told NME : "" It was written for a wonderful young girl whom I 've not seen for more than 30 years .
When I hear this song she 's still in her 20s , of course .
A song will put you tantalisingly close to the past , so close that you can almost reach out and touch it .
The sound of ghosts again . ""
Though the compilation does n't include any songs from classic records like Low or Space Oddity , there are three wild cards .
Some Are , an out - take from the Low sessions , is included , and the album 's final tracks consist of Bowie 's new remix of Time Will Crawl , and a vintage live version of Hang on to Yourself .
Full track list :
1 .
Life on Mars ( from Hunky Dory ) 2 .

2008-09-13,"The moment when David Bowie and Andy Warhol crossed paths for the first time was preserved for posterity on a shaky hand - held camera by one of the latter 's assistants , Michael Netter .
The meeting took place at the Factory , Warhol 's studio - cum - hangout in Manhattan on 14 September 1971 .
Bowie , who had yet to reinvent himself as one of pop 's ultra - modernists , wears baggy trousers and has his long hair styled in a side parting beneath a big floppy hat .
After some awkward small talk about Syd Barrett and the price of albums in America , Bowie performs a mime in which he drags his beating heart out of his chest .
All the while , Warhol stands off to one side looking on as blankly as only he could , occasionally whispering to his aides .
Then , Bowie and his small entourage shuffle off .
It is not so much a meeting of two great pop minds as a cagey standoff between someone who has created a pop future in his own image and someone who , at that moment , may have suddenly realised he must do the same or be left behind .
The short , black - and - white , fly - on - the - wall film of Bowie and Warhol 's encounter is one of several similar fragments that make up just one section of the multimedia overload that is Andy Warhol : Other Voices , Other Rooms , a touring exhibition that opens soon at the Hayward Gallery in London .
The show is a kaleidoscope of Warholia that includes paintings , posters , TV shows , album sleeves and interviews , as well as the famous screen tests and various snatches of his film diaries .
It is a noisy , unruly , wilfully distracting event , the art show as conceptual homage and critique .
It makes one wonder how the world would have looked without Warhol .
The world of pop music would certainly have looked very different .
As creative director of the Velvet Underground , perhaps the most influential rock group of all time , Warhol helped shape the pop future from early Bowie on to Kraftwerk and punk .
Though he was credited as producer on The Velvet Underground and Nico album , his only direct input , apart from creating that iconic sleeve , was to pay for the studio time .
Nevertheless , when Richard Goldstein wrote glowingly about the Velvets in New York magazine in 1967 , he called them ' Andy 's rock group ' .
They were seen as another Warhol - inspired idea , ' the product of a secret marriage between Bob Dylan and the Marquis de Sade ' .
Goldstein - wrongly , as it turned out - saw rock'n'roll as Warhol 's new medium . '
Andy says he 's through with phosphorescent flowers and cryptic soup cans .
Now , it 's rock .
He may finally conquer the world through its soft teenage underbelly . '
Warhol , for his part , saw the Velvets as a piece of kinetic art , an installation even . '
It 's ugly , ' he told Goldstein . '
It 's an ugly effect when you put it all together .
But it 's beautiful .
You know you just look at the whole thing -
the Velvets playing and Gerard [ Malanga ] dancing and all the film and light , and it 's a beautiful thing .
Very vinyl .
Beautiful . '
More presciently still , Warhol , alongside Roy Lichtenstein , was the Pop artist as creative magpie , making the notion of creative borrowing a central motif in his work .
The Campbell 's soup cans , the Brillo boxes , the silkscreened prints of celebrities all heralded the age of audio sampling .
In short , Warhol saw a future in which pop would endlessly eat itself and regurgitate its past in new and exciting ways .
Twenty one years after his death , Warhol may still be the most influential invisible presence in contemporary pop , his most celebrated quote - ' in the future , everyone will be famous for 15 minutes ' - now a kind of template for the current vogue for reality talent shows and created pop groups .
More than that , though , Warhol saw how celebrity worked and where its worship would lead .
He was an early master of PR and self - promotion , and , in his lifetime , his reputation was based as much on his public and media profile as his art .
Andy made the rounds of openings and premieres , Andy partied ( after a fashion ) and Andy posed .
His own magazine , Interview , tracked his every appearance in a column called ' Out ' , where Andy appeared in the company of Bianca Jagger , Liza Minnelli and Truman Capote .
Little wonder that John Lennon called him ' the biggest publicity man in the world ' ."
2008-09-23,"What better way to help children in areas of conflict than by having Duffy sing a song by Wings ?
That 's the logic behind Heroes , a new compilation to be released by the charity War Child .
Released on November 22 , Heroes sees newfangled artists including Hot Chip and the Kooks covering classic songs by David Bowie , the Clash , Paul McCartney and others .
And while we 're used to listening to goofy and unauthorised covers - ukelele orchestras covering the Stones or illegal mash - ups of the Monkees - these covers are fully authorised .
The covered acts themselves nominated the coverers .
In other words , the Kinks like the Kooks . ""
Paul McCartney 's nominated Duffy to cover [ Wings ' ] Live and Let Die .
And Joy Division has nominated Hot Chip to cover Transmission , "" explained Ben Knowles , executive producer of music at War Child , glossing over the fact that Joy Division are strictly speaking defunct .
"" The modern bands are incredibly flattered to be asked .
But I think it 's been a bit of a responsibility as well , in the fact that they know that these legends are going to want to hear these tracks . ""
War Child is a British - based charity founded in 1993 .
It is dedicated to providing assistance to children in sites of present and recent conflict .
They previously released star - studded compilation albums in 1995 , 2002 and 2005 .
Other artists appearing on Heroes include Rufus Wainwright covering Brian Wilson , the Kooks playing the Kinks ' Victoria , and Beck doing Bob Dylan 's Leopard - Skin Pill - Box Hat .
"" On most of them the legend has asked the new people to have total clearance to re - work the clip as they see fit , "" Knowles told BBC 6 Music . ""
But a couple of the tracks will feature some surprise collaborations .
"" The full track - list will be released soon ."
2008-09-29,"The handover from Virgin Radio to Absolute Radio came at 7.45am yesterday .
"" I will speak to you next on Absolute Radio , "" explained Christian O'Connell .
There followed some sci - fi - ish churning sounds ; a nauseating homily about real music ( "" real music is the song not the video "" ) ; a fizzy jingle ( "" let 's go to the future - the Absolute future "" ) and a dreary musical collage ( the Beatles , Queen , David Bowie , Van Morrison ) .
"" I 'm covered in goose bumps , "" said one caller .
"" Totally amazing , "" said another .
It was hard to share their excitement :
Absolute is just a sharper focus for an existing station , brought about by a change of owners .
There 's a pledge to play some older music , more new music , and sponsorship has replaced ads .
There is also hysterical repetition of a new daytime "" no repeat "" policy ; the repetition of this was as maddening as tracks played again and again .
Some changes are to be welcomed , though - especially Geoff Lloyd as the new drivetime host .
And you can hear the new set - up trying to connect in new ways with listeners .
Virgin Radio often sounded lazy , happy to rest on its laurels , and so far Absolute does n't .
That 's not enough to trigger goose bumps , but it is a start ."
2008-09-29,"Virgin Radio rebranded as Absolute this morning , after its buyout by The Times of India group .
But what was the first song heard on the station , I hear you ask ?
David Bowie 's Absolute Beginners .
And the intro music ?
A Day
In The Life by The Beatles .
However , the choice of opening music as a statement of intent was not enough for Absolute â
it needed a mission statement as well .
Thus , these were the first words heard early this morning , written by listener Michael Cook : Real music is the song , not the video playing , not miming gigs , not photo shoots tour buses , not voice coaches built to last , not flavour of the month the lads from school , not an ad in The Stage something to say , not something to sell So there we go .
Monkey is excited that Absolute wo n't allow music trying to promote something , but does that rule out Jack White 's big new James Bond theme ( as heard on the Coke Zero advert ) ?"

After my folks divorced when I was 11 , my Mum bought my brother and me uncharacteristically expensive Christmas presents - she 's got seven children and is rather careful with money .
We got ghetto blasters , and it was a bit of a revolution .
I did n't have any cassettes
so I poked around the house and found Hunky Dory , which my sister Sam had bought .
I learned all the words , and sang along , and until I got more cassettes this was the only one that was in there .

Growing up with five elder sisters and only one hi - fi in the house formed my musical tastes .

They all sang close harmony to songs from this album , and it was beautiful , but I was n't allowed to join in .
It is my biggest lyrical influence ; she does n't waste a word .
I love the fact that she 's a quite bitter old broad now , having put her heart and soul into everything she 's done to the cost of personal happiness .

We were called Mr Soft , and Andy supplied these great records , one of which was this .
It coincided with smoking weed for the first time , and it was when I realised there 's more to being in a band than making music : there 's a gang mentality .
This was the soundtrack to the summer when we all decided to pursue the band full time , which , when I listen to the music we were making then , was a very foolish decision .
We thought we sounded like this album .
We did n't .
The one that has had the most impact on elbow Laughing Stock , Talk Talk ( 1991 )
Talk Talk have a song called ' It 's Getting Late in the Evening ' .
I 've still never heard anything like it , and it led me to this timeless album .
The intensity with which Talk Talk focused on the recording process was a huge influence on the way we made albums .
Laughing Stock shouted at me every day , and it had brilliant lyrics .
The amazing thing about Talk Talk is that their early stuff was awful .
I hope they 're remembered for Laughing Stock .
Their song ' New Grass ' will be played at my funeral ; it 's the most beautiful song I 've ever heard .

2008-11-28,"It 's late 1979 and the Human League are pioneering Britain 's synthesiser pop revolution .
The previous week , at a gig at the Nashville Rooms in London , David Bowie had bounded into their dressing room to proclaim them "" the future of rock'n'roll "" , a comment picked up by NME .
However , that does n't count for much by the time the tour reaches the band 's hometown , Sheffield .
In the middle of the gig , singer Philip Oakey is pouring his heart and soul into a futuristic , electronic version of the Walker Brothers '
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling , when an unfamiliar figure joins him on stage .
"" This bloke came up and tapped Philip on the shoulder , "" remembers Martyn Ware , who played synthesiser for the Human League before leaving to co - found Heaven 17 . ""
He said , ' Excuse me .
Can you get off now ?
We 've got a beer race on . '
"" Oakey winces at the memory .
"" I was very angry and everyone was trying to calm me down , "" he sighs , in his famous deadpan baritone .
"" I was going , ' This is wrong !
Let me finish the song ! ' "" "" What people forget is that the other band who Bowie said were the future of rock'n'roll were Legend , "" deadpans Oakey , remembering a metal band who "" had an album cover bearing vinyl shoes and must have seemed very modern "" .
Legend did n't become legends , but the music made by the Human League , Heaven 17 and fellow Sheffield electronic soulsters ABC - a triumvirate now touring together for the first time - has become pivotal to the way pop sounds today .
Originally , their ambition was to destroy rock music altogether : "" We hated anything that was n't modernist , "" says ABC 's Martin Fry .
"" It was like Cavaliers and Roundheads .
Total warfare ! ""
Instead , their work from the late 70s and early 80s resonates across modern pop , from Ladytron to Warp Records , from Xenomania to hip - hop .
These days , a meeting with Sheffield 's electronic titans is peppered with camaraderie and self - deprecating northern banter .
That was n't the case back when the Human League 's Do n't You Want Me sold 1 m copies and the bands were jostling for pop supremacy .
At that point , the Human League were so paranoid about being copied that they would n't give anybody tapes of what they were doing .
History records Cabaret Voltaire as Sheffield 's first electronic group , but they were n't the first Steel City act to use a synthesiser .
That honour goes to an early-1970s band called Musical Vomit .
Featuring computer operators Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh ( who would later found the Human League ) , Heaven 17 singer Glenn Gregory and actor Ian Reddington ( Coronation Street 's hapless drummer , Vernon ) , they were unlikely pioneers .
"" It was like A Clockwork Orange crossed with Alice Cooper , "" says Gregory .
"" There was vomit from the stage and ' legs ' being chopped off . ""
As for the synth , it was wooden .
"" It had a joystick , which we loved because it was very Brian Eno , "" sniggers Ware . ""
But it only made two noises .
"" The curious thing about Sheffield is that , unlike in Britain 's other major cities - especially Manchester - its hip crowd did n't embrace punk .
The most creative musicians in the city were exploring the possibilities of electronic music .
"" Sheffield was a hard place , "" recalls Gregory .
"" Everyone else was into heavy rock .
It did n't accept punk other than as a trigger for innovation . ""
Oakey - who says he had n't heard of Cabaret Voltaire until he joined the Human League - recalls Kraftwerk 's appearance at Sheffield University in 1976 as being "" as seismic as the Sex Pistols .
Everybody loved it . ""
Crucially , the Human League did n't copy Kraftwerk 's dry , robotic music ; they added emotion and humanity to create what Ware describes as "" synthetic soul "" .
In an early interview , Oakey declared their ambition was to become "" an international version of Abba "" .
Aligning oneself against rock meant looking different , too .
Ware remembers meeting his fellow synth player Adrian Wright , who was wearing "" white jeans , a green jacket and silver platform boots "" .
But when the band went out to the Crazy Daisy nightclub , their attire was even more unusual .
One night , Marsh turned up wearing chains and a baked bean tin as a bracelet .
"" This guy looked at him and said , ' What the fuck 's that ? ' "" remembers Ware ( soberly dressed these days ) .
"" The guy took [ the beans tin ] off , threw it on the floor and stamped on it , saying , ' Now what are you gon na do ? ' ""
Ware considers Marsh 's reply - "" Open another one "" - worthy of the subsequent beating .
That fate somehow eluded Oakey , despite his famous lopsided haircut , although singer Susan Sulley does remember one audience member trying to set fire to his trousers .
But there was a point to even the most outlandish fashion statements .
Oakey 's magnificent barnet - which led to him being called "" Phil Funnywig "" by NME - got the Human League 's music noticed .
"" I always wanted a distinctive hairstyle , like Bowie or Marc Bolan , "" says the 53-year - old .
"" I copied it from a girl on the bus . ""
ABC 's Martin Fry - a Mancunian Roxy glam rocker turned Sheffield - based electronic kid - remembers the "" shock "" of first encountering the Human League . ""
The reaction from the audience was uneasy : ' Where 's the drummer ? ! '
This was before hip - hop , and that sort of shock is n't around now . ""
Record labels did n't know what to make of the Sheffield scene , but the Human League were given a chance by Virgin , which was still flush with money from the success of Mike Oldfield 's Tubular Bells .
The groups felt as if they were taking on the entire musical establishment .
Their nemesis was the Musician 's Union , which saw synthesisers and drum machines as a threat to the livelihood of thousands of percussionists .
It started a "" Keep Music Live "" campaign , to which the Human League responded with an on - stage skull and the slogan "" Keep Music Dead "" .
There were other problems .
Early synthesisers were problematic , and although musicians first picked them up in part out of laziness - "" We did n't want to spend months with the Duane Eddy songbook , learning to play guitar , "" admits Oakey - they found themselves programming their equipment for months .
( At one point the Human League took photographs of the machines ' settings so they could get the same effects the following week . )
Nevertheless , the Sheffield sound was extraordinarily influential even then .
Oakey insists that Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark copied the Human League 's stage equipment , although he concedes that their debut , Electricity , was a "" brilliant single "" .
Others were catching up , too , and synth music started to generate hits , while the first two Human League albums - 1979 's Reproduction and 1980 's Travelogue - barely troubled the charts .
When Gary Numan hit No 1 with Are ' Friends ' Electric ? , Oakey was mortified .
Something had to give , and the Human League broke into two , with Ware and Marsh leaving to pursue new projects .
Even today , the members find it awkward to discuss what exactly precipitated their acrimonious split .
Oakey suggests he and Ware were simply too forceful as characters to be in the same band .
Ware suspects that their manager , Bob Last , had spotted Oakey 's potential as a "" pop star with massive earning potential "" and engineered him away from arty stuff .
Ware and Marsh set up the British Electric Foundation - a "" futuristic production concept "" whose most lasting legacy was to relaunch Tina Turner - before bringing in Gregory to become Heaven 17 .
Oakey , meanwhile , was drowning his sorrows at the Crazy Daisy , where he spotted two teenage girls dancing and asked them to join the band for a gig in Doncaster .
At first , the new members did n't seem to be adding much .
"" We just hummed along and did some dancing , "" says Sulley .
"" And occasionally got so drunk we fell off stage , "" adds Joanne Catherall .
In Germany , they faced burning union flags and cans pelted by people who "" expected a band of boys "" .
However , when the new - look Human League released their 1981 masterpiece , Dare , the pair became part of electronic pop history - glamorous girls - next - door who paved the way for everyone from the Spice Girls to Girls Aloud . ""
But we were never stylised , "" says Sulley .
"" We did look like we 'd walked out of Sheffield .
It gave hope to people , because if we could do it , anyone could . ""
In the 80s , the Sheffield sound went overground .
As the Human League 's Do n't You Want Me squared up to Heaven 17 's
( We Do n't Need This )
Fascist Groove Thang and Temptation
, ABC released their masterwork , 1982 's The Lexicon of Love , which blended electronics , orchestrated soul and a gold lamÃ© jacket .
For Oakey , it was a vindication of what he had been trying to achieve for years .
"" People who had laughed in our faces three years earlier were suddenly saying , ' Your records are great , ' "" he remembers . ""
And things like , '
It does n't matter if it 's a synthesiser , it sounds like a bass . '
"" Suddenly , even rock bands were using synthesisers , while there were , ironically , howls of outrage when the Human League played guitars for their 1984 single The Lebanon .
"" We should n't have done it , "" says Oakey .
Sulley is more circumspect : "" We wanted something different . ""
Today , the records made in Sheffield in the late 1970s and 80s are in the rare position of being loved by housewives , electronic boffins and hip - hop purists alike , and still sound ultramodern .
The battlegrounds on which the Steel City contingent fought for pop 's future - the Limit Club and Crazy Daisy - have long been demolished , but the stance of their patrons remains unwavering .
"" I still hate rock music , "" says Oakey , defiantly .
"" I think it 's adolescent , easy , power - chord nonsense . ""
Meanwhile , a blue plaque at Sheffield Hallam University ( formerly Sheffield Polytechnic ) honours the site of the Human League 's first gig .
Appropriately , it has become a computer department .

2008-11-29,""" Convivium "" is the term for a local chapter of the international slow food movement : a nod to conviviality , and also perhaps a reminder that our word "" company "" comes from the words for "" together "" and "" bread "" .
Andrews 's history of slow food is a thoughtful account of how politics came back to eating , from 1970s Italy and California to present - day Ludlow and further afield .
The slogan "" slow food "" , he notes , was born after a 1986 anti - McDonald 's demo in Rome , but the roots stretch further back , at least to the legendary early-70s California restaurant Chez Panisse , where , we are told , Led Zeppelin and David Bowie played in the kitchen .
Today slow fooders see eating as "" an agricultural act "" .
Against the charge that it is "" elitist "" to nag poor people about buying cheap supermarket food , Andrews argues that only slow fooders really care about the growers , and that only such a wide - angle view of food , from field to table , is politically and ecologically respectable .

2008-12-19,"Chrysalis has fallen heavily into the red after a year which the founder of the music publisher , home to acts such as David Bowie , Estelle and Leonard Cohen , admitted had been "" extremely challenging "" .
The company has been involved in two separate bid talks - the most recent ended last week - while the Hollywood writers ' strike has knocked a hole in the revenues Chrysalis makes from supplying tracks for use in television and films .
A review of operations , spurred by the rejection of an offer in the spring , has also caused the management to reduce the value of its catalogue by Â£ 2.4 m , while cost - cutting , including shedding one in 10 staff , has led to several additional charges .
In total , the company 's losses for the 13 months to September rose to Â£ 18.8 m .
Last year the firm made a loss of Â£ 6 m .
Chris Wright , chairman and founder , admitted : "" Our first year as a standalone entity has been extremely challenging . ""
In addition to the deteriorating global economic backdrop , Chrysalis has suffered a number of specific issues which have impacted the financial performance of the group .
"" The company sold its radio stations , including Heart and Galaxy , to Global Radio last year , returning Â£ 96.5 m to shareholders , and decided to focus on music publishing .

2009-01-02,"Anita Blay - a 23-year - old Londoner who creates eccentric , delightfully gloomy pop songs on her laptop and then records them under the name thecocknbullkid - wants to be many things : a musician as enigmatic as David Bowie or Kate Bush , a shape - shifting electronic artist , a 2009 chart star .
But she does n't want to be seen as a performer of grime or R&amp;B. Not because she does n't like the music , but because she hates being prejudged , something that is already happening even though she has only released one single , the vampy , synthy On My Own .
"" I never wanted to do anything that people would expect from looking at me , "" she says , a small but striking figure with her half - shaved head and polka - dot dress , taking a break from recording her debut album in a north London studio .
"" I 'm into the new and futuristic .
People put me in the MIA category , but I 'm not grime
and I 'm not some ' ghetto princess ' .
I want to make pop music .
The media put black people in boxes .
It really irks me . ""
Indeed it does .
She even wrote a blog about it , prompted by a magazine photographer who urged her to "" be more urban "" for the camera . ""
Now , I can just about handle any other ill - informed safe / buzz word , "" she ranted . ""
But this grime thing has too much of an unsavoury undertone for me .
Is this the only palatable way the media see fit to present a black artist ?
Can I not be included in the mainstream ?
Is it too hard for them to understand that I am making pop music ? ""
Blay , a Hackney girl brought up by her father after her mother moved to Canada , then Ghana , discovered pop music between leaving her convent school in Euston and studying for English , sociology and theology
A Levels at a college in west London .
The first songs to make an impact on the 16-year - old Blay were Psycho Killer by Talking Heads and Girlfriend in a Coma by the Smiths .
She was fascinated by Morrissey .
Her friends thought she was weird . ""
They did n't understand why I was being so ' white ' , "" she laughs .
"" But everyone knew I was n't a standard black girl . ""
Despite being outgoing and having many friends , in her late teens , jobless and directionless , she virtually became Morrissey : a classic bedroom miserabilist .
In a way , it suited her .
It still does .
"" I sank into depression for a year and a half , "" she admits .
"" It was quite a tough period : delayed angst .
It was my Morrissey phase .
I 'm still in it !
I do n't see myself as a happy , bubbly person .
If I got really happy it would be weird . ""
During this period , she had "" really negative thoughts "" and felt "" worthless "" .
She did "" certain things that I would n't want to do again "" which she does n't care to elucidate , though it does n't include self - harming .
She does , however , admit that she "" allowed people to take advantage of me .
I was naive "" .
She describes it as a form of self - sabotage .
She sought refuge in the music of Morrissey and the Cure , and anti - depressants .
"" I did n't want to deal with it any more , "" she says .
She took Prozac , which levelled out her mood - swings , but had a desensitising effect .
"" I almost felt too OK - there 's a fine line between feeling all right and numb . ""
A series of day jobs , including one for Southwark council looking at leaky roofs , did n't suit her increasingly nocturnal , gig - going lifestyle , which was pursued with little concern for the demands of work .
"" I 'd go out all night and turn up at the office , smelling of booze , "" she recalls .
"" It would be 8 am and I 'd fall asleep at my desk .
They sacked me . ""
She decided to apply herself more seriously to music - making .
She had "" fiddled around "" at a studio when she was 16 during a youth placement scheme , where she sketched out songs with the rapper Plan B and various "" hip - hop people "" , and generally "" went rampant "" with her computer and Midi keyboard .
Of her early song - writing forays at home , in the flat she still shares with her dad in Hackney , she says : "" They 're like what I do now , but not as good . ""
She enjoyed the atmosphere of spontaneous invention , writing and recording alone , precisely because she did n't understand the process .
She loves "" crafting pop songs "" but leaves the finessing to experts : these days , she has producers , including Metronomy 's Joseph Mount , who transform her rough drafts into fully formed songs with quirky arrangements .
"" That 's why I work with those guys , who can hone what I put down and make it better , "" she says .
"" I do n't really want to know what I 'm doing because I 'll lose the magic . ""
The first songs she ever wrote were about "" feelings of despair , rejection and far - fetched analogies about robbing people - which , by the way , I 've never done "" .
Sometimes , she says , "" you can get carried away in songs and say things you would n't in real life . ""
More recently , her dark , infectious cyber - pop songs - which she sings in a voice between a gentle sigh and an odd warble - have addressed the nature of sexuality ( Boys and Girls ) , and guilt and religion ( Sinners ) , inspired by her strict Christian upbringing and "" God - fearing "" mother .
Her next single , I 'm Not
Sorry , is about being cruel but having no regrets .
"" It 's not very nice .
Sometime 's there 's a pleasure in hurting someone . ""
Even if it 's not deserved ? ""
Hey , I do n't make the rules !
Sometimes I do horrible things
and I 'll write a song about it .
Hopefully , people will be able to relate to it . ""
On her MySpace , there 's a Madonna quote : "" Why do I push myself so hard ?
Because I have demons .
Because I want to live forever .
Because when I die I do n't want people to forget I existed .
"" Blay 's own demons are a capricious bunch .
"" I have days when I think I 'm a fucking genius , others when I think everything I do is shit , "" she says .
"" But that 's OK .
It 's good to see the good and bad in myself .
It means I 'm human .
If I was one or the other , I 'd be fucked . ""
The idea of Blay as the egomaniacal thecocknbullkid is appealing to some record company types .
She is actually quite shy .
"" I 've been told that I should be more animated .
But I 'm not going to drag a man on stage and ride him , then chuck him back into the audience and start spitting on people .
It might be great for other artists , but it 's not me . ""
She has also been told that she 's not thin enough to make it in pop .
In fact , she used to look more conventionally pretty , but she shaved her head at the side and put on weight in a deliberate ploy to make the struggle to be successful even harder and to make similarly "" unattractive "" fans feel less alone .
"" I was slimmer and had nicer hair , but I was fucking miserable .
I do n't want to be ' pretty ' .
I do n't aspire to be like the Pussycat Dolls .
I want people to say , ' Oh , she 's a bit fat , that 's all right , then . '
I want to be an artist who people can believe in . ""
Of the artists she believes in - David Byrne , Grace Jones , Bowie and Kate Bush among them - her ideal parents would be Little Richard and BjÃ¶rk , though she acknowledges the impracticalities when it comes to the former .
Polymorphous perversity appeals , at least in theory .
"" I 've always been obsessed with ambivalence .
I do n't think I look androgynous but I 'd like to because it 's so bold in terms of pop , having a look that 's either off - putting or beautiful . ""
Does she swing both ways ?
"" God , "" she splutters , "" I , er ... "" She is momentarily lost for words .
"" All I 'll say is : I 'm not a straight down the line person .
I do n't think , ' You 're a girl or a guy . '
It 's more about the person and whether you get on with them . ""
She is drawn to those tortured artists who are "" reckless and experimental and open .
Even the Beatles went out and got fucked with the sole purpose of being creative . ""
Would she sacrifice her health and sanity at the altar of artistic endeavour ? ""
Well , I do n't want to be too earnest , but I do n't want to fuck up , either .
Sometimes getting wasted can be fun .
I 'm still only 23 , so who knows ? ""
Her ultimate aim is to make electronic pop music as enduring as her favourites , Yazoo and the Human League ( "" I do n't want to shout over a guitar that 's being throttled .
I want some musicality "" ) , while retaining an air of inscrutability . ""
No disrespect to Lily Allen , "" she says , "" but we know too much about her .
We did n't know that much about David Bowie -
we saw him on stage and that was it .
Where are the kooky reclusive artists ?
I want to bring back some mystique , although I do n't know if that 's possible with my big mouth .
I feel like I 've given away too much already . """
2009-01-14,"Who is to blame for the recession ?
Forget all that stuff about out - of - control bankers , negligent governments and sleepwalking regulators ; instead , according to the BBC 's Evan Davis , it 's time to point the finger at David Bowie - a pioneer not only of experimental rock music and
what used to be called "" gender bending "" , but exactly the kind of financial sophistry that got us in this mess .
In yesterday 's Daily Mirror , Davis laid out his theory as follows .
In 1997 , Bowie needed millions of pounds to buy back the rights to his songs from a previous manager .
With the help of a financier named David Pullman , he thus created the so - called "" Bowie Bond "" , through which investors would receive a share of the royalties from 287 Bowie songs over the next 10 years ( Â£ 55 m worth of them were sold to the Prudential Insurance Company ) .
By 2004 , falling record sales meant they were dangerously close to what the markets call "" junk "" status - but as Davis sees it , that is n't really the point .
Far more significant is the fact that the Bowie Bond was a prime example of the same "" securitisation "" via which millions of dodgy mortgages have been chopped up and sold on .
In effect , he reckons , "" the banks started doing what Bowie had done - in a big way "" .
It 's a nice theory , but it hardly stands up .
Securitisation of mortgages began in the early 1970s , when Bowie was a much - worshipped glam rocker rather than any kind of financial visionary .
Using the technique to bundle up credit card loans and debt on car sales gained pace in the mid - to - late 1980s , when his career was in the doldrums and there were still no signs of any interest in the markets .
That said , the Bowie Bond did set a modest precedent , leading to the same idea being applied to the back catalogues of such artists as James Brown and Iron Maiden .
The rest of us may have to sweat our way through the downturn while worrying about our valueless houses , but some lucky people will be kept warm by the cash flow from such songs as Get Up
( I Feel Like Being A ) Sex Machine , and such fortuitously appropriate Maiden pieces as The Evil
That Men Do and Two Minutes To Midnight .
Really : what a strange world this is ."
2009-01-17,"A credit crunch oddity
If we are looking for people to blame for the financial mess we are in , how about David Bowie .
Sounds crazy , but an article in Tuesday 's Daily Mirror debated the question of whether the Thin White Duke could be the "" godfather "" of the credit crunch .
The article , by BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Evan Davis , points out that back in 1997 , the pop star did something called "" securitisation "" ( now , of course , a dirty word ) when he issued Bowie Bonds - asset - backed securities which awarded investors a share in the future royalties from his classic songs .
"" It meant he no longer had the money coming in but instead had a lot up front .
His investors were guaranteed a good income ...
And the banks were catching on to the idea ...
[ they ] started doing what Bowie had done - in a big way , "" wrote Davis .
Born into debt Rapidly rising government debt means every baby born in Britain starts life owing Â£ 17,000 , David Cameron claimed as he launched a new publicity campaign this week .
The Tories unveiled a new poster designed to highlight what they have dubbed Labour 's "" debt crisis "" .
The poster , which will be displayed at 260 billboard sites across the country , features a photograph of a baby and the slogan : "" Dad 's nose , mum 's eyes , Gordon Brown 's debt - Labour debt crisis : every child in Britain is born owing Â£ 17,000 .
They deserve better . ""
Do n't count on child trust fund accounts bailing the nation 's youngsters out of their financial hole - many are now worth less than the money paid into them .
Lipstick and measuring tapes
Women who want to know if a future boyfriend will splash the cash or be a tightwad need only look at his fingers .
"" If they find a big difference in length between ring and index finger , he is likely to be more aggressive and less likely to part with his cash , "" according to the Metro freesheet , quoting a scientific study .
Volunteers were shown a heavy metal music video , and then each given â¬ 10 ( Â£ 9 ) and asked how much they would like to give to another person .
The bigger the difference in ring and index finger length , the less money they gave away .
Where 's the interest ?
If you think the interest you 're getting on your savings is meagre , spare a thought for some customers of Julian Hodge Bank , based in Cardiff .
It is offering savers with less than Â£ 1,000 an interest rate of 0 % on their money for all its variable rate accounts .
In fact , customers need to invest at least Â£ 10,000 in the bank 's instant access Savings Account before they get a return on their money - and even then it pays only 0.5 % before tax , rising to 1 % if people have a balance of Â£ 50,000 .
The bank is really having a laugh with its "" High Interest Cheque Account "" , which only pays interest to people who hold a balance of Â£ 50,000 ... at which point they receive the princely sum of 0.5 % .
These rates could fall further still , as they came into force on 10 December - before the most recent interest rate cut .
Taxing times If filling in your tax return is one of the many things on your "" to do "" list , you 'd better get a move on - because the 31 January deadline is drawing ever closer .
The taxman has warned that you need to submit your self - assessment form online and on time , or you risk being hit with a Â£ 100 penalty ( the paper - filing deadline has now passed ) .
If you 're new to online filing , you need to register by visiting hmrc.gov.uk/sa and clicking on "" Register for Self Assessment Online "" .
A pin number will then be posted to you .
It can take up to seven days to arrive , so make sure you register by Wednesday , to allow enough time for the pin to come and for you to sit down and do your form .

2009-01-18,"Camille O'Sullivan 's trademarks are her love of red wine , her exuberant dress sense and her highly individual stage routine , which includes a ( somewhat irritating ) tendency to emit animal noises and to drape herself across unsuspecting audience members .
London 's Roundhouse perhaps was n't the ideal venue for the Irish cabaretchanteuse whose turbulent , physically charged singing style is best suited to more intimate settings .
Still , O'Sullivan 's wonderful voice makes her capable of carrying any audience , and here she won over an initially reserved crowd with inspired renditions of songs by Nick Cave , Tom Waits , David Bowie and others .
O'Sullivan attacks each song with heroic gusto , with the result that , when she sings a line , you really feel as if she means it .
Thus , her rendition of Hurt by Nine Inch Nails ( "" I will make you hurt "" ) crackled with vengeance , while Nick Cave 's People Ai n't
No Good was infused with despair .
The highlight of the night , though , was her version of David Bowie 's Five Years , which built up from its jaunty opening ( "" Pushing through the market square "" ) into a torrid vision of apocalypse , before morphing , strangely but hauntingly , into the finale of Pink Floyd 's Dark Side of the Moon ."

2009-01-29,"The Belgian Guy Peellaert , who has died aged 74 , was best known for his book Rock Dreams ( 1974 ) , scripted by Nick Cohn .
A string of album covers followed , including Diamond Dogs for David Bowie and It 's Only Rock'n'Roll for the Rolling Stones ( both 1974 ) .
The self - styled faiseur d'images created dream - like paintings of inordinate potency , crammed with symbol and smudged colour .
He populated them with musicians , actors , politicians and celebrities , and painted unlikely , yet semi - plausible meetings that functioned as fantasy tableaux - Elvis and John Lennon , for example , hunkered down in an American diner .
Born in Brussels , Peellaert first came to public attention in the French - speaking world in 1966 through his early work as a comic artist in a pop art vein with his character Jodelle .
The following year Pravda , a female character , was launched , first in the satirical magazine Hara - Kiri and then in Pravda la Suivireuse
( Pravda the Overseer ) .
Jodelle was modelled on the singer Sylvie Vartan , widely viewed as her generation 's first lady of yÃ© - yÃ© in France .
Pravda was based on FranÃ§oise Hardy , the icon of cool French pop .
These cult comics used brash , pop art colours and added twists of psychedelia , as Australian Martin Sharp was doing in London and Kelley - Mouse in San Francisco .
They earned him a particular reputation in Japan where this work was republished as Guy Peellaert 's Flipper Comics ( 2000 ) and an exhibition and installation entitled Looking For Pravda was held in Tokyo in 2004 .
The couturier Jean - Charles de Castelbajac used the two heroines for his 2001 collection Physical Graffiti , named in honour of the Led Zeppelin album .
Peellaert came to greater attention with Rock Dreams .
It sold more than 1 m copies in its various editions .
The meticulously detailed paintings created imaginary situations , uniting people in fantasy situations , frequently adapted from iconic photographic images .
Laughing moptop - era Beatles race towards the camera as if in an outtake from Help !
- only this time not with screaming fans but a copper in hot pursuit .
Bob Dylan sits in a limousine cradling a cat .
A man we presume is Sam Cooke lies murdered in a motel room .
Rock Dreams led immediately to important commissions .
Bowie had him deliver the artwork for Diamond Dogs , with the singer as some louche , human - headed dog , part - whippet , part - sphinx , totally under the skin of the public perception of Bowie at this point in his career .
Peellaert did the cover for
It 's Only Rock'n'Roll in the same year .
Among the acts he subsequently painted for were Guy BÃ©art ( BÃ©art chante l'espace ) , Bowie ( Bowie at the Beeb ) , Willie Deville ( A Horse of a Different Color ) , Lio ( Ballades and its counterpart Pop Songs ) and , just released , Second Sex 's Petite mort .
He was also active , especially during the 1980s , as a film poster artist for films from , among others , Robert Altman , Robert Bresson , Francis Ford Coppola , Martin Scorsese and Wim Wenders .
He notably reprised his fantasy images with Las Vegas - The Big Room ( 1986 ) , on which Michael Herr collaborated .
Each book took years to create .
The Big Room took 11 .
In an interview with the Guardian in 1986 , he said : "" If I do two more [ like this ] I 'm going to be dead . ""
He completed one more - the culmination of his sequence of fantasies , 20th Century Dreams ( 1999 ) .
He is survived by his wife Elizabeth and son Orson .

2009-03-13,"Harry Hammond , who has died at the age of 88 , was the first great photographer of British rock'n'roll , chronicling the first decade of that music , up to and including the emergence of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones .
He photographed every major American rocker who visited Britain , from Bill Haley through to Jerry Lee Lewis , Little Richard and Eddie Cochran .
His shots of Gene Vincent , newly clad in black leather , were to be particularly influential on later stars , including David Bowie and Ian Dury , while his portrait of Buddy Holly on stage was to become the image for the long - running West End musical Buddy .
His work also embraced the first British response to rock'n'roll , with the definitive photos of Lonnie Donegan , Cliff Richard , Billy Fury and Adam Faith .
Many of these were taken on the sets of the pioneering television shows of the late 1950s Six - Five Special and Oh Boy ! , capturing clearly the drama and excitement created by the shows ' producer , Jack Good .
Born in Bow in the East End of London , Hammond left school aged 14 , and , with interests in science and art , was apprenticed as a photographer to the London Art Service in Fleet Street .
Four years later , he moved to Bassano , the leading society photographers , taking portraits of the aristocracy and leading literary figures .
His career was soon interrupted by the outbreak of the second world war and he joined the RAF , serving as a reconnaissance photographer in the north African campaign .
While there , he met his future wife , Peggy , who was a physical training instructor in the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force .
On his return to London , Hammond resumed his coverage of society events , though now as a freelance .
He became interested in the musicians performing at the balls and fashion shows he was shooting and , following them back to their natural habitat , found himself falling in love with the world of Tin Pan Alley - Denmark Street , the home of London 's music industry .
By the end of the 1940s , his work was increasingly centred on providing images both for the music press and sheet music covers .
The promoter Maurice Kinn provided regular commissions .
Kinn bought the struggling Musical Express and relaunched it in 1952 as the New Musical Express .
Hammond soon became its primary photographer , and his most famous work was to appear in its pages .
Shortly after its relaunch , the NME introduced the first record charts in Britain .
By following the chart acts , it created a new readership for music papers , shifting the focus away from the musicians - at whom the market leader , Melody Maker , was aimed - and on to consumers .
The NME was thus much quicker in picking up new trends , in particular identifying the emerging teenage market .
Hammond was an enthusiastic accomplice in this process , following every trend of the early 1950s , from swing to trad jazz and skiffle , from ballads to calypso .
Among his subjects were Billie Holliday ( the only shots at her only British gig ) , Judy Garland ( "" the only time I ever came close to ardour "" ) and Eartha Kitt ( "" the most uncooperative "" ) .
He struck up friendships with many , particularly Frank Sinatra , whose 1953 UK tour was so ill - attended that he considered quitting the industry .
Then came rock'n'roll , a development viewed by many as a passing fad .
Hammond was one of the few to take the new sounds seriously , and - according his subjects the respect , courtesy and professionalism he had been taught 20 years earlier - he secured seminal images of the era .
He was still working into the early years of the beat boom , shooting the Beatles onstage at the NME poll - winners concert and an early session with the Rolling Stones , as well as the Searchers , the Animals and Arthur Brown .
As rival photographers came into a world that had been his sole preserve , he became disenchanted with the changing relationship between artist and photographer .
He retired from shooting rock acts in the mid-1960s ( though he continued to manage bands ) , and instead concentrated on less pressured areas of work .
In the late 1980s , following successful exhibitions , the Victoria and Albert museum , London , acquired his archive .
A book based on his photos was published as Halfway to Paradise last year , and a touring exhibition starts this year .
In recent years he devoted himself to his wife , who had retouched many of his classic images , his daughter , Carole , and his granddaughter , Lucy , all of whom survive him .

Harold Richard Hammond , photographer , born 18 July 1920 ; died 4 February 2009"
2009-03-29,"The annual musical binge that is Southbank 's Meltdown Festival has taken on a decidedly chi - chi quality in recent years , with the likes of David Bowie , Patti Smith and Jarvis Cocker acting as both star headliners and savvy directors .
This year the venue has selected a very different eminence as frontman and curator , American jazz legend Ornette Coleman .
It 's a brave choice ; Coleman is hardly a household name .
No one is yet sure who will be brought in by the Pulitzer Prize winner , who at 78 can still shine and startle as a performer , as he showed at the Royal Festival Hall two years ago .
He will perform two shows as part of the Meltdown programme .
From the outset he has attracted acolytes and detractors in equal measure .
His landmark albums , The Shape of Jazz to Come ( 1959 ) and Free Jazz ( 1960 ) were revolutionary , dispensing with chord structures in favour of improvisation , with Ornette starring on quirky plastic alto sax .
Subsequently he explored world music , classical composition - 1972 's Skies of America was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra - and electric jazz .
Along the way he also took up trumpet and violin , and inducted his son , Denardo , as his drummer .
Since then Ornette and Denardo have become a family firm , and the drummer will doubtless leave his imprint on Meltdown 2009 .
Coleman himself is clearly just getting attuned to his role as musical director , proving as keen to talk metaphysics as music , though his passion for creation is undiminished .
"" I write every day , "" he says .
"" I prefer the title of composer to jazz musician , and composing ideas , not just musical ones , that can serve humanity . ""
His outlook , he says , and the musical system he terms "" harmolodics "" , has always been shaped by his early life in Fort Worth , Texas .
His first love was the blues , and despite a reputation as a champion of dissonance , his playing has retained a bluesy feel .
"" I was born in the South , where there was n't much opportunity , and I have never wanted to feed that class system , a monarchy system in sound .
I have never liked categories .
Whoever is playing the notes , they 're still the same notes . ""
On Skies of America , I say , he has a track called "" The Men
Who Live in the White House "" - what about the new guy in residence there ? ""
That number was asking what do those people want to achieve - is it to help us become better human beings and to make existence more valuable ?
Human beings are the most valuable asset on earth . ""
Denardo is more direct .
"" I do n't care for all the dire talk going on , "" he says .
"" Maybe this is a good time for people committed to freedom in music , in art . ""
That 's an ethos that fits Meltdown , which seems likely to include a strong New York contingent - sax player John Zorn , perhaps , who cut a Coleman tribute album , bassist Charlie Haden , whom Ornette cites as his closest ally in pursuit of "" what we call The Idea "" , or light - hearted Lou Reed , who has also worked with him .
"" It 's early days , "" says Denardo of any line - up .
Watch this space .

2009-05-22,"The history of rock and pop music comes replete with alter egos : Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust , country and western star Garth Brooks 's barmy attempt to convince a baffled American public he was actually an Australian alt - rock singer called Chris Gaines .
But none are quite like Sasha Fierce , the drag queen - inspired diva who occupies one disc of BeyoncÃ© 's most recent double album , and a considerable portion of her live show .
Most alter egos conspire to make their creators look more interesting but Sasha Fierce seems to have had the opposite effect .
The half of the album supposedly essayed by Sasha seems to contain pretty much everything that 's unequivocally great about BeyoncÃ© 's records : wildly futuristic , sexy r'n'b , performed with a gusto so unbridled it borders on the faintly disturbing .
The half of the album that BeyoncÃ© kept insisting revealed "" the real me "" made her sound like a dead loss : dreary MOR ballads packed with gloopy self - help sentiment .
You listened to it and thought , if that 's the real her , no wonder Jay - Z wears that grumpy expression .
The problem is less immediately apparent live , thanks to the sheer opulence of her show .
Last year , Forbes reported that she had earned $ 80 m in 12 months , a considerable portion of which seems to have been ploughed back into costumes and lights and high definition films .
The ballads might sound like such an open incitement to head to the bar that they might as well be sponsored by Carling , but at least there 's always something to keep your eyes occupied .
During Smash Into You , the wind machines blew a force nine gale , while she performed the dreary Ave Maria in a white swimsuit that was transformed into a wedding dress , with a train so wide it should require planning permission .
More diverting still , introducing Me Myself and
I she delivered a sermon on female empowerment while sporting a metallic breastplate with lights on her bosom and what appeared to be a large car headlamp covering her crotch .
Still , there 's no getting around the fact that BeyoncÃ© 's ' real strength lies delivering frantic uptempo tracks .
An opening salvo of songs that began with Crazy
In Love and took in a powerful version of Freakum Dress was astonishing .
As she performed it all the production wizardry seemed superfluous : BeyoncÃ© might need costumes and technical support , but Sasha Fierce could keep an arena audience gripped with the sheer force of her personality ."

2009-06-20,"Now in its 16th year , the Southbank Centre 's Meltdown festival has netted a wide range of curators , from John Peel to David Bowie , Massive Attack to Morrissey .
This year 's choice
( it 's also a bit of a coup ) , the saxophonist , composer and musical visionary Ornette Coleman , must count among the most fruitful .
For one thing , he is the first sole black curator , and I 've never seen so many black faces in a Royal Festival Hall crowd as at the opening night 's main event , the Roots .
The Philadelphia hip - hop band 's MC , Black Thought , takes the stage to loud cheers , followed by drummer Ahmir "" Questlove "" Thompson .
The latter , eventually joined by the rest of the band , kicks up a storm as the MC raps , non - stop , for half an hour without breaking sweat ; an astonishing performance , and the crowd , on their feet since the first minute , are dancing in their places all night .
There are plenty of other shades in the band 's palette .
Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid produces jangling arpeggios , followed by Frank Zappa - esque solos .
Jazz sounds abound amid the beats , and towards the end the group are joined by Ornette Coleman with tenor saxophonists David Murray and the 91-year - old Andy Hamilton .
Murray 's solos tear through the music , hard blasts building to high screeching and skronking .
Coleman is something else , his lilting alto starting on a high wail and descending through different scales - straight blues , free jazz which veers into classical ; it defies categorisation and is undeniably beautiful , possibly the essence of what he terms "" harmolodics "" , his philosophy of music .
The next night plays host to Yoko Ono and a band that includes her son Sean Lennon , Mark Ronson on bass and members of Japanese experimental pop band Cornelius .
Ono is a bounding sprite , a pint - size packet of energy , amazing for her 76 years .
She bowls about the stage warbling and yodelling on tracks such as vintage opener ""
Why ? ""
Her relationship with son Sean is sweet , and you ca n't help warming to them both ; his guitar is impressive , often veering into Magic Band or My Bloody Valentine territory .
Coleman appears tonight , too , as does the singer Antony Hegarty , a huge presence next to the tiny Yoko .
Their duet on new track
"" I 'm Going Away Smiling
"" is touching , with an amazing , elastic , cello - like solo on theremin from Pamelia Kurstin .
Senegalese singer - guitarist Baaba Maal and his band are great .
Starting slowly with "" Tindo "" , Maal hits his first high note two minutes in ; it resonates around the hall , and we 're away .
What a voice ; those hard , high notes , alternating with falsetto and tumbling scales .
The full band come on for the title track of new album Television , and are joined by guests .
VV Brown duets sweetly on the lovely "" Djarabi "" , while London rappers Kano and Bashy come on for "" A Song for Women "" .
The energy is astounding , especially when talking drum player Massamba Diop trades licks with the other two percussionists , Bahkane Seck and Mamadou Sarr .
Over in the Queen Elizabeth Hall I catch James Blood Ulmer , a disciple of Coleman , who takes the stage solo and sings to an open tuning on his electric guitar .
It 's rough blues interspersed with tightly packed runs of fast jazz figures , and his themes are often biblical , though two songs about Hurricane Katrina and one about his ornery grandfather stand out .
Patti Smith is one of the most anticipated gigs of the week , and the audience the most vocal .
Montreal post - rockers
the Silver Mt Zion Memorial Orchestra are her backing band
but she takes the stage solo for the signature "" Piss Factory "" and is then joined by SMZ leader Efrim Menuck on drums and Portishead 's Adrian Utley , who attacks a guitar with a paintbrush to spooky effect .
Smith 's daughter Jesse plays piano on a couple of numbers , one a nautical tribute to her late husband Fred "" Sonic "" Smith , before Red Hot Chili Pepper Flea takes the stage , backing her beatnik verse with a high bass loop over which he improvises .
I 'm delighted when the Master Musicians of Jajouka , who have played every afternoon for free , come on to blast us with their ancient pagan ritual music - wailing riffs from ghaita reed horns and hypnotic drumming ; Smith salutes them in a poem and joins in with squealing clarinet .
The full band produce an amazing sound , electric guitars fusing with the string section in a warm , wild noise .
Smith draws an intense performance from the pit of her soul on the first encore , "" Pissing in a River "" , and is dazed by the end .
A rich mix then , and it 's a sign of the esteem in which Coleman is held that so many fine musicians felt so clearly honoured to be part of his Meltdown .

2009-07-10,"After soaking himself in the music of Stravinsky , choreographing the composer 's three great ballet scores - Rite Of Spring , Apollo and Les Noces - Michael Clark returns to his roots .
His latest work , Thank U Ma'am , is inspired by the holy trinity of 1970s rock : David Bowie , Lou Reed and Iggy Pop .
Using tracks such as Heroes and The Jean Genie , Clark delivers his unique brand of neoclassical dancing and contemporary edge .
Dark themes of provocation , desire and power run through his work , shadowing his instinct for poetry of line and precision of detail .
The new work is paired with a revival of his 1986 classic Swamp , commemorating the 25th year of Clark 's career as a choreographer .
His lineup of dancers has never looked finer , including Kate Coyne , Melissa Hetherington , Stephen Beagley , Oxana Panchenko and Ellen van Schuylenburch .
Clark himself also makes a brief appearance ."
2009-07-17,"Aiming to reflect both "" the iridescent public Eno and the vulnerable everyman Brian "" , Sheppard deftly shows how growing up near a US airbase , attending art school in the 60s and being exposed there to the work of avant - garde composers all helped to shape the androgynous randy dandy who played synthesiser for Roxy Music .
He then traces Eno 's myriad adventures after tension between him and Bryan Ferry forced him out of the band , including solo albums , celebrated collaborations with David Bowie , Talking Heads , U2 and others , inventing ambient music , producing art , theorising and publishing his diary .
The anecdotes are entertaining throughout ( as when John Cale claims he caught Eno about to attack him from behind with chopsticks in a studio power struggle ) , admiration and facetiousness are deliciously blended , and Sheppard 's writing is splendidly vivid .
He seems to tire towards the end , devoting relatively little space to the last 25 years , but that 's the only flaw in a book that sets new standards for rock biography ."
2009-07-18,"Many fathers are eager to hand the family business down to their sons and Duncan Jones 's dad was no exception .
He wanted his son to become a rock star , or a musician of some description , but instead Jones has grown up to be a film director and his highly accomplished - and perfectly timed - debut feature , Moon , went on general release on Friday .
David Bowie , for he is the father , can blame his son 's career choice on his own love affair with cinema .
The glam rock star made his first major appearance as an actor in Nic Roeg 's The Man
Who Fell to Earth in 1976 , when Duncan was five .
At home in Kent , where Jones spent his early years , father and son would play around with cameras and make stop - motion animations using Star Wars figurines .
Later , Jones witnessed the real thing , hanging out with his father on the sets of films such as Labyrinth and getting a sneak preview of his future profession .
Once you 've clocked that his father once sang about Martian spiders and floating around space in tin cans , you can understand a little better why Jones , who is 38 , has a deep - rooted passion for science fiction .
Moon , based on an original story by Jones , is the result of many hours spent reading the mind - bending works of Philip K Dick and watching contemplative extraterrestrial classics such as 2001 :
A Space Odyssey and Outland
The film is set in a not - so - distant future - the moon can be manned on a permanent basis and Sam Bell is the caretaker of a lonely mining station on its dark side .
As his three - year shift draws to an end and he prepares to return to his young family on Earth , Bell begins to have disturbing visions that send his understanding of his job and , ultimately , his own identity into metaphysical meltdown .
Bell is played by the excellent Sam Rockwell .
His companion , the talking computer system Gerty , a close relative of Hal from 2001 , is voiced by Kevin Spacey .
To a genre in thrall to relentless action and thunderous explosions , Jones reintroduces a welcome sense of quiet , or disquiet , and a plot that prompts audiences to think rather than merely to react .
The action in Moon is largely psychological , but that 's not to say that the film does n't deliver the visual goods .
Considering Jones and his team were working with Â£ 2.6 m , a minuscule budget for a sci - fi movie , and using old - fashioned models manipulated by catgut instead of expensive , computer - generated effects , their finished product looks startlingly good .
It 's a smart bit of scheduling that the film has come out on the very weekend of the 40th anniversary of the first manned moon landings , but Moon is also topical in other ways .
An updated version of such classic ecological sci - fi pictures as Silent Running
, it addresses the need for clean fuel sources at a time when dirty energy is a burning issue .
The American corporation that Bell works for is mining Helium-3 , a source of clean energy that really does exist on the moon and which Jones believes is "" the only financially viable reason to go "" there .
( That the corporation turns out to be exploitative only makes the film more relevant . )
Trudie Styler , whose production company , Xingu Films , helped raise extra money for Moon , hopes that the film will appeal to people who 'd usually give sci - fi a wide berth .
And she has nothing but good things to say about its director , whom she has known for seven years .
"" If I were a betting person , I 'd bet heavily that he 's going to go all the way to the top , "" she told the Observer Jones 's future did n't always look so bankable .
Money , connections and media attention can be a gift for a young scion seeking to outshine his or her famous parent , but they can also be a curse and some , like Jones , go to great lengths to avoid them .
"" I saw the drawbacks of fame as a kid , "" he has said .
"" I think if you 're young and you 're being compared with a successful family member , it 's really hard to maintain any sense of self - worth and credibility . ""
His path to Moon , which he made without any financial support from his father , was anything but straightforward .
Jones was born in 1971 and , until now , he has perhaps been best known for his middle name which , notoriously , rendered him Zowie Bowie , a feast for any playground predator .
Wisely , he adapted it to Joey and at 19 he reverted to the more robust name on his passport , which has helped him conceal his celebrity ties for most of his adult life .
David Bowie 's fame was in the ascendant in 1971 but his marriage to Duncan 's mother , Angie , was falling apart and a divorce was officially granted when Jones was nine .
He has n't seen his mother since he was 13 .
His childhood was spent with his father , which meant living all over the world , and frequently joining his father on tour .
At 13 , he went to Gordonstoun , the Scottish boarding school , a miserable experience for this shy , bookish young man who now cheerfully refers to himself as a "" geek "" .
He was expelled for sleeping through his A - levels - he says he was too stressed to cope with them - and without qualifications he went to London , where he worked for six months at Jim Henson 's Creature Shop .
After a stint counselling children with learning difficulties in Switzerland , he moved to the US and returned to academia .
He won a scholarship to read philosophy at a college in rural Ohio .
An ill - fated romance drew him to Vanderbilt University , where he began a PhD , but he quit after breaking up with his girlfriend .
( Romantic complications also permeated the Moon shoot , during which he was trying , like his lead character , to sustain a difficult long - term relationship . ""
Girls seem to get me in trouble a lot of times , "" he says . )
Finally , he put his love of cinema into practice and enrolled at the London International Film School , but there was still some way to go before this self - confessed "" eternal student "" took on a major project of his own .
He served his apprenticeship under Tony Scott on a TV version of The Hunger and applied what he 'd learnt to a short film called Whistle in 2002 .
At Scott 's advice , he went into advertising and worked on commercials for McCain oven chips and Heinz ketchup .
A commercial he directed for French Connection was dubbed the "" kung - fu lesbian advert "" .
At last he was ready to take the leap and direct a feature .
"" I 'm glad I 've waited until now , to be honest , "" says Jones .
"" I was a bit of a delicate flower growing up
and I think it could have damaged me if I tried to do it any younger . ""
He devised the story for Moon with Sam Rockwell in mind and Nathan Parker , son of film director Alan , wrote the screenplay .
It was shot at Shepperton Studios in just 33 days .
When Moon had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival , David Bowie flew in unannounced to see the fruit of his son 's labours .
"" It was quite emotional for both of us , "" Jones said afterwards , "" because he 's been waiting for me to get off my arse and do what it is that I 'm going to do with my life .
At the Q&amp;A afterwards , I thanked him and said that I really appreciated that he gave me the time to work out what I wanted to do , because it 's taken me a while .
"" Moon was warmly received at Sundance , hailed as "" one of the most original sci - fi films in years "" .
At the Edinburgh International Film Festival last month , it won the Michael Powell award for best British debut .
"" I 'm real proud of it , "" Sam Rockwell told the Observer recently , adding : "" I just think Duncan was born to do this .
I 'd really like to work with him again . ""
He describes Jones as "" affable , a little shy , and kind of childlike , but really sharp .
There are a lot of assholes in this business so it 's nice to meet somebody who is courteous and thoughtful and sensitive .
You do n't get that a lot . ""
Jones sometimes gives the impression that he profoundly regrets having to relinquish his hard - won anonymity , but Styler insists he can be quite an extrovert .
"" I actually think that he 's really blossoming and taking the stage himself now .
In a way , it 's been wonderful for him . ""
"" He 's having some fun , "" Rockwell agrees .
"" I think it 's good for him because I do n't think he has been comfortable in the limelight , probably because of his father .
Now it 's about him .
The success of this film has nothing to do with his dad .
It 's all him .
It 's his baby . ""
"" I hope , by the second or the third film , who my father is wo n't be a story anyone 's interested in , "" Jones has said .
He wo n't have to wait long to find out .
Another sci - fi film , Mute , which he describes as "" my love letter to Blade Runner "" , is already in development and will be filmed in Berlin .
His third film is expected to be Escape From the Deep , a Second World War submarine thriller based on a true story . ""
Eventually I 'm going to be judged purely on my own merits , "" Jones says .
If the impact he has already made with his debut feature is anything to go by , it looks as though Duncan Jones can stop worrying about his father 's legacy right now .
The Jones lowdown Born : Beckenham , Kent , on 30 May 1971 to David Bowie and his first wife , Angie , who Bowie divorced in 1980 .
He attended Gordonstoun and university in the US and graduated from the London International Film School in 2001 .
Best of times : Right now : his directorial debut , Moon , has won many plaudits , and the Michael Powell award for the best new British feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival last month .
Worst of times : Getting kicked out of Gordonstoun without A - levels and drifting aimlessly through his twenties , strained by the pressure to emulate his father 's success : "" I was angry and frustrated when I was younger and did n't know my place in the world . ""
What he says : "" I was massively geeky .
I was never the kid who would have been invited to that [ celebrity ] stuff -
I was painfully shy and not comfortable around that crowd .
You would never have seen me on any party scene , which is probably what made me able to disappear , in a way , because the tabloids had nothing to follow .
I did n't do anything . ""
What they say : "" It 's nice to work with directors who have a good bedside manner .
I think he was born to do this .
I think he 's really got a future .
And he 's smart .
He took an interest in what I was interested in .
For a young director , he has a great curiosity and that 's key if you 're a beginner . ""

2009-07-31,"Crooner Richard Sutton , aka Rik Suntan , plays his local club for Â£ 15 a session , covering old Cliff Richard numbers and dreaming of making it big .
What he does n't know is that he has the soul of David Bowie , switched from the star 's body in the 70s by occult dabbler Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin .
Suntan 's attempts to climb the ladder to superstardom are thwarted by a host of nefarious rogues intent on using his soul for their own ends .
It sounds daft , and the combination of occult shenanigans and grotty urban realism sits uneasily on the page , but Williams 's brilliant first - person portrayal of Rik Suntan redeems the novel .
His egotistical , self - regarding quest for fame , driven by Bowie 's soul but hampered by a cleft lip and little talent , is at once pathetic , tragic and wonderfully entertaining ."
2009-08-13,"Here 's a high school movie with its heart in the right place , displaying a likable enthusiasm for classic rock'n'roll , and also , with its references to Beckett , Austen , Willa Cather and Robert Louis Stevenson , displaying an interesting reverence for the quaint business of reading books .
Gaelan Connell plays Ben , the standard - issue alienated new guy at a new school , with an educated taste for David Bowie .
He falls , hard , for an indie chick called Sa5 m ( the "" 5 "" is silent ) played by Vanessa Hudgens , this week 's second High School Musical graduate .
But he is also head - spinningly befriended by super - hot blonde Charlotte ( Alyson Michalka ) who wants him to manage her band ; they 're fixing to compete in a live - music competition called Bandslam .
The movie 's problem is the division of loyalties between these two female leads , which fatally divides and muddles the dramatic focus .
Just to make us all feel old , Lisa Kudrow plays Will 's mom .
On the other hand , there 's a game cameo from a very venerable rock legend who will make anyone feel very young ."
2009-08-20,"Cocksure Vincent Frank , who is Frankmusik , or Vince to his friends , and whose smart sharp hit debut album Complete Me is advertised everywhere at the moment , so his slightly sulky photo , neat head extremely shaved , eyes checking you out because you 're checking him out , is pasted either side of my Sainsburys Local , and he pops up full of pop and ' look at me listen to me buy me ' in ad breaks during Big Brother , was born in 1985 .
I point this out because by then I was 28 , and it never occurred to me then that 24 years later I would be talking with a new pop star , influenced as much by the Doobie Brothers and ELO as David Bowie and Japan , who would look like a member of 1982 Depeche Mode and yet not hide a love for Foreigner and Bread .
He makes a dance singed entertainment electro - pop that somehow figures out a world where Bronski Beat influenced Marmalade and Prefuse 73 dream of Dire Straits .
I chat to him now and then because I 'm increasingly fascinated by young new musicians operating inside the fluid , infinite post - single post - album world , who make music influenced by specific vinyl era shapes , structures and dynamics .
The pop likes of Vince , who write their own music to get things out of their system and to meet people , and who make music using computers , samples , plug - ins and programmes , talk about the music that was around before they were born in a very different way from those of us who heard the music as it was being made .
There 's a gently surreal dislocation in the air therefore as wily , whimsical baby pop singers like Vince , with their vaguely conceptual projects , pick and choose from the past without inheriting some of the social pressures and cultural prejudices that tended to stop those of us at the time slipping more openly from say Cabaret Voltaire to Chairman of the Board .
Vince picks up various signals from those of a certain age that there might once have been something not so cool about fancying ELO , but he can not quite work out why that is the case .
In his eyes and ears , and to some extent this could be described as a proto - disco attitude , ELO segue nicely into Yazoo , which then fit into Shades of Rhythm and then into Jean Michael Jarre and then around the edges of Hamilton Bohannon , Billy Joel and Bonobo .
Vince and I somehow came from roughly the same place but are separated by how each of us approach music because we were born decades apart .
We are roughly speaking the same language - file under pop - but we 're gently separated from each other because we learnt the language on different planets in different time zones breathing different air seeing different visions wanting altogether different things with very different amounts of time left in our lives .
I meet him at his gran 's house in Thornton Heath , at the decaying edge of Croydon , South London , a few days before his album is released .
He sleeps and works there , inhabiting a young man 's cheerfully rumpled bedroom , looking like he never does much other than quickly pass through on the way to miscellaneous passionate encounters , with a small side room filled with his recording equipment , a tiny kitchen area and a brand new piano he 's just bought which he is very proud of .
He tells the standard working class story of how when he walked into the grand instrument shop he was treated as if he was more likely to shop lift than spend some serious money on a piano that he actually plays quite beautifully .
If his album sales continue to impress the way they did during the first few days of release he may soon be leaving run down Thornton Heath and heading for parts that sparkle a little more .
The cover photograph from his new album was taken in his kitchen , and if you look closely you might be able to detect the wary gaze of a young man trying hard to convince you that the photo is not taken in his gran 's timeworn but cosy house but in some glamorous unspecifiable location .
I like the fact he does not smile on the cover .
There 's a subtle note of defiance , and there is indeed something attractively unapologetically brittle about his approach to life and career .
I arrive a few minutes early , and his elderly gran cautiously answers the door .
After she realises that despite my age I am here to play with Vince and not sell her something or demand anything , she conspiratorially advises me that it 's no use relying on his punctuality .
He 's not likely to be where he says he will be at the time he says he will be there .
It turns out he 's late because of some other promotional obligation in central London .
This involved him reviewing some records for a magazine , which seems to have riled him a bit .
He has a little bit of a whinge about how he did n't expect it to take so long , and then we get down to business .
He always seems like he 's in the middle of something , racing between one duty and another , liking being busy , liking how he 's found a way not to be pinned down by some regular job , but able to use his love and knowledge of pop music to become a part of pop himself .
I sometimes think there 's a faint melancholy in these zealous new young pop traditionalists / archaeologists that they were n't around when the music they 're passionate about was on vinyl and had more of a direct impact on the social and cultural environment .
This is allied with a sense of apprehension that those comforting old structures and belief systems are insistently collapsing , replaced at the moment with an environment that is fiercely and almost completely commercial , and also a sense of excitement , that there are multiple ways to potentially reach and enthral an audience .
At the moment , the music transmitted throughout this radical new commercial environment is reminiscent of music that would have been around twenty , thirty , even forty years go , give or take an amount of techno tweaking and image massaging .
This music is aggressively but not necessarily sentimentally nostalgic for when music craved a future , and more recognisably defined various generational anxieties .
Rather than ask Vince of Frankmusik - who makes what can safely be called electrodisco(soul)pop - various questions about what disco means to him , I thought I should just ask him to sketch out his version of a disco track .
Within minutes of him arriving back at his studio at his gran 's place overlooking an exhausted looking south London street , he 's speedily constructing the outline of a song using electronically generated parts and found sections to reflect a particular personal disco idea of combining deep light headed light hearted joy , shallow pleasure , soul yearning , and an abstract element of unashamed giddy idiocy .
A couple of cigarettes seem to help the juices flow and the mind race .
It 's like hearing a radio being tuned .
In this case the radio is Vince 's mind as he raids his memories of the old time good time disco
he heard growing up in the 1990s .
I quickly hear traces of Crown Heights Affair , Yellow Magic Orchestra and that camp period when Chicago flipped and went more Bee Gees than Blood Sweat and Tears .
A song actually does emerge , one that demonstrates the Vince extroverted electro - view of disco as ear catching mutant show business pop .
It means that this month 's Showing Off has its own theme tune , because , as disco often makes very clear whether through voice , rhythm or surprising remix , life is the name of the game ."
2009-08-28,"Do n't expect many compromises from Danielle Ward .
Jokes on comfortable subjects are few and far between , as she tackles things like self - mutilation , clinical social inadequacy and specific details of David Bowie 's back catalogue .
While it 's not the most accessible menu on the fringe , the resulting hour of comedy is wonderfully thought - provoking , with the kind of finely crafted writing that you 'd expect from a Radio 4 regular .
In Lies , Ward starts with a deceptively typical fringe show premise - suggesting that what she 's offering is an exploration of her inability to lie convincingly , and the possible reasons behind it - before developing through a number of surreal interludes ( which , she sarcastically claims , are designed to show off her acting skills ) , to a denouement that messes with audience expectations in an understated but deeply peculiar way .

Over his 20-year career he has collaborated with Siouxsie Sioux , the Stranglers and David Bowie , got Uri Geller to paint and , weirdly , discovered that Ken Russell likes to talk to God on a purple telephone .

2009-09-29,"Happy first birthday , Absolute Radio !
The station formerly known as Virgin Radio relaunched on 29 September last year with David Bowie 's Absolute Beginners ( what else ? ) .
Have the ch - ch - changes been to your liking , or has it , er , turned to ashes ?
A better future , or a bunch of scary monsters ( and super creeps ) ?
The station 's chief operating officer , Clive Dickens , promised to open up the station 's playlist , saying it would be "" deeper , wider and less repetitious "" than Virgin .
He also promised it would be "" irreverent and cheeky "" with an emphasis on personality DJs .
To this end he has introduced two stand - up comics , Frank Skinner and Dave Gorman , to its weekend schedule , switched former evening presenter Geoff Lloyd to drivetime , promoted one - time 11 O'Clock Show host Iain Lee to weekdays and backed Christian O'Connell on breakfast .
But what of the playlist ?
In the week up to 27 September , Absolute 's top five most - played songs were The Temper Trap 's Sweet Disposition ( 35 plays ) , Muse 's Uprising ( 30 ) , Florence and the Machine 's Drumming Song ( 28 ) ,
Kasabian 's Where Did All The Love Go ?
( 25 ) and Stellify by Ian Brown , which was heard 22 times in the week , according to the station 's own figures .
Bon Jovi , Kings of Leon , Mumford and Sons and the station 's former favourite band when it was still known as Virgin â Snow Patrol â were also high up the playlist .
A turn for the better , or are you yearning for Virgin ?
Relaunching in the midst of a recession was hardly ideal for Dickens or the station 's new owners , the Times of India Group , a subsidiary of which paid SMG Â£ 53.2 m for the station in June last year .
The Absolute chief executive , Donnach O'Driscoll , set a pre - launch target of 3 million listeners , but the station 's first official audience figures saw a 20 % fall from 2.35 million to 1.89 million , and in the final three months of last year reached a low of just 1.49 million .
The station blamed listener confusion over the name change , which undoubtedly played its part .
The decline has since been stemmed , but with an average weekly audience of 1.69 million in the second quarter of this year , it is still nearly 30 % down on Virgin 's audience in the same period last year .
And one of its two digital stations , Absolute Radio Xtreme , has seen its weekly audience fall to just 58,000 .
O'Connell did his bit for the station 's profile with a little help from David Cameron , of course , but I thought the station missed a trick with its big marketing push , featuring actor Jordan Prentice , who you might remember from In Bruges .
They said they were going for "" squirm humour "" , but they appeared to forget the humour bit .
The scale of the challenge ahead remains immense , not just for Absolute Radio but the whole of commercial radio .
Absolutely ."

It comments : "" As a result the full year results are anticipated to be slightly ahead of the board 's expectations .
In the second half there were good chart performances from The Gossip , Bat for Lashes and The Horrors building on the first half successes which included White Lies , The Fleet Foxes and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs .

2009-11-07,"This month sees the 30th anniversary of "" the magazine that 's not as funny as it used to be "" .
Viz , Chris Donald 's foul - mouthed comic , evolved from a 12-page fanzine hawked around Newcastle 's pubs into one of the country 's highest - selling titles , shifting over a million copies an issue with celebrity fans ranging from David Bowie to Simon Bates .
Since that 1990 peak , sales have declined to around the 100,000 mark ; however , the comic which first posed the then - unanswered question "" Morrissey ; pop genius or twat ? "" is still going strong as it enters its fourth decade .
Viz 's influence on British comedy has been profound .
Its squalid brand of anarchy and self - referential surrealism is present in everything from Mitchell and Webb and The League Of Gentlemen to Little Britain and The Daily Mash .
And while its writers resist serious analysis , Viz 's most overlooked quality has always been a furious intelligence .
As its numerous , pathetic imitators ( Smut , Zit , Brain Damage etc ) proved , a comic can not survive on profanity alone and Viz strips like Biffa Bacon , Sid The Sexist and The Fat Slags tell you more about the national character than many literary heavyweights .
In a tongue - in - cheek documentary , Auberon Waugh suggested that "" if the future generations look back on the literature of the age , they 'll more usefully look to Viz than they would , for instance , the novels of Peter Ackroyd or Julian Barnes , because Viz has a genuine vitality of its own which comes from the society which it represents "" .
His favourite strip was The Bottom Inspectors , by the way .
The classic premise of situation comedy has always been that of a man trapped in his surroundings ; and this is the case in Viz 's finest strips , the characters poignantly locked in a doomed cycle by their giant testicles , religious fervour , undiagnosed autism , painful haemorrhoids , and terminal stupidity .
Writer Graham Dury claims a core readership of "" the well educated , the unemployed and people in prison "" and Viz speaks to the parts of Britain that have a simmering and instinctive dislike of the rich , the show - offs , the moronic and the vain .
Viz has been entirely prescient about where our culture is going .
Once , its obsession with third - rate celebrities , Roger Mellie 's endless ideas for cheap television ( "" I 've got an idea , Tom â Celebrity Shit Bucket ! "" ) , dishonest overselling , and ludicrously hyperbolic real - life stories seemed like flights of fancy .
Now , they look like the vast majority of the modern media .
"" We pride ourselves on the fact you 're no cleverer when you 've read Viz , "" says Dury .
"" You might have had a few laughs , but you 've not learnt anything . ""
If that really is the case , then the fault lies with the reader , not the comic ."
2009-11-18,"Viewers of BBC4 's Synth Britannia would have seen Gary Numan 's peers virtually queuing up to heap praise on Middlesex 's foremost purveyor of dystopian pop electronica .
Which was something of a surprise : at the height of his fame , one of Numan 's weirder characteristics was his ability to attract hatred from other musicians .
His hero David Bowie had him thrown off a television show , then wrote a song about how much he disliked him .
"" I 've never met the guy , "" chipped in Mick Jagger , "" but he 's one of those people you absolutely loathe . ""
Listening to him perform his biggest album , 1979 's The Pleasure Principle , it 's difficult to see why anyone was so upset by him , unless they had an aversion to choral - sounding synthesizers and songs about alienated robots : Engineers and Conversation bear the mark of a man adept at balancing commerciality with more avant - garde concerns .
That 's not to say there are n't problems here .
In more recent years , Numan has reinvented himself as a godfather of industrial rock .
Occasionally , The Pleasure Principle 's songs sound awkward resting on top of the genre 's standard - issue distorted bass guitar and pummelling drums , something that , to his credit , does n't seem to pass Numan by . ""
That was a bit rubbish actually , "" he offers between songs .
Indeed , he seems more comfortable performing newer material .
So do his fans : weirdly subdued even during Cars , they get more excited when he breaks out the distorted guitars , which must be gratifying for the man on stage : perhaps uniquely among his 80s contemporaries , Numan 's fans seem less interested in his past than his present .
Headbanging , synthpop 's former whipping boy looks like a man enjoying the last laugh .

These days it 's the far more sensible Duncan Jones , and tonight he emerged triumphantly from the very large shadow of his father when he picked up two prizes at the British independent film awards .
Forty years after the first Moon landing and 40 years after his dad , David Bowie , released Space Oddity , Jones 's retro

Having outgrown its formative Britpop revival playlist , the night now embraces rock and indie classics of every era and ilk .
Resident DJs Debstar and Fabianski occasionally spin approved tracks from demos submitted by local bands alongside the likes of the Cribs , the Smiths , Passion Pit , Kings Of Leon , Blondie , the Cure and Friendly Fires .

The Black Cotton Club , London
Possibly the closest you 'll ever get to stopping by at Fat Sam 's Chicago speakeasy in Bugsy Malone â
but minus the whipped cream - shooting machine guns , sadly â
The Black Cotton Club is a suave vintage hangout which takes place in the swanky surrounds of burlesque bar VoluptÃ© .
This week 's special guest is Tony Diavolo , who 'll be appearing alongside regular record selectors Demi the Viper , El Nino and Lady Kamikaze .
Playing the more rootsy , rocky and low - down sounds from the 1920s through to the 40s , the Black Cotton Club mixes up satin - swathed glamour with dirty grind sleaze .
Gypsy jazz will be spun alongside the brilliant - sounding "" reefer rhumba "" , as well as more slinky swing , balboa and bebop tunes .
If you 've got a few hours to kill before The Black Cotton Club opens for business , ukulele - brandishing cabaret performer Tricity Vogue appears in the evening .
VoluptÃ© , EC4 , Fri Leonie Cooper The UV Freeze Rave , Southampton
With most punters destitute and detoxing , it takes a rare kind of courage to host a night during clubland 's official Graveyard Week .
So fair play to the delightfully monikered student party specialists
Let 's Get F*cked for laying on all the bells'n'whistles for their inaugural show of the new decade this Thursday at this , ahem , "" rough and ready "" home of scholar - centric over - indulgence .
Their UV Freeze Rave features massive snow and UV cannons plus the chance to indulge in the exotic delights of a free vodka luge .
There are also free vodka shots and glowsticks on entry , plus 20p shot girls to numb the new year pain .
Music almost seems secondary among such a dazzling cornucopia of delights .
But in case you 're interested , it 's a floor - friendly mix of dance and chart classics plus contemporary hits .

2010-01-08,"Enemies of Coldplay might not yet be able to send the band on a one - way trip to oblivion , but at least fans can now use one of their album covers for postage .
A teeny - tiny version of A Rush of the Blood to the Head is among 10 new stamps issued by the Royal Mail , honouring iconic LPs from the last 40 years .
Calling them "" some of the most potent graphic images of modern times "" , the Royal Mail has announced miniature tributes to the Rolling Stones '
Let It Bleed ,
Led Zeppelin 's IV , David Bowie 's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , Mike Oldfield 's Tubular Bells , the Clash 's London Calling , New Order 's Power , Corruption and Lies , Primal Scream 's Screamadelica , Pink Floyd 's The Division Bell , Blur 's Parklife and Coldplay 's 2002 album .
By purchasing certain Royal Mail souvenir packs , you even get , er , liner notes .
The Royal Mail claims to have undertaken a "" lengthy research process "" to choose which albums to celebrate , but despite the finalists ' relative variety , however , there 's no sign of straight pop , let alone hip - hop , jazz , folk or R&amp;B.
That 's either because the Royal Mail 's curators do n't like the Streets ' album covers â or because they 're too busy combing through back - issues of Mojo .
Then again , they can always blame it on the Queen : according to the BBC , Her Majesty approved every design .
To celebrate such endorsement , Coldplay launched a contest to give away one of the new stamps to a fan .
"" We visited our local post office earlier today and bought some of the Coldplay stamps , "" the band wrote on their website .
"" Very nice they are too . ""
Somewhere out there , someone 's getting a lucky 44p prize ."
2010-01-14,"No artist 's musical past has come back to haunt them quite like David Bowie 's .
There he was in 1973 , the world 's most cutting - edge pop star :
half the country certain he 's rock 's saviour , the other half terrified , seemingly convinced he actually is some kind of gay alien sex demagogue on Earth to corrupt youth .
He has achieved this via stunning records and provocations : telling the press he 's homosexual , pretending to fellate his guitarist on stage , suddenly announcing his retirement .
It has all been brilliantly planned and executed , which makes the reappearance of music he made years before devising Ziggy Stardust all the more agonising .
Worse , the song his old label has rereleased and seen rise to No 6 in the charts is The Laughing Gnome , a 1967 novelty that has also been covered by crooner Ronnie Hilton .
The Laughing Gnome fitted perfectly with Hilton 's oeuvre Ã¢â¬ â his big hit being that one about a mouse living in a windmill in old Amsterdam Ã¢â¬ â which obviously makes it profoundly unsuitable material for a terrifying gay alien sex demagogue to be caught singing in public .
Perhaps understandably , Bowie long evinced a strained relationship with his 60s work , first ignoring it , then rerecording some of it in 2002 , for the unreleased album Toy .
Its reputation was further damaged by his former manager Kenneth Pitt 's book
The Pitt Report , notable both for a diverting interlude in which Bowie inadvertently sees Pitt 's penis and pretends to measure it while bellowing "" ye gods ! "" and its demented premise
that Bowie 's 60s work was unequivocally the artistic highlight of his career .
The other bit Ã¢â¬ â when he became the most important artist since the Beatles and somehow made four of the greatest albums ever while so maddened by cocaine he allegedly stored his own urine in the fridge in case a wizard stole it
Ã¢â¬ â was merely the unasked - for , complimentary
After Eight following the creative smorgasbord that was When I 'm Five and Ching - a - Ling .
It 's so insanely wrong - headed that it reflects badly on the music ; anything requiring that much special pleading must be rubbish .
Fans ' usual reaction to the eponymous debut album and singles contained on this deluxe edition is to note the themes that would inform his later work , then discreetly file them away : She 's Got Medals touches on sexual ambiguity ; Uncle Arthur on mental illness ; Maid of Bond Street on fame .
We Are Hungry Men , meanwhile , features an unexpected impersonation of Kenneth Williams alongside the first flowering of the obsession with dystopias and messianic dictators that would come to an unhappy head with some addled praise for Hitler in interviews circa the piss - in - the - fridge years .
Alas , his later dalliances with Nietzschean ubermensch theory passed without further recourse to his Williams impersonation : perhaps if he 'd interspersed his remarks about how a fascist leader would be good for Britain with a few cries of "" Ooh matron ! "" and "" Stop messin ' ABOUT ! ""
, it would have leavened the atmosphere a bit .
In fact Bowie spent the 60s doing exactly what he did for the rest of his career : trying on musical styles , from then - voguish mock Edwardiana to big orchestrated ballads .
The difference was that not all of them fit .
He could n't do Kinks - inspired satire , not least because the music he set it to reeked of cosy light entertainment : Join the Gang 's hippy - mocking seems hopelessly square , like something Dick Emery would have sung while wearing a kaftan .
Ching - a - Ling suggests trying out Incredible String Band acid - folk whimsy was the most catastrophic career decision he made until he opted to go dancing in the street with Mick Jagger :
"" I wish I played the doo - dah horn "" indeed .
And yet Bowie 's 60s work deserves better than the dustbin of history .
Let Me Sleep
Beside You and In the Heat of the Morning
prove he was already a lavishly gifted songwriter .
Furthermore , he was already able to do things others could not .
Caught up in the 60s ' heady whirl , most pop stars were disinclined to write about the era 's darker side .
With his nose pressed against the pane of the Swinging London party , Bowie could offer a more clear - headed view of the times , hence The London Boys , a remarkable monochrome drama of poverty , amphetamine psychosis and intimations of homosexuality , set in grimy bedsits and Wardour Street cafes .
But you listen even to David Bowie 's highlights knowing that their failure was imperative .
Had anything here succeeded commercially , it would have been a disaster , not merely for Bowie , but rock in general : he would have become only briefly famous for his ballads , novelty songs or , worst of all , his doo - dah horn .
As it was , necessity proved the mother of the greatest reinvention pop has ever seen ."
2010-01-17,"When influential music website Pitchfork listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s â which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music â the modestly immodest , driven , musical non - musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them , including the number one , Low , on which he collaborated with a nomadic , post-""Fame "" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti .
As an intellectually mobile loner , scene - setter , systems lover , obstinate rebel , techno - prophet , sensual philosopher , courteous progressive , close listener , gentle heretic , sound planner , adviser explorer , pedant and slick conceptual salesman , and devoted fan of the new , undrab and surprising , wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard , or Duchamp and doo wop , or Mondrian and Moog , Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s .
He looked at what the Velvet Underground , Can , Steve Reich and the Who had done , went forth and multiplied .
Eno created an atmosphere , and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century .
He demonstrated â as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music , the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy Heroes / Low / Lodger , the nervy NY Talking Heads , as a floating collaborator with Nico , John Cale , Robert Wyatt , Cluster , Robert Fripp , Kevin Ayers , Jon Hassell and Harold Budd , as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox , as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure , as careful discoverer of the pulseless , wordless , eventless , timeless music he lovingly called "" ambient "" â that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be .
In 1981 , he designed the influential sound and content of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts with David Byrne â the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s , the studio combining of inner space , other worlds , random impressions , scrupulous visions , found sound , taped memories , cut - up text , stolen rhythms , daring edits , painted space , original borrowing , inquisitive permutations , mutant gospel and electronic interference .
Then there was U2 and recently , as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants , he 's attended to another ambitious four - piece male rock group with delusions of splendour , Coldplay , producing their last multi - million selling album and now , at the age of 61 , finishing their next .
A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be , in fact , post - Eno as much as post - punk .
Coldplay did n't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success .
Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice .
Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay .
He stays behind the scenes , more likely to curate an art festival or present a public lecture on something to do with pleasure , beauty , atheism , perfume or nuclear disarmament than appear to have anything to do with rock or pop music .
If Roxy Music are ever spotted together on stage , he will be somewhere else , searching for something new to astound him .
Much , naturally , has changed since the volatile , fussy , sublime Eno of For Your Pleasure
, Here Come The Warm Jets , Discreet Music , Heroes and Once in a Lifetime , but he 's still talking about what he does , and why , working out his place , the place of art , the history of progress , the enigma of meaning , the mechanics of creativity , the mystery of aesthetics , reluctant to think too much about his past in case , as he says , he starts to feel "" useless awe towards his former self "" but politely prepared to look back at his work if he thinks someone might find it useful .
When you meet him to discuss something or other to do with his always perfectly organised research and development thoughts about something or other , you arrive as he is finishing one conversation with someone about , say , how technology changes the way our brains work , and as you leave someone else is arriving for a conversation about , say , the shrinking divisions between art and science .
Or how Jeremy Clarkson almost moved into the house next to his office which was previously owned by Jason Donovan .
I talked with him as part of a series of conversations that were filmed for a BBC Arena documentary .
On talking : 1 "" I heard a recording that had been made of me 35 years ago chatting with some friends
and I thought the tape must have sped up because I sounded so fast .
When Â­others spoke , they were at a normal speed .
It was me , I was speaking so fast .
What I find both disappointing and reassuring is that I was saying exactly those things I will be saying today .
I do n't know what to make of that .
A few different references , but the basic ideas have n't changed at all .
No difference whatsoever !
I suppose it 's good to see I 've been consistent as sometimes over the years
it seems as though it 's all been a bit incoherent , a bit of this , a bit of that , a while doing this , then one of those , followed by three of those .
It seems all over the place when I 'm doing it .
Listening to me now talking then suggests there has been a pattern . ""
On the intensity of ideas "" If you grow up in a very strong religion like Catholicism you certainly cultivate in yourself a certain taste for the intensity of ideas .
You expect to be engaged with ideas strongly whether you are for or against them .
If you are part of a religion that very strongly insists that you believe then to decide not to do that is quite a big hurdle to jump over .
You never forget the thought process you went through .
It becomes part of your whole intellectual picture . ""
On listening "" If you think of the mid- to late-50swhen all of this started to happen for me , the experience of listening to sound was so different from now .
Stereo did n't exist .
If you listened to music outside of church , apart from live music , which was very rare , it was through tiny speakers .
It was a nice experience but a very small experience .
So to go into a church , which is a specially designed and echoey space , and it has an organ , and my grandfather built the organ in the church where we went , suddenly to hear music and singing was amazing .
It was like hearing someone 's album on a tiny transistor radio and then you go and see them in a 60,000-seater .
It 's huge by comparison .
That had a lot to do with my feeling about sound and space , which became a big theme for me .
How does space make a difference to sound , what 's the difference between hearing something in this room and then another room .
Can you imagine other rooms where you can hear music ?
It also made a difference to how I feel about the communality of music in that the music I liked the most , singing in church , was done by a group of people who were not skilled â
they were just a group of people , I knew them in the rest of the week as the coal man and the baker . ""
On destiny "" It was a dilemma for me at the end of my time at school .
Am I going into music or painting ?
The Who were important to me when I was working out whether I would go into fine art or popular art .
I felt they had found an important position between the two .
Then the Velvet Underground came along and also made it clear how you could straddle the two somehow .
It helped make my mind up to go into music . ""
On recording "" I came out of this funny place where I was interested in the experimental ideas of Cornelius Cardew , John Cage and Gavin Bryars , but also in pop music .
Pop was all about the results and the feedback .
The experimental side was interested in process more than the actual result â the results just happened and there was often very little control over them , and very little feedback .
Take Steve Reich .
He was an important composer for me with his early tape pieces and his way of having musicians play a piece each at different speeds so that they slipped out of synch . ""
But then when he comes to record a piece of his like , say ,
Drumming , he uses orchestral drums stiffly played and badly recorded .
He 's learnt nothing from the history of recorded music .
Why not look at what the pop world is doing with recording , which is making incredible sounds with great musicians who really feel what they play .
It 's because in Reich 's world there was no real feedback .
What was interesting to them in that world was merely the diagram of the piece , the music merely existed as an indicator of a type of process .
I can see the point of it in one way , that you just want to show the skeleton , you do n't want a lot of fluff around it , you just want to show how you did what you did .
As a listener who grew up listening to pop music I am interested in results .
Pop is totally results - oriented and there is a very strong feedback loop .
Did it work ?
No .
We 'll do it differently then .
Did it sell ?
No .
We 'll do it differently then .
So I wanted to bring the two sides together .
I liked the processes and systems in the experimental world and the attitude to effect that there was in the pop , I wanted the ideas to be seductive but also the results . ""
On being like nothing else "" In my house in Oxfordshire , we have this big , beautiful Andrew Logan sculpture of a lovely Pegasus with blue glass wings .
When I get a taxi from the station , a driver will always comment on it because it is so striking .
What they often say is , ' What does that stand for then ? '
Or , ' What does that mean ? ' , based on the idea that something exists because it has to tell you something , or it refers to something else , and I realise that this notion is foreign to me .
The earliest paintings I loved were always the most non - referential paintings you can imagine , by painters such as Mondrian .
I was thrilled by them because they did n't refer to anything else .
They stood alone and they were just charged magic objects that did not get their strength from being connected to anything else . ""
On singing "" I belong to a gospel choir .
They know I am an atheist but they are very tolerant .
Ultimately , the message of gospel music is that everything 's going to be all right .
If you listen to millions of gospel records â and I have â and try to distil what they all have in common
it 's a sense that somehow we can triumph .
There could be many thousands of things .
But the message â¦ well , there are two messages â¦
one is a kind of optimism for the future rather than a pessimism .
Gospel music is never pessimistic , it 's never '
oh my god , its all going down the tubes ' , like the blues often is .
Gospel music is always about the possibility of transcendence , of things getting better .
It 's also about the loss of ego , that you will win through or get over things by losing yourself , becoming part of something better .
Both those messages are completely universal and are nothing to do with religion or a particular religion .
They 're to do with basic human attitudes and you can have that attitude and therefore sing gospel even if you are not religious . ""
On the synthesiser : 1 "" One of the important things about the synthesiser was that it came without any baggage .
A piano comes with a whole history of music .
There are all sorts of cultural conventions built into traditional instruments that tell you where and when that instrument comes from .
When you play an instrument that does not have any such historical background you are designing sound basically .
You 're designing a new instrument .
That 's what a synthesiser is essentially .
It 's a constantly unfinished instrument .
You finish it when you tweak it , and play around with it , and decide how to use it .
You can combine a number of cultural references into one new thing . ""
On the synthesiser : 2 "" Instruments sound interesting not because of their sound but because of the relationship a player has with them .
Instrumentalists build a rapport with their instruments which is what you like and respond to .
If you were sitting down now to design an instrument you would not dream of coming up with something as ridiculous as an acoustic guitar .
It 's a strange instrument , it 's very limited and it does n't sound good .
You would come up with something much better .
But what we like about acoustic guitars is players who have had long relationships with them and know how to do something beautiful with them .
You do n't have that with synthesisers yet .
They are a very new instrument .
They are constantly renewing so people do not have time to build long relationships with them .
So you tend to hear more of the technology and less of the rapport .
It can sound less human .
However !
That is changing .
And there is a prediction that I made a few years ago that I 'm very pleased to see is coming true â synthesisers that have inconsistency built into them .
I have always wanted them to be less consistent .
I like it that one note can be louder than the note next to it . ""
On the naming of things "" A way to make new music is to imagine looking back at the past from a future and imagine music that could have existed but did n't .
Like East African free jazz , which as far as I know does not exist .
To some extent , this was how ambient music emerged .
My interest in making music has been to create something that does not exist that I would like to listen to , not because I wanted a job as a musician .
I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened , by putting together things that suggested a new thing which did not yet exist .
It 's like having a ready - made formula if you are able to read it .
One of the innovations of ambient music was leaving out the idea that there should be melody or words or a beat â¦ so in a way that was music designed by leaving things out â that can be a form of innovation , knowing what to leave out .
All the signs were in the air all around with ambient music in the mid 1970s , and other people were doing a similar thing .
I just gave it a name .
Which is exactly what it needed .
A name .
A name .
Giving something a name can be just the same as inventing it .
By naming something you create a difference .
You say that this is now real .
Names are very important . ""
On talking : 2 "" I like to talk about all sorts of things .
I 've never seen the downside of it .
I 've never minded the egghead tag .
It makes sense with my physiognomy anyway .
I 've fought for years the idea that rock and popular art is only about passion and fashion and nothing to do with thinking and examining and if you do think there is something suspicious about you . ""
On hindsight "" Instead of shooting arrows at someone else 's target , which I 've never been very good at , I make my own target around wherever my arrow happens to have landed .
You shoot your arrow and then you paint your bulls eye around it , and therefore you have hit the target dead centre . ""
On a celebration of human frailty "" The other day I heard a band who had the worst singer , the most out of time drummer and most out of tune guitarist
I 've ever heard on a professional record , and I thought , at last , the reaction against pro - tools perfection has set in .
A pro - tools engineer would have sorted it all out , but this band was an actual celebration of human frailty .
It was so rough it was really encouraging . ""
On Abba "" In the 70s , no one would admit that they liked Abba .
Now it 's fine .
It 's so kitsch .
Kitsch is an excuse to defend the fact that they feel a common emotion .
If it is kitsch .
you put a sort of frame around something â to suggest you are being ironic .
Actually , you are n't .
You are really enjoying it .
I like Abba .
I did then
and I did n't admit it .
The snobbery of the time would n't allow it .
I did admit it when I heard ' Fernando ' ; I could not bear to keep the secret to myself anymore and also because I think there is a difference between Swedish sentimentality and LA sentimentality because the Swedish are so restrained emotionally .
When they get sentimental it 's rather sweet and charming .
What we really got me with "" Fernando "" was what the lower singer was doing ,
I do n't know her name .
I spent months trying to learn that .
It 's so obscure what she 's doing and very hard to sing .
And then from being a sceptic I went over the top in the other direction .
I really fell for them . ""
On Frank Zappa "" Zappa was important to me because I realised I did n't have to make music like he did .
I might have made a lot of music like he did if he had not done it first and made me realise that I did not want to go there .
I did not like his music
but I am grateful that he did it .
Sometimes you learn as much from the things you do n't like as from the things you do like .
The rejection side is as important as the endorsement part .
You define who you are and where you are by the things that you know you are not .
Sometimes that 's all the information you have to go on .
I 'm not that kind of person .
You do n't quite know where you are but you find yourself in the space left behind by the things you 've rejected . ""
On working with U2 and Coldplay at the same time "" It was fine .
A few jokes .
I felt like a Â­philanderer who was with another woman and might make a slip and call her by the wrong name in bed .
I had one computer that had all of the Coldplay stuff and all the U2 stuff .
I had to very carefully label each folder because I was paranoid that I might end up with the same basic track for each group
and I would n't notice until it was too late .
There was a chance the same track might have appeared on both albums . ""
On ego "" Bono commits the crime of rising above your station .
To the British , it 's the worst thing you can do .
Bono is hated for doing something considered unbecoming for a pop star â meddling in things that apparently have nothing to do with him .
He has a huge ego , no doubt about it .
On the other hand , he has a huge brain and a huge heart .
He 's just a big kind of person .
That 's not easy for some to deal with .
They do n't mind in Italy .
They like larger - than - life people there .
In most places in the world they do n't mind him .
Here , they think he must be conning them . ""
On reporting in the 1990s that there was too much music being released and he was not going to add to it any more ""
I did n't think it through to be honest . ""
On the end of an era "" I think records were just a little bubble through time and those who made a living from them for a while were lucky .
There is no reason why anyone should have made so much money from selling records except that everything was right for this period of time .
I always knew it would run out sooner or later .
It could n't last , and now it 's running out .
I do n't particularly care that it is and like the way things are going .
The record age was just a blip .
It was a bit like if you had a source of whale blubber in the 1840s and it could be used as fuel .
Before gas came along , if you traded in whale blubber , you were the richest man on Earth .
Then gas came along and you 'd be stuck with your whale blubber .
Sorry mate â history 's moving along .
Recorded music equals whale blubber .
Eventually , something else will replace it . """

I have noticed that one of the albums I missed out as an album of that year was the Diana Ross introducing the Jackson 5 album , which you could say sets up some sort of shiny , showy entertainment pathway that ends up with the bright , professional Ellie â add in Joni and the Carpenters , and the froth and fragrancy of Ellie begins to be suggested , and because after all Ellie is the kind of iPop star that covers Bon Iver , a list of top 1970 albums that would include Drake , Buckley , COB , Shirley Collins , Stills , Syd and Perhacs could perhaps make you think of the kind of glowing , delicate and touchy feely folk - pop of Ellie .
Ellie has been nominated , perhaps , as a new act that confidently proceeds with a certain kind of naÃ¯ve knowingness about how to mix commercial sheen with various degrees of integrity inherited from an indie spirit as filtered through Britpop .
She 's been nominated by an industry system that rejects the impact of Susan Boyle , and pop as pop in the vulgar , shameless , empire - building Cowell sense .
An industry that is conscious of appearing cool , of appearing to be aware of the music on that list above , in a way that Cowell does n't give a fancy damn about .
This industry , if it can be summed up as an identifiable collective , likes their female acts to be very much in the Annie Lennox mode â attractively middle of the road but with an edge of something connected to the potentially weird , commercial but streaked with enough neurosis and confessional eccentricity to suggest that big selling pop need not be banal and bloated .
Cowell 's system throws up acts that are not shall we say of a pop world that gave us Bowie , Madonna and Bjork .
He 's coldly , unromantically cut out any pretence to any thought of art , craft , drama , originality , personality , based his sensibility on a love of pop as a very banal demonstration of very mundane technique .
His immediate opposition , one that might still cause his pause if he cares about any kind of legacy as a record man like Tommy Mottola or Clive Davis , the industry that tips up
it 's tips into the Brits , the Mercury Prize , the BBC Sound of the Year predictions , ca n't shake off a belief that great pop requires an element of charisma , even strangeness , and something that is still connected to , say , Little Richard and the Beatles rather than Cliff Richard and the Bachelors .
So ultimately Cowell gives us something that could never appear on a stage with , say , the White Stripes and Animal Collective , and the rest of the industry remain loyal to something that can work with White Stripes etc , and therefore belongs to a recognisable tradition of rock as a militant , fashionable , progressive energy â as something that is in fact cool , even if it is a cool that has not really changed in dimension or appearance for pretty much 40 years .
Ellie would be just a little too twisted to succeed in the Cowell universe , where a desire to genuinely express personal feelings is the very definition of twisted , but in the Brit world is just the right , polite amount of unconventional .
She 's clean , family friendly and nicely turned out in a way that Cowell would appreciate , but she contains enough Bush , Prince and Madonna , and therefore Florence and Little Boots , for the beleaguered but battling , mainstream but indie minded industry to promote her as the sound of 2010 .
And therefore she is the very picture of the commercial sound of 2010 , not necessarily something that might make an album that as a piece of individual thinking could cope with being in a list like the one above , but something that has a good chance song by song costume by costume of persuasively perpetuating the illusion that all is really well with pop and the party is getting wilder , the noises fancier , the sets more breathtaking , the technology more astounding and the dances more advanced .
It means 2010 makes 1970 seem very quaint but also somehow filled with progressive pop and rock the mainstream world has not yet caught up with .
I interview Ellie on the day that she is chosen by the BBC Sound of 2010 poll as the No 1 example of the next big thing .
She acts not so much as though she has won a talent competition , although in a way she has , but more that she 's now got a very specific role to perform , a job to do , and she does n't quite know what 's expected of her , but she 's ready for the task .
She seems very composed , not least because she finished her album before all this fuss so does n't have to stress about that , but admits she 's been suffering a little from low level panic attacks .
She 's become , she says , very conscious about the beat of her heart , and what would happen if it stopped .
This suggests that if she gets to make a second album , it could be very interesting ."
2010-01-24,"No one can accuse Peter Gabriel of being short of a concept or three .
The art rocker 's latest wheeze is an album of cover versions , to be followed by an album of their composers covering his work ( hence the title ) .
The thought of that second album doubtless influenced the final cut from the 100 songs Gabriel shortlisted ; among those interpreting his work will be Neil Young , Regina Spektor , David Bowie and Elbow .
Handy !
Gabriel 's own covers are theatrical pieces of baroque pop without guitars or drums .
Gabriel 's voice , grainier these days , takes centre stage , while arranger John Metcalfe spins rich , sometimes cinematic settings from his orchestra .
The dominant mood is wistful and melancholic , the dominant pattern a slow beginning with big booming climaxes .
Mostly , it works well .
Intriguingly , Gabriel fares better with more recent material .
Elbow 's Mirrorball becomes a hushed , midnight meditation with prog styling ( the ghost of Genesis is never far away ) .
Bon Iver 's Flume is transformed from cabin folk to big ballad , while a sweet - sour take on the Magnetic Fields ' Book of Love already has cult status following its role on the Scrubs soundtrack .
Less exciting are versions of Bowie 's Heroes , Lou Reed 's Power of the Heart , Randy Newman 's
I Think It 's Going to Rain Today and
Young 's Philadelphia , all of which reprise , rather then re - create , the mood of the originals .
At the other extreme , turning the enthused African pop of Paul Simon 's The Boy in the Bubble into forlornness seems downright wilful , and even drastic deconstruction ca n't make much of the unconvincing angst of Radiohead 's Street Spirit .
Still , there 's more right than wrong about Gabriel 's audacity .
With Talking Heads ' Listening Wind he hits his mark sweetly , turning David Byrne 's jittery original into a dreamy , scary account of terrorism .
For that , Dave owes Pete a good ' un ."

2010-02-12,"The music world has been rocked by the death of fashion designer Alexander McQueen , who created clothing for artists including Bjork , David Bowie and Rihanna .
Acts such as Kanye West , Kelis and Katy Perry took to blogs and Twitter yesterday , paying tribute to the couture icon . ""
Rest In Peace Alexander McQueen , "" Perry wrote yesterday afternoon .
"" Just woke up , so sad . "" Little Boots offered a similarly terse and tender comment : "" Oh my goodness just heard about Alexander Mcqueen so sad I ca n't believe it . ""
Kanye West was a little more expressive , posting on his website . ""
So devastating , "" he wrote . ""
McQueen ... was a genius .
He was so important and special .
We lost an angel . ""
The rapper is no stranger to McQueen 's work : he had been spotted at several of the designer 's fashion shows , including Paris fashion week in 2007 and last year 's autumn fashion week in New York .
He has also blogged pages of photographs of McQueen 's work in the past , hailing his 2009 collection as "" my favourite fashion show this year "" . ""
His work was beautiful and will remain immortal , "" R&amp;B singer Kelis said in a statement . ""
He was one of our gems , it is truly so sad .
There are n't many designers or artists that are able to let you into their minds and their hearts simply through vision and creation .
Alexander McQueen was one of few .
We will all feel his absence forever . ""
McQueen fans such as Bjork and Lady Gaga have yet to issue statements , with some Gagaphiles proposing that the popstar is "" in mourning "" .
In the meantime , Courtney Love has piped up , showing her typical sensitivity : "" Poor Lee McQueen , "" she wrote on Twitter .
"" I really tried to help him long ago .
I feel really bad .
I found a pair of tights today and they were Lee 's .
I felt morbid . ""

2010-02-17,"At risk of sounding like a party - pooping pedant , it was n't actually the 30th anniversary of the Brits at all .
The first Brits â or as it was then , the snappily - titled British Record Industry Britannia Centenary Awards â was in 1977 , the year of The Clash 's eponymous debut album , David Bowie 's Heroes , the Sex Pistols '
Never Mind The Bollocks and Donna Summer 's
I Feel Love .
Outside , punk was raging , and disco was at its zenith .
Inside the Wembley Conference Centre , however , Michael Aspel was compering , Shirley Bassey had just pipped Petula Clark to best female singer and Nicholas Parsons and Frankie Howerd were handing out the best British male award to Cliff Richard .
You can see why the Brits have tactfully chosen to sweep the first event under the carpet but , equally , you could argue it was entirely of a piece with this year 's awards , and every Brits since .
A cosy early evening light - entertainment show to which the musical cutting - edge is not invited : you would have to be optimistic to the point of insanity to have put money on experimental US psychedelicelectronicists Animal Collective winning the awards for which they were nominated .
The big difference is that the Brits in 1977 appeared to revel in its remoteness : blithely ignoring the thrilling musical upheavals of the year , it doled out gongs to Procul Harum and The Beatles .
This year 's ceremony kept pretending either to be either a stew of barely - contained licentious excitement â
"" you 've got the two most naughtiest Spice Girls here "" offered Geri
Halliwell â or some kind of tirelessly edgy , hip entertainment . ""
Bit of a shocker there , with all those grown - up acts in the running , "" sniffed Fearne Cotton on voiceover when X - Factor runners up JLS scooped one of their two awards , before going on to remind viewers of The Brits ' relentless commitment to envelope - pushing countercultural subversion : "" coming up later , Prince Harry !
"" It 's not that there 's actually anything wrong with an early evening
ITV show rewarding a boy band propelled to stardom by another early - evening ITV show
but it 's disingenuous to do it while simultaneously trying to suggest that you 're a bit above doing it .
You ca n't pretend to be hip while having one of your awards voted for by the legendary arbiters of bleeding - edge musical taste â the viewers of GMTV .
Elsewhere , things continued much as they always do at the Brits : if nothing else , you could argue that there 's something comforting about its immutability in a turbulent world .
Oasis got an award , Liam Gallagher got up and the producer 's finger hit the mute button , leaving him gesticulating in silence , like Marcel Marceau with a feathercut .
Dizzee Rascal performed with Florence Welch and the movements of Cheryl Cole 's lips did n't appear to quite match the singing coming out of the speakers â in fairness , she 's had a rough week â
but , just as in 1977 , when a reformed Simon And Garfunkel apparently stole the show , the most exciting things on offer were from America :
Jay - Z and Alicia Keys duetted on New York State Of Mind and Lady Gaga , apparently wearing part of the set , , spoke about Alexander McQueen then performed not one of her hits but a grinding bit of electro - pop no one recognised .
While she was onstage , the Brits were momentarily as edgy and exciting as they like to think they are ."
2010-02-23,"Folk guitarist Richard Thompson is to curate this year 's Meltdown festival .
Following in the footsteps of David Bowie , Patti Smith and Massive Attack , Thompson will act as artistic director for the event , which runs from 11 â 20 June , 2010 .
Thompson , 60 , is best known as a founding member of Fairport Convention , whose albums in the late 60s pioneered electric folk .
He went on to success with albums such as 1974 's I Want to See the Bright Lights
Tonight and 1982 's Shoot Out the Lights , recorded with his then - wife and musical partner Linda Thompson .
Thompson said : "" I am very excited to be hosting this year 's Meltdown at Southbank Centre .
The wide - ranging programme reflects many of my interests and influences across many musical , visual and literary styles , and should provide some unique moments , unusual collaborations and juxtapositions .
All this in the place where I saw my first concert in 1961 â such an honour ! ""
A prolific musician , Thompson has recorded more than 400 songs over a long and varied career .
He is now regarded as one of the world 's greatest guitarists , his solo playing often mistaken for the sound of two or more guitars .
Although no acts have been announced yet , organisers promise that the bill will be diverse .
Thompson 's tastes are varied , ranging from Django Reinhardt and Jerry Lee Lewis to north African musicians and the avant garde .
More recently , Thompson toured the show 1,000 Years of Popular Music , which featured renditions of songs from the 11th century alongside Elizabethan madrigals , Victorian music hall and Abba .
Last year 's Meltdown was curated by Ornette Coleman , who staged concerts by Yoko Ono , Mike Patton and James Blood Ulmer .
The Observer is the official media partner of Meltdown .
For more information , visit southbankcentre.co.uk/meltdown ."
2010-02-23,"The appointment of Richard Thompson as director of this year 's Meltdown is good news , but champagne and fireworks are n't appropriate .
An unassuming 60-year - old with a neat beard whose sole concession to showbiz is donning a black beret while on stage , Thompson looks more like Sooty 's handler Matthew Corbett than a towering creative colossus .
In terms of glamour , he 's no match for previous directors such as David Bowie , while his aura may seem lacking in mystique and cutting edge credentials compared to last year 's curator , jazz titan Ornette Coleman .
Far from a publicist 's dream , then , but from a musical standpoint he 's a fine choice .
With access to vast depths of knowledge , Thompson 's input should help reboot the event 's stated desire to act as a forum for disparate strands of music , art , performance and film to entwine .
It should certainly look a lot less like the alt - rock event it has tended towards under the recent guidance of Patti Smith , Morrissey ( the man who booked the Ordinary Boys ) and Jarvis Cocker , when the lineup was often hard to differentiate from that of countless other music festivals dotting the calendar .
If nothing else , Thompson will bring forward - looking curiosity to the table rather than mere nostalgia .
Elvis Costello was the festival 's first non - classical curator in 1995 , and Thompson occupies a similarly hazy point on the musical landscape .
Doggedly unaffiliated to any scene , trend or ethos , though nominally a folk artist , he 's a fearsomely adventurous musician who ranges all over the firmament .
He grew up loving jazz guitar and Scottish ballads , and helped blend folk and rock during his time with Fairport Convention .
With his first wife , Linda , he plumbed the emotional depths of confessional singer - songwriting while also writing rude songs about licking lollipops .
A solo artist for almost 30 years , Thompson 's music also taps into vaudeville , classical and Tin Pan Alley .
He has scored films for Werner Herzog , made instrumental albums combining music from north Africa with Duke Ellington 's Rockin ' in Rhythm , and last year he premiered an extended piece of musical narrative scored for a chamber orchestra .
Most impressively , his evolving 1,000 Years of Popular Music show travels from the 13th - century smash hit Sumer Is Icumen
In to Britney 's Oops , I Did It Again , taking in along the way Henry Purcell , Gilbert and Sullivan , Hoagy Carmichael , Abba and Prince .
If schedules align , we might reasonably expect a programme that attempts to cover a good portion of this ground .
Though it may well feature crumhorms , fuzzy folkies and some no - brainer bookings ( Thompson is friends with Loudon Wainwright III , while his son Teddy is buddies with the Wainwright offspring , so expect a gathering of those clans ) , it should reach far wider .
Despite the fact that he has never been adopted by younger musicians as an emblem of hip folkery in the way that Bert Jansch or John Martyn have ( partly because he 's never been in need of "" resurrection "" ) , he should have no trouble attracting younger artists and admirers to the bill ( Bob Mould seems a good bet ) , nor will he shy away from embracing a truly global lineup .
He may look like the quintessential suburban Englishman , but Thompson has lived in Los Angeles for nearly half his life and is drawn towards the east in both music and philosophy : an endlessly inventive guitarist , he favours Arabic and African scales â and Celtic drones â over blues notes ; once a devotee of Sufism , he remains a practising Muslim .
I 've interviewed him many times
and he 's constantly illuminating while giving very little away .
Serious , with flashes of dry humour , he shies away from the cult of personality .
Instead , he thinks deeply about music , its function in society , how and why it does what it does , and he certainly knows his stuff .
The last time we spoke , he talked knowledgeably about gangsta rap and emo , and explained why he is often drawn to darker subject matters . ""
In a song , often you 're dealing with slightly troubling things below the spoken desires of the audience , "" he said .
"" As a songwriter , you look for those things .
Sometimes it can be unsettling for the audience , especially the ones that deal with serious subjects , but because it 's entertainment you can do it and the audience will go through that process â
they almost like to be unsettled .
It 's part of the job . ""
So expect the unexpected , and expect to be challenged .
And if being boss man at Meltdown also brings Thompson the wider kudos and general recognition he richly deserves , then so much the better ."
2010-03-11,"The Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset Strip has , to put it kindly , seen better days .
Its clientele today consists chiefly of grizzled former roadies , ageing 80s hair - metal bands still waiting for their moment , and greying women who appear to view Pamela Anderson as the pinnacle of taste and sophistication .
But in late 1973 it was the only place to be in Los Angeles , and this was where David Bowie , Iggy Pop and James Williamson met for dinner to celebrate the completion of Raw Power , the third album by Pop and Williamson 's proto - punk band , Iggy and the Stooges . ""
Bowie turned up with his bodyguard , despite the fact that he was n't hugely famous yet , "" says Williamson , a sober - looking 60-year - old who has , via a bizarre turn of events , found himself playing guitar with the Stooges once more , after a 37-year hiatus .
We are standing in the semi - gloom of the Rainbow 's tarnished interior as Williamson points out the vinyl - upholstered booth where the historic dinner took place . ""
As for Jim [ Osterberg ] , he was busy trying to create his Iggy Pop persona , which was difficult because he was n't famous at all . ""
Raw Power bombed on its release , but it has since been acknowledged as one of the most influential records in rock history .
For the last few decades , however , the man who gave Raw Power its air of menace has been something of a mystery .
James Williamson joined the Stooges in 1971 , when they were at their lowest ebb after two commercially disastrous albums and the development of serious drug habits .
Photographs of Williamson at the time depict a dark , brooding presence ; a juvenile delinquent in platform boots .
When he disappeared from view in 1977 it was assumed he had either died of a heroin overdose or gone off the rails entirely .
In fact , he did nothing so cliched .
Until taking early retirement late last year , Williamson was vice president of Sony Electronics .
For the last 30 years he has lived with his wife and children in Silicon Valley , California , working from nine to five and wiping his shoes on the doormat each evening after a hard day 's work at the cutting edge of technology .
"" I gave up being a Stooge to study calculus , "" he explains over a beer at the Rainbow .
"" I designed computer chips , working with geeks who had no idea about my past and who would n't have heard of the Stooges . ""
The story is all the more remarkable for the fact that Williamson is one of the great rock guitarists , having carved out a sound that is at once threatening and glamorous .
"" I 'm his biggest fan , "" says Johnny Marr , late of the Smiths , who as the pre - eminent guitar hero of his generation carries some authority .
"" He has the technical ability of Jimmy Page without being as studious , and the swagger of Keith Richards without being sloppy .
He 's both demonic and intellectual , almost how you would imagine Darth Vader to sound if he was in a band .
When I heard rumours that James had got involved with computer chips , I could only guess he had become a cyborg . ""
""
The first time I heard him play , "" says Iggy Pop , "" which was in a basement in Ann Arbor , he did something that later became known as punk or speed metal â a great number of chords , almost all at once â but which at that time came from no known musical vocabulary .
His playing had dirt , but it did not lack authority .
You could hear the intelligence in it . ""
What did Pop make of his new guitarist ?
"" Somebody once wrote that James 's guitar style sounds ' distinctly unfriendly ' , "" he says with a laugh . ""
Let 's just say that James was not the most friendly person I 'd ever met .
But I was n't paying too much attention to him as a person , only as a guitar player . ""
Tempting as it may be to imagine a baby James Williamson snarling out of his mother 's womb with a cigarette hanging from his infant lips and the riff to Raw Power in his head , he was born to a reasonably normal family in 1949 before growing up into what Iggy has described as "" a troubled youth from the Detroit area "" , spending time in reform school along the way .
Williamson joined the Stooges after bumping into Iggy Pop , whom he already knew , at the Chelsea Hotel in New York .
The band quickly collapsed under the weight of drugs and dashed expectations , but a year later , when Williamson was living on his sister 's couch in Detroit , recovering from hepatitis A , he got a call from Iggy to say the band had been given another chance .
"" I had nothing to look forward to , "" Williamson says .
"" I had no money , no prospects .
Then Iggy calls and says David Bowie wants him to come to London to make an album , and that he 's not going without me .
We get a contract for Â£ 10,000 â a huge amount of money back then â stay in Kensington Gardens Hotel , and hang out with people that drive Bentleys .
We go from absolute poverty to the lap of luxury .
It was amazing .
"" It was also productive .
After trying out English musicians and finding them wanting ( Willamson calls them "" a bunch of sissies "" ) , Williamson and Pop arranged for the Stooges ' original guitarist and drummer , Ron and Scott Asheton , to fly over from their home in Ann Arbor , Michigan and complete the muscular lineup , with Ron moving to bass .
The band wrote and practised constantly during their six months in London .
Iggy reputedly came up with the famous opening line to Raw Power 's opening track , Search and Destroy â
"" I 'm a street - walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm "" â under a tree in Kensington Gardens , high on Chinese heroin .
Williamson remembers it differently .
"" We did n't know where to get any hard drugs in London .
The most we could score was a bit of pot .
So we got our heads down and worked , realising this was a shot at being a real band .
"" As it turned out , Raw Power was ill fated from the start . ""
When Iggy and I showed up at the airport we were so undesirable that customs officials wanted us to get straight back on the plane .
It was only when [ Bowie 's manager ]
Tony DeFries turned up that they actually let us into the country .
"" There was also the problem that Bowie and DeFries really only wanted Iggy . ""
DeFries was in the business of making pop stars , "" says Williamson . ""
But Iggy brought me over , and then we brought the Ashetons over , and so now it 's the Stooges , who nobody in their right minds would want as pop stars .
Then Bowie got big and they forgot about us .
We were left with no adult supervision . ""
"" That was by no means particular to DeFries , "" confirms Pop of Williamson 's assertion that the manager wanted the singer , not the band .
"" That was what the label wanted , what the booking agents wanted .
All of the Stooges were big characters .
They were n't the easiest guys to manipulate . ""
The one and only concert the Stooges played during their stay in London was at the Kings Cross Cinema , now the Scala , in June 1972 .
Noting how glam rock bands presented themselves , Iggy and co decided they needed a striking look for their UK debut .
So they headed off to a joke shop and bought clown makeup .
On the back cover of Raw Power is a photograph of Williamson at the concert , looking extremely pale .
That is because he went overboard with the pan stick shortly before going on stage .
Iggy , meanwhile , put on a performance so shocking that DeFries all but ensured the Stooges would never play in the UK again . ""
The audience was terrified , with Iggy climbing all over them , and management decided we would get arrested if we did any more shows , "" says Williamson .
"" And apart from Bowie , nobody really got us anyway .
We did n't help people get us .
We made it up as we went along . ""
The result was a band the world was , frankly , not ready for .
Iggy Pop 's malodorous lyrics ( "" Gimme danger , little stranger , and I will feel your disease "" ) were mirrored by Williamson 's wild , complex guitar style , which sounds , if you can apply such a word to music , unhygienic .
"" It makes you think of a monster from a swamp â in makeup , "" says Marr .
"" James 's riffs sound dead cool , but you do n't get that good by goofing off .
There 's thought going on behind the swagger . ""
DeFries rejected every recording the band made .
When the Stooges left London for Los Angeles in October 1972 , DeFries got Bowie to produce and mix Raw Power in a last - ditch attempt to create something vaguely palatable for the record - buying public . ""
DeFries called in his golden boy to salvage the album at Western Studios on Sunset , "" says Williamson .
"" We 've been grousing about the mix
Bowie did ever since , but we ca n't complain too much because we were in the studio when it was done .
And the truth is that Raw Power would never have been released had it not been for Bowie . ""
After Raw Power 's release , the Stooges embarked on a disastrous tour of the US that , according to the late Ron Asheton , was like "" beating a dead horse until it was dust "" .
It ended on February 1974 at the Michigan Palace in Detroit , when a gang of bikers beat up Pop after he challenged the entire audience to a fight â the show is captured on the legendary bootleg album Metallic KO , described by the critic Lester Bangs as "" the only rock album I know where you can actually hear hurled beer bottles breaking against guitar strings "" .
Williamson and Pop returned to Los Angeles in the hope of kickstarting their musical careers once more , but by then pretty much all was lost .
While Williamson seems sanguine about its initial failure , Pop clearly feels that Raw Power 's current status as a classic album is long overdue .
"" I felt that if the 14-year - olds could hear it , if the real , smart music fans could hear it , they would get it , "" he says .
"" Maybe I was being unrealistic , but it always felt like the album I had to make . ""
"" After that , Iggy wanted to take it to the edge , "" remembers Williamson , who was by this point living in an apartment on the Sunset Strip , next door to the Hyatt House Hotel . ""
He took any crap he could get hold of and it whacked him out .
He was at my place , then he was at his girlfriend 's , and then nobody wanted him so he was on the street .
He was despondent and desperate .
He could n't manage his life anymore , so he did the right thing and checked into a mental hospital . ""
The pair made a final attempt to get another deal by making a series of recordings in 1975 .
It did n't work , although the tracks were eventually released as the 1977 album Kill City . ""
Here we are , my singer is in hospital , nobody is knocking on our door or even answering our phone calls , and nothing has worked out , "" says Williamson . ""
Then Bowie takes Iggy under his wing and off they go to Europe .
So that was that . ""
Bowie and Pop relocated to Berlin and made some of the most creative albums of their careers : The Idiot and Lust for Life for Pop ; Low , Heroes and Lodger for Bowie .
Meanwhile , Williamson was left high and dry .
So he went back to school .
He studied electronics and , apart from a rare foray to the studio to produce Iggy 's 1979 album New Values , he gave up on rock'n'roll .
Soon after becoming a father he landed a job at a pioneering microchip company , Advanced Micro Devices , leading to engineering work at Sony Electronics .
He did n't go near a guitar for the better part of three decades .
His son referred to the collection of vintage guitars gathering dust in the family living room as "" the coffins in the corner "" .
"" It turned out to be an amazing time for me , "" says Williamson , animated at the memory .
"" I was involved in the explosion of the computer boom , working with brilliant people , and it was a lot more exciting than rock'n'roll , which I felt had reached a plateau .
I 'd be myself , asking questions like , ' Isaac Newton â how did he come up with that ? '
"" Williamson never mentioned his old life to his colleagues .
While Iggy Pop became a worldwide superstar , Williamson made personal computers user friendly .
The only clue to his whereabouts came on a line from Pop 's 1977 song
The Dum Dum Boys , a tribute to his old gang , which contains the line : "" What about James ?
He 's gone straight . ""
As the Stooges ' place in rock history became appreciated , however , Williamson 's old life came back to haunt him .
At first it was the occasional fan or journalist trying to track him down .
Then in 2007 , responding to the cult that had built up around the Stooges since their demise , Pop decided to get the old band back together .
The Asheton brothers heeded the call but Williamson explained that , being a top - ranking executive at Sony , he was n't really in a position to take off around the world and crank out ultra - malevolent rock riffs when there were board meetings to attend .
Then events were to take a turn for the surreal .
In February 2009 Ron Asheton died of a heart attack , not long after the Stooges ' triumphant reunion tour .
A few months later Williamson got a call from Pop , who wanted to play Raw Power in its entirety , live , for the first time .
"" I told him I had a full - time job and could n't do it .
Then the recession caught up with Sony and they offered me early retirement .
And then I remembered the Stooges . ""
"" Not that his family are particularly interested in their old man 's youthful folly .
"" My daughter could n't care less about the Stooges , "" he says , laughing .
"" My son got interested when he went to college and his friends were into the band , but my wife has disliked the Stooges ever since coming to see us at the Whisky back in 74 .
We are n't for everyone . ""
Williamson compares himself to Rip Van Winkle , waking up after a long sleep to discover a changed world .
Pop is now an ultra - smart professional who knows how to put on a brilliant show .
Raw Power is a huge album .
And soon after relearning the riffs he came up with back in 73 , Williamson was playing to big audiences for the first time in his life ; his debut gig was in SÃ£o Paulo last November , in front of 30,000 people .
"" All we 're doing now is finishing off a job , "" says Pop of the Raw Power tour .
"" And I 'm pleased to report that James has now learned to use his intelligence in balance with his more impulsive , aggressive side . ""
"" It 's really strange to be doing it now , "" Williamson says .
"" We 're basically pensioners .
It 's fun , but nobody wants to get so old that playing rock'n'roll becomes a joke . ""
That never stopped the Rolling Stones , but you can see his point .
The rebirth of Williamson is one of the more heartwarming stories in the brutal world of rock'n'roll .
Does he have any regrets at leaving it all behind for so long ?
"" You know , last night I met Slash , "" Williamson says with a smile . ""
He was a really nice guy , but you have to ask yourself , when he does n't play guitar , what does he do ?
I look back at everything I 've done and think , it worked out OK . ""
Alexis Petridis on how nothing can prepare you for your first listen to Raw Power Raw Power is an album preceded by its reputation .
At first , that reputation was as a monumental disaster .
Intended to revive a career you would have described as dying had it ever shown any signs of commercial life in the first place , it succeeded only in hammering the final nails into the Stooges ' coffin .
Muddily mixed by David Bowie , Raw Power was adduced either as evidence of a hitherto - unnoticed fallibility on the part of its patron , or of Iggy Pop 's unfailing ability to screw up every opportunity presented him : only "" the world 's forgotten boy "" , as he styled himself on the opening track , Search and Destroy , could hook up with the planet 's hottest rock star and emerge with his reputation in worse shape than before .
Either way , within months of its release , the Stooges were reduced to playing the kind of gigs you hear on the notorious live album Metallic KO , shows people attended specifically in order to jeer and throw things : "" You can throw your goddam cocks for all I care , "" snaps Iggy .
Within a couple of years , however , Raw Power 's reputation had changed to one of vast importance .
In his history of punk , England 's Dreaming , Jon Savage claimed you need hear only two records to understand the genre : one was the Sex Pistols ' Never Mind the Bollocks , the other Raw Power .
Whatever its reputation , nothing can really prepare you for the experience of hearing Raw Power .
Over the years , Pop has tended to describe the album not in terms of music , but violence .
On one occasion he explained its sound to a journalist by wordlessly smashing a glass ; on another he noted "" that band could kill any band at the time , and frankly can just kill any of the bands that built on this work since "" .
He has a point , although you might point out that , based on the opening seconds of Search and Destroy , the Stooges play not as if they 're ready to kill every other band , but as if they 're on the verge of killing each other : every member seems locked in , desperate struggle to drown the rest out .
Over the top , in every sense of the phrase , Pop howls one of the greatest opening lines in rock history : "" I 'm a street - walkin ' cheetah with a heart full of napalm "" , a lyric that would sound utterly ridiculous coming from anyone else , but which he delivers with convincing urgency .
Almost immediately , however , the swagger vanishes , replaced by a palpable panic and distress ; for all the heroic look - out - honey strutting , something is clearly desperately wrong here .

he howls , a man who ca n't decide whether he 's revelling in his own nihilism , or just terrified .

2010-03-26,"I have so much I want to ask John Surman when I meet him that I 'm not actually sure what to ask him .
I 've been buying John Surman records since I was 14 , since I was buying Bowie , Bolan and Roxy , Mott , Iggy and Can and not many hours can pass without me playing some of his music and hearing his baritone / soprano saxophone and bass clarinet carve out endlessly varied possible routes between immense sadness and sheer ecstasy ...
should I begin at the beginning with those energetic avant - fusion proto - prog records he appeared on in the late 1960s co - ordinated by Alexis Korner , Mike Westbrook , John McLaughlin , Mike Gibbs , his early solo records for Deram ( home of David Bowie , Caravan and Giles , Giles and Fripp ) , the more experimental records he made around 1970 for the Dawn label ( home to Mungo Jerry , Donovan and Comus ) , the brief , secret time he spent on Island Records , and how by the mid-70s he was switching nimbly between free music and composition , between the arranged and the spontaneous , losing confidence in rock labels because they were losing confidence in jazz as any kind of commercial prospect , consigning it to the shadows .
Perhaps I should talk about the mid-70s years spent working at the Paris Opera , how his eclectic interests developed and expanded during that decade , leading to his signing to the extraordinary ECM label in the late 70s having already built a large discography as leader and guest and having appeared on Barre Phillips 's 1976 dark , sparse and abstractly mesmerising ECM album suite Mountainscapes , unclassifiable cerebral body music that you could play alongside Burial and Xiu Xiu ...
maybe I should just begin by saying , John
, I want to talk about jazz , and what the hell it is , and what the hell happened , and do you even think of yourself as a jazz musician , and why do lots of people think , people who passionately love music , and often experimental , challenging music ,
if it 's jazz , it 's of no interest to them ...
( I once read someone say that life is too short to listen to jazz , and that 's ok â against my better judgement I am prepared to admit that whoever thought this is entitled to their opinion , although for me life is too short to read someone say that life is too short to listen to jazz .
I 've been listening to jazz for about as long as I have been listening to pop music and whatever the thrill is listening to a great new and surprising pop song , there is an equal thrill listening to a moment of magic , madness and mayhem as some immense piece of improvisational intimacy changes its shape in what seems like the floating , startling mid - air of life .
Such a moment can express the absolute astonishing potential the mind has to create something out of nothing , conjuring up a new sort of reality , and then , mere seconds later , adjust , correct , transform this particular reality and replace it with something equally as astounding and unexpected .
How did I get my education in jazz , leading to the fact that when someone mentions to me that , say , "" I 've never been entirely convinced by jazz "" , I feel â giddy , sick , sad , bewildered â like they have just said that they are not convinced by breathing , love and pleasure ?
It might have been the fact that in my local record shops in Stockport in the early 70s jazz albums , especially British ones by the likes of Mike Westbrook , Graham Collier , Mike Gibbs , Keith Tippet and Ian Carr , always seemed available at very cheap prices .
Buying The Faust Tapes for 48p on the eccentric new Virgin Records in the early 70s changed me forever : buying Graham Collier 's Mosaics album for a cut price 80p made a huge impact as well .
The charged , careering noise inside these surging , sometime terrifying British jazz albums as various sized collections of ingenious instrumentalists â the saxophones of John Surman , Mike Osborne , Alan Skidmore , Lol Coxhill , Dudu Pakwana , Evan Parker , John Warren , the trumpets of Kenny Wheeler , Harry Beckett , Henry Lowther , the basses of Harry Miller , Barre Phillips , Graham Collier , Dave Holland , Danny Thompson , the trombones of Paul Rutherford , the drums of John Marshall , John Stevens , Tony Oxley , Alan Jackson , Louis Moholo , Stu Martin , the pianos of Mike Westbrook , John Taylor , Chris McGregor
, Keith Tippet â tore into each others space and fought for some sort of life seemed just as exhilarating and necessary as the noise I was hearing positively infect my imagination via the likes of Faust , the Stooges and Van Der Graaf Generator .
Once one thing quickly led to another , as it did if you so desired even in the dark age decades before the internet , and I found out about Ornette Coleman , Cecil Taylor , Anthony Braxton and Thelonius Monk .
There was an opaque glamour , a cryptic splendour about these mysterious , defiant figures and their obsessive pursuit of the meaning of sound , and the glory of self - liberation , that made their music , as epic , crazed , somber , disordered , cranky as it might be , seem as spectacular and seductive as any pop .
It might have been the fact that in Manchester when I was going to early punk rock gigs in 1976/77 , one week I might be seeing Buzzcocks , the Fall and Joy Division learning very quickly how to be the Buzzcocks , the Fall and Joy Division
we now know â
it 's all become history , although back then it was so much the future that it did n't even seem to have time to be part of the present â and
the next week I 'd be seeing Evan Parker , Stan Tracey or Keith Tippet play the same kind of small clubs and pubs .
The urgent noise of one got mangled into the transformative noise of the other .
An addiction to the double quartets sensationally arranged into intensely inspiring free thinking instrumental infernos by Ornette Coleman on the high driving Free Jazz album supplied clues as to exactly what Buzzcocks , the Fall and Joy Division were doing as they reacted to the Sex Pistols , in the sense that they were using music to make a break for freedom , they were using noise to propose alternative states of being , thinking and feeling .
There seemed distinct links , at least from where I was assembling reality , between what was called punk rock and what was called free jazz , and these links seemed to be connected to the idea that music had an importance in how you resisted being compelled to obey miserably ordinary instructions from somewhere vague and insistent above .
It might have been because around the time Joy Division released Unknown Pleasures on the Factory label , one of my favourite labels , John Surman was releasing the first album , Upon Reflection , that he made for another of my favourite labels , ECM , equally as committed to its catalogue , and the pursuit of uncompromisingly packaged and uniquely produced new music , and I would play Surman 's solo record of overdubbed improvisations , electronics and baritone / soprano sax as much as Unknown Pleasures , and the two would get a little tangled up in my imagination , a psychic merging of two very particular , scarred landscapes and intensely nervy , questing sensibilities . )
As John Surman and I walk into the Showing Off ... studio , me feeling intimidated in the presence of someone whose music I play as much as just about anyone else 's , I 'm reduced to a little bit of small talk â does he live in the centre of Oslo , with his wife since the late 80s , the avant - cool Norwegian singer Karin Krog ? ...
( apparently , they live on the outskirts ) ...
and then as we sit down for our interview , something I 've wanted to do ever since I started writing about music , I empty a bag full of Surman CDs that I 've brought along , because I 've been thinking , if you only have one John Surman CD in your life , which one should it be ?
I 've got over 30 that he 's been involved in as leader or sidekick or band member , from the 44 years he 's been recording , and obviously I feel that you really should have at least one , even if your jazz CDs tend to be in the Kind of Blue / Love Supreme / John McLaughlin area , few and far between , or you have no records at all that you could say are jazz .
I spent the hours before I interview Surman wondering exactly which of the record 's he 's made I would recommend you hear if you said to me , "" you seem to like him , a lot , so which Surman album should I get ? ""
So I grabbed a few and before I meet John , I look at them , thinking about how they connect to each other and make up a map of someone 's mind , a movement through and across time , working out which one I would single out , and urge you to hear , even if you do n't like jazz , or any sort of music that apparently comes near .
I spread the CDs out in front of him in the studio , and he looks at them , a little amused , and says , well , that 's good , because sometimes you can forget when a certain album was made , you can forget a track or two that was on it .
I wonder if he 's amazed by all the music he has made over the years , playing with Gil Evans , John McLaughlin , Miroslav Vitous , Jack De Johnette , Paul Bley , John Abercrombie , Tomasz Stanko , jumping from solo to duet to trio to quartet to sextet to mixed ensemble , from the John Dowland
In Darkness Let Me Dwell ECM album re - examining Dowland 's 16th century songs from a contemporary improvisational perspective , to the Anouar Brahem Thimar ECM album where he 's part of an exotic drumless dream post - jazz trio with Tunisian oud player Brahem and exquisitely dynamic double bassist Dave Holland ... both of which are amongst those CDs of his I spread out on the table between us ... if I had to recommend one album where John Surman is part of a group not the leader
then these two would certainly be in the running ... as well as Barre Phillips ' Mountainscapes ... and The Paul Bley Quartet with Bley , Bill Frisell and Paul Motian ... and Miroslav Vitous Journey 's End with Vitous , John Taylor and Jon Christensen ... and Tomasz Stanko 's From The Green Hill ...
But what would be the one John Surman - as - leader album I suggest you listen to if you only had room in your life for one ?
Perhaps the obvious one is the selected recordings compilation of his ECM .
work between 1976 and 1999 , : rarum xiii , which he selected himself , one of 20 ECM artists to be given the opportunity to put together their own favourite pieces from the work they 've done for this epic , esoteric label .
This put him in the company â the only British musician alongside Dave Holland â of such as Keith Jarrett , Chick Corea , the Art Ensemble of Chicago , Pat Metheny , Carla Bley , Paul Motian and Eberhard Weber .
This compilation contains examples both of his solo work and a variety of collaborations with Americans and Europeans as guest and leader .
It seems a bit of a cheat , though , to go for the compilation , and to just go for the ECM years which means , just looking at the albums spread out between us as we do our interview , you do n't get to hear anything from , say , the 1970 Deram album How Many Clouds Can You See , which combined racy , precise small groups and triumphant , cracking big groups , and which was already anticipating many of the areas Surman would explore in the decades to come , a combining of an interest in strange , disorientating , spiritual English mood music and a love for the way sax players like Parker , Konitz , Coltrane , Rollins , Dolphy , Adderly and Getz searched out their own way of playing , and their own tough , holy route to bliss , and higher and higher moments .
Then there 's 1975 's S.O.S record , a collision of three big , bold British sax players Alan Skidmore ( tenor ) , Mike Osborne ( alto ) and Surman ( baritone / soprano ) , recorded in Worthing , very English , gloomy and glamorous , and it 's a fight between the three , a sax summit , but also an embrace , a sÃ©ance , a prayer meeting , a chess game , a philosophical exchange , and as well as the circling , spiralling , cunning trio of saxes and the discreet percussion there 's Surman experimenting with synthesisers and electronics that puts the record somewhere isolated and special between Johnny Griffin 's 1957 Blowin ' Session with Griffin , Coltrane and Hank Mobley , and mid - period Tangerine Dream .
For elegant , mature , transcendental late period Surman , opening up celestial territory that pieces together intuitive composition and uncanny improvisation to create a kind of free chamber music , something that sounds like it might have come one way or another from the jazz of Parker , the Renaissance consort music of William Byrd and the notation of Ravel but which sounds only like itself , I 'd say his 2007 album for saxophones , bass clarinet , double bass and string quartet , The Spaces in Between .
Or you could just begin at the beginning of his ECM solo years with Upon Reflection with solitary Surman , studio , sax and synths , sorting through some secrets : a man on his own with instruments and electronics , concentrating on himself , on his place in space , on inventing a repertoire for himself , on the sound he 's making , in the moment he 's making it , one man and his shadow , drifting to the deserted edge of ambience , and this record is somewhere isolated and special between Anthony Braxton and Steve Lacy 's more graceful solo sax pieces and Four Tet .
I look at all these CDs spread out between us as we settle down to begin our interview , representing just a fraction of his work since the mid-60s , and I get a little hint of what I 've always thought it would be like if I ever got a chance to interview Bob Dylan .
I have so much I want to say , I do n't know what to say ."
2010-05-07,"All the nightmares came today/
And it looks as though they 're here to stay .
Substitute "" this week "" for "" today "" in David Bowie 's lyrics
and you have a fair summary of events in financial markets .
Greece 's woes threaten to infect the rest of the eurozone and the European Central Bank stands idle .
Those pretty things on Wall Street gave themselves a Lehman - style fright when the Dow Jones briefly dropped almost 1,000 points on Thursday .
The plunge ( or two - thirds of it ) turned out to be a case of computer - driven madness but it felt real at the time â
Greece has frayed nerves to that degree .
In any case , the Dow delivered a further 200-point loss by lunchtime in New York .
Taking its cue , the FTSE 100 index fell 138 points .
And now we have a hung parliament in the UK .
The City , despite chewing the permutations for months , was confused .
Sterling jumped around with every minor plot development , twitching upwards every time David Cameron mentioned the need for "" strong , stable "" government .
But was that even the correct response ?
The respected Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research offered the counter - intuitive view that a shaky government might help the economy â a weaker pound , with the market watching the UK like a hawk , might offer the best chance of staying upright .
At least Moody 's , the credit rating agency , was on best behaviour â or seemed to be .
The hung parliament was "" no direct threat "" to the UK 's rating , it declared .
But did that mean it is an indirect threat ?
That seemed to be the message . ""
In the event of a failure to reach some form of consensus on a detailed multi - year fiscal adjustment programme , the UK government 's Aaa rating would become much more vulnerable , "" Moody 's concluded .
Welcome to a world of shifting financial sands .
The biggest uncertainty â far bigger than the outcome of the horse - trading in Westminster â is the fall - out from Greece .
Dylan Grice , strategist at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale , pointed out this week that there is no set threshold beyond which markets refuse to finance government deficits .
Nobody knows how much debt is too much .
What we do know , argued Grice , is that the market â like "" an outsized monster in the Hollywood movies "" â hunts its victims one by one , as in the banking crash of 2008 .
At the moment , a re - run of that script is the main nightmare .
The debt dynamics of Portugal and Spain ( which , semi - officially , emerged from recession today ) do n't look as tight as those of Greece but in a proper panic that may count for little .
Investors are obsessed by the credibility of debt - reduction programmes â
it 's just that their definition of credible changes by the day .
That is Greece 's problem , too .
On paper , its austerity programme ticks the right boxes â
it is deep and is supported by the International Monetary Fund .
But the hole in the middle is obvious â with a fixed exchange rate , Greece faces an unequal struggle to make its economy competitive .
That flaw seems likely to be fatal to the plan .
If so , the ECB and IMF have merely delayed the moment of reckoning for the eurozone and holders of Greek debt .
Markets might tolerate that uncertainty for a while but any fresh bad news threatens to enrage the monster .
The biggest worry is that the change of mood in the investment world spills into the real world where companies make and sell products and services .
Will executives be too scared to hire new staff and make new investment ?
That way lies a double - dip recession .
At least the US had some good news today .
Employers added 290,000 workers in April .
It was a reminder that a dose of old - fashioned growth is the surest way to calm nerves .
But if that medicine fails to arrive in Europe , expect more wild weeks .

2010-06-03,"Of the eight acts in the fourth semi - final ( only one more to go now ) , no less than four were street dance acts .
Back in my day we danced in nightclubs , or in front of the mirror with a hairbrush and a pair of fingerless gloves : only Mick Jagger and David Bowie were dancing in the street .
Now it seems that half the nation is busting some synchronised moves with their baseball caps on backwards .
Still , we had some variety ; first up were Ice â a group from Rotherham who had clearly taken advantage of a 2 for 1 deal on scarecrow hair extensions .
They were followed by Tyler Patterson , a 10-year - old street dancer with plenty of ear - bling , loads of character and a real talent , like George Sampson in miniature , or the really cute kid from Diversity .
Keeping the Halloween costume industry alive were Fusion , who were more theatre than street , in fairness , which has to be preferable in bad weather .
My personal favourite were Twist ' n ' Pulse , who combined street dance and comedy into something refreshingly original and clever .
And they 're named after the operating instructions for my blender .
What 's not to love ?
In the non - streetdance half of the show , we were treated to two singers â Emile Harris , who made the double error of both singing his own song and singing it really badly .
Doing it for the more mature lady was 80-year - old Janey Cutler , whose distinctive talent was being very old , a bit of a character and yet still able to belt out a tune .
She also provided a prime opportunity for Ant to ask "" you 've had a really good time , have n't you Janey ? "" in his most patronising voice â he only just stopped just short of patting her on the head and offering her a Werthers Original .
But if you ca n't sing and ca n't dance , how do you impress the BGT judges , especially when every act on the stage has to compete against Amanda Holden 's cleavage ?
Well , you do n't , it seems .
One - man double act
Mark James tried his best with his half Elton / half Kiki Dee novelty act , which had a great costume but was otherwise forgettable .
Likewise , martial arts act Team Shaolin , who fashioned themselves into a human sandwich between knives and nails , did n't manage to blow the judges away .
They only made me crave watermelon .
The winner of the public vote was Janey Cutler ( who looked brilliantly stunned at the news ) , and the judges chose Twist ' n ' Pulse over The Fusion for the second slot in Saturday 's final .
Still with us ?
Vicky is back tomorrow night for the final semi - final , and I 'll be here on Saturday to liveblog the actual final final .

2010-06-29,"During the 1970s , David Bowie embarked on a dizzying journey through pop .
Over the course of the decade , working with an ever - changing cast of collaborators , he recorded fey art - pop , butch glam rock , soul , disco and stern European rock .
His run of successes is regarded as one of pop 's hottest streaks , his restlessness hailed as the sign of an unceasingly fertile mind .
Despite the mixed reviews , to see Damon Albarn with his band
Gorillaz onstage at Glastonbury on Friday was to be reminded of the heyday of Bowie .
Like his predecessor , Albarn is restlessly creative : he could easily have become only "" the singer from Blur "" , but instead he embarked on three remarkable projects that bear his imprint ; as well as Gorillaz , he has also composed an opera , Monkey : Journey to the West , based on a Chinese myth , and convened another group , the Good , the Bad and the Queen , all of which have achieved commercial success and critical acclaim .
Like Bowie , who dedicated much of the 70s to reviving the career of Iggy Pop , Albarn has drawn attention to other musicians : in his case , it has been African performers , through his Mali Music album and the Africa Express live project .
Like Bowie , he sometimes falls short of his targets , but like Bowie , it does not stop him striving to achieve yet more .
Albarn 's cocky , cockney persona sometimes encourages underestimation of his achievements , but he is our most unremittingly inventive pop figure in the 40 years since Bowie 's emergence .
We should be glad to have him ."
2010-07-25,"Michael Sheen has earned a reputation for specialising in the portrayal of ambitious men who know how to get what they want : in a 15-year film career , he has already played Brian Clough , David Frost and Tony Blair ( three times ) .
But while the 41-year - old Welsh actor is leaving behind the serious - minded biopic for his latest film , he still modelled his performance on a real - life figure .
Speaking at Comic - Con , the film and comic - book convention in San Diego , Sheen revealed that his approach to playing the villainous Castor in Disney 's forthcoming blockbuster Tron : Legacy was informed by the master chameleon Ã¢â¬ â David Bowie .
"" I was going for a sort of albino Ziggy Stardust , "" Sheen told the Guardian . ""
A one - man walking Andy Warhol Factory . ""
The film , directed by first - time director Joseph Kosinski , is a belated sequel to the 1982 hit Tron , set within a deadly computer game in which players are forced into combat much in the manner of Roman gladiators .
Sheen is one of the new members of a cast that also includes Jeff Bridges , star of the original Tron .
Eight minutes of 3D footage were unveiled at Comic - Con last Thursday to enthusiastic fans , who also learned that the French electro - pop band Daft Punk had composed the movie 's score .
"" Joe wanted the character to look completely different to everyone else in the Tron world , "" Sheen noted , "" so whereas everyone is in black , he 's in white : white hair , no eyebrows .
It 's a good choice , I think .
Castor is a character who reflects and assimilates everything around him , then adapts to survive .
I liked the idea of him as a shape - shifter who keeps reinventing himself , and the obvious reference there has to be Bowie . ""
Sheen confessed that he also took inspiration from Frank - N - Furter , the "" transvestite from transsexual Transylvania "" played by Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show , as well as from Mae West .
"" I wanted him to be a human pop - cultural jukebox . ""
"" Joe said he needed my character to bring a whole different kind of energy to this film , and that I had to be the biggest showman ever .
Then I 'm given that amazing nightclub set with hundreds of extras , that dazzling white costume , contact lenses and six - inch heels , and a cane that lights up , and I 've got Daft Punk as my house - band Ã¢â¬ Â¦ well , it was like a red rag to a bull . ""
Sheen is the latest in a long line of British actors ( including Alan Rickman in Die Hard and Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , Alfred Molina in Spider - Man 2 , and Sir Ian McKellen in the X - Men series ) to bring some flamboyance to the role of baddie in a Hollywood blockbuster .
The actor , who lives in Los Angeles , is currently filming Woody Allen 's Midnight

Or to put it more prosaically , David Bowie 's Station to Station from 1976 has been reissued in new packaging ( together with a previously unreleased two - disc live set , which highlights that even without Earl Slick on lead guitar , he never had a better band ) , and this week it entered the top 30 , sandwiched at No 26 , between Hands
All Over by Maroon 5 and the Script 's Script Ã¢â¬
â the sort of drab company that you would n't wish on anyone , let alone Ziggy or the Dame , as later wags would call him .
But still , never mind .
Suddenly Bowie is everywhere : the recipient of a cover story in the NME , in which younger turns line up to discuss the old chameleon 's influence , with some of these acts also appearing on a covers compilation , We Were So Turned On , the proceeds from which go to the charity War Child : here are Warpaint with a faithful "" Ashes to Ashes "" and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros with "" Memory of a Free Festival "" , alongside ( incongruously )
Duran Duran 's "" Boys Keep Swinging "" ( no , you do n't ! ) and Carla Bruni as a game ingenue on "" Absolute Beginners "" .
What to make of "" the more credible end of pop ...
rediscovering Bowie 's big ideas and grand themes "" , as the NME puts it ?
Lady Gaga , Janelle MonÃÂ¡e , Mark Ronson , Brandon Flowers and even ( incongruously ! )
Paul Weller all testify in the hope of seeing some of that stardust rub off on them .
Inevitably , Gaga is most brazen , saying : "" I look at Bowie as icon in art .
It 's not just about the music .
It 's about the performance , the attitude , the look ; it 's everything .
And that 's where I live as an artist ....
"" It 's here where she really misses the nub , of course , and likewise the NME writer who claims : "" Bowie invented the idea that having a pseudonym was only one degree of separation : that beyond that , you could in fact remake yourself into a walking , talking , living doll that would effectively become the canvas for your work . ""
Because where would Bowie himself have been without the likes of Billy Fury Ã¢â¬ â star of David Jones 's youth , born plain Ronald Wycherley Ã¢â¬ â or for that matter , Bertolt Brecht ?
Yes , image was crucial to Bowie , but it was n't just his look that mattered ; through the invention of multiple , subsequent personalities , he invited a different perspective on his art
Ã¢â¬ â his music .
Perhaps put it this way :
Lady Gaga can change outfits umpteen times in the course of a show , but the pop she produces , for all its slick attraction , bears little relation to any sense of an evolving identity .
It just , you know , sounds quite enjoyable .
In this context , Station to Station is actually of especial fascination because the Thin White Duke was the last of Bowie 's alter - egos , and the album represents a sloughing off of those skins .
Even if he never looked more striking , with cheekbones like razor blades , there was nothing very pretty about his coke addiction or his dabbling in the works of Aleister Crowley ( interestingly , in the new reissue there 's no place for the photo that appeared in the 1999 reissue of Bowie drawing a cabbalistic tree of life ) .
The record that followed the superficially glamorous but mysterious and darkly unsettling Station to Station , recorded in Los Angeles , was the first of his Berlin records , Low , and as the critic Ian MacDonald once wrote , the transformation between the two "" was an inner one , not a career move .
It happened to Bowie himself , not to Bowie the actor .
"" It all adds up to this question : in today 's pop climate , so bereft of real ideas , where is Dave when he 's needed most ?
On which note , this week , shockingly , also brought succour .
Almost nothing has been heard of Bowie since his 2004 tour , when he was hit in the eye by a lollipop on stage in Oslo and suffered a minor heart attack in Germany .
But news has just leaked Ã¢â¬ â then confirmed on the official website Ã¢â¬ â that a book is due next year :
Bowie : Object , which will feature "" 100 fascinating items that give an insight into the life of one of the most unique "" etc , etc .
Bowie will provide the text and one object could well be something called a "" kirlian photographic device "" .
Again , we can say not watch this space but watch that man ."

2010-11-26,"Music publisher Chrysalis , which has a back catalogue including the rights to songs by artists such as David Bowie and Michael Jackson , today agreed a ÃÂ£107.4 m takeover by German media giant Bertelsmann and a private equity firm .
Chrysalis is being bought by BMG Rights Management , a joint venture between Bertelsmann and private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts that has a catalogue of more than 200,000 songs and recordings by artists including Coldplay , Britney Spears and Westlife .
At 160 pence per share , the deal represents a 45.5 % premium over Chrysalis 's closing price on 29 October , the day before it said it was in takeover talks .
The company 's share price opened at 161.5p and hit a 52-week high of 172.5p following the announcement of the deal .
By late afternoon it had settled back to 158.5p , a 0.16 % drop .
Chris Wright , the chairman and co - founder of Chrysalis , said that the deal "" marks the end of one era and the start of another "" .
"" Our continued progress , evolving from management , recorded music , television and radio to focus on music publishing , has been clearly recognised by BMG , "" he added .
"" I am proud of both our track record and our future prospects in an industry in which we have both innovated and pioneered . ""
Wright has been invited to join the supervisory board of BMG Rights Management and become its UK non - executive chairman .
Bertelsmann , which also owns book publisher Random House and broadcaster RTL , was the owner of one of the five music "" majors "" until the end of the last decade .
However , a need to reduce debt saw Bertelsmann sell its songwriter 's catalogue to rival Universal , and offload its recorded music division to Sony in 2008 .
The German company formed BMG Rights Management after the Sony deal and has grown its catalogue with a series of deals in the past year .
Hartwig Masuch , the BMG chief executive , said that the deal was "" an important step forward "" in building its global music rights business . ""
Chrysalis 's extensive and high - quality catalogue represents an excellent fit with our existing business , "" he said .
Chrysalis , founded in 1969 , has a 70,000-strong catalogue of music copyrights and operates in areas of music publishing , music recording , artist management and entertainment product distribution .
Chrysalis used to own a record company of the same name before it was sold to EMI in 1991 .

2010-11-26,"Chris Wright 's music publishing group Chrysalis , whose roster includes David Bowie , Damon Albarn and Kylie Minogue , has been sold for ÃÂ£107
m after a month of takeover talks .
The buyers is BMG Luxco , a joint venture between media group Bertelsmann and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , which is paying 160p a share in cash .
In the market Chrysalis shares have dipped 0.25p to 158.25p .
Chrysalis said that during the bid process it had received another offer , but since that involved taking unlisted securities from the potential bidder , Chrysalis went with the cash on the table from BMG instead .
BMG - which has received acceptances accounting for 73.4 % of Chrysalis - said the deal was an important step in its strategy to build a global music rights business .
Chris Wright , who founded Chrysalis four decades ago and will become non - executive UK chairman of BMG , said the deal marked "" the end of one era and the start of another for Chrysalis . ""
Since its formation , the company has moved from management , records , television and radio to its current focus on music publishing .
Singer Capital Markets analyst Johnathan Barrett said the deal could turn the spotlight on other similar businesses : Historically many have struggled with the valuation of music publishing assets , not to mention the trends in the music industry , and it is therefore interesting to see this approach move to the agreed offer stage .
Industry consolidation has been a theme in the industry with Shed Media having been taken over during the second half by a large industry player ( Warner Bros ) in combination with management .
Amongst the remaining entertainment companies in the sector we note Entertainment One could be attractive to the large global entertainment companies looking for rights ( the Entertainment One library is independently valued at $ 250 m ) , content creation and distribution capabilities .
We note Warners recently acquired Leavesden
Studios , which may bode well for Pinewood Shepperton 's valuation .
Bloomsbury is in transformation mode , but does have an attractive back catalogue and is building a stronger information business , a combination that could be attractive to another party .
Entertainment One is up 2.5p at 113.5p , Pinewood is down 1p to 147p and Bloomsbury has edged 0.5p higher to 115.5p ."
2010-11-26,"When he was social secretary at Manchester University in the 1960s , two of the bands Chris Wright booked to perform there were Cream and the Yardbirds .
It marked the beginning of 42 years in an industry that finally came to a close with the Â£ 107 m sale of Wright 's company today .
The 66-year - old will walk away with Â£ 29 m following the sale of Chrysalis , one of the few remaining independent music companies , and begin "" semi - retirement "" after a business career that saw him sign artists including Blondie and David Bowie , build a radio empire , a television operation , and even chair Queens Park Rangers football club .
The impresario had been contemplating the sale of his remaining Chrysalis music publishing business , which includes artists such as Blur 's Damon Albarn and Thom Yorke of Radiohead , for several years and he has finally agreed to a takeover by a consortium of Germany 's BMG and private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts .
After the deal he will remain as non - executive chairman of the BMG UK operation .
After 42 years of running Chrysalis â founded with Terry Ellis â Wright was only prepared to concede to "" an element "" of retirement today .
He said : "" I hope it is less work than as executive chairman of Chrysalis but I might be busier than I think .
I 'm still at that point in my life that when I 'm not in the office I have nothing else to do but go into the office .
I will be in Monday to Friday as long as there is an office for me to go into . ""
Selling Chrysalis , where Wright had a 27.5 % stake , caps a colourful and at times difficult career .
Following a split from Ellis in the 1980s , Wright was forced to take the company public .
He subsequently sold its record business to EMI in the early 1990s .
He later set up a radio operation , which included the fast - growing Heart and Galaxy stations , and diversified into television â making Midsomer Murders and covering Formula 1 .
The City did not care for the mini - media conglomerate he created and the television arm was sold .
The radio stations were offloaded to the Tabor family for Â£ 170 m in 2007 .
Wright said running a public company had been of mixed benefit . ""
There have been times when it has been an advantage , especially building the radio division , "" he said .
"" But on the music side it is not easy being a public company .
It is so cyclical , not as consistent as investors like .

2010-12-29,"Being asked to narrate Peter and the Wolf is like being cast as Lear : the ultimate sign you have pricked a certain layer of the nation 's consciousness .
David Bowie has done it .
So has Peter Ustinov .
Ditto Patrick Stewart , Ben Kingsley and David Attenborough .
It was only a matter of time , then , before Jarvis Cocker was given the honour .
Like those that have gone before him , the Pulp singer is the owner of a voice you 'd recognise underwater , a deep and warm tenor with vowels as flat as his native Sheffield is hilly . ""
Hello everyone .
I 'm Jarvis , "" he said with a salute , as he strode on to the stage at London 's Royal Festival Hall .
The introduction was not superfluous .
While Cocker will be remembered by anyone over 30 after his bottom sabotaged Michael Jackson 's performance at the Brit awards in 1996 , to most of today 's audience he was just a messy - haired man wearing a lot of brown Ã¢â¬
â the kind of dishevelled chap you used to see on BBC2 if you got up too early and watched the Open University .
Many of those in the auditorium were still at nursery when Michael Jackson died Ã¢â¬ â and not even alive when the OU went off air back in 2006 .
Five - year - old Bella had been told by her uncle , Andrew Clark , that they were going to see the singer in one of his favourite bands .
But she was more interested in the animal noises .
"" I like the cat , "" she said .
"" It 's played by the castanets .
I mean , the clarinet .
I 'm always getting those mixed up . ""
What 's the name of the man telling the story , asked Uncle Andrew .
"" Umm , "" said Bella .
"" I 've forgotten . ""
Before he began , Cocker explained we were going to hear Prokofiev 's work twice .
"" You are getting the Brucie bonus , "" he said to an audience far too young for the reference .
""
The first time I 'll be reading the story , and the second time you will be watching an award - winning film .
"" Both versions would be accompanied by the Philharmonia Orchestra , he said .
"" The first time you 'll have to make the pictures in your head , and then you can compare them to the ones on screen . ""
Then he introduced the animals : the fluttering flute to represent the bird ; the waddle and quiver of the oboe as the duck ; the French horns for the big bad wolf , the timpani for the hunters and the jaunty strings playing Peter . ""
And which instrument is the grandfather ? ""
Cocker asked the crowd . ""
The bassoon ! "" chorused a choir of small voices , some of whom had attended the pre - show workshop in which animateur Luke Crookes provided a masterclass in Prokofiev 's kiddie classic .
As the story unfolded , tiny voices could be heard whispering : "" Mum !
Is that the hunters ? ""
and "" Dad , I think I can hear the wolf .
"" The jumpier members of the audience flinched when Cocker , as Peter , yelled "" Look out ! "" when the bird was about to be pounced on by the cat .
He was a fantastic narrator : deadpan , but never boring .
Some people put on baby voices to read to young crowds , but Cocker sounded just the same as he did singing Babies back in 1992 .
Perhaps inevitably , though , he was upstaged by the film that followed him .
In these celluloid days when kids watch a DVD in the back on every car journey , pictures will always win out over audio alone .
Especially when the film is as delightful as Suzie Templeton 's animated version , which won the best animation Oscar in 2008 .
Children and grown - ups roared as the duck skated on the ice , gasped as Peter lassoed the wolf and giggled as a flightless bird strapped a balloon on its back in an attempt to fly .
But Cocker did n't mind .
Sitting cross - legged on stage , he seemed as enthralled as everyone else .
Tickets are still available for tomorrow 's two performances"
2011-02-16,"Berlin in February ...
the song David Bowie never wrote .
But that 's the time of year Germany 's capital puts on its film festival in the Potsdamer Platz , a plot of land so symbolic
it 's dizzying .
Now a bustling square ringed by glassy skyscrapers , you can still see a portion of the wall â or "" Mauer "" as I now call it â standing in situ , and a paved track following its route that splits the square in half .
The major fault - line of postwar Europe is slowly being buried by the scurryings of tourists , filmgoers and office workers .
But life goes on .
The Berlinale Palast , where they show the films in the official competition , is just on the western side of the old divide , in Alte Potsdamer Strasse , and there are two other giant cinema complexes within a few hundred metres .
It 's perfectly possible , therefore , watch as many films as you can handle just by scooting between the three venues .
And that 's what I did .
The first day was bit of a non - event : the festival had secured True Grit as the opener , but that was of strictly limited interest â it 's one of those promo - oriented events where the film in question goes on general release a day or two later , rather than something fresh from the editing suite .
Things got going early on the following day with a screening of Margin Call , starring Kevin Spacey .
It 's a film that has set itself up as a searing drama about the 2008 financial meltdown .
But the plain truth is that it is n't searing at all ; neither does it eviscerate its investment - banker characters in the way most of the audience would presumably like , nor does it summon up trading - floor machismo like Oliver Stone 's original Wall Street .
The Devil 's Double was another film programmed for its hot - potato political relevance , with Dominic Cooper putting in the man - hours playing both Uday Hussain and his body double , Latif Yahia .
It 's based on one of Yahia 's three books about his time with Uday , and given muscular treatment by Lee "" Die Another Day "" Tamahori ; Cooper is , however , much more watchable as the entertainingly psychotic Uday than the stolid Latif .
But as is the way with film festivals , the idiosyncratic entries in the lineup can often be the most rewarding .
The Salt of Life is the new film from Gianni di Gregorio , his follow - up to the delightful Mid - August Lunch .
Salt â or to translate its original Italian title , Gianni and the Women
â is a tad more bawdy in content , being the story of a dispirited middle - aged man attempting to trigger a love affair with anyone who 'll have him .
But such is Di Gregorio 's all - consuming likability â
just take a look at our video interview with him â that this potentially Berlusconi - esque material is never tasteless or cheap .
Meanwhile , I liked Kevin Macdonald 's YouTube compilation Life in a Day a bit more than our Sundance blogger did .
The young director pulls off some nice sequences , rhythmically edited and often properly moving , but almost inevitably you feel that trying to shoehorn so much material in means you barely get to dip a toe anywhere before you 're whisked off somewhere else .
You also learn to expect the unexpected at film festivals : seeing so much stuff in so few days means odd conjunctions crop up and strange connections are made .
For example , Sing Your Song was an interesting if somewhat hagiographic documentary about Harry Belafonte , which essentially allowed Harry B to ruminate at length about his civil rights activism , his relationship with Martin Luther King and â weirdly â how he and Petula Clark , of all people , changed US TV .
( Apparently , her touch of his arm on her TV special in 1968 was the first such cross - ethnic contact on primetime . )
The next night I popped into The Black Power Mixtape 1967 - 75 , a very odd compilation of news footage shot by Swedish TV reporters during the Black Panther era , with lots of material â interviews with Stokely Carmichael , Angela Davis and the like â and the occasional glimpse of King with his acolytes , among them Belafonte .
You left
Sing Your Song under the impression
Belafonte was a solid citizen and bleeding heart of major proportions ; the Black Power people , by contrast , had little time for him ( though they largely seemed to respect King ) and there 's one outrageous shot of Belafonte simpering and winking to the camera , as he follows King into a plane .
A different view , all right .
Berlin also threw up a smackdown between two of the grizzled veterans of the New German Cinema movement , who improbably had both made an art - cinema 3D documentary at the same time .
Win Wenders , more than ever resembling an aging rocker , had shot a film about "" tanztheater "" pioneer Pina Bausch , while Werner Herzog had gone underground to examine a cave filled with prehistoric paintings .
Of the two , I much preferred the Herzog : he 's a film - maker who has been reborn after focusing on documentaries in the early 90s , and while Cave of Forgotten Dreams may lack the punch of Grizzly Man or Little Dieter Needs to Fly , its images are extraordinarily powerful and make far better use of 3D than anything I 've seen to date .
Pina was elegantly controlled and a film of high seriousness , but if I had n't had the Guardian arts writer Charlotte Higgins nudging me every now and then to explain which dance was being filmed at which moment , it would have all blurred into one .
And my Berlinale finished with another film of high seriousness â the Ralph Fiennes - directed Coriolanus .
I 've always thought Shakespeare adaptations have regularly proved graveyards for many talented film - makers â there seems to be a reflex to go very stripped - down , which rarely does cinema any favours â but Fiennes has done a pretty good job , unleashing some serious combat violence and concentrating on clarity rather than grandstanding .
It 's by no means flawless , but Fiennes carries it off in style ."

2011-03-17,"Continuing from last week 's Tom Waits - themed post , this week let 's take in a little Queen and David Bowie while considering just how stressful the stress tests Ireland 's banks are being subjected to really are .
Ireland 's banks are , indeed , ' Under Pressure ' .
But just how much pressure is being assumed in the tests being conducted at the behest of the Irish central bank by Blackrock Solutions , the consultancy charged with the task ?
Yesterday the Central Bank revealed details of the scenarios being used to test four banks .
The headlines made for grim reading for property owners , with a peak to trough fall in value of between 55 % and 60 % , as reported in the Guardian by Lisa .
Stress tests are simulations performed on a bank 's loan books .
The tests look at the likely effects on the quality of bank 's assets and liabilities when , say , interest rates rise .
When that happens , some people will be unable to pay back their loans , and these people will default , leaving the bank with a bad debt it will have to absorb .
In normal times , the bank has a sufficient cushion of equity capital or other assets to absorb the effects of an interest rate rise of moderate size .
But when banks are in deep trouble , when their balance sheets are damaged by excessive and inappropriate lending to commercial and residential areas , then we need to make sure they are strong enough to keep going if we , the public , inject more cash into the banks ' balance sheets .
Hence stress tests .
You ca n't have a test that nobody fails The last set of central bank stress tests , performed in late 2009 , passed AIB and Bank of Ireland as having sound balance sheets .
Less than two months after the stress tests , AIB needed a further injection of state capital , making a mockery of the tests .
The objective of the stress test is to provide credibility and to act as a strong signal to the markets that Irish ( and European ) banks are in reasonable shape .
For that signal to be credible , the assumptions underlying the stress tests must be very likely Ã¢â¬ â scenarios ca n't be too rosy , for example Ã¢â¬ â and some banks have got to fail .
They must fail because if the stress test is a true test of the solvency and liquidity of a bank 's balance sheets under strain , then under certain scenarios , we should expect to see banks falling apart .
If every bank we have concerns about sails through the stress test , then the test tells us nothing about the bank in question .
It does tell us something about the test though : we ca n't trust it . '
Make an ass of U and me '
My father used to say : never assume , you make an ' ass ' of ' u ' and ' me ' .
The fact that I make assumptions all day as a professional economist made him smile .
Key to the stress test 's credibility are their assumptions .
The Central Bank issued details of the macroeconomic parameters in this table above .
Let 's look at three of the parameters Blackrock Solutions are looking at .
There are two scenarios . '
baseline ' ( good ) and ' adverse ' ( bad ) .
The charts above shows four different macroeconomic assumptions the stress tests are based on .
Red lines show the bad scenarios , blue lines show good ones .
Everything is measured as a percentage change .
Going from left to right , we see the range of estimates for gross national product ( GNP ) is fairly tight .
We see the range of estimates for disposable income varies somewhat .
We see a sharp divergence in house prices .
What the fourth panel shows us is the outlook for domestic investment .
Remember that the four - year plan released in November contained estimates for investment .
That 's there in green .
Are the stress tests as meaningless as the four year plan ?
We see just how fanciful the investment assumptions underlying the four - year plan were , as we highlighted on this blog at the time [ 1 ] .
Under the bad scenario , GNP is roughly zero over the three - year period , while investment is close to zero .
Under the good scenario , house prices decline 55 % , but under the bad scenario , house prices only decline just over 60 % from peak to trough .
This is a very narrow corridor .
International evidence suggests cumulative peak - to - trough house price falls of 50 - 70 % after construction booms .
Why not go for a wider spread and assume 50 % drops as the good scenario , with 70 % as the bad ?
Why not assume disposable income continues to decline throughout the period , as we have seen in other balance sheet recessions ?
There is a risk that the stress test assumptions are overly optimistic , that the test is too easy to pass , and that the results will be meaningless .
Banks may not be under much pressure at all ."
2011-03-23,"A decade after it was shelved by his label , David Bowie 's 23rd studio album has been leaked on the internet .
Toy , conceived as a reimagining of Bowie 's early work , appeared on file - sharing websites this week , with Bowie 's reps refusing to comment .
Toy was originally scheduled to be released in 2002 .
Together with long - time producer Tony Visconti and Bowie 's touring band from 1999 's Hours ... , the singer had laid down sessions at New York 's Sear Sound studios , recording new versions of some of his earliest works .
These included 1968 's In The Heat of the Morning Ã¢â¬ â with the strings taken out Ã¢â¬ â and 1971 demo Shadow Man Ã¢â¬ â with strings put in .
Bowie also recorded a new version of his very first single , 1964 's Liza Jane , first released under the name Davie Jones and the King Bees .
But Virgin Records did not release Toy .
There were reports of rights issues , royalty disputes , and shortly thereafter Bowie set up his own label , ISO , licensed through Columbia .
Five of Toy 's tracks have since seen release , appearing on 2002 's Heathen and as B - sides , although the bulk of Toy remained a mystery .
On Sunday , that changed .
A week after an Australian man sold a purported copy of Toy on eBay ( it sold for ÃÂ£62.98 ) , a CD - quality MP3 version of the album suddenly appeared on BitTorrent , spreading like ( ziggy ) stardust .
This release is missing two tracks from Toy 's alleged track - list , Ca n't Help Thinking About Me and Karma Man , but includes two that were rumoured to have been cut .
Toy 's unveiling will be of considerable interest to music - starved Bowie fans , who have n't had a new album since 2003 .
Outside of a handful of cameos Ã¢â¬ â including work with Arcade Fire , Scarlett Johansson and David Gilmour Ã¢â¬ â the Thin White Duke has been on an apparent musical hiatus since heart surgery in 2004 ."
2011-03-28,"It 's been mooted for a while but confirmation has finally arrived , in typically irregular fashion , of a collaboration between the Flaming Lips and chillwave supremo Neon Indian .
Flaming Lips singer Wayne Coyne tweeted last week that he was dropping off boxes of the untitled EP to two record shops in Oklahoma and Dallas and , lo and behold , here 's the lead single , Is David Bowie Dying ?
At six minutes long and featuring big chunks of distorted guitars , rudimentary beatboxing and layers of sonic squiggles , it 's hardly chart - bound , but as the song unfolds it manages to mesh the more hypnotic end of the Flaming Lips ' work with Neon Indian 's dreaminess .
The second track on the EP is Alan 's Theremin , which we can only assume is the big hit single ."
2011-04-05,"David Bowie is reissuing a 1975 single as an iPhone app .
Almost four decades after Golden Years was released , the singer 's remastered classic will be available for fans to remix via dedicated , handheld software .
According to Music Radar , the original 16-track Golden Years has been mixed down to eight stem files : Bowie 's lead vocals , 12-string guitar , bass , drums , guitar , harmonium , percussion and backing vocals .
From 6 June , aspiring producers can download the app and create their own variation on Harry Maslin 's original mix .
For Â£ 1.23 , a similar program is already available for Bowie 's Space Oddity .
To accompany the new Golden Years app , EMI enlisted four DJs at Los Angeles 's KCRW radio station to remix the song on a new EP .
These versions are now streaming at KCRW 's website , and will be issued as 12ins and downloads .
EMI claims that each remix was heard by Bowie himself â though it is not known whether he liked them .
This week has seen the Blu - Ray re - release of Bowie 's first major film role , The Man Who Fell to Earth .
The Thin White Duke has also announced the forthcoming release of a limited - edition DVD containing films he made with his son , Source Code film - maker Duncan Jones .
Shot when Jones was young , these stop - motion animated shorts will be available on a set entitled CONtenders Volume 2 .
More information is expected soon ."

An absolutely - sober - honest Bernard Sumner says he saw the mothership hovering over Glastonbury 's Sacred Space one year .
The Troggs ' Reg Presley became so obsessed with crop circles in his post - fame years that he wrote a book about it .
The autobiography of the Kinks ' Dave Davies tells of being contacted Ã¢â¬ â by smell , no less Ã¢â¬ â by five alien intelligences in a Virginia hotel .
George Clinton and Sun Ra have purported to be aliens among us , and only partly as a metaphor for racial discrimination .
It might be reasonable to assume that all these stars were receiving scrambled messages from Space Station DRUGS .
But with so much evidence orbiting rock 's stratosphere , can they all be wrong ?
Sammy Hagar Hagar 's first encounter with UFOs came , he claims , at the age of four , when a spaceship descended over a field near his family 's home in Fontana , California . ""
At the time I thought it was a car with no wheels Ã¢â¬ Â¦ floating across a field , creating this big dust storm , "" he recently told MTV Hive .
"" I threw rocks at it Ã¢â¬
Â¦
And I do n't know what happened after that . ""
Clearly these visitors found Hagar a rich source of biological interest , since in 1968 , they returned in a dream , explained they were from the planet Zeeba and set about brain - mangling the poor chap .
"" They have used me in an experimental fashion , "" he told Guitar World .
"" They downloaded my brain information .
And I caught 'em doin' it !
I woke up in the middle of the night , thinkin ' , ' What 's goin' on ? '
They were like , ' Oh , my god , he 's waking up ! '
But this was all telepathy ; there were no words being spoken .
And as soon as I woke up Ã¢â¬ â it was probably three o'clock in the morning
Ã¢â¬ â my whole room was so bright that I could hardly keep my eyes open .
I was wide - awake
, I could not move Ã¢â¬
â
they were still disconnecting Ã¢â¬
â and when they did , it just went bang !
Everything went back to normal , back to black . ""
Hagar claims he 's since been visited by the same group of ETs , whom he calls The Nines "" because they 're from the ninth dimension "" .
A few dimensions too many for Hagar ?
Perhaps , but when he was examined by John Malley , a renowned expert on extraterrestrials , Malley claimed : "" Sammy has the mark of the alien on his left arm . ""
So the Daily Sport - style Weekly World News website reported , anyway .
David Bowie His Spiders were undoubtedly from Mars , but were the rest of his friends as well ?
According to Paul Trynka 's new Bowie biography Starman , Dave 's on - off squeeze around 1968 was one Lesley Duncan Ã¢â¬ â a songwriter who sang backing vocals on Pink Floyd 's Dark Side Of The Moon Ã¢â¬ â who would invite him to weekly UFO - spotting meditation evenings at her Hampstead flat .
"" We hoped the flying saucers would come and take us away , "" says Jeff Dexter , a fellow cosmic traveller present at those sessions .
"" We did see UFOs Ã¢â¬ â absolutely . ""
Creem writer Bruno Stein overheard Bowie himself telling a UFOlogist in 1975 : "" I made sightings six , seven times a night for about a year when I was in the observatory .
We had regular cruises that came over .
We knew that the 6.15 was coming in and would meet up with another one .
And they would be stationary for about half an hour , and then after verifying what they 'd been doing that day , they 'd shoot off . ""
Mind you , in practically the same breath around that time , Bowie could be heard extolling Adolf Hitler as "" a perfect figurehead "" for the "" real "" leaders of Nazism , and "" a marvellous morale booster "" whose "" overall objective was very good "" .
Which may undermine his position as a credible witness a little .

On a flight back to the UK from Australia during the writing period for their second album Surfing The Void , James Righton and Simon Taylor - Davies swear they were involved in a near - miss with an alien craft .
"" We were going over the channel from Scandinavia , "" says James with a geographical specificity that only adds credibility to the tale , "" I looked out and there was this fucking light and it flew really , really close . ""
"" I remember seeing it dart very fast that way , then dart that way , then dart directly under the plane , "" adds Simon . ""
No plane could do those manoeuvres .
We were so fucking scared .
The whole of the flight we were shaking with the blind down , sweating , thinking , ' Let 's land as soon as we can and speak to the pilot . ' ""
James picks up the story again : "" They denied there was anything close to [ us ] .
He said there was no chance anything could have come that close to the plane without them knowing . ""
The experience inspired the song Flashover , which the band hoped would become "" the theme song to the arrival of the aliens ! ""
"" I read somewhere that around about now the government were going to turn around and admit there had been alien contact , "" says Jamie Reynolds .
"" I wanted it to coincide with that event . ""
A compelling tale , then , and corroborated by each band member .
Sadly , its credibility is undermined by the fact that the band were at the time knocking back so many narcotics they thought their album was being produced by an apple called Mr Tabernacle .
Lemmy "" Four of us saw [ a UFO ] , in Yorkshire , "" Lemmy told Bizarre magazine in 2005 .
"" It came across the horizon like a streak and stopped dead in mid - air , hovered there for half a minute and then went off at a right angle .
It reached its original speed almost instantly .
We were just made up to have seen it .
So yes .
I believe in aliens .
"" Lemmy , lest we forget , was once a member of Hawkwind .
Matt Bellamy Muse 's frontman has long been fascinated by the more outlandish theories about the mysteries of the universe .
The Exogenesis suite of songs from 2009 's The Resistance focused on the concept of human life being carried to Earth via alien "" seeds "" dispersed throughout space .
These ideas were refined from Zecharia Sitchin 's 1976 book The Twelfth Planet which claimed that humans were ape / alien clones genetically engineered by a super - intelligent race from the planet Nibiru to mine Earth 's gold .
Which makes perfect sense when you look at it .
These ideas were further explored by Bellamy 's band on 2001 's Origin Of Symmetry .
It was when touring that album that Bellamy believed he had his own intergalactic experience .
He began hallucinating that he was on a red desert planet , being impaled by skull - piercing alien shards as thick as spears flying through the air .
Sadly , Bellamy 's doctor told him his visions were simply the result of dehydration from too much on - the - road booze .
He prescribed Bellamy some water and at that point the hallucinations stopped .
Jim Sullivan A real beam - me - up mystery , this one .
In 1969 , west coast folk singer and Easy Rider extra ( he had one of those moustaches )
Jim Sullivan quietly released his debut album , entitled UFO .
Now a much sought - after rarity ( recently reissued by Light
In The Attic ) , the album barely tweaked the record industry 's radar on release and Ã¢â¬ â one album later , with his marriage broken Ã¢â¬
â Sullivan left Los Angeles to start a new life as a session player in Nashville .
The only thing was , he never made it .
Sullivan 's VW bug was found abandoned in the road outside Santa Rosa , New Mexico , all the doors open with none of his possessions removed .
Search parties found nothing .
No buzzards gathered to indicate a body .
Locals told of a bearded hippy spotted living off the land near a local ranch , but there was never a confirmed sighting .
Others came up with stranger theories , suggesting he was kidnapped by a local mafia family .
Or even that he was abducted by aliens , angered by the contents of his long player .
It seems unlikely we 'll ever know the truth ."
2011-04-28,"Chicago 's Smith Westerns started in thrall to compilations of 60s garage rock , such as Nuggets , before their listening habits moved on a few years Ã¢â¬ â to David Bowie when he was still wearing makeup , Marc Bolan in silver lamÃ Â© and the like .
Their second album reflects that change in their tastes , blending the trebly , reedy , fuzzed guitar sound of the glam era with pop hooks and a brimming spoonful of creamy psychedelia .
None of the individual elements are terribly original , but the way they are brought together is a delight :
Dye the World sounds like a Teenage Fanclub song being played by the Spiders from Mars ; Still New offers the kind of huge , descending guitar hook that Ã¢â¬ â in combination with Cullen Omori 's wispy voice Ã¢â¬ â puts one in mind of Flaming Lips or Mercury Rev. Hooks , in fact , are the thing here :
Dye It Blonde is crowded with them .
It 's a joy to hear a band who want you to enjoy their music , not just admire it ."
2011-05-24,"Wolf Gang , led by frontman Max McElligott , are one of those blog bands that seem to have been around for ages yet are only just about to release their debut album ( our NBOTD profile was back in July 2009 ) .
While their early songs were heavily influenced by Talking Heads and David Bowie ( see non - album track Pieces of You ) , it 's MGMT 's Oracular Spectacular that seems to have soundtracked the album sessions ( masterminded , tellingly , by the producer of said album , Dave Fridmann ) .
Previous singles such as Lions in Cages and Dancing With the Devil gallop along , all pounding drums , sunny keyboards and a melodic core
that 's hard to shake , while this new single should nestle nicely on Radio 1 's A - list .
In this Guardian exclusive first showing of the video , we find McElligott following a mysterious young lady through a forest , across a field and finally to a beach before leaving her there to walk into the sea .
Also , the man is so talented he and his band can produce electricity in a cave without leads .
Definitely one to watch .
The album , Suego Faults , is out on 27 June and you can listen to five of its tracks here"
2011-06-07,"Producer Tony Visconti has denied Kaiser Chiefs ' "" absurd "" claim that they rejected lyrics sent to them by David Bowie .
This weekend , drummer Nick Hodgson said the band had asked Bowie for help with lyrics on The Future Is Medieval , soliciting him by text message
Ã¢â¬ â but his suggestions ""
just were n't right "" . ""
Tony texted David asking for suggestions to finish off a verse [ on the song Man on Mars ] and he came up with a couple of lines , "" Hodgson told News of the World .
"" I 'm such a big Bowie fan I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , but they just were n't right , so I 've missed out on a Hodgson / Bowie writing credit .
Gutted ! ""
Now , Hodgson will be even more "" gutted "" : Visconti claims the story was invented .
"" I have never asked David Bowie to write lyrics for Kaiser Chiefs , "" he told NME . ""
That is absurd "" .
Though Visconti was aware of the band 's love of Bowie Ã¢â¬ â
"" I was hired for the production job because of Nick 's obsession with Bowie and T Rex , "" he said Ã¢â¬ â ""

2011-06-11,"Michael Clark , choreographer , ex - heroin addict , and pin - up boy of the 1980s Blitz kids , is 50 next year .
And while his work continues to develop and refine within the abstract micro - sector that he has made his own , his deep subject remains himself and his life .
Last week , in the colossal emptiness of Tate Modern 's Turbine Hall , he presented th , a 10-piece programme set to songs by David Bowie , Kraftwerk , Pulp and others .
These were performed by his loyal gang of professional dancers , and by a chorus of four dozen amateurs .
The professionals are sleek in Stevie Stewart 's black and white all - in - ones , and later dramatic in black and silver .
As the music rolls from the speakers , and Charles Atlas 's icy lighting picks them out from on high , they map out the 50-yard floor space with Clarke 's wary , hyper - reductive steps .
All the familiar tropes are here : the nodding - dog heads , the tight couronne arms , the karate - stiff hands , the banking turns .
There 's no amplitude , no curved line , no surrender to the music 's sweep and billow .
But then it 's the very narrowness of the bandwidth to which Clark confines himself that gives the work its intensity , and there 's a humming interplay between his stark choreographic glyphs and the airy vastness of the hall .
There 's a relaxing of tension at the end , as Kate Coyne and Oxana Panchenko punch out the opening riffs of Bowie 's "" The Jean Genie "" with stabbing little prances on pointe , and the other dancers swing into the number 's sexy mannequin strut , but the main impression is of an artist endlessly reworking the same material in the hope of resolution , and perhaps redemption .
For me , numbers like "" Aladdin Sane "" , with their repetitive circuits and overwound toy dynamics , find a parallel in the scratchy self - portraits and neon epigrams of Tracey Emin .
There 's the same introversion , the same codifying of personal experience , the same close - focused search for meaning .
A delicate , momentarily - held frieze of dancers at the end of Funkadelic 's "" Maggot Brain "" is almost painful in its vulnerability , its blink - and - you - miss - it beauty .
Which is not to say that Clark does n't respond to the Vatican - like scale of the place .
Deploying his dancers at the greatest possible distance from one another , he plays stylish perspective tricks .
Here 's Benjamin Warbis , inches from the audience , performing a slow dÃ
Â©
veloppÃ
Â© .
And there , high on the walkway , so far away they do n't seem to be part of the same event , are the others , stretching and throwing shapes against the darkness .
Clark usually appears in his own programmes , if only for fleeting , Hitchcockian moments , as if to emphasise their autobiographical subtext .
And there he is , as Bowie mugs to "" Heroes "" on a screen , all but invisible in a dark hoodie on the floor .
The chorus is a nice touch .
Of all ages , visibly thrilled to be taking part , they advance and retreat in waves , dressed in Monty Pythonesque towelling tunics .
Sometimes they lie down , legs paddling , pinned to the floor like great black moths .
And if it 's clear that not all of them could do the steps blindfold , their tentativeness is very human , and highlights the fluency , accomplishment and all - round otherness of the dancers ."
2011-07-14,"Annette Peacock , the avant garde American composer , collaborator with Salvador DalÃÂ­ , friend of Albert Ayler and Moog - synth pioneer , brought this seismically influential session out in 1972 Ã¢â¬ â its synth - warped banshee vocals , morphed jazz ballads , Motown grooving and squelchy electronics were to touch many jazz and pop artists in that decade , most David Bowie and Mick Ronson .
Early on , Peacock 's spacey , harmonically drifting pieces were regularly interpreted by her second husband ,
the jazz pianist Paul Bley Ã¢â¬ â
but she 's since been covered by everyone from Busta Rhymes to Pat Metheny and Marilyn Crispell .
Peacock has finally reacquired I 'm The One 's rights from Sony - BMG , and reissued this long - unavailable classic .
And for all the familiarity of computer - assisted vocals now , nothing prepares you for the howl of her searingly high notes spiralling up out of spooky organ chords and soul - brass riffs on the title track , or against the rolling blues groove of Pony , or the dark and prowling one of Blood .
Elvis 's Love Me Tender is the only cover , a blend of soft , lyrical intimacy and fierce exhortation .
The underpinnings are as 1970s soul / blues - rooted as any classic - pop listener could wish , but the uncompromising , sound - manipulating focus still sounds contemporary ."
2011-07-16,"Call them the Big Five .
Game hunters have their wish - list of trophy animals , and rock music has its own â the elite group of rock stars yet to be bagged for publishing deals .
This month , after HarperCollins snapped up the autobiography of Pete Townshend of the Who after a bidding war , publishers ' sights are firmly set on the few remaining major talents to have held back from a book deal .
Paul McCartney , Elton John , Robert Plant and Bruce Springsteen are on that list , but at the top for many in the book industry is David Bowie .
Over the last year , memoirs by members of the Rolling Stones , MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and Guns N ' Roses have reached the bestseller lists .
As a result , a further series of stadium names â all now in their fifties and sixties , some against the odds â have decided to chronicle their lives and times , turning 2011 into the year of the rock memoir .
Turning the volume up well beyond 11 with tales of fast living and hard drinking , rockers Patti Smith , Steve Tyler and Sammy Hagar of Van Halen have all been vying for space in the book shops .
In Britain , the autobiography of the slightly younger Shaun Ryder is due to be published later this summer .
The really big prizes , like Bowie â recently described as the "" big white whale "" by Touchstone publisher Stacy Creamer â are the most tantalising prospects of all .
"" I will retire if I can get David Bowie , "" Creamer said .
Bowie has already signed a book deal with Penguin , but it is for a typically idiosyncratic kind of memoir .
The planned book
Bowie : Object has no confirmed publication date , but is billed as the first in a series to feature 100 items taken from the 63-year - old musician 's archive to "" give an insight into the life of one of the most unique music and fashion icons in history "" .
The design - led first volume will be "" annotated with insightful , witty and personal text written by Bowie himself "" .
The musician was due to deliver the manuscript to his New York literary agent , Andrew Wylie , in December but there has been no further word .
According to Weidenfeld and Nicolson 's Alan Samson , the British publisher behind Keith Richards 's hit memoir , Life , it is no surprise if the trail has gone a little cold . ""
The number of wild goose chases I have been on over the years , whether it was Eric Clapton , Bob Dylan or Sting , is incredible .
Of course , they have all done books by now , and Bob Dylan 's Chronicles were huge , but Sting has still only done his early life , "" said Samson , who was narrowly beaten to the rights to the Townshend book this month .
"" At every book fair in the last 20 years there has always been an A - list rock star on the schedules .
But to pin one down is probably harder than pinning down a Hollywood actor . ""
For Samson , the key element is to find the band member who writes the music .
"" That is what the market seems to want most .
It ca n't just be a book about drinking a bottle of whisky a day , because lots of people do that .
What lots of people do n't do , is stand in front of a stadium full of people and sing their songs .
"" A good lyricist is also a useful thing , Samson thinks .
Steven Tyler 's book Roll ' Em , published this spring , let the writer off the leash .
"" I 've been mythicised , Mick - icised , eulogised and fooligised , I 've been Cole - Portered and farmer's - daughtered , I 've been Led Zepped and
12-stepped .
I 'm a rhyming fool and so cool that me , Fritz the Cat , and Mohair Sam are the baddest cats that am , "" teased the Aerosmith frontman in promotional material .
The book went back to the presses for a new print run six times before publication based on the number of advance orders .
"" The nature of celebrity memoirs has changed , "" said Samson .
"" What used to be a series of well - polished anecdotes about dancing with Frank Sinatra , or the part that Sammy Davis Jnr played in changing a life , is now all about obstacles and about overcoming them .
Whether it is a bad haircut , a painful divorce or drug and alcohol abuse , people want to know how they got over it . ""
Samson is shortly to publish the memoir of Duff McKagan , the former Guns N ' Roses bassist .
It is titled
It 's
So Easy ( And Other Lies ) and the omens look good
: the author 's drink habit was once prodigious enough to give rise to the name of the beer in The Simpsons and a recent book by his fellow band member , Slash , sold unexpectedly well .
With a former drinker , simply recalling the crucial landmarks over the decades can prove a problem .
Samson said Keith Richards 's memory was "" amazingly good "" , which helped the book to stay on the New York Times hardcover bestseller list for 22 weeks , but the veteran music promoter Harvey Goldsmith concedes some of the stars he has worked with could have trouble remembering the details .
"" At times Led Zeppelin did n't know whether it was Dortmund or Dusseldorf or Denmark , "" said Goldsmith , who is planning to get around to his own autobiography some day .
"" But with established acts like that it is a great story and so is worth waiting for .
There is 35 years of music history there and the income from selling records has fallen away , so they can either make money from touring , or from a book . ""
Music writer Luke Bainbridge says the appetite for these books is enormous .
"" It is because you have got a set of rock stars and of fans who have reached the right age .
These are the bands doing the classic album tours , whether it is Primal Scream or Suede . ""
Bainbridge suspects that the unpredicted success of MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e 's book
The Dirt has now persuaded publishers that this is an increasingly lucrative area .
"" Lots of people read The Dirt who would never have bought a MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e album , "" he said .
As the HarperCollins editor who scooped Townshend 's memoir told the New York Times : "" It appears the entire Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is now sitting in front of the computer . ""
And the same is true of Britain 's ageing rockers ."
2011-07-20,"An installation taking up four walls and 16 frames , simulating a car driving north from Dalston Junction , with cameras mounted left , right , fore and aft , Flying Down to Rio itself marks the convergence of two paths , reuniting Iain Sinclair and Chris Petit .
Petit 's fascination with the view from the dashboard dates back to the 1970s .
"" Music and speed , combined with the ratio of the windscreen , made for an experience that was often more cinematic than the films I had to review for Time Out , "" he has said ; and his debut film Radio On ( 1979 ) contained a cherished driving sequence shot on the Westway , in tribute to JG Ballard 's Crash and Concrete Island , and soundtracked by David Bowie .
Over the decades , through London Orbital ( 2002 ) , also made with Sinclair , and Content ( 2009 ) , the windscreen shots have proliferated , and Flying Down to Rio , which is nothing but , is a culmination .
We proceed at the woozy pace of the car chase in Vertigo ( 1958 ) , in pursuit of a police van , usually with one quadrupled image per wall , but sometimes with a single loop taking up the whole space
Ã¢â¬ â an elaborately domed and corniced basement room in Mayfair .
On the left - hand wall , our view of the pavement , the joins between identical shots create , at points , an uncanny special effect : as the leading edge of one frame wipes out a pedestrian , so the trailing edge of the next frame along instantaneously introduces another in the same spot .
The Westway represents for Petit "" the modern city that London never became "" ; Kingsland High Street is Sinclair 's manor , at once the vanishing present and the distant past , subjected to a forensic going - over in his 1997 book Lights Out for the Territory .
The "" furious river of competing voices "" which Sinclair sought to interpret , increasingly subject to the single commanding voice of the property developers , is also the Roman Ermine Street , running from the London Wall to York .
This being Sinclair , Izaak Walton , John Clare , Barbara Windsor ( look them up ) , and divers others , are also in the mix .
Another reason for the choice of road , explaining the installation 's title , is the cinema that was Sinclair 's gateway to the borough he later made his own .
In 1961 , as a film student in Brixton , Sinclair first ventured north and east to catch Joseph Losey 's diamond - hard prison movie The Criminal ( 1960 ) at what was then the Dalston Classic . ""
The extended parenthesis of Kingsland Road became the trailer to Losey 's film , "" he recalls , "" the reason for that not - unwelcome retreat to the monastery of the prison system . ""
Accordingly , Petit and Sinclair 's layered soundtrack is for the most part an elegy for the old world of repertory cinemas , of which the Rio , which gets the full 16-screen treatment , is a rare survivor ; and for the sociable , mobile mode of cinephilia they sustained .
There are fragments from Ennio Morricone 's score for Once Upon a Time in the West ( 1968 ) , Anna Karina singing in Jean - Luc Godard 's Pierrot Le Fou ( 1965 ) , Orson Welles and Marlene Dietrich going back and forth in Touch of Evil ( 1958 ) .
In the Sinclair - Petit analysis , the closure of the Rio 's peers Ã¢â¬ â the Academy ( 1986 ) , the Paris Pullman ( 1983 ) , the Cameo - Poly ( 1980 ) Ã¢â¬
â belongs with the death of Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the rise of Miramax to the moment of "" post - cinema "" .
This has implied for Petit 's films what Sinclair calls a "" final renunciation of the burden of narrative "" , and it 's no accident if the image tracks of Flying Down to Rio aspire to the condition of Google Street View .
But renunciation has a narrative thread , not without ironic turns .
In Lights Out Sinclair included Petit alongside Patrick Keiller and Michael "" Witchfinder General "" Reeves in a pantheon of the forgotten , a category from which that book 's great influence has since removed them ; and if Petit seems more and more ambivalent about continuing , he has n't stopped .
Content described a convergence of mental and physical anti - landscapes Ã¢â¬ â online communication and giant distribution sheds Ã¢â¬ â and was primarily screened online .
Rio , by contrast , refuses to be turned into an AVI file , asks you to leave the house , to learn what the trip to Dalston taught Sinclair 50 years ago , that film is "" part of the occasion of its viewing .
Part of the place where it is viewed .
"" It 's not so much post - cinema as cinema by other means ."

2011-09-09,"An illustrated version of the 1969 David Bowie song Space Oddity , featuring Major Tom "" sitting in a tin can far above the world "" , has become a surprise viral sensation .
Canadian illustrator Andrew Kolb conceived of the book as a free PDF to showcase his talents to publishers , featuring colourful , retro illustrations of the astronaut as he rockets away from earth and floats "" in a most peculiar way "" through space .
The ending â "" Ground Control to Major Tom , your circuit 's dead , there 's something wrong "" â means it is "" maybe not necessarily the warmest , cuddliest children 's book , "" Kolb has admitted , but he posted it for free on his website in August , rapidly receiving more than 90,000 views , along with demands from fans asking to buy physical copies .
Its popularity follows another recent children 's book internet sensation , the tongue - in - cheek bedtime story Go the Fuck to Sleep , which hit the top of Amazon.com 's bestseller charts months before publication after a pirated PDF took off online .
Unfortunately for Kolb , as well as requests to buy the book , he also received an email from the music group holding the rights to Space Oddity , and has now been forced to take down the PDF and to remove references to the Bowie song from his pictures .
Although the Bowie version of the book can still be viewed elsewhere online , on Kolb 's own website it is described merely as a "" picture book set in space "" , with the proviso that "" this is merely a concept and no physical form of this book will be made until all involved approve of the collaboration "" .
The email , "" in a formal and very legalese manner , saying this is n't cool beans ... was n't the message I was hoping for , "" Kolb admitted to Fast Company .
But according to the website , the illustrator is now talking to publishers "" who are interested in trying to negotiate with the Bowie camp "" , and the project 's original purpose â to get Kolb noticed â has certainly worked .
He is currently talking to a "" major "" Canadian publisher about illustration work .
"" I guess I do n't have a book out in bookstores yet , but we 're on our way , "" he said .
"" I 've got no complaints at all . """
2011-09-16,"In just six ( long ) tracks , Station to Station manages to incorporate almost everything fantastic about pop music : it 's dramatic , stylish , emotional and danceable .
It 's not the most celebrated Bowie album Ã¢â¬ â that would be The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars or Low Ã¢â¬
â
but it 's been my favourite right from the moment I heard it , aged 16 .
The sleeve alone has a huge sense of occasion , with bold red typography that omits the spaces between the words , and a glorious picture of a drip - thin Bowie emerging from a spacecraft , a still from his film The Man
Who Fell to Earth .
Then there 's the mythology .
Being a teenager , I was particularly susceptible to the stories about this record Ã¢â¬ â that it was made in a cocaine blizzard in LA that involved witchcraft , the collecting of Nazi memorabilia and an exorcism that left a silhouette of Satan stained on the bottom of a swimming pool .
Yet despite the fact that Bowie was at his maddest ( he told NME that Britain needed a fascist leader a few weeks after the album 's release in 1976 ) , and so out of it that he ca n't even remember recording the thing , Station to Station is almost frighteningly accomplished , with a glittering , malevolent glamour I 've heard on no other record .
Has there ever been a more epic album opener than the title track ?
The first minute is just a sound effect Ã¢â¬ â a train travelling counter - intuitively from the right speaker to the left .
There are screams of feedback , and then the band kick in with a kind of art - rock death march before Bowie finally announces his presence , operatically declaiming one of the great first lines : "" The return of the thin white duke , throwing darts in lovers ' eyes . ""
The Thin White Duke was Bowie 's final persona , a character who embodied the allure of evil , immaculately dressed in waistcoat and Oxford bags , crooning rather than rocking out , determinedly European .
He 's never looked or sounded better .
As the song reaches the five - minute mark , speeds up and suddenly turns into a full - on disco number , the Duke shows his decadence in another line that impressed the 16-year - old me no end : "" It 's not the side - effects of the cocaine Ã¢â¬ â
I 'm thinking that it must be love "" .
Narcotically fuelled , dropping oblique references to Crowley and strange religions , Bowie blasts away his immediate Philly soul past and speeds into a more experimental future over 10 totally exhilarating minutes .
The Berlin trilogy of albums would come next : as Bowie announces , "" the European cannon is here "" .
That such a monumental opener does n't overshadow the rest of the album shows how much Bowie was on fire .
Golden Years Ã¢â¬ â a big hit in both the UK and US Ã¢â¬
â refines the "" plastic soul "" of previous album Young Americans into something suave and addictive .
Stay is savage funk deconstructed by brilliant , if audibly wired , musicians .
I used to feel that TVC15 was rather pedestrian compared to the rest of the album , but its second half is just inspired , jet - propelled by hysterical backing vocals , what sounds like a crazed concert pianist , and feedback that 's almost musique concrete .
It becomes apparent over the course of Station to Station that Bowie had found a band that could do almost anything , from Broadway - style showstoppers to krautrock Ã¢â¬ â which is no doubt why he stuck with them ( and vice versa ) through the rest of the decade , Low , Heroes and all .
The two other tracks are ballads that get to the heart of Station to Station 's Ã¢â¬ â and Bowie 's Ã¢â¬ â ultimate appeal .
Word on a Wing has a lyric whose meaning still remains tantalisingly out of reach : is it about a quest for meaning in life ?
For God ?
Is it sincere , or some kind of demonic piss - take ?
Then there 's Wild
Is the Wind , a cover of a song made famous by Nina Simone , on which Bowie gives a Sinatra - esque vocal performance so earth - shaking that it would have most other singers waving the white flag .
It 's the tension between the artifice and the emotion , the sheer enigmatic complexity of what 's being expressed , and the uncanny feeling that the band are creating something that 's not entirely down to their own consciousness that has kept me listening to Station to Station for more than 20 years .
The cocaine had one welcome side - effect : the fact that Bowie does n't remember making it means it will never be demystified , and the Duke 's corrupt glamour will therefore never fade .

2011-10-12,"To say David Bowie 's return in 1983 was eagerly awaited would be an understatement .
Bowie had been one of pop 's dominant figures in the 70s , his astonishing shape - shifting ensuring he remained ahead of the cultural curve .
And in the three years since his last album , 1980 's Scary Monsters , his central place in the pop firmament had been cemented , with post - punks and new romantics citing him as a key influence .
Given the stratospheric levels of anticipation , it was perhaps inevitable that many fans found
Let 's Dance a disappointment .
The alien artist formerly known as Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane had assumed no new identity , donned no new mask .
His 1983 incarnation was prosaic : a grinning , besuited , bleach - blond rock star .
He looked tanned and healthy , years younger than the emaciated , cocaine - addled Thin White Duke .
In interviews he joked and appeared relaxed .
There was nothing to frighten the horses .
Bowie had become accessible .
Where was the mystery ?
But I was n't disappointed .
I 'd discovered Bowie after Scary Monsters and found Let 's Dance thrilling .
I was 18 , and loved the idealised romance in the lyric Ã¢â¬ â and the reference to the song of the same name by Chris Montez , a hit when Bowie was a similar age .
And I found the marriage of Carlos Alomar 's blues guitar to Chic 's classy disco exhilarating .
Co - produced with Chic 's Nile Rodgers ,
Let 's Dance had a huge sound , as wide and expansive as the multiple zeros on its maker 's bank account , a sheen as glossy as the magazine covers he adorned .
True
, Let 's Dance signalled a parting of ways with the zeitgeist Ã¢â¬ â
but Bowie had n't quite finished with it yet .
The commercial success of Let 's Dance and the album of the same title ( featuring the follow - up hit singles China Girl and Modern Love ) dominated the airwaves in the long - hot summer of 1983 .
Like the best pop records , it was the perfect snapshot of the time ."

2011-10-20,"What 's this ?
A book about David Bowie with no pictures inside ?
Your average Bowie book is composed of little but pictures , the better for purchasers to feast on all that satin and tat .
Not for nothing did Bowie call one of his records Pin Ups .
He knew that his fans liked looking at him at least as much as they liked listening to him .
Brian Duffy , who shot the famously homoerotic image for the cover of Aladdin Sane , was n't wrong when he called Bowie "" a boy who liked dressing up "" .
There was always more to Bowie than perms and pan - stick , but the credits on many of his greatest albums did n't style him "" the Actor "" for nothing .
Stage - struck and starry - eyed , Bowie loved the paraphernalia of thespianism almost as much as his worshippers did .
Indeed , the one concession to the visual in Peter Doggett 's thrilling new study of Bowie is its dust - jacket portrait of our pouting hero emerging from behind a Kabuki mask â an image that serves as a lovely pointer to the book 's contents .
A work of impeccable scholarly exegesis , The Man Who Sold the World is about as far removed from conventional biography as its subject is from run - of - the - mill rock'n'roll .
Still , it is hard to imagine another book telling you more of what really matters about David Bowie than this one .
Its "" unashamed model "" is Revolution in the Head , Ian MacDonald 's song - by - song analysis of the Beatles ' oeuvre and its place in 60s culture .
In fact , MacDonald was subsequently commissioned to write a companion volume on Bowie and the 70s .
( A few tracks on Heathen aside , Bowie has n't done anything of note since 1980 's Scary Monsters . )
Alas , MacDonald had apparently done little or no work on the book when , in 2003 , he took his own life .
Into the breach steps Doggett , whose own books on the Beatles and on rock 's ( frequently spurious ) claims to radical politicking evince a man wholly at ease with MacDonald 's brand of historicist aesthetics .
Not , says Doggett , that he has a hope in hell of besting his predecessor when it comes to formal analysis . ""
Ian MacDonald was a trained musicologist , "" he tells us in his introduction .
"" I have chosen to take more of a layman 's path through Bowie 's music . ""
Some layman .
Did you know that "" Space Oddity "" opens with a floating Fmaj7 , and if you did â or could have worked it out with a little noodling â did you know that "" the C chord that established the key was played higher up the guitar neck than its companions , despite occupying a lower place on the scale "" ? ""
He 's only an eye , "" Cezanne said of Monet , "" but my god , what an eye ! ""
Pete Doggett , I think we can safely say , has a my - god of an ear .
But is the ear attached to a my - god of an intellect ?
Can Doggett move beyond the descriptive and categorical into the discerning and critical ?
Later on in his discussion of "" Space Oddity "" he mentions an "" almost ethereal sequence of ' ninth ' chords that suggested the spaceman hanging free "" and a "" Mick Wayne guitar solo that seemed to be testing out the walls of Major Tom 's prison "" .
I like that "" seemed "" even less than I like that "" suggested "" , and ca n't help wondering whether those same ninth chords might not equally "" signify "" entrapment in a song whose lyric required them to .
We are back ,
I 'm afraid , with the old chestnut about music and meaning â about whether , say , the flute motif at the start of Beethoven 's Pastoral evokes birdsong or merely reminds us that flautists , like birds , can make incomprehensible sounds that nevertheless please the human ear .
Thankfully , Doggett 's more impressionistic judgments are spot on .
Aladdin Sane is "" a more ' real ' album than Ziggy Stardust "" â and "" a more rewarding one "" too .
The beautifully multi - dubbed chorus vocal on Diamond Dogs 's "" Sweet Thing "" does sound "" pinched yet desperate "" .
The "" climactic ' genocide ' line "" in "" Future Legend "" is "" silly "" .
Bowie 's "" daredevil mutation into a Philadelphia soul man "" on Young Americans did indeed "" mask â¦ self - disclosure "" .
Less of a downer than it is often taken for , Low really does "" convey â¦ a state of emotional dissonance , in which depression [ can ] be uplifting and boredom become transcendent "" .
But it is in contextualising Bowie , in showing how he was nourished by multifarious aesthetic traditions , that Doggett comes into his own .
Bowie was always candid about his work being a mash - up of whatever he 'd been listening to or watching or reading , though he was often too drug - addled to actually detail chapter and verse .
Not so Doggett , who as well as having a fully annotated mental jukebox he can access at will , appears to have read everything from Arendt to Zarathustra .
He even owns up to having pushed his eyes through Colin Wilson , demonstrating pretty convincingly that Bowie swiped the imagery for Hunky Dory 's "" Quicksand "" from Wilson 's recently published The Occult .
Hegel , weirdly , does n't get a mention , though every page is infused with his spirit â so much so that the book could be called called "" Ziggy Zeitgeist and the Riders from Marx "" .
Hence Bowie , for Doggett , was the pre - eminent artist of the 70s because he embodied the decade 's entropic dread as much as â perhaps more than â the happy - go - lucky antics of the Beatles did for its predecessor .
Does this mean that our own straitened times augur well for a Bowie comeback ?
We can but hope .
Meantime , we have this challenging , cherishable goad of a guide to the great man 's most vital work .
Ian MacDonald might have done it differently , but he could n't have done it better , and The Man Who Sold the World takes its place next to Revolution in the Head on the short shelf of necessary reading about pop .
Praise does n't come any higher ."
2011-11-11,"Receiving its world premiere in this BBC Symphony Orchestra programme under JiÃ â¢ ÃÂ­ BÃâºlohlÃÂ¡vek was C , by JiÃ â¢ ÃÂ­
KadeÃ â¢ ÃÂ¡bek .
The 33-year - old Czech composer comes from a jazz / pop background and acknowledges such widely divergent influences as Chick Corea and David Bowie , as well as JanÃÂ¡Ã ï¿½ ek and Charles Ives .
As its title suggests , the 10-minute piece exclusively inhabits the key of C major , starting off with the note itself .
It soon sprouts what the composer refers to as tiny melodic roots , and then gradually adds in larger segments of the scale until full octave stretches , harmonised from within the key itself , bring it to a bouncy conclusion .
It 's the simplest of ideas , and , indeed , needed more sophistication and cleverness in its handling to justify its inclusion in an otherwise serious programme .
Here , its limited use of variation and extension felt shallow and unimaginative .
Unusual , too , in the all - Czech programme was the late Rhapsody - Concerto for viola and orchestra by Bohuslav MartinÃÂ¯ , with soloist Maxim Rysanov .
It 's an odd piece , its designation presumably owning up to its looseness of formal approach .
Much of the writing suggests background rather than foreground Ã¢â¬ â mood music with a hint of the composer 's American domicile as well as distinctive reminiscences of his distant homeland .
What made the performance special was the heightened authority and depth of tone provided by Rysanov , who dug deeply into his instrument to seek out potent expressive colours .
These were also apparent in some finely imagined orchestral playing in two further substantial works , DvoÃ â¢
ÃÂ¡k 's symphonic poem
The Golden Spinning Wheel and JanÃÂ¡Ã ï¿½ ek 's rhapsody Taras Bulba .
To hang together , both needed a greater sense of coherence and momentum than BÃâºlohlÃÂ¡vek provided Ã¢â¬ â the potentially thrilling apotheosis of the JanÃÂ¡Ã ï¿½ ek scarcely made it into the air Ã¢â¬ â
but he conveyed DvoÃ â¢ ÃÂ¡k 's extraordinary lyrical outpouring lovingly ."
2011-12-05,"Older siblings do n't always get the credit they deserve for their influence on one 's musical tastes .
From one of my brothers I acquired a lifetime 's unhealthy fascination with the work of David Bowie and from the other , a soundtrack of skinhead reggae and Tamla Motown that opened the door to a whole world of black music .
( The process is n't reciprocal : neither of them shows any sign of being influenced by the stuff I discovered on my own . )
In this case my brother had mentioned that Freda Payne , famous for her No 1 hit Band of Gold , had recorded an anti - war song called Bring the Boys Home and that the ensuing controversy had more or less killed her career .
It was only years later , in the early 80s , that I came across the single , on the blue Invictus label , at a car boot sale and promptly bought it despite never having actually heard the song .
Through the hisses and crackles came the sound of what I maintain is the greatest anti - war record ever made ( and at the time Robert Wyatt 's majestic Shipbuilding was a regular on my turntable ) .
Although released in 1971 during the Vietnam war , it has something universal and timeless about it
Ã¢â¬
â Payne said : "" It really addresses the ghosts of other wars .
"" The song packs its emotional punch by focusing on the simple human longing for loved ones far away and for those who will never come home .
For me the lines "" Ca n't you see them march across the sky/ All the soldiers that have died /Tryin ' to get home "" call to mind this famous Busby Berkeley image .
The song was written by General Johnson ( of her Invictus label - mates Chairmen of the Board ) , Greg Perry and Angelo Bond , and had originally been earmarked for another Detroit soul singer , Laura Lee .
Payne later said : "" I loved it the moment I heard it . ""
( She had been less enthusiastic about Band of Gold , feeling that the song , and in particular the lines "" That night on our honeymoon/ We slept in separate rooms "" , was more suitable for an ingenue than a grown woman . )
Far from ending her career , as my brother suggested , Bring the Boys Home actually went gold in the US although , unsurprisingly perhaps , it was banned by US armed forces radio .
It 's true the hits dried up not long after but that probably had more to do with the singer falling out with her record company .
Freda Payne is still working , still singing ( she recently toured with Cliff Richard ) .
Harder hearts than mine may be able to listen to this wonderful song unmoved but I ca n't hear Freda sing it without getting a lump in my throat ."
2011-12-22,"If the 1970s are remembered fondly at all , it 's through the prism of stack heels , feathers , glitter and flares , yet on BBC4 at the moment you can have your memories of the glam rock era destroyed in half an hour by watching old episodes of Top of the Pops .
It 's clear that Cliff Richard and the Wurzels spent more time in the charts than Roxy Music or T Rex , forming an incongruously bland soundtrack to years of political and industrial upheaval . ""
The decade of David Bowie , "" writes Peter Doggett of his latest subject , was fired not "" by idealism or optimism , but by dread and misgiving "" .
The latter sentiments , along with bitterness and blame , comprise "" the dominant folk memory "" of the 1970s , the 1960s having ended sourly for those who had believed in the promise of social transformation .
Doggett 's previous book , You
Never Give Me Your Money , was an account of how the Beatles , having preached spiritual investment and material divestment in the previous decade , spent years after their split in 1970 dragging each other through courts and accountants ' offices .
In The Man Who Sold the World he retrieves this thread of disillusionment and applies it to Bowie 's "" long Seventies "" , which begins with his first hit , 1969 's "" Space Oddity "" , and ends with 1980 's Scary Monsters , for most fans his last truly satisfying album .
David Bowie remains a cult artist ( though a hugely popular one ) in a way the Beatles never were .
There 's an extent to which you already have to be a pop music fan in order to be a Bowie fan , and his appeal in the 1970s did not extend across the generations .
Bowie 's music and image - making are strikingly important to our notion of the British propensity for intense , unusual creativity in pop culture .
His originality is a source of pride , though Doggett 's detailed study reveals this to be more a genius for stealing the right bits from his rivals .
He created Ziggy Stardust partly from how he perceived Marc Bolan to be at the height of his fame : spectral , imperious , out of control .
The book 's song - by - song format takes after Revolution in the Head , Ian MacDonald 's superb 1994 study of the Beatles .
Doggett writes that MacDonald was under contract to write a similar analysis of Bowie 's work at the time of his death in 2003 ; he was asked by MacDonald 's editor to revive the project , which he does admirably .
His sharpest insights come in the discussion of what he clearly feels are the most important songs .
Hunky Dory 's "" Oh !
You Pretty Things "" , with its creepy exhortation to "" make way for the Homo Superior "" , is only in part a hymn to Nietzsche .
It was also a way for Bowie , in his own words , to write his "" own problems out "" : the "" crack in the sky "" he witnesses in the first verse was first reported by his half - brother , Terry Burns , incarcerated in a south London asylum for nearly 20 years before he killed himself in 1985 . ""
According to Jung , "" Bowie once observed with rare understatement , "" to see cracks in the sky is not really quite on . ""
Doggett discusses Bowie 's cocaine use , which left him "" ravaged beyond belief "" on his 1974 American tour , and his repeated references in interviews to the coming of a Hitler - like leader .
Even in the 1960s he was harping on about this , which suggests that his notorious mid-1970s comments on the desirability of British fascism sprang as much from a genuine conviction that society was fragmenting as from his drug addiction .
The songs on the 1974 album Diamond Dogs , which loosely trace the story arc of George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty - Four , give weight to this idea .
The songs ""
We Are the Dead "" and "" 1984 "" were sketched out after Bowie took the Trans - Siberian Express across "" the fabled communist paradise "" of Russia .
He told his wife , Angie , that he had "" never been so damned scared in my life "" .
Listening to the song 's paranoid chorus Ã¢â¬ â "" Beware the savage jaw of 1984 "" Ã¢â¬ â Doggett conjures "" the image of a rabid slobbering hound "" .
He identifies the album 's "" nexus between science fiction , catastrophe and consumerism "" as having been a preoccupation of the 1950s , carried into the 1970s by writers such as JG Ballard and Colin Wilson , whose 1971 history of the occult was read and absorbed , perhaps a bit too comprehensively , by the autodidact rock star .
Bowie said in a later interview about the 1970s that "" nobody knew who they were "" once the 1960s were over : to him , the National Front , union membership , neoliberal thought , or punk rock , whether illusive or transformative , were rudders for the rudderless Ã¢â¬ â all Big Brothers of a kind .
In his book In the Seventies ( Serpent 's Tail , ÃÂ£14.99 ) , the biographer and memoirist Barry Miles has broadly the same take on the decade as Doggett , but his account 's blithe style and the notable absence of political figures or movements beyond the transatlantic underground hint that he was part of that turn inwards , away from collective action towards self - actualisation .
In the Seventies returns to themes and subjects familiar to readers of Miles 's 2002 book In the Sixties , notably his recording and archiving work with Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs , which took him to upstate New York , where he was an enthusiastic participant in Ginsberg 's commune for city - frazzled poets , before returning to the countercultural bubbles of downtown Manhattan and Berkeley , California .
The son of domestic servants , he lightly skewers the pretensions of the privileged , yet angry , drop - outs he encounters .
Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin , "" self - appointed youth leaders "" who sabotage a Greenwich Village benefit in 1970 for the imprisoned psychologist Timothy Leary , possess "" two enormous egos "" which "" buffeted around the room like weather balloons "" .
He eventually moves to the Chelsea Hotel , where he had stayed at the end of the 1960s , and then back to London , where he writes for the NME , wolfing smoked salmon and champagne at press junkets and being flown to New York on Concorde for the sole purpose of reviewing a Tangerine Dream concert .
All this is related in a way which suggests that such experiences are , if not normal , then accessible to anyone who is able to shake off the shackles of class and societal expectation , regardless of the times they live in .
Miles told the Guardian last year that his mother used to scold him for his aspirations , saying : "" You 're flying too high , my boy . ""
Unlike Bowie , who described "" hitting an all - time low "" in "" Ashes to Ashes "" , his contrite reckoning of a strung - out decade , the less noteworthy Miles never did come crashing down .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Lynsey Hanley 's Estates :
An Intimate History is published by Granta ."
2012-01-06,"It 's a cliche when a rock star reaches 65 to mention the time when it did n't look like they 'd make pensionable age , but with David Bowie who marks the milestone on Sunday , it 's almost unavoidable .
Look at a picture of him in the mid-70s , when he was ravaged by cocaine , living off a diet of red peppers and milk and so paranoid that he apparently kept his own urine in a fridge lest persons unknown steal it : this is not a man destined to make old bones .
It was n't just the drugs : there was something about the intensity with which he worked during that decade - the scarcely - believable ten - year creative streak that begins with the 1970s
The Man Who Sold The World and ends with the 1980 's Scary Monsters And
Super - Creeps Ã¢â¬ â that suggests an early demise .
Someone that burns that brightly probably is n't going to burn for long .
Under the circumstances , it 's hard to begrudge him his ongoing semi - retirement : he last made an album in 2003 , and for the best part of a decade has made only sporadic public appearances , the odd special guest spot here and there .
It was precipitated by emergency surgery on a blocked artery , and lurid rumours about the state of his health have abounded ever since .
Ill or not , having achieved more in one phase of his career alone than anyone can hope to in a lifetime
Ã¢â¬ â so much that it 's literally impossible to imagine what pop music would be like if he had n't existed Ã¢â¬
â
he 's entitled to take early redundancy from pop stardom .
You can mourn the loss of more music if you want , but in a sense , his absence feels strangely right .
Before his retirement , he 'd begun down the path taken by most august rock legends : having bullishly announced in 1990 that he 'd never return to his most famous songs , he began playing the hits again
Ã¢â¬ â he performed Low in its entirety in 2002 Ã¢â¬ â tacitly acknowledging that his best work was probably behind him .
It 's a pragmatism that has served everyone from Paul McCartney to Iggy Pop well , but the all - our - yesterdays approach somehow did n't suit Bowie .
The artist who drew a decisive , iconoclastic dividing line between the 60s and the 70s in the lyrics of All The Young Dudes ( "" my brother 's at home with his Beatles and his Stones Ã¢â¬ Â¦ what a drag "" ) , Bowie 's music was never about nostalgia , always the present , or , even better , the future .
Furthermore , the playing the - big - hits gigs are about creating a warm , communal glow of recognition among the audience and Bowie 's music was never about that either .
There was almost always something distant , aloof , other about it , even when it sounded like it was speaking directly to the listeners .
"" You 're not alone , give your hands , you 're wonderful , "" he cried at the end of 1972 's Rock ' N ' Roll Suicide , the collective we're - all - in - this - together sentiment undercut by the fact that it was sung by Bowie in the guise of someone else : he 's playing a role .
His music could certainly move you , but the main emotion it instilled was a kind of boggling awe , not least 1976 's Station To Station , made at the height of the wee - in - the - fridge era and yet - incredibly given that Bowie claimed to not actually remember making it - arguably his best album .
You listen to it , or Low , or Diamond Dogs in the absolute certainty that the person who made it was not like you or anyone else , no matter how much anyone else claimed to identify with him : not the gay kids who sat thunderstruck in front of Top Of The Pops as he casually slipped his arm around his hapless guitarist Mick Ronson
( "" people used to stop my sister on the street and say ' is that Mick of yours a poof ? '
"" , he later protested ) , not the fanatics who dressed up like him , not the legions of other artists who tried to imitate him and always fell short .
Bowie was an early adopter of the internet , but he did n't really fit with the notion of a star in the 21st century , an era when the manufacturing of pop music has been laid bare on the TV and where stars are perpetually available on Twitter and Tumblr .
Rock music currently exists in a world of 360 degree connectivity that 's supposed to bring the artist and the fan closer and reveal the real person behind the myth .
But as the best of his umpteen biographers David Buckley pointed out , with Bowie , revealing the real person behind the myth is missing the point : "" the myth has far greater resonance and is far more intriguing than stolid attempts to identify a ' true ' essence
Ã¢â¬ Â¦ his appeal has lain in the generation of myths .
"" Those myths look likely to remain intact forever , which seems perfectly fitting ."

2012-01-09,"New light is set to be cast on David Bowie 's enigmatic , tight - trousered portrayal of Jareth the Goblin King in Jim Henson 's cult children 's fantasy film Labyrinth through a graphic novel prequel out later this year .
A deal between the Jim Henson Company and comics publisher Archaia to publish graphic novels based on Henson 's creations has already seen adaptations of Fraggle Rock and The Dark Crystal .
Now a long - rumoured Labyrinth comic is on the cards , with illustrator Brian Froud , who worked on the original film , to oversee character design and conception .
Released in 1986 , Labyrinth told of young girl
Sarah 's quest to rescue her baby brother Toby from the labyrinth of the Goblin King , after she wishes the goblins will take him away in a fit of anger .
Jennifer Connelly played the part of Sarah , with a big - haired Bowie attempting to seduce her into staying with him in the labyrinth as the Goblin King Jareth : "" I ask for so little .
Just fear me , love me , do as I say
and I will be your slave , "" he says to Sarah .
The Archaia graphic novel , due out late this year , will cover Jareth 's past .
"" It 's the story of how Jareth is brought into the Labyrinth for the first time .
So , it does n't deal with Sarah , it does n't deal with Toby or anything like that , "" Archaia editor - in - chief Stephen Christy told Entertainment Weekly .
"" It 's a very tragic story that is the opposite of Sarah 's , which has triumph at the end .
It 's a prequel , so we know what happens in the movie .
We know how it 's going to end : Jareth is going to be the Goblin King Ã¢â¬
Â¦
so we 're showing how he 's pulled into the labyrinth for the first time .
It 's going to be cool .
We 're switching up the dynamic of it , but what we 're doing is completely true to the spirit of the original . ""
With Bowie performing songs for the original film Ã¢â¬ â "" You remind me of the babe "" Ã¢â¬ â Christy also hopes to include music in the prequel .
"" I do n't know if this will work out , "" he told Entertainment Weekly , "" but I want to do songs where they 're songs being sung ( by characters ) and we show the notes on the page , so you can actually play along . ""
And he says he 's "" talking "" with Bowie about the idea : "" The budget to get Bowie to do one song would be the budget of all the books , but we 're talking to him to at least get his blessing or maybe an introduction or something .
"" The graphic novel follows a series of manga sequels to Labyrinth , which featured an older Toby as he returned to the Labyrinth to become Jareth 's heir .
Christy said that "" a whole generation "" grew up with the film , and that it was "" a big deal to a lot "" of people .

Labyrinth was one of them , "" he said ."
2012-01-11,"Starting in 1966 , Lloyd Johnson helped change the look of rock'n'roll fashion , selling his iconic designs to Bob Dylan , Keith Richards , David Bowie , Oasis and many more .
A teenage modernist from Hastings , he began procuring tab collar shirts for the Beatles and Stones at Cecil Gee 's menswear shop in London 's Charing Cross .
On opening his own boutiques , the Heavy Metal Kids in Kensington Market from 1967 and Johnsons , The Modern Outfitters on the King 's Road in 1978 , he became an image - maker , kitting out Roxy Music in embroidered shirts , Rod Stewart in velvet suits and the Cramps ' Lux Interior in gold leather .
He also pioneered the black - studded leather "" La Rocka ! ""
look , immortalised by George Michael in his 1987 Faith video , and made his mark on Britpop , wrapping Take That and Oasis in fake fur coats .
What sparked your interest in fashion ?
It was 1959 .
I was 14 , at a battle of the bands competition .
I saw three guys there , they had Tony Curtis haircuts , were wearing bum - freezer jackets , cutaway collar shirts , slim Jim ties , tapered trousers , winkle - pickers with side laces .
I went up to them and asked : "" Why are you dressed like that ? ""
They said : "" We 're modernists .
"" I did n't know what that meant
but I thought , I 'm going to be a modernist .
My mum bought me a ÃÂ£10 brown suit with all the trims from Burton for my birthday .
With my college boy haircut , I 'd arrived .
You went from Cecil Gee shop assistant to tailor of choice for the Beatles and Bob Dylan .
It was quite by accident .
There was no game plan .
I started making my girlfriend 's clothes and wearing my own homemade ties to work , then I started selling my ties and it expanded from that .
I took a stall in Kensington market , made it look like a silver submarine with a port hole as the entrance , and I combined my loves Ã¢â¬ â music , rock'n'roll imagery and posing Ã¢â¬ â in my designs and created what I saw as stage wear for the street .
That 's what attracted them to the designs , they were from the heart Ã¢â¬ â and pure rock'n'roll .
Rod Stewart and the Faces were big fans ?
Rod used to live on a houseboat in Shoreham in the early 60s .
He 'd come over to Hastings and really cut a dash Ã¢â¬ â he already had a great haircut , and wore a black cord jacket and matching trousers , which were really hard to get hold of then .
He did n't have any money and he got chucked out of the local coffee bar because he could n't afford to buy a coffee .
Later he and the Faces would come over to the flat in Earl 's Court , to get fitted for their suits .
Ronnie Wood would come down the Greyhound pub round the corner from the stall in Kensington market , Marc Bolan would be there , Freddie Mercury , who at that time ran the stall next to me , too .
I remember telling him I thought Queen was a silly name for a band .
As a member of the previous generation , why did you embrace punk ?
There was a recession , the three - day week
, everyone was struggling , I could n't get my clothes made and then punk came along and bang !
It was a wake - up call .
Let It Rock , Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's shop on the King 's Road , was selling 50s - style clothes and that opened my eyes to retro fashion .
I started selling second - hand vintage clothing .
Not many people were doing that then .
I was selling mohair jumpers , plastic sandals and peg trousers to the soul boys and Bowie fans such as Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol .
Siouxsie was pure art form .
The youth always inspired me , the rubber spy - like trench coat I made in the 60s that John Lennon was fond of
, that was inspired by the riding coats a lot of French boys were wearing at the time , they were rubber and oil skin for practicality , but looking back , mine were more kinky
, they had a Joe Orton feel to them .
A range of clothes I made called R'N'Roll Suicide that Siouxsie , Billy Idol and Joe Strummer wore was inspired by a photo a friend of mine had of a young American pilot in the war in the Pacific .
Even though he was fighting in this dreadful war , he had a swagger , and it reminded me of the punk swagger .
It did n't matter what the circumstances , the youth always had a confidence , coolness and swagger about them .
You designed the clothes for the 1979 film Quadrophenia .
We measured all the suits but no one told me they 'd be wearing them over wet suits and fighting in the sea , and then they wondered why the seams split and the sleeves fell off .
No mod would fight in their suit .
They 'd go out of their way to keep their suit smart .
Once word got out that we did the clothes though , it got ridiculous .
The press jumped on it and it was : "" Want the mod look ?
Go to Johnsons .
"" The shop became overrun with teenage mods .
There 'd be queues round the block before we 'd even opened in the morning .
The Jam , the Specials , Madness , they came down and bought clothes .
But we sold rock'n'roll stuff too
and I thought no one else will come to the shop because it 's "" mod this "" , "" mod that "" so I got some French 50s window display dummies with rocker hair cuts , put them in skin tight jeans , biker boots and cut - off jean jackets I 'd designed
, I called it the La Rocka !
range and our first customers the next day were the Stray Cats .
George Michael launched his solo career with La Rocka !
George wore our BSA leather jacket and steel toe cap and heeled boots , they got a starring role in his Faith video .
It was a big statement ; here 's George , out on his own , serious , part of rock'n'roll 's heritage .
He bought loads of those boots because they kept being stolen by fans , and he had four of the BSA jackets too .
What advice do you have for those starting out in fashion ?
Do n't give up .
If you believe in what you are doing people will be drawn in like a magnet .
We did n't advertise for our staff , they came to us because they believed in what we were doing .
They were the best looking girls and boys in London and every night they were out clubbing in our clothes .
You could n't get a better promotional vehicle than that .
Likewise the musicians who bought our clothes , we never did product placement , they found out about us , through word of mouth .
If people are wearing your clothes because they want to , you know you 're on the right path .
What are you doing now ?
I 'm in the process of putting together a new La Rocka !
12-piece collection .
It 's La Rocka !
for now , for those who grew up with the original range and who still love rock'n'roll and rock'n'roll imagery .

2012-01-23,"The graphic designer behind the Occupy London logo has spoken out about the high court judgment ordering the eviction of the St Paul 's protesters last week , calling the ruling "" depressing but not unexpected "" .
Jonathan Barnbrook , who has worked with David Bowie and Damien Hirst and gave Occupy their logo for free , said : "" I do think that even if they are evicted the idea of what they are doing is now in the mainstream and we ca n't go back .
Occupy London has become a channel for the voice of people who feel that they are not being represented by the government .
This financial crisis has affected everybody , and the City , being accountable to only itself , has got off lightly .
This was a direct action of people who were prepared to sacrifice the comfort of a roof over their heads to represent us all . ""
Last Wednesday Mr Justice Lindblom ruled that the protesters Ã¢â¬ â who object to the banking bailout and government response to the financial crisis Ã¢â¬ â had to leave the area around St Paul 's Cathedral in central London that they have occupied since October .
He gave them until Friday 27 January at 4 pm to appeal to the court of appeal .
So far Tammy Samede , the lead defendant in the case , has done so ; George Barda and Daniel Ashman , the two "" litigants in person "" , have yet to do so but have indicated that they plan to , a spokesman for Occupy London said today .
Barnbrook became involved with the Occupy campaigners when they were forced to stop using their previous logo ( see left ) , based on the London Underground sign , by Transport for London , and held an open competition to find a new one .
Barnbrook 's design beat 17 others to be chosen as the new Occupy London logo after a vote among the protesters .
He said he was "" honoured "" they chose his logo .
The London - based designer said he had wanted to avoid the typical imagery of leftwing movements , such as the clenched fist , because he felt that the Occupy movement involved people from all parts of the political spectrum .
Instead he used the Os in the words Occupy London as symbols for location , with the L in the graphical part of the logo transformed into an arrow , indicating the journey a protester has to make to occupy a public space .
It was a reasonably conventional idea , he said , but that was right for something meant to be understood as widely as possible .
The Occupiers are also using Barnbrook 's font Bastard for the logo of their newspaper the Occupied Times ( left ) .
As he wrote on his blog , Barnbrook thought that was "" a rather apt choice of typeface , considering the ideology of the typeface : the reinterpretation of blackletter semiotics [ such fonts are often associated with the Nazis ] and insinuation that multinational corporations are akin to the new fascists "" .
One of the reasons Barnbrook wanted to be involved with Occupy London was because he felt that designers were often bracketed with the worst of the capitalist system , and he wanted to show that that did not have to be the case .
He is sympathetic to Occupy London 's aims , feeling that the protesters are playing an important role pointing out the flaws in the economic system since the financial crisis of 2008 .
He told the Guardian : "" It 's clear that we have to look at a new way of constructing our society , and I do believe the Occupiers are the start of that .
The market economy has limped along for a number of years , bringing unfairness to all but a few .
The people who called for the free market to rule all have been discredited .
People like Matt Ridley come to mind Ã¢â¬
â
he was chairman of Northern Rock when the government saved it from collapse .
He had previously been against regulation by government in all its forms . ""
The problem is until now people have lacked the imagination or will to change the situation but desperation is making people act now .
For me as a designer it gives me hope because we have been complicit in the feeding frenzy of the money - making ; now as part of the Occupy movement , there are designers working without ego , just with a belief in what the movement is doing .
"" Of the court case , he said : "" The strangest thing was the position of the church .
They talked very publicly about supporting the movement but gave evidence for the Corporation of London , so really there has to be some consistency in their view here .
""
Barnbrook said that throughout history society did not change until an idea gained "" mainstream political currency "" .
"" I do believe that Occupy London and the other movements around the world are the part of what will be a fundamental shift in society . """

2012-03-14,"Antony Hegarty is to follow in the footsteps of Laurie Anderson , Robert Wyatt and David Bowie by curating this year 's Meltdown , the annual festival of music and arts held at London 's Southbank Centre .
Hegarty , the man behind the extraordinary voice in Antony and the Johnsons , said he wanted to explore the environment , spirituality and gender politics when he curates the 12 days of performances and activities in August .
Speaking to the Observer , Hegarty said : "" It 's a bit daunting just because I want to invite a lot of people that I really like
and I want to make sure it all goes well for them Ã¢â¬ â
but it 's exciting .
"" He did not give names of artists he had in mind for Meltdown , but said he wanted them to participate in a way that was "" beyond the scope of their own music , in a cultural dialogue "" .
Hegarty said the Southbank Centre had not given him any limitations .
"" I 've started gathering the musicians I love , especially the singers I love Ã¢â¬ Â¦ and then because I 've been so focused in my work on the environment , women 's issues and feminism , that will be something I address in the course of the festival as well .
Ecology and the role of women and the feminine .
If there 's a theme , the theme is beauty and strength
Ã¢â¬ â the things that I think are most beautiful and strong ! ""
The Southbank 's artistic director Jude Kelly said Hegarty was "" one of the most fascinating artists of our age "" .
She added : "" From the moment we heard his voice , or caught an early glimpse of him stealing the show on jaw - dropping guest spots , there was no doubt Antony was a major talent . ""
Each director takes Meltdown in a different direction .
We ca n't wait to see where Antony will take the festival and us in August 2012 .
"" Hegarty was born in Chichester , Sussex , but was brought up in Amsterdam and California before moving to New York aged 19 and becoming part of the city 's underground performance circuit .
He became more widely known in the UK when Antony and the Johnsons won the Mercury prize for the album I Am a Bird Now , and memorably expressed disbelief that he had won .
"" It 's just a crazy contest , "" he said .
"" It 's almost like there 's a contest between an orange and a spaceship and a potted plant and a spoon Ã¢â¬ â which one do you like better ? ""
Hegarty expects to perform himself , something he has done before at Patti Smith 's Meltdown in 2005 and Ornette Coleman 's in 2009 .

2012-03-27,"When English Heritage erects a blue plaque , it 's generally to mark a place that 's associated with a famous person or event .
Very rarely does it celebrate a fictional character
â Sherlock Holmes has one on the site of 221b Baker Street â and now so to does Ziggy Stardust .
A plaque has been placed in Heddon Street , just off London 's Regent Street , to mark where the cover of David Bowie 's 1972 album , full title
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , was shot .
If Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust is eligible for a plaque , what other fictional characters would you like to see honoured like this ?
Maybe a plaque for Nigel Tufnel ( if you manage to locate Squatney , east London ) ?
One for Tracy Jacks on Walton seafront ?
And there must be club somewhere crying out to commemorate Ebeneezer Goode ?
If you 've got any better ideas , let us know below ."
2012-03-27,"In Strange Fascination , his biography of David Bowie , critic David Buckley treats Bowie 's performance of Starman on Top of the Pops on 5 July 1972 as one of pop music 's rare JFK moments , asking a selection of younger musicians where they were when they saw Bowie , plastered in makeup , drape his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson .
Ian McCulloch of Echo and the Bunnymen remembers schoolmates saying : "" Did you see that guy on Top of the Pops ?
He 's a right faggot , him ! ""
"" It helped forge an identity and a perspective on things , "" says McCulloch .
"" Helped us to walk in a different way , metaphorically , and to see things differently . ""
Now that the idea of a single pop performance challenging social taboos is as dead as Top of the Pops itself , it can be hard to comprehend the significance of the gesture , and of Bowie 's statements about his sexuality in his Ziggy Stardust days
Ã¢â¬ â
six months earlier he had told Melody Maker , "" I 'm gay , and I always have been . ""
He was no bolt from the blue : enough male rockers were toying with dresses and makeup for the magazine to call 1972 "" the year of the transvestite "" .
When journalists came to call , they found gay magazines ostentatiously displayed on the coffee table of this married father - of - one .
Bowie 's motives were not uncomplicated .
Though not exactly a lie , it was clearly part of a calculated plan to transform himself into a teen idol via his new alter ego .
But perhaps only someone who felt he was playing a role could have had the courage to make that step at that moment in time .
The gay rights movement was in its infancy , homosexuality had only been legalised a few years earlier , and even Liberace was still publicly denying the rumours .
And unlike a thoroughly gay star , Bowie had plenty of room for manoeuvre : the freedom of a born actor who could assume and discard roles as he wished .
But the significance of Ziggy 's sexual ambiguity transcended both Bowie 's media games and the glam rock scene that he ( and the similarly androgynous Marc Bolan ) spearheaded .
Many of the schoolchildren whose minds were blown by that performance of Starman grew up to be key players in the genre - blurring pop of the early 80s .
When gay stars such as Boy George , Marc Almond and Holly Johnson shared the top 10 with straight men in eyeliner , it was n't always clear which was which .
Rock audiences , especially in the US , retained a strong streak of homophobia Ã¢â¬ â that was one of the drivers of the ferociously bitter backlash against disco Ã¢â¬ â but at least different visions of male sexuality could now be played out in public .
Even Prince , one of the decade 's true megastars , enjoyed toying with listeners ' ideas of where his proclivities lay .
And during Britpop , too easily remembered for Oasis 's sports - casual machismo , it was once again the Bowie fans , chiefly Suede 's Brett Anderson and Placebo 's Brian Molko , who revelled in ambiguity .
For Bowie , Ziggy was a passing fancy : one of several stepping stones through the most exhilarating career of the 1970s .
By 1976 he was even prone to denying authorship . ""
That was just a lie , "" he lied .
"" They gave me that image . ""
But in the greater scheme of things , whatever he said later was irrelevant .
The deed was done , the genie was out of the bottle , and it 's arguable that a more militantly gay performer could never have released that genie in the same way .
Tom Robinson , a Bowie fan and gay rights activist who released the groundbreaking 1978 single Glad to Be Gay , reflected : "" I knew what he was talking about , and it affected my life in an enormous way .
Had that message been stronger , and not broadcast on the radio , I 'd never have heard it . ""
To gay fans
Bowie 's early 70s identity was a lifeline , while to those who did n't identify as such it was a demonstration that sexuality is n't a simple binary but a sliding scale .
Pop music was the perfect forum in which to explore and debate it .
That 's the real significance of the plaque to Ziggy Stardust unveiled in London 's Heddon Street : a reminder of how powerful an electric current pop could generate in less enlightened times .
On occasion , a song or a gesture could crackle through society so far and so deep that chart success became the very least of its achievements ."
2012-03-29,"It may be something to do with his extraordinary stage moniker Ã¢â¬ â somehow redolent of Goliath and Job Ã¢â¬ â that Bruce Campbell aka Jobriath has maintained a tenuous foothold in pop culture , somehow remaining a name to conjure with , unlike the legions of has - beens and never - wases who litter the rock'n'roll stage .
Of course , Jobriath was something special , even by the standards of rock loserdom : hyped to the max in 1974 , signed Ã¢â¬ â apparently
Ã¢â¬ â to a massive contract , given a billboard in Times Square for his debut album , and then promptly became an epic commercial disaster .
Jobriath was swiftly relegated to a footnote after punk rock detonated in the mid 70s , mostly for intrigued David Bowie fans mildly insulted by such an apparently flagrant act of copyism .
( At least , that 's how it looked to the likes of me , a decade or so later . )
But give any act long enough , and the underlying details , if allowed to emerge , will point to an undreamed - of significance in hindsight .
In this fantastically revelatory documentary by Kieran Turner , Jobriath has been thoroughly rehabilitated : as a charismatic performer in his own right , the unwitting victim of record - industry hubris , and an unlikely , reluctant martyr for gay rights .
Turner 's film contends that Jobriath 's fate was sealed by the tag his manager , Jerry Brandt , gave him : "" The true fairy of rock "" .
The androgynous , effeminate stylings affected by British glam rockers just did n't work when Jobriath adopted them : mainstream rockers hated them , the gay community despised the "" sissy "" look and , allied to Jobriath 's actual homosexuality ( as opposed to the assumed gayness of Bowie , Bolan et al ) , proved positively toxic .
The near - mute , uncomfortable figure we see in interviews is in stark contrast to the happy , effusive Jobriath captured in recording studio footage : clearly the man delighted in music making , and it was during the process of selling himself and his album that the pressure began to tell .
Jobriath 's story , of course , has its antagonist , the slightly satanic figure of Brandt , the wannabe Colonel Parker to Jobriath 's aspiring Elvis .
To contemporary eyes , Brandt looks the ultimate archetype of the mid-70s svengali : disco hair , a Studio 54 mien and fatally overweening ambition .
Instead of a doing simple hatchet job , to his credit Turner gives Brandt Ã¢â¬ â now in his 70s and living modestly in Florida Ã¢â¬ â ample screen time to explain his thinking .
Fairly soon you realise Brandt was more than a little besotted with his protege ; their eventual severing of creative relations , so devastating to Jobriath , was also more than likely a source of considerable pain to the manager , too .
Rather humiliatingly , he still seems to be waiting for a big break himself .
The film 's final section takes us into Jobriath 's post - stardom years .
Reeling from the failure , he eventually holed up in the Chelsea hotel , and reinvented himself as a retro cabaret singer ( one of his monikers was the rather obvious "" Cole Berlin "" ) .
A successful , if not spectacular career appeared on the way , but he died in 1983 as Aids took hold in New York 's gay community .
In recent years , his cause has been taken up by musicians as varied as Marc Almond and Def Leppard 's Joe Elliott , but their advocacy is hardly necessary : Jobriath 's story emerges as one of rock'n'roll 's great tragedies , a tale of hubris , misery and death .
One not to be missed .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Jobriath AD premieres tonight at the BFI Southbank as part of the London Lesbian and Gay Film festival , with further screenings tomorrow and Saturday ."

2012-05-09,"Comic strips , matchstick men and David Bowie will hit the Tate in 2013 , along with Marc Chagall , Gary Hume and Paul Klee .
The four galleries Ã¢â¬ â Tate Britain , Tate Modern , Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool Ã¢â¬ â have announced their programmes for next year , which include the first major retrospective of Roy Lichtenstein 's work for 20 years and a show that will demonstrate how LS Lowry was influenced by French painting .
Lichtenstein , whose comic - strip - style paintings made him one of the forefathers of pop art , will be shown at London 's Tate Modern from February .
The exhibition will include landmark works including Whaam !
, his famous 1963 picture of a fighter plane being shot by another , and Drowning Girl , both appropriated from contemporary comics , as well as the Artist 's Studio series which saw him bring his graphic , pop style to his own surroundings and other real - life art works .
It will also display lesser known late work including a series of female nudes and Chinese landscapes .
The gallery 's autumn show will be dedicated to Klee , a pivotal figure in 20th century art , who taught at the Bauhaus school and whose intense , radiant paintings , replete with symbolism and references to the unconscious , draw on cubism , surrealism and primitive art .
It will be the first Klee exhibition to take place in the UK for more than 10 years .
The Lowry show will take place at London 's Tate Britain from next June , the first of its kind since the artist 's death in 1976 .
Last year , the actor Ian McKellen accused the Tate of neglecting the artist , after claiming that it had shown only one of the 23 Lowry works it owns Ã¢â¬ â a claim the Tate denies .
Though Lowry 's images of matchstick - style workers in industrial landscapes are some of the most famous in British art , the exhibition promises to reveal how he was influenced by 19th - century French painters such as Camille Pissarro and Maurice Utrillo .
Tate Britain promises to unveil its refurbished galleries in early summer next year , including a re - hang that has already aroused some controversy , with Burlington magazine claiming that it was prioritising modern works over pre-20th century ones .
It will also stage an exhibition of work by Hume alongside that of Patrick Caulfield , who died in 2005 .
Tate Liverpool will approach another aspect of popular British art with its show Glam !
The Performance and Style , which promises to demonstrate the influence of the glam rock era , from 1971 to 1975 , on other art forms in Europe and America .
The gallery will also host Chagall :

2012-05-16,"My mates were as dismissive of David Bowie as they were of Bob Dylan .
This was 1972 , before he was quite as chameleonic as he would soon become .
Maybe it was to do with Bowie sometimes wearing dresses , or simulating fellatio on his lead guitarist 's instrument .
Whatever their reason , their hostility was reason enough for me to turn to his music as I sought to rethink my own persona , and searched for a new hero .
In 1971 , I had half - listened to tracks from The Man
Who Sold the World on Bob Harris 's BBC radio show while half - revising for my A - levels .
A year on Ã¢â¬ â sweeping the streets for the council after dropping out of university
Ã¢â¬ â
I was belatedly getting into this fresh album , Hunky Dory , full of kooky , inquiring songs .
There was a cool , clever sharpness , lyrically and musically , about Hunky Dory Ã¢â¬ â "" look , out , you rock and rollers "" Ã¢â¬ â with its jazzy piano and sax .
Other memorable tracks included Life on Mars , the homage to Lou Reed and the Velvets , Queen Bitch , plus Andy Warhol and Song for Bob Dylan , and Oh !
You Pretty Things , which was covered by Peter Noone of Herman 's Hermits .
And then there was this song .
It took the summer of 1972 and its aftermath for us to realise quite how much significance Changes held for Bowie .
That was the year he exploded : Ziggy Stardust came out , followed a year later by Aladdin Sane , and Bowie sped through his switches of costume and image , always on the move .
But the Changes were n't just Bowie 's , but ours , too .
It remains an anthem of diffident but defiant youth Ã¢â¬ â and still infernally catchy , too ."
2012-05-17,"Did you know this week is Music is Great week in Britain ?
You may think it 's Music is Great week every week of the year , but this is part of the This is Great Britain campaign , celebrating everything that is British and , er , great .
As part of the Music is Great campaign , backed by the major labels , a DVD of "" iconic live moments "" by British artists has been released with all profits going to Save the Children , and the first clip Ã¢â¬ â
David Bowie performing Ziggy Stardust Ã¢â¬
â reminded me of why I , as a child growing up in Stockholm , fell in love with British music in the first place .
While Abba dominated my tape recorder as a child ( I 'm Swedish , after all ) , my older brother would be blasting Bowie through the wall into my bedroom .
Pretty soon I was raiding my brother 's collection of albums .
The reason I wanted to move to England was the music .
That 's what defined the country for me .
Sure , I eventually got into numerous American artists , such as Joni Mitchell , Rickie Lee Jones and Stevie Wonder , but the Brits were something else altogether .
They did things no one else dared .
They were over the top .
They were larger than life .
Freddie Mercury , Kate Bush and , later on , Pulp ( who also feature on the DVD ) could n't have come from any other country .
I ca n't imagine a US awards ceremony where someone would interrupt a performance because the performer was "" pretending to be Jesus "" .
And after having lived in New York and then relocating to London I think I 've figured out why you guys are so good at creating new genres and hybrids of music : it 's the multiculturalism .
Sure , New York is multicultural
but it 's far more segregated musically .
I remember hearing a white label of UB40 and being blown away when I saw a picture of the band later on .
Other acts , such as Soul II Soul ( produced by Nelle Hooper ) , Seal ( produced by Trevor Horn ) , Massive Attack Ã¢â¬ â and Craig David , produced by Artful Dodger , before he attempted selling ice to Eskimos by mimicking US R&amp;B Ã¢â¬ â benefited from this multiculturalism .
Their music could n't have come from anywhere but Britain .
Another cultural phenomenon , unique to Britain , is a festival culture that I have n't seen anywhere else , with many people of all ages planning a few days at a festival as part of their yearly holiday .
The Music is Great DVD acknowledges the festival heritage , with some of the performances coming from Glastonbury , but the campaign has missed a trick by not celebrating the multiculturalism that makes British music unique .
There are some great performances , but how come the only two artists on the DVD that are not Caucasian are Freddie Mercury and Scary Spice ?
What about any of the artists I 've mentioned or , for example , an artist like Nitin Sawhney ?
Some of the most interesting and successful current music is also the product of said multiculturalism that makes you guys punch above your weight internationally .
I would have loved to see or hear some bass music as part of the campaign .
Or how about Maverick Sabre ?
I 'm in awe of British music 's heritage , which has provided much of the soundtrack to my life .
What about you ?
What do you think has made Great Britain produce so many of the most interesting artists in popular music ?
And what would be your dream lineup for this year 's Olympics ?"
2012-05-29,"David Bowie recorded a fair amount of bland pop in his time .
And I 'm not just talking about Absolute Beginners .
Even the strutting pomp of Ziggy and Aladdin Sane , Diamond Dogs and Young Americans seem rather banal now .
But every Bowie album from the 70s contains a Desert Island track .
Something you would n't want the world to lose .
Lady Grinning Soul , All the Madmen , Always Crashing in the Same Car , Station to Station , Sweet Thing / Candidate , Quicksand Ã¢â¬
Â¦
And , on the eponymous David Bowie album , rereleased as Space Oddity , there was this track , Cygnet Committee .
I do n't pretend to know what a Cygnet Committee was or is .
I 'm not sure
Bowie himself does .
And though there is a lot that is musically familiar about this piece ( the descending prog - rock sequence at the opening , and the predictable major - chord cycle of the song 's climax ) , it 's the words that make the difference Ã¢â¬ â and the way they are sung .
The basic idea Ã¢â¬ â relevant today in the upheaval sweeping the Arab world Ã¢â¬
â is that revolutions founder on the new orthodoxies they impose ( "" We can force you to be free/ We can force you to believe "" ) .
There is the wretched oxymoron of the peaceful ideal of the mid-60s counterculture being subverted by the violence it abhorred , as the decades clicked over .
( "" I will fight for the right to be right/
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right "" . )
And then that alarming culmination : "" We want to live .
I want to live . ""
Anywhere else that might be stating the obvious ; here Bowie , hollow of cheekbone and hounded by a demonic lead guitar , makes it sound like an urgent priority .
This is a piece of the period , a visceral scream that even 40 years later makes the hairs on the neck stand up .
A movement came and went and left an awful lot of pieces to be cleared up afterwards ."
2012-05-31,"Space Oddity was originally a top five hit in 1969 , after featuring in advertisements for the miniature Stylophone synthesiser , which Bowie plays on the song , and during the BBC 's coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing .
But the space age sounds and lyrics such as "" Ground control to Major Tom "" still sounded incredibly futuristic on its 1975 re - release , by which point Bowie bestrode pop like a Technicolor - clad colossus .
As one of the multitudes that took Space Oddity 's second mission to No 1 , the appeal for me was n't just Bowie 's science fiction odyssey of a doomed spaceman , but the fact that it was marketed as a "" maxi - single "" containing the equally dazzling Changes and Velvet Goldmine on the flip .
Eerily , while Major Tom ended up lost in the outer galaxies , my copy underwent its own tragic meltdown after contact with a radiator at school .

2012-05-31,"After David Bowie 's Low and Heroes , the race was on for the first big British electronic hit .
Everyone knew it was going to happen , because this was the sound of the future .
Who would it be : the Human League , Ultravox , Orchestral Maneouvres in the Dark ?
Nobody expected this to come out of left - field : a slow , almost dirge - y blast of pure teen alienation set in a chill Science Fiction future Ã¢â¬ â or , rather , alternative present Ã¢â¬ â with its intimations of surveillance , gay cruising , and robotic sex .
It sounds too much , but Numan sealed it with a perfect , disconnected vocal and a sweeping , whooshing synthetic arrangement .
With its two note hook , Are ' Friends ' Electric ?
Ã¢â¬ â even the quote marks are of their time Ã¢â¬ â dominated the high summer of 1979 .

2012-06-01,"HMV has sold the Hammersmith Apollo venue Ã¢â¬ â which has housed acts as varied as Oasis , Queen , the Beatles , David Bowie and Peter Kay Ã¢â¬ â to a consortium that includes the owner of the O2 Arena for ÃÂ£32 m .
The venue has been sold to Stage C which is jointly owned by Ansco Music , a subsidiary of the American magnate Philip Anschutz 's Anschutz Entertainment , and a subsidiary of CTS Eventim , a ticketing services provider , of Germany .
The venue , which opened in 1932 as the Gaumont Palace cinema , generated profit before tax of ÃÂ£1.9 m in the nine months to 30 April .
The sale indicates that HMV will sell off its string of live venues piecemeal .
It had been thought that it might try and sell them as one package with Sony touted as one prospective buyer . ""
The strategic review of the remaining [ HMV ] Live business is ongoing and we will update the market as appropriate , "" the company said .
HMV said the sale was part of a strategy to allow the struggling company to focus on its core business of re - invigorating its retail chain . ""
The Hammersmith Apollo is an iconic London venue and it has been a privilege to own it over the last three years , "" said Simon Fox , chief executive of HMV Group .
"" However , the sale will enable HMV to extend its bank facilities , strengthen its capital structure and ensure a strong future for the group . ""
Proceeds from the deal will be used to reduce the group 's ÃÂ£168 m debt .
HMV also said that its ÃÂ£220 m banking facility had been extended to 2014 ."
2012-06-09,"Anna Wintour , the formidable British editor of American Vogue , has been named as a leading fundraiser in the re - election campaign of Barack Obama Ã¢â¬ â an effort that has led to renewed speculation that she might be in line for a political appointment , potentially the US ambassadorship in London should the post becomes vacant later this year as expected .
Wintour , 62 , is expected to step further out from the political shadows this week when she joins David Bowie 's wife Iman to campaign for Obama on his home turf of Chicago .
The pair will travel to the city in the company of White House deputy chief of staff Jim Messina , known in Washington as "" the fixer "" , or "" the most powerful person in Washington that you have n't heard of "" .
The Washington Post reported last week that the price of access to the event is $ 1,000 , considerably less than access to a $ 40,000-a - plate fundraising dinner Wintour is co - hosting two nights later at the New York home of Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker .
Both events point to elevated political engagement by the British - born editor satirised in The Devil Wears Prada .
While she was active in Obama 's 2008 election drive , Wintour 's engagement in the political sphere has markedly increased over the last two years .
She has attended high - profile White House events , including two state dinners , one of them during David Cameron 's visit in April .
She serves on the President 's committee on the arts and humanities and has held Democratic party fundraising events at her New York home .
In addition , Wintour has been instrumental in helping Michelle Obama dress fashionably , pleasing not only the first lady but presumably her husband as well .
That in turn , benefits the business of fashion , particularly young designers who gain from sales and exposure after their designs are worn by Mrs Obama .
Moreover , Vogue has consistently supported the first lady 's effort in education and public health and was the first glossy magazine to land her for a cover .
But it is Wintour 's role in promoting fashion and luxury goods manufacturing as an important US export business , coupled with her growing political fundraising acumen ( according to the Obama campaign , she is a "" top bundler "" , raising more than $ 500,000 for the Obama Victory Fund ) that led to speculation she is eyeing a political position .
Last week , the Obama campaign released a video of Wintour wearing a designer scarf from an earlier , fashion - backed fundraising effort , Runway to Win , that she had kicked off with a party co - hosted by the actress Scarlett Johansson .
"" I 'm so lucky in my work that I 'm able to meet some of the most incredible women in the world : women like Sarah Jessica Parker and Michelle Obama , "" Wintour enthuses in the clip .
She continued : "" Sarah Jessica and I both have our own reasons for supporting President Obama , and we want to hear yours .
So please join us , but just do n't be late . ""
Wintour and Parker invited viewers to enter a draw for a pair of tickets to the event .
The opposition Republican National Committee responded with a video criticising the Obama campaign for releasing the "" glitzy fundraising video "" on the same day the unemployment rate went up .
"" It looked like the Romney campaign planted Dr Evil in the house of Obama and he said , ' You know on the day the grim job numbers come out let 's have someone who reeks of ornamental excess announce that the peasants can have a place at the table , ' "" considered Fox News commentator Juan Williams .
But despite its deep pockets , fashion is still feeling its way in the political realm .
It remains unclear what kind of influence , if any , fashion designers exert over the voting public .
Vogue 's Sylvana Ward Durrett told the Washington Post that young people are "" responding to the world of fashion .
Designers are becoming celebrities now "" .
Wintour , who has been at the helm of the magazine for more than 20 years , has consistently dismissed the suggestion she may be considering a new position .
But her personal life Ã¢â¬ â her long - term Texan consort Shelby Bryan was a key Clinton - era fundraiser Ã¢â¬ â and her adept use of professional power make a political appointment a natural move .
And vigorous political fundraising is typically key to a posting such as London , as opposed to a career - diplomat position in a less socially hospitable location .
In recent years , the London ambassadorship has typically been reassigned with each new presidential term as reward for services rendered .
President Bush appointed financial backers William Farish , a multimillionaire Texan , and Robert Tuttle , a California car dealer , as ambassadors to London .
The current ambassador , Louis Susman , 74 , was appointed by Obama in 2008 .
As a retired vice - president of Citigroup , Susman had little foreign policy experience but was known as "" the vacuum cleaner "" because of his ability to hoover up campaign cash in Chicago .
Sir Nigel Sheinwald , then serving UK ambassador to Washington , controversially described Susman as "" aloof "" and "" decidedly liberal "" .
But Wintour for ambassador ?
A state department spokesman would not be drawn on the subject : ""
An ambassador serves at the pleasure of the president .
It 's a designation of the most qualified person .
But it would be erroneous to think of London as a nice , cushy , westernised post .
This is a key strategic ally , so you 're going to want a very seasoned person , be it on the economic or diplomatic side of things . """
2012-06-12,"Three changes of dress and a kiss from Lou Reed .
The waiters were horrified .
Jill and Lyn are 17 and they 're into Bowie .
They 've both seen David working three times in as many weeks .
They 've both got Ziggy Stardust and neither of them like Marc Bolan .
Jill says she likes the way David looks .
She does n't necessarily think he 's good - looking , she just likes the way he looks .
They and me and a sweaty hall - full of other people saw David Bowie and the Spiders From Mars work Friars in Aylesbury at the weekend .
The phantom waver of the Ziggy banner put in an appearance as well , and it was alright
, the band were altogether and Ziggy played guitar .
The Spiders are a surrealistic vision of a rock band .
Trevor Bolder 's silvered sideboards hang several inches off his face and Woody Woodmansey 's hair is an orange Vidal - Sassoon duck 's ass similar to David 's .
Through the show at top speed until the final encore of Suffragette City where David pulls of his most outrageous stunt and goes down on Mick Ronson 's guitar .
David is gon na be huge .
The day after the gig he 's holding an extended press conference at the Dorchester Hotel , held especially for the planeload of American writers flown in for the weekend .
In the foyer , everything is frosty , air - conditioned elegance , in slow motion after the sweltering dusty street .
Down the mirrored corridors of the second floor through the door into a suitably chic room where assorted media people are eating cakes and sandwiches and drinking tea and/or Scotch .
Lou Reed and his band are there , all the Spiders , and curled up in a corner in a Bolan T - shirt , eye shadow and silvered hair , is Iggy Pop .
When I got there David was wearing an entirely different outfit .
Before I left he 'd changed into a third .
David 's wife , lithe and crewcut , is smoothing things down , getting together drinks and being assaulted by Lou 's roadie .
When I arrived , he 'd just bitten her in the stomach
and as she 's very slim , the bite had gone direct to her abdominal muscles and everybody was falling about .
Woody pours me a sumptuous Johnnie Walker Black Label and peach juice .
Lou Reed is talking quietly to David .
He 's wearing shades and maroon fingernails .
Periodically , horrified waiters enter to deliver yet more scotch and wine and sandwiches .
CSM :
At the moment , the most popular rock journalist words appear to be funk , camp and punk .
To what extent do you think you 've brought these words into essential usage ?
DB :
I think it 's most probably due to the general inarticulacy of the press .
They 're very small - minded .
They do indeed revolve around those three words .
Not revolve around .
They crop up ...
Yes they do .
Funk , I do n't think I have anything to do with funk .
I 've never considered myself funky .
Would you say that ?
I would n't ...
Would you want to be ?
Yes .
It 's a muddy kind of thing .
Camp , yes I understand the camp thing .
Once upon a time it was , I think , put down in the category of entertainer , but since the departure of good old - fashioned entertainers the re - emergence of somebody who wants to be an entertainer has unfortunately become a synonym for camp .
I do n't think I 'm camper than any other person who felt at home on stage , and felt more at home on stage than he did offstage .
Nobody ever called Jerry Garcia camp .
No , right ,
but he 's a musician
and I 'm not a musician .
I 'm not into music , you see on that level .
I do n't profess to have music as my big wheel and there are a number of other things as important to me apart from music .
Theatre and mime , for instance .
You say you do n't consider yourself a musician , but for somebody whose producing music of a very high grade , I would reckon that you 're entitled to be called a musician .
Okay then , I 'll shift my emphasis .
I would n't think I 'd ever be considered a technocrat on any instrument .
I have a creative force which finds its way through into a musical form .
You were saying you did n't consider yourself to be a musician .
In that terminology , in that definition : that a musician is a virtuoso on his instrument ?
By no stretch of the imagination .
I play a good alto
Ã¢â¬ â
I played a bit actually on the Mott album , which is quite pleasing for me , having not touched a sax for a long time .
You used it on Hunky Dory .
Yes , but just for a few phrases .
I used it quite heavily on the Mott thing .
[ Interjection from Mick Graham : "" You used it on stage . "" ]
What ?
Yeah , I did a James Brown thing for a couple of gigs .
We did Hot Pants and we blew a bit .
We did it at some of the gigs where there seemed to be a lot of Mods , so we thought we 'd throw it in , I ad - libbed most of it .
I remember five years ago trying to run a blues band and failing completely because people were standing at the front shouting "" Geno !
Geno !
Play some Tamla ! ""
Oh yeah
but I was a great soul merchant , a James Brown merchant .
I 've always dug his very funky things , but I 've never considered that I was capable ...
I 'm never gon na try and play black music because I 'm white .
Singularly white !
There 's a distinct kind of white funk .
Velvet Underground for instance .
Going by that as a yardstick of funk and not Albert King , would n't you say that what you are doing is into a certain kind of funk ?
Yes , I could n't put my finger on what it is .
Of the rock'n'roll things that we write , they would definitely be in the Velvets bag , because that 's my biggest influence in rock'n'roll Ã¢â¬ â more so than Chuck Berry , the archetype .
I 'd say that Lou Reed was to you as Chuck Berry was to the Stones .
Yes very much so , that 's a very good analogy , and I agree with it entirely .
In fact , I 've said the same myself on numerous occasions .
The second pre - conceived question I came with was that rock'n'roll is increasingly becoming a ritual .
Instead of the very down - to - earth stance of , say , the Dead .
Its becoming very much of a spectacle , very formularised .
I 've not seen many bands where I 've noticed that .
Alice is a very extreme example .
I think you come into it to a certain extent .
I think Bolan does .
Sha Na Na in their own particular way also ...
Well , you must firstly tell me your feelings on this before I quite know what your question is ...
I have mixed feelings about it
Ã¢â¬ â in some cases
it works .
I think it works when you do it , but sometimes I get the feeling that the audience is being excluded .
Yes , I feel that a great deal more : theatre does not necessarily mean props .
As you saw with us , we were using no props .
We 're not into props .
If we have theatricality it comes through from us as people , not as a set environment or stage .
Like playing an instrument , theatre craftsmanship is something that one learns .
There are going to be a lot of tragedies and a lot of clangers dropped over the next few years when a lot of bands try to become theatrical without knowing their craft .
I 'm a very professional person , and I feel that I contribute all my energies into my stage performance , that when I 'm on stage I give more to an audience than to anybody else when I 'm off stage .
I 've worked hard at it .
I was with a mime company and I 've had other theatre experience .
What I 'm trying to say is that it 's important to know about the things you do and to have learnt it , as it is to learn your instrument .
As the theatrical expression evolves a lot of it is going to be on a secondary - school amateur dramatics level .
There will only be the odd bands who have the knowledge to master their theatre .
Iggy has natural theatre .
It 's very interesting because it does n't conform to any standards or rules or structures of theatre .
It 's his own and it 's just a Detroit theatre that he 's brought with him .
It 's straight from the street .
Remember we have only been on the road for three months , so its still coming together , but I wish myself to be a prop , if anything , for my songs .
I want to be the vehicle for my songs .
I would like to colour the material with as much visual expression as is necessary for that song .
One thing I 've noticed is the way you use words , like in [ the song ] Andy Warhol , where you transform the word "" wall "" into Warhol .
I mean , the way you listen to speech and incorporate it into sound .
One can say a sentence to three people and it 'll take on an entirely different meaning for each of those three people .
I think if any of my stuff becomes at all surrealistic it 's because that 's the purpose of it .
It 's to give people their own definitions .
I certainly do n't understand half the stuff I write .
I can look back on a song that I have just written and it means something entirely different now because of my new circumstances , new this or that .
I get told by so many people Ã¢â¬ â especially Americans
Ã¢â¬ â what my songs are about .
You had better watch out or you 'll have your very own A.J Weberman rooting through your garbage .
I have one already !
He 's not quite at garbage level yet , but he 's certainly very adamant about what I mean .
It 's disconcerting to say the least .
Alarming .
But America is made up of academics .
They 're very Germanic in that respect .
Because they are so subconsciously aware of being a new nation that has no accepted roots in the old world , they strive for their own culture as fast and as quickly as they can .
Whatever is n't needed is soaked up by the media and becomes part of the American way of Life .
They 're terribly self - conscious about everything .
The level to which rock music has become an academic subject is just incredible .
I could walk into a shop and see row upon row of books about any aspect of rock .
I mean writers about rock .
I mean writers about writers .
There are even books on [ Richard ] Meltzer .
Layer upon layer .
Its a build - up .
They 're making their own culture .
Another line of yours I wanted to ask you about is in Five Years .
You said , "" I never knew I 'd need so many people "" .
Basically what it means is realising the inevitability of the apocalypse , in whatever form it takes .
I was being careful not to say what form it would take because that to me would be incredibly sad and I just tried to get that feeling over in one line .
It 's like the things you flash on supposedly when you 're dying running down the street and ...
His whole life passed before him ...
Yeah , really it 's like that , the grasping for life .
Do you feel worried by people who regard you as a guru ?
I 'm not that convinced at the moment that I am anybody 's guru .
I know there is a lot of interest in what I 'm doing , and we seem to be getting our goodly fair share of exposure , but I 'm not convinced that we are leading any particular cult .
But it 's happening almost in spite of you , people examining your albums almost line by line .
Okay , well , if this is going to be an inevitable situation with the chronicles of rock , and one must presume that it will be , then I would strive to use that position to promote some feeling of optimism in the future , which might seem very hypocritical related to Five Years .
There the whole thing was to try and get a mocking angle at the future .
If I can mock something and deride it , one is n't so scared of it .
People are so incredibly serious and scared of the future that I would wish to turn the feeling the other way , into a wave of optimism .
If one can take the mickey out of the future , and what it is going to be like ... It 's going to be unbelievably technological .
There is n't gong to be a triangle system , we are n't gong to revert back to the real way of life .
That 's not going to happen .
It 's certainly not a new thing , My God , I have n't got any new concept .
I juggle with them , but what I 'm saying , I think , has been said a million times before .
I 'm just saying again that we 've got ta have some optimism in the future . '
Five Years ' struck me as an optimistic song .
It is , it is .
The album in fact should be taken that way .
Starman can be taken at the immediate level of "" There 's a Starman in the sky saying , ' Boogie children ' "" , but the theme of that is that the idea of things in the sky is really quite human and real and we should be a bit happier about the prospect of meeting people .
On the second side of Ziggy Stardust the songs seem to go in a cycle .
But when you play live you do n't necessarily play them in that order .
I must admit I speculate on the prospect of a show which would be Ziggy Stardust , but the way I want to do it requires a lot of planning and we have n't had time for that .
I 'd rather leave it alone until its gon na be done properly .
I do n't want to do anything unless its gon na be done well .
In the other room I saw a tape box of the Mott [ the Hoople ] album .
The only title I recognised was Sweet Jane .
That 's right , Lou came down .
I 've got Lou singing it at the moment .
I 've got to put Ian [ Hunter ] on , but he does n't know the lyrics yet .
So you recorded it with Lou Reed singing on Mott 's backing ?
Lou phrased it so Ian can pick up how it was .
How does it sound when Mott play it ?
Fabulous , it 's really good .
I 'll play it for you .
The album is fabulous .
They 've never written better stuff .
They were so down when I first met them .
They were having troubles with Island , were n't they ?
Oh , everything was wrong .
Everything was terrible , and because they were so down
I thought I was gon na have to contribute a lot of material .
Now , they in a wave of optimism and they 've written everything on the album bar one Lou Reed number and the All The Young Dudes single
I did for them .
They were being led into so many directions , because of general apathy with their management and recording company .
Everybody was very excited about them when they first came out and then , because they did n't click immediately , it fell away .
When I first saw them and that was n't very long ago , I could n't believe that a band so full of integrity and a really naive exuberance could command such enormous following and not be talked about .
The reactions at their concerts were superb , and it 's sad that nothing was done about them .
They were breaking up , I mean , they broke up for three days and I caught them just in time and put them together again cause
in fact all the kids love them .
[ At this point , Bowie put on the rough tape of the Mott album .
First cut was Lou and Mott 's Sweet Jane .
It sounded the best Mott I 've heard .
While it was playing , Reed entered the room .
I hoped to get him to join in the conversation but he just came over and kissed David . ]
REED :
That 's it
[ exits ] .
I was hoping to get a two - way interview .
BOWIE :
That was a two - way interview .
You retired after Space Oddity :
Would you ever do it again ?
I ca n't envisage stopping gigging for the next year at least , because I 'm having such a good time doing it .
I 've never enjoyed it more .
I feel I 'm one with the band I 'm working with and that has n't happened before for me .
I 've always felt I was dragging people into doing things .
I had a band once before which had the same lead guitarist .
Yeah , I saw you work at the Roundhouse once with Country Joe about two years ago .
That Roundhouse gig was the kind of thing I cite , in that I was into something there that the band was n't into .
They were very much still only wanting to be musicians at the time , and it came off as no more than everybody dressing up .
Was that the one you came to where I was wearing a silver superman suit ?
You were n't .
You did Cyprus Avenue .
We did one at the Roundhouse about the same period when we appeared very much the same as we are appearing now , and that was with Mick Ronson .
I was in a cartoon strip and we all dressed up as a different super hero .
Who were you ?
No one in particular but superhero type figures .
We had silver suits , the thing I used to wear for Space Oddity , that silver cat suit which is exactly the same as this .
It has n't changed at all in three years , if you think about it , but it 's different material .
I was in silver lamÃ
Â© and blue silver cloak and silvered hair and blue hair and the whole thing , glitter everywhere .
The whole thing was on that scale .
Were they ready to cope with it at the time ?
No , they were n't .
We died a death .
And , of course , the boys said look , I told you so , let 's get back to just being a band again .
That 's the period that broke me up .
I just about stopped after that performance , because I knew it was right
, I knew it was what I wanted to do , and I knew it was what people would want eventually .
I did n't know when , though , so I held on .
I knew it would happen , because I 've always been excited about seeing things that are visually exciting and it 's always knocking me out .
I like seeing people pretending .
I have a great imagination .
I 'm not a vegetable .
I like to let my imagination run wild and I thought , well , if that does that to me , it has to do it to other people as well , cause I 'm just a person .
I 'm not quite that much of a superman .
And , anyway , I 'm glad I stuck it out really .
Could you name four or five specific records that influenced you early on ?
Yes .
Alley Oop by the Hollywood Argyles Ã¢â¬ â just a feeling that came from it .
I 'm afraid I 'm not very technical on things like that
and all I can say , at best , is that it was a feel that I had an empathy with .
I do n't know what it was whether it was the zaniness of the record or what .
Is that the one about the caveman ?
Yes , and that was Kim Fowley as a matter of fact .
He was the Hollywood Argyle that did it , and I loved parody because ...
Zappa ?
Yes , I admire Zappa , but there again I prefer Charlie Mingus .
I like my parody to be a little softer because I 'm a pacifist by nature and hostility in any form , even on a mental level , I find not endearing .
I think Zappa may have a problem with feeling that he was not accepted on a Mingus level and he had to find himself an audience .
I do n't think he 's ever forgotten that .
But Pithecanthropus Erectus is not quite the same as Brown Shoes Do n't Make It .
Well , that 's the strength of my view on parody .
I 'm a softer person by nature .
I 'm not hostile .
I do n't believe I 'm an aggressive performer , either .
I like the situation that seems to develop with the audience which is generally on a very human level
and they 're quite friendly .
It 's neither screamy nor rebellious : it just has a good feeling to it .
I love my audiences .
I think I 've not been to too many gigs , where the feeling is not nice .
It 's a very warm feeling I get from audiences .
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but is n't there one cut on The Man
Who Sold The World
that is a parody of Marc Bolan ?
Oh yes , yes .
That was Black Country Rock .
I Bolanised it .
I do that to a lot of people .
Apart from the obvious one , Queen Bitch , which of the others are notably parodic ?
I did a lot of Newley things on the very first album I made ,
Love
You ' Til Tuesday .
That 's a very strange album .
Has it been reissued ?
It will be .
It 's been out once .
They brought it out when I had Space Oddity , but it did n't do so well .
I expect they 'll bring it out in a few weeks time .
I guarantee they 'll bring it out .
Other songs : D'you want some more songs ?
Of course Waiting for the Man , I 'll have to say that one .
In fact , a lot of Lou 's material .
Especially that one because it sums up a lot of his early writing and his writing has changed considerably since those days .
I think his new material on the album that we gon na do will surprise a lot of people as well .
It 's miles different from anything he 's ever done before .
On Waiting for The Man I think Lou captured , for me better than anyone else , the feeling of New York , that particular area of New York that he was living in and those times .
The other great New York record of our times is Summer
In The City .
Yeah , I agree with that .
I was a devoted fan of the [ Lovin' ] Spoonful .
I loved them .
Another record was the Mingus Oh
Yeah album , particularly Ecclesiastic , which I drew an enormous amount of pleasure from .
I felt it was very 1990s
Ã¢â¬ â
very 2001 Ã¢â¬ â that whole album .
I was into that sort of jazz .
Before Santana came , I was into the English scene
and I was never able to relate to that stuff because of my earlier interest in Coltrane and Mingus as well .
A lot of Zappa 's things flatten me , actually .
Any of Zappa 's stuff make it with you ?
We 're Only
In It
For The Money , because I mean I saw huge potential in that area for Zappa , but I do n't understand Zappa
and I 'm not that intrigued by him to try to unwrap his problems or try to find out why .
Were you ever tempted to get into the James Taylor thing of autobiographical songs ?
Yeah , I had a spasm of that , but thank God I got out of it .
Out of all your material , with which songs do you feel most comfortable ?
D'you ever listen to any of your stuff and think that you could have done it better if you 'd done it later ?
Oh yes , lots of times .
A lot of The Man Who Sold The World , although that was one of the best albums I made .
It was a whole traumatic period .
What 's gon na be the next post - Ziggy development ?
Have you started to think about a new album ?
No , not at all .
I 'm still totally involved with Ziggy .
I probably will be for a few months getting it entirely out of my system , and then we 'll don another mask .
Thanks a lot , and I hope you and Ziggy will be very happy together .
Oh , no .
I hope YOU and Ziggy will be very happy .
Ziggy 's my gift to you .
IT HAD been the last interview of a long day of raps , zaps and varied craziness , and I was keeping David from an immediate departure to enjoy a fortnight 's holiday .
So we shook hands and said our farewells .
David 's alright , you know .
He may even be the "" shining genius "" his ads say he is .
Whatever , he 's a gas .
Long live Ziggy Stardust !
We needed him ."
2012-06-15,"Alan Yentob was responsible for getting David Bowie his proper first feature - film gig , after director Nicolas Roeg watched his legendary 1974 documentary Cracked Actor ; Bowie stepped seamlessly from one outsider 's odyssey across the American mindscape into another .
He is like ET 's spindly , sexy older brother as stranded alien Thomas Jerome Newton , seeking to transport water back to his parched planet .
Bowie 's skewed affect was a clean fit for the role , and it 's not clear how much acting is on display ; the musician , apparently up to his eyeballs in medicinal - strength cocaine , was n't sure either .
The wry playfulness of Paul Mayersberg 's script offsets
Bowie 's imperial detachment , and keeps TMWFTE grounded as Newton 's quest dissipates .
Roeg surfs the delirium throughout , finding stratospheric poetic imagery in the New Mexico locations and peering towards the horizons of present - day America : immigrant marginalisation , ecological violence , corporate corruption and , in Newton 's bank of television screens , traumatic media consciousness of it all ( "" Get out of my mind , all of you ! "" ) .
That a major America studio ( Columbia ) was prepared to bankroll this kind of visionary circus is more proof of how far gone we are .
Iconic , and nearly canonic ."
2012-06-23,"David Bowie does n't actually take part in David Bowie and the Story of Ziggy Stardust ( BBC4 ) , an excellent documentary about the making of the album , and the birth of the alter ego that catapulted him from just an androgynous 1970s oddball to unearthly android and icon , the biggest Ã¢â¬ â and most important thing Ã¢â¬ â in British pop since the Beatles .
It would be out of character , and take some of the mystery away , for him to appear as a talking head in a TV documentary , albeit one about himself .
Elton John does that kind of thing Ã¢â¬ â
not Bowie .
It does n't really matter , since just about everyone else who was there takes part : the Spiders from Mars ( apart from guitarist Mick Ronson , of course , though his widow appears ) , plus producers , press officers , mime artists , old queens , dance teachers , journalists , photographers , friends , lovers , and a bunch of other musicians who were friends or fans or who simply would n't have happened if it had n't been for Bowie .
Like Marc Almond , Holly Johnson , and perhaps Jarvis Cocker , who is narrating .
Ah , and here is Elton John .
"" It was like an art installation , it was like , ' Wow ! '
"" he says of Bowie 's first appearance on Top of the Pops , singing Starman . ""
No one had ever seen anything like that before . ""
And here 's Elton again , on Bowie 's seminal album .
"" When he came out with Ziggy Stardust , it was like an art installation , it was like , ' Wow ! ' "" he says .
Yeah , all right Dwight , we get it : it was like an art installation , it was like , "" Wow ! ""
Maybe Bowie does well not to appear on these shows .
Some of the Ziggy stuff , old interviews in which Bowie claims his mind was taken over by his own creation , now seems a little ridiculous in the get - real , down - to - earth 21st century .
Yeah shut up , mate , you 're from south London , not from bloody space .
He does n't even come over as a particularly nice person : very self - possessed and narcissistic .
But perhaps you have to be , to be a genius .
And God , it still sounds good , does n't it ?"
2012-07-06,"David Bowie 's performance of Starman may not have changed anything , but it 's still an extraordinary piece of television .
On Thursday 6 July 1972 , halfway through an edition of Top of the Pops , David Bowie performed his new single , Starman .
Dressed in a multicoloured lycra jumpsuit , he put his arm languidly round his guitarist Mick Ronson and looked seductively into his eyes .
Now , exactly 40 years later , Dylan Jones has written a 200-page book , When Ziggy Played Guitar , all about those three - and - a - half minutes of television .
"" It was thrilling , slightly dangerous , transformative , "" writes Jones , who was 12 at the time .
"" For me , and for those like me , it felt that the future had finally arrived . ""
Jones is not alone .
It would almost be quicker to list the pop performers and writers of his generation who have not cited this broadcast as a watershed in their musical and sexual education .
"" Basildon was a factory , working - class town , "" Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode once recalled . ""
Bowie gave me a hope that there was something else
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
I just thought he was n't of this earth . ""
The radio presenter Mark Radcliffe , then a 14-year - old pupil at Bolton School , thought that Bowie and Ronson had "" arrived from another planet where men flirted with each other , made exhilarating music and wore Lurex knee socks "" .
In 1972 , less than 5 % of British homes had more than one television .
Most teenagers avidly watched Top of the Pops , as the only chart music show on TV , but so did their parents , most of whom had grown up before rock'n'roll Ã¢â¬ â and something unfolding unexpectedly on the living room set could uncover a troublesome issue that would ordinarily remain unspoken .
Just before he launched his Ziggy persona , in January 1972 , Bowie had told Melody Maker he was bisexual .
And on 1 July , about 700 people walked from Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park in the first Gay Pride march .
The world was changing , but not fast enough .
While a pop star putting his arm round another man on television might not look very revolutionary now , it seems to have been a liberating moment for young people coming to terms with their sexualities .
The crime writer Jake Arnott , then aged 11 , recreated the Top of the Pops performance in his back garden with his best friend Pete , who had hennaed his hair like Bowie , "" feeling a strange sense of excitement as he put his arm around me "" .
But did this moment really "" create havoc in millions of sitting rooms all over Britain "" , as Jones suggests ?
We do not know , because no fossil record of its contemporary effect on viewers remains .
In 1972 there were no Twitter hashtags to collate an instant collective response , and it was only in the 1980s that newspapers , faced with declining readerships , really began to cling parasitically to the younger medium of television as a source of comment and gossip .
So Bowie 's performance inspired no press coverage or public reaction at the time , simply vanishing into the ether to make way for The Goodies at 8 pm .
All we have are people 's memories of the event , and viewers often misremember what they see on television , an inherently evanescent , momentary form Ã¢â¬ â especially in those days before domestic video recorders .
Perhaps these people are remembering having seen it repeated , because it is one of the few Bowie broadcasts around this time not to have been wiped Ã¢â¬ â although there was much excitement last December when a retired BBC cameraman came forward with a lost recording of The Jean Genie on Top of the Pops in January 1973 .
Despite the TOTP Starman being repeated often , people still misremember it .
When Alan McGee , founder of Creation Records , recalled seeing "" Mick Ronson on 10-inch platforms , bending over , giving the guitar fellatio "" , this must be a case of the wish fathering the thought .
Bowie did simulate fellatio on Ronson 's guitar in concert , but it would have got him taken off air at primetime on BBC1 .
One of the traits of popular collective memory is that it likes to fasten on landmark moments when everything was transformed and after which nothing was ever the same .
But the truth is always subtler and historical change always more of a continuum .
The turning of Bowie 's Starman performance into a seminal moment probably has something to do with nostalgic regret for the seemingly lost capacity of multichannel television to create these shared , cataclysmic moments .
But all those who saw the performance repeated again on TV recently can surely agree on one thing .
Even 40 years on , it remains an electrifying piece of television .

2012-07-27,"More than 50 years of British pop music were honoured by Danny Boyle as part of his 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in east London .
Featuring a megamix of artists from 1960 to the present day , an array of dancers performed to music from David Bowie to the Prodigy , via Blur , Amy Winehouse and the Specials .
There were many highlights during the often moving 15-minute section .
Dizzee Rascal appeared onstage to perform a section of his hit Bonkers , while dancers in Day - Glo costumes appeared to hold their own rave - up to the music of Eurythmics , Happy Mondays and New Order .
Underworld 's Born Slippy also featured in the medley , a song that Boyle had previously used in the soundtrack to his film Trainspotting .
And the ironic sight of the Queen having to listen to the Sex Pistols â whose music was accompanied by pogoing cartoon punk creatures â wo n't have been lost on most music fans , either .
The segment formed part of a ceremony that played tribute to key moments in British history , from the industrial revolution to the formation of the NHS ."
2012-07-29,"An album featuring music from the London 2012 opening ceremony has sold more than 10,000 copies within 24 hours of going on sale .
The compilation , named Isles of Wonder , is No 1 in the iTunes store album chart in the UK , France , Belgium and Spain , and has reached No 5 in the United States .
The release , which is also No 2 on Amazon 's bestselling downloads list , includes music featured in Danny Boyle 's opening ceremony to the Games , with tracks from Dizzee Rascal , Emeli SandÃ© , Underworld , David Bowie and the Chemical Brothers .
A spokesman for the Official Charts Company said 10,000 copies of the album were sold on Friday night and Saturday , earning it the No 5 spot in this week 's compilation albums chart .
Universal Music is also expected to release an album of music from the Olympic closing ceremony on 12 August , which will feature British acts including The Who ."
2012-08-05,"Consciously or otherwise , New Zealand comic Rhys Darby 's set keeps recalling Flight of the Conchords , the HBO sitcom that made his name .
In this show 's tenuous framing device , we find Darby marooned on a spaceship whose computer , Al , talks like Conchords star Jemaine Clement .
The gig even opens with a David Bowie number Ã¢â¬ â a singer to whom Conchords fans can never listen again without smirking .
But here , unlike in his last major fringe outing , Darby is n't overshadowed by his Conchords fame , and finds a workable balance between autobiographical standup and the rubber - limbed cartoon comedy with which he started out .
It 's the latter that secures the big laughs tonight , as Darby mimics a horse trying to walk backwards , or twists himself into wonky shapes to trigger a motion - sensor tap in a public loo .
For the opening 20 minutes we 're in Lee Evans territory , as standard - issue observational material is made loopily amusing by Darby 's vocal effects and elastic physicality Ã¢â¬ â not to mention delicious echoes of his Conchords alter ego , the fastidious consulate pen - pusher Murray .
( On offering a handshake and being met with a closed fist : "" Please receive it !
Please receive it ! "" )
The rest of the set is more autobiographical , and lowers the comic pitch .
That 's partly because Darby 's personal stuff does n't ring true ; his stories of childhood misadventure and teen romance are generically dorky rather than specific .
The best anecdote Ã¢â¬ â because it marries form and content , and could n't be about anyone else
Ã¢â¬ â recounts a careers advice session when , advised that New Zealand offers only three jobs ( rugby , farmer , Lord of the Rings ) , Darby pesters his teacher to let him work in sound effects .
Be true to yourself , is the lesson drawn from these fragments of autobiography Ã¢â¬ â and sure enough , a sharper sense of who Darby really is might yet turn his good act into a great one ."
2012-08-13,"David Bowie turned down the offer to sign off Sunday night 's Olympic Games closing ceremony with a performance of Heroes , one of several high - profile acts who passed up the chance to perform in front of a global TV audience of hundreds of millions at the finale of London 2012 .
Organisers of the ÃÂ£15 m show had also hoped to persuade the Rolling Stones , Kate Bush and the Sex Pistols to appear in what was intended to be a history of British music .
Even the Who , who did close the Games with a medley ending with My Generation , turned down the request to play twice , according to industry sources .
But a decision by the band to announce a US tour in July swayed them , given the scale of the promotional opportunity .
The three - hour show featuring Elbow , Take That and another Spice Girls reunion was watched by an average of 23.2 m viewers , making it marginally more popular than the ÃÂ£27 m opening ceremony two weeks earlier .
Viewing peaked at 26.3 m on the night , although the event , which garnered a more mixed reception than Danny Boyle 's show , would have been helped by its Sunday night slot , when people are more likely to be at home .
As for Bowie , the 65-year - old has not toured since 2006 , and it was always an ambitious request to try to persuade him to participate , even if Heroes was used as an unofficial anthem for Team GB during the Games .
Although he closely monitors his own press coverage , Bowie , now based in New York , repeatedly turns down requests to perform or appear in public .
Fans of the singer had to make do with a segment in the middle of the "" Symphony for British Music "" in which Fashion was played against a catwalk sequence featuring Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell Ã¢â¬ â one of several recorded sections which suggested that hoped - for performers would not appear .
Six months ago , artist managers and other music industry executives were given a presentation by concert producer Kim Gavin and film composer David Arnold of ambitious plans to showcase the history of British pop music from the 1960s .
At that stage , there were few confirmed participants other than an agreement to play John Lennon 's Imagine , which formed a centrepiece of the programme .
Kate Bush was among those Gavin and Arnold hoped would appear , and there were rumours in the industry that she had agreed to perform .
However , Bush too is reluctant to appear in public .
Organisers agreed to play a remix of Running Up That Hill , and the singer released a statement on her website on Monday praising a "" brilliant show "" .
Backstage on the night , there was surprise that George Michael was allowed to perform his new single , White Light , which was released on Monday , in addition to solo classic Freedom .
Island Records , his record company , hastily deleted a tweet inviting viewers to buy the song and the single did not make the top 10 on iTunes on Monday .
One manager keen to support the event was Simon Fuller , the impresario behind the Spice Girls , David Beckham and Andy Murray .
Some of the Spice Girls were particularly reluctant to perform at an event that despite all its apparent expense was still felt to be staged at minimal cost , but Fuller persuaded them , helpfully keeping the quintet in the public eye a few months ahead of the opening of the musical Viva
Forever , which is based on their songs .
Fuller , who was in the royal box on Sunday night , also saw another of his acts , singer Annie Lennox , perform Little Bird .
But there was little sign of his rival svengali , Simon Cowell , with only one X Factor act , One Direction , performing at the event .
HMV said it expected sales of music by John Lennon , the Spice Girls and Elbow Ã¢â¬ â who performed One Day
Like This Ã¢â¬ â to soar by up to seven - fold this week .

2012-08-18,"David Bowie is to part - curate an exhibition of his life and work told primarily through his extravagant costumes at the Victoria and Albert museum next year .
The show will chart his rise to cult rock star status from his early years in Brixton , south London , using his collection of outfits to illustrate his constantly changing identity .
Details about the clothes are being kept under wraps until next month 's official announcement of the show , but the V&amp;A 's director confirmed to the Observer that Bowie is involved in selecting exhibits .
Many of the flamboyant outfits worn by Bowie in his years as a pioneer of rock style will come from his own collection .
The exhibition is expected to draw large numbers of visitors .
However , some critics lament what they see as a further descent of a serious museum into the cult of celebrity .
Bowie 's look was inseparable from his sound .
The 65-year - old singer and actor , who merged rock and theatre with his androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust , is synonymous with futuristic costumes and outlandish makeup , from space - samurai outfits to white satin kimonos , flame - red hair to eye - liner .
He achieved wide popularity with his psychedelic rock single Space Oddity , coinciding with the first moon landing , and became an international star with albums such as The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
His films include The Man Who Fell to Earth .
Speaking to the Observer , Bowie 's biographer Paul Trynka said that Bowie was at the forefront of fashion , recreating his own image with the aid of cutting - edge designers .
Seeing the costumes close - up would be amazing , he said .
"" Although he 's an artist whoÃ¢â¬ Â¦ does n't tend to revisit his own past , there 's a kind of contradiction in that he 's collected his pieces for over two decades , lots of them historic and iconic , not just for Bowie fans but for popular fashionÃ¢â¬
Â¦
He 's always had a public presentation in mind .
""
Costumes that Trynka expects to be included in the exhibition at the V&amp;A include the "" bunny leotard "" created by Kansai Yamamoto , one of the avant - garde designers whose potential was spotted by Bowie . ""
That was quite groundbreaking because Yamamoto was n't known in the UK , "" Trynka said .
"" Although other pop stars had flirted with high fashion , [ Bowie ] was the first one to use it as an integral part of his look .
He then went on to even more outrageous Yamamoto designs .
There 's a fantastic one with hugely - inflated legs
Ã¢â¬ Â¦
and I suspect that will be there Ã¢â¬ Â¦ [
It ] is engagingly ludicrous .
Nobody had that effrontery to wear those kinds of outfits before . ""
Among other likely highlights , he said , are homemade catsuits created by the late Freddi Buretti , a designer who described himself as a "" seamstress "" .
Martin Roth , the V&amp;A 's director , said : "" Bowie is incomparable .
No one has inspired the whole world not only in terms of music but also arts , fashion and style .
He created a vision of individualism for an entire generation .
"" Others are less impressed , particularly following the V&amp;A 's 2007 exhibition dedicated to Kylie Minogue , which included her dungarees from the Australian soap Neighbours .
Critics felt that it was unworthy of a museum dedicated to showcasing the finest arts and crafts .
The Bowie show has been condemned by Michael Daley , director of ArtWatch UK , the museums watchdog : "" The museum world is losing the plot .
They 're just crazed about numbers at any costÃ¢â¬
Â¦
Obviously you could fill the V&amp;A
every day of the week if you had a pop concert or a bunch of celebs .
"" Noting that the V&amp;A also covers fashion , he added : "" Fashion is a bigger thingÃ¢â¬ Â¦ than the cult of one man .
If Bowie , why not Liberace ?
It 's about the cult of celebrity , particularly youth . ""
Bowie , he added , did not fit the museum 's remit for recording significant fashion .
The V&amp;A is of course tapping into a demand , but whether a cultural museum should be meeting it is another matter .
The Kylie Minogue exhibition attracted 271,000 visitors and was one of the museum 's most popular shows .
Trynka , who wrote the Bowie biography Starman , said : "" Bowie epitomises Britain 's influence on fashion and textiles .
He represents the best of it .
Kylie is a wonderful pop icon , but she has n't had a lasting effect on popular culture outside of her fanbase . ""
Today Bowie himself remains elusive .
He has not toured since 2006 , and turns down requests to appear in public Ã¢â¬ â most recently , the Olympic Games closing ceremony , although his song Fashion was used .
There have been reports of ill - health .
Roth said : "" [ People ] try to build a story around him .
There 's a lot of gossip . ""
Bowie 's spokesman declined to comment ."

"" The V&amp;A is going for the bigger picture though and has announced details of the first museum retrospective for a man who is one of the most influential performers of modern times .
The museum has been allowed into Bowie 's vast private archive in New York and given unprecedented access to some 60,000 items Ã¢â¬ â costumes , photographs , designs , instruments , films Ã¢â¬ â from which it has chosen around 300 for the show next spring .
The tiny Starman costume , used for the performance on 6 July 1972 of the first single from his Ziggy Stardust album Ã¢â¬ â ""
I think he was living on a diet of cocaine , milk and red peppers , "" said Broackes , the show
's co - curator Ã¢â¬ â will be a highlight , as it should be .
For the time it was an extraordinary performance , not least the way
Bowie Ã¢â¬ â who had told Melody Maker he was bisexual Ã¢â¬ â effortlessly draped his arm around guitarist Mick Ronson .
"" It was the manner of presentation , the way he pointed down the camera and was saying to people ' I look different , you can be different , you can be whoever you want to be , ' "" said Broackes .
"" Yes people were wearing pretty wacky things but Bowie was getting through to people in a different sort of way and allowing them to be individuals . ""
The novelist Jake Arnott has written of his 11-year - old self playing at being Bowie and Ronson in his garden with his friend Pete .
Ian McCulloch , of Echo and the Bunnymen , remembered it this way : "" All my other mates at school would say ' Did you see that bloke on Top Of The Pops ? '
He 's a right faggot , him ! '
And I remember thinking ' You pillocks ' Ã¢â¬
Â¦
It made me feel cooler . ""
The V&amp;A show will be an exploration and celebration of Bowie 's creative spirit and it will make big claims .
"" Bowie has played a crucial role in shaping modern society due to his focus on personal self - expression that we in the west , at least , now take as a right , "" said the exhibition 's other curator Geoffrey Marsh .
"" Bowie may not have set out to do this Ã¢â¬ Â¦ but help change the world he did and the ripples of those changes continue to move outwards around the globe today . ""
The V&amp;A stressed it was the museum 's show .
The famously controlling Bowie has no say in it .
A recent story in the Observer suggested he would part curate the exhibition prompting a rare response on his Facebook page .
Bowie , who lives almost reclusively in Manhattan with his wife Iman and daughter Lexi , 12 , wrote : "" I am not a co - curator and did not participate in any decisions relating to the exhibition . ""
He added : "" A close friend of mine tells me that I 'm neither ' devastated ' , ' heartbroken ' nor ' uncontrollably furious ' by this news item . ""
No one from the V&amp;A has sat down face to face with Bowie and , given he does not fly , it would be a surprise to everyone if he even made it along .
"" I 'm sorry to say I 've never met him , "" said Broackes .
"" Of course I 'd love to and I really hope he likes it
but in a way , because the V&amp;A always takes editorial control of what it produces , it is better that we have n't met him . ""
Marsh said there were piles of books on Bowie Ã¢â¬ â
"" I 'm sure there will be many more university doctorates "" Ã¢â¬ â but this is the first significant exhibition and he promised it would be "" groundbreaking "" and hopefully achieve the almost impossible task of appealing to both diehard fans and an audience too young to really know how much of an influence Bowie was and still is .
That present tense is important and the V&amp;A has called its show Ã¢â¬ â which has taken two and a half years to plan Ã¢â¬ â ' ""
David Bowie is . ""
It underpins a key tenet of the exhibition , "" said Broackes . ""
David Bowie 's impact today .
"" It will examine what has influenced him Ã¢â¬ â German expressionism , music hall , Theatre of Cruelty , French chanson , surrealism , Brechtian theatre , avant - garde mime , musicals and Japanese kabuki to name a few Ã¢â¬ â and the countless artists he in turn has influenced .
The show will include costumes such as the Union Jack coat designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen for the Earthling album cover and the outrageous striped bodysuit Kansai Yamamoto designed for the 1973 Aladdin Sane tour ; classic photographs by Brian Duffy and Terry O'Neill ; and excerpts from videos and films including The Man Who Fell to Earth and Labyrinth .
The V&amp;A has held exhibitions about The Supremes , Kylie Minogue and Annie Lennox .
There may be some who sniff at the V&amp;A staging a show on Bowie , but it points out it is the museum for performance and theatre .
Broackes added : "" I do n't feel there is an argument unless you think museums should be filled with things from the past .
This museum has never been like that or about that .
"" Tickets are now on sale for David Bowie is at the V&amp;A from 23 March-28 July 2013"
2012-09-06,"David Bowie 's ubiquitous soundtrack to the summer rang out again at the Olympic Stadium on Thursday night to acclaim a new sporting hero in 19-year - old Jonnie Peacock , who sprinted to victory in the blue riband Paralympic event .
The single - leg amputee charged to victory in 10.90 in the T34/44 100 m Ã¢â¬ â the second fastest time in history behind his own world record Ã¢â¬ â and left Oscar Pistorius trailing in fourth place .
Peacock was one of a trio of British gold medallists on another memorable night for ParalympicsGB on which the team beat their pre - Games medal target with three days of competition to spare .
Hannah Cockroft , the 20-year - old wheelchair racer from Halifax , did the sprint double with victory in the T34 200 m final , and David Weir bagged his third gold of the Games in the men 's 800 m T54 final in a time of 1.37.63 .
Despite increased competition from the rest of the world , the trio helped ParalympicsGB comfortably exceed their target of recording "" more medals in more sports "" than in Beijing , where they won 102 .
By the end of the action , as a crowd drunk on home success staggered away from the Olympic Stadium , the total stood at 107 medals , 31 of them gold .
The "" Weirwolf "" , greeted on to the track by his newly adopted theme tune Werewolves of London , refused to be beaten .
As the now familiar strains of Massive Attack 's Unfinished Sympathy rang out Weir hit the front on the back straight of the last lap and narrowly held off the Swiss Marcel Hug and Thailand 's Saichon Konjen to huge cheers as he crossed the line .
He said afterwards he was tired but that the exhortations of discus thrower Dan Greaves , who on Thursday night won silver himself , on the final bend kept him going .
"" That was hard work tonight .
I had to dig deep , "" said Weir , who will race again in the marathon on Sunday .
"" This is for my children .
This one 's for my kids tonight .
I just had to dig deep . ""
But there was little doubting the main event for a crowd for whom the lure of the Olympic Stadium seems to be increasing as the end draws nearer and they milk the last drops from this summer of sport .
Just as Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake had the nation rapt four weeks ago , it was a measure of how far the Paralympics have come in terms of profile that the T43/44 100 m had much the same effect on Thursday night .
Peacock , the Cambridge - born sprinting sensation who recorded the fastest time ever by an amputee when he ran 10.85 seconds earlier this year , was up against Pistorius , one of the biggest names of this Olympic and Paralympic summer .
He appeared to revel in the support of 80,000 fans chanting his name before they were silenced for the start of a 100 m race that matched its Olympic companion for excitement .
Amid huge tension , Alan Oliveira Ã¢â¬ â the 20-year - old who beat Pistorius in the 200 m on Sunday night Ã¢â¬ â tottered out of his blocks .
But Peacock was calmness personified .
The tension was further ratcheted up by a pre - race row over the length of the blades used by some sprinters , which pitted Pistorius , Jerome Singleton and others against Oliveira and Blake Leeper .
The South African Ã¢â¬ â accused of sour grapes by some over the timing of his comments Ã¢â¬ â was gracious in defeat to Peacock , hugging the young pretender at the finish of the 100 m . ""
What people were able to witness tonight was the beginning of a phenomenal career for Jonnie Peacock , "" said Pistorius , who also finished behind the American Richard Browne and fellow South African Arnu Fourie . ""
He epitomises professional sprinting , not just as a Paralympian but one of the world 's best .
To be part of that race was a blessing .
"" Peacock had to have his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting a form of meningitis at the age of five and was first spotted at a talent ID day at Mile End stadium .
"" It 's absolutely surreal .
I 've been in the village for over a week trying to stay focused , "" he said , also paying tribute to his coach Dan Pfaff , who also trained Olympic gold medal winning long jumper Greg Rutherford .
"" It 's going to take a while to sink in .
I got to 60 m and thought , ' Oh dear I could actually win this "" . ""
Cockroft came into these Paralympic Games as the double world champion and world record holder in the 100 m and 200 m .
But like others including Jessica Ennis , Mo Farah , Weir and Ellie Simmonds across both Games , the pressure has not fazed her .
If anything , the opposite is true .
Under a spectacular golden sky Cockroft won by more than two seconds , a huge margin in a wheelchair sprint , in a time of 31.90 with a display of raw speed and power . ""
This summer has been breathtaking , this is what all the training has been for .
I hope we 're doing everyone proud , everyone 's excited
and I do n't want this ever to end .
It 's been amazing .
"" She is now one of a number of British Paralympic athletes who in the space of a week have become household names . ""
There is definitely something that has happened in the Paralympic movement that makes me unbelievably emotion , "" said Pistorius .
"" There are millions of people out there for whom Paralympic athletes are now household names .
For me , that 's better than anything . ""
At Brands Hatch , Sarah Storey made Paralympic history by winning the 11th gold medal of her career , and the fourth of these Games , in the women 's cycling road race .
Appropriately , given the run of success for ParalympicsGB in the pool , it was in the Aquatics Centre that Heather Frederiksen surpassed ParalympicsGB 's Beijing tally by winning silver .
Funding agency UK Sport had invested a record ÃÂ£49.2 m in Paralympic sport in the runup to the London Games and , as at the Olympics , the investment has paid off . ""
The London Paralympic Games have been a truly wonderful display of sporting excellence and a testament to the power of the human spirit .
To see what our athletes have achieved has been inspirational , "" said UK Sport chair Lady Sue Campbell ."

What was the first song you ever bought ?
Absolute Beginners Ã¢â¬
â
David Bowie
I was about 15 .
I should pretend I bought it from a trendy indie record shop , but it was actually bought with my pocket money from Asda in High Wycombe on a Friday night food shop with my dad .
It was the 12-inch single packaged in a very glossy gatefold sleeve and it started a lifelong fascination with David Bowie and his music .
What song always gets you dancing ?
The Lovecats Ã¢â¬ â
The Cure This song would always get everyone dancing in the 1980s , along with other stalwarts such as Soft Cell 's Tainted Love .
What was great was that you 'd go to discos or nightclubs and they 'd play what was in the charts and everyone at school knew all the songs .
What song takes you back to your childhood ?
I Am The Walrus Ã¢â¬
â
The Beatles
My dad had all his original Beatles singles from the 60s and me and my sister would play them when we were young , in the late 1970s .
I was probably only eight .
It was a pure listening experience because I did n't really know much about who the Beatles were .
The Magical Mystery Tour EP had a lyric sheet printed so we 'd sing along ...
GOO GOO GOO JOOB .
What is your perfect love song ?
Love Comes Quickly

I 'm not interested in songs about people being really happy in love .
Songs like The Lady
In Red and Wonderful
Tonight Ã¢â¬ Â¦ boring .
But I love the Pet Shop Boys , and this second single from Please is fantastic .
They never really bettered the sound of that album and Neil Tennant 's voice is very distinctive and he somehow gets away with the dreaded "" spoken intro "" !
( "" sooner or later this happens to everyone ... "") .
What song would you want at your funeral ?
Together Alone Ã¢â¬ â Crowded House
The lyrics deals with death and separation and the song has a very earthy spiritual feel to it since it features a New Zealand Maori choir and log drummers .
It 's such a moving song
Ã¢â¬ â Neil Finn is one of the best songwriters on the planet , but it has never really been trendy to like Crowded House even though the Together Alone album was one of the finest records of the 1990s .
Anyone who is not crying at my funeral will be when they hear this !
Time for the encore Ã¢â¬ â one last song that makes you , you .
Mad World Ã¢â¬ â Tears
For Fears
The line about going to school and no one knowing you resonates .
I went to about 10 different schools when I was a kid because we moved house so much .

2012-09-09,"For any David Bowie fans eagerly hoping that the V&amp;A 's just - announced major 2013 retrospective might draw their hero out of his long period of media seclusion , the answer came two weeks ago :
yes and no .
Yes , he was moved to post a droll statement on his Facebook page , but only in order to rebut rumours that he had any hand in curating the exhibition .
Having made his private collection available to the V&amp;A 's curators , who confess they have n't even met him , he clearly felt he had done enough .
It is not the only time this year that Bowie - lovers have thrown him a party only for the guest of honour 's chair to remain empty .
Although he has n't toured for eight years , or appeared on stage in any capacity for six , it still seemed possible that he might make an exception for the closing ceremony of the Olympics to perform his yearning 1977 hit Heroes , the unofficial Games anthem .
On the night , a video montage of his singles ramped up the excitement before the arrival ofÃ¢â¬
Â¦ some supermodels on trucks .
Such a conspicuous absence seemed to confirm what Bowie - watchers have suspected for years : that he has in fact retired but simply neglected to tell anybody .
Out of sight he may be , but never out of mind .
A book about a single Top of the Pops appearance , Bowie 's groundbreakingly homoerotic performance of Starman in 1972 , has just been published .
A new plaque in London 's Heddon Street marks the 40th anniversary of Starman 's mothership album , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars .
Rock critics Paul Trynka and Peter Doggett have both written chunky studies of his life and work .
His influence continues to be felt in the work of legions of younger artists , from LCD Soundsystem to Lady Gaga .
In fact , Bowie love is at such a pitch that were he to announce a new tour tomorrow , he could set up camp at the O2 for weeks .
One reason for this undying fascination is that at a time when many feel that pop 's past is a great deal more compelling than its future , Bowie 's 70s career represents the white - hot thrill of innovation .
The Beatles may have shown that it was possible to reinvent your music with every album but Bowie went one better by reinventing the whole package .
In the early 60s , the teenage David Jones spent a year as a "" visualiser "" at a Bond Street advertising agency and learned the dark arts of brand communication .
His first album , David Bowie , was derivative , theatrical and easily ignored ; even the chart - topping success of 1969 's Apollo 11 cash - in Space Oddity made him look like an opportunistic one - hit wonder .
So , frustrated by the failure of even 1971 's brilliant Hunky Dory to give him the stardom he craved , he remade himself as Ziggy Stardust , described by Peter Doggett as "" the perfect rock'n'roll starÃ¢â¬ Â¦ male and female , king and queen , alien and human , transcendental and sublime "" .
While many rock musicians were sprouting beards and moving to the country in search of something "" real "" , he was fabulously other : a physical realisation of his audience 's most outre pop fantasies .
Most artists would have considered this a job well done and kept on going , but Bowie soon believed that Ziggy had mutated from liberator into jailer and killed him off after just 18 months .
With each subsequent album , he became someone new : "" cracked actor "" ( Aladdin Sane ) , apocalyptic seer ( Diamond Dogs ) , "" plastic soul "" star ( Young Americans ) , frozen - hearted Thin White Duke ( Station to Station ) and , on his trilogy of albums recorded in Berlin with producer Tony Visconti and new pal
Brian Eno , the pale grandmaster of art - pop alienation .
The philosophy is right there in many of the song titles : Changes , Station to Station , Move On .
His restless hunger made him one of the few 70s stars whom the insurgents of punk admired rather than mocked , while the sounds and themes of his Berlin period inspired every synth - pop act worth its salt .
More broadly , his self - refashioning and magpie eye define pop stardom to this day .
For each new concept , he hoovered up raw material from cinema , theatre , fashion , literature and visual art ; the V&amp;A exhibition takes in everything from kabuki to German expressionism to the Theatre of Cruelty .
Crucially , his shrewd pilfering was rooted in ceaselessly great songwriting .
Tony Visconti recently talked about Bowie 's unnerving habit of coming into the studio with mere sketches for songs and finishing them on the hoof .
"" It 's a scary situation , "" the producer said .
"" I was never comfortable with it
but I did n't have a choice .
If this is the process , you go with the flow .
Bowie remains to this day the most extraordinary person I 've ever worked with in the studio , on many levels .
He 's always full of surprises .
You can never predict what he 's going to do . ""
Of course , this kind of creative velocity does n't stem from contentment .
Bowie could be anybody except , it seemed , himself .
"" Sometimes I do n't feel as if I 'm a person at all , "" he confessed in 1972 .
"" I 'm just a collection of other people 's ideas . ""
In 1997 he told Q magazine : "" I had enormous self - image problems and very low self - esteem , which I hid behind obsessive writing and performingÃ¢â¬
Â¦ I was driven to get through life
very quicklyÃ¢â¬
Â¦ I really felt so utterly inadequate .
I thought the work was the only thing of value . ""
In some ways , he was a weathervane for a decade in which many people were fearfully searching for answers
Ã¢â¬ â
he was far from the only confused soul in the 70s to acquire an interest in the occult or an ambivalent fascination ( later regretted ) with fascism .
But in his recent book The Man
Who Sold the World : David Bowie and the 1970s , Peter Doggett suggests that Bowie was driven by a terror of losing his mind , as his older brother , Terry , had done .
In 1993 , Bowie told the BBC : "" I felt that I was the lucky one because I was an artist and it would never happen to me .
As long as I could put those psychological excesses into my music and into my work , I could always be throwing it off . ""
He came closest to unravelling himself in Los Angeles in 1975 while making Station to Station , an experience he claims he ca n't ( or chooses not to ) remember in any detail , although he has admitted to living on a diet of cocaine , Gitanes , peppers and milk .
This is a cherished bit of trivia because fans generally prefer self - destructive genius to well - adjusted mediocrity : never mind the life , give us the work .
The fitter and happier
Bowie became during the 80s , the worse his music , leading to such fan - scarring horrors as the 1987 Glass Spider tour , the humdrum hard rock band Tin Machine and his mystique - annihilating duet with Mick Jagger on Dancing in the Street .
It says something about his waning powers that his most worthwhile 80s creation after Let 's Dance was the goblin king Jareth in the film Labyrinth .
More unjustly , boldly experimental 90s albums such as 1 .
Outside and Earthling were overlooked and only with Heathen , his 2002 reunion with Visconti , did he win back some of the warmth and acclaim that used to be his for the asking .
You wonder if this born neophiliac ( he was an early champion of the internet and has long been a generous supporter of new bands ) grew tired of living in the shadow of his youthful achievements and had no interest in the lucrative but repetitive hits tours embraced by so many of his peers .
It has also been suggested , given that his 2004 world tour was curtailed by an emergency angioplasty , that his health would not permit a return to live performance .
Or perhaps the reason for his apparent retirement is simple : perhaps he is just happy .
He lives in New York with his wife of 20 years , cosmetics entrepreneur and former model Iman , and their daughter , Alexandria .
He is on good terms with his son , once known as Zowie Bowie , now as gifted film director Duncan Jones .
He enjoys attending gigs and dining with old friends such as Visconti and Lou Reed .
It 's a fallacy to assume that any celebrity who chooses to retreat from the public eye must be a frail recluse , but by all accounts Bowie is comfortable and contented , so why not view his creative silence as a dignified victory rather than a form of defeat ?
Much as his admirers may want him back belting out the likes of Heroes and Starman in the world 's arenas , it might be fairer to accept that the man whose youthful genius was nourished by so much loneliness and self - doubt deserves the quieter , happier life he has built for himself .
David Bowie has done as much as anyone to shape our understanding of what pop music can be .
Surely that is more than enough ."
2012-09-09,"It was hard not to approach the Closing Ceremony of the Paralympic Games with some trepidation .
The equivalent event at the Olympics had felt slightly underwhelming , perhaps because no spectacle could possibly live up to the athletic spectacles that had preceded it , partly because the air of mystery surrounding what was going to take place led people to expect a surprise that never actually came : if you 'd listened to the wild talk of appearances by David Bowie and Kate Bush and holograms of Freddie Mercury , it was hard not to be even more disappointed when it became apparent what you were actually going to get was
Jessie J.
The latter issue was circumvented here by announcing who was going to be performing in advance .
Nevertheless , you did n't have to be one of those people who thinks Coldplay are the cloven - hoofed musical emissaries of satan himself to have been slightly concerned about how appropriate a booking they were .
On one hand , they are one of the biggest bands in the world Ã¢â¬ â a suitably global success for a global event Ã¢â¬
â
they stir vast stadiums full of people for a living , and it is a churlish character that claims they are anything other than very good at it .
On the other , the key piece of music at the Paralympic opening ceremony Ã¢â¬ â the track that seemed to hit on something vital about the Games to come Ã¢â¬ â was Orbital and the Graeae Theatre Company 's retooling of Ian Dury 's Spasticus Autisticus , a song that is brutal , startling , furious and many other things that Coldplay 's music are not .
Thanks to their ubiquity on TV soundtracks Ã¢â¬ â tinkling away as someone departs The X Factor or the DIY SOS tells their tragic back story Ã¢â¬ â a lot of their songs have become musical shorthand for "" oh , is n't it a pity "" , designed to elicit sympathy for whoever is on screen .
The Paralympics have incited a vast array of emotions in viewers , but pity is n't among them , as anyone who caught a glimpse of the frankly terrifying wheelchair rugby will attest .
As it turned out , their set got better the more upbeat
it became : the triumphant arena - filling guitar riff of Charlie Brown seemed to fit the event more than the more ponderous ballads , while it would take an effort almost as superhuman as the athletes had put in over recent days not to be moved by their collaboration with the Paraorchestra on Strawberry Swing , -Ã¢â¬
â one of their loveliest songs ,
its melody boasting a subtlety that the bands ' detractors would have you believe they do n't possess Ã¢â¬ â or the crowd singing along with Viva La Vida while fireworks exploded and confetti fluttered from above .
The staging meanwhile , felt noticeably darker , less cosy and self - congratulatory than the Olympic closing ceremony .
There was a lot of stuff with fire and steampunk costumes , rusty vehicles cannibalised from old cars and farm machinery and people pretending to be crows on stilts .
A seasoned festival - goer might note that it all had a whiff of the kind of thing you see at 3 am in the outlying fields at Glastonbury : a definite improvement on the Olympic closing ceremony , which carried a whiff of a bad night at the Brits .
In the event that you felt bored by Coldplay , there was always something to distract your attention : ice skating , high - wire artists dangling from motorbikes , aerialists twirling from bunches of oversized light bulbs that sprayed out fire , people running out of the mouth of a giant fish carrying huge cardboard cutouts of insects on sticks .
There was interpretative dance , which was nowhere near as disheartening as interpretative dance to Coldplay looks on paper .
The same was true of Rihanna 's solo appearance .
We Found Love is a decent pop song that 's become rather a victim of its own success : one way of giving it some added interest in the teeth of its ubiquity is to have her perform it while flying around the stadium on what looked like a vast garden swing .
The other special guest was Jay - Z.
With Rihanna and Coldplay , he played Run This Town .
Not the most obvious choice , but recontextualized by its surroundings
it felt weirdly appropriate : as anyone who visited London during the Games and noted an almost tangible sense of excitement in the air knows , that 's precisely what the Paralympics appeared to do ."
2012-09-13,"The Dutch saxophonist Yuri Honing , who comes to London with this meditative music next week has also worked on edgier projects with fellow countryman Misha Mengelberg and improvised on everything from pop hits to Schubert .
However , this album is closer to the slow - moving , saxophone tone - poetry of Jan Garbarek .
Recorded in one day in Berlin with the first Honing band in a decade to feature a pianist ( fellow Dutchman Wolfert Brederode ) , it includes a couple of pop diversions ( Goldfrapp 's Paper Bag and David Bowie 's Bring Me the Disco King ) but is otherwise wistful Honing material , and bassist Ruben Samama 's gently bouncing Nobody Knows .
The title theme features Honing 's forlorn alto curling over Joost Lijbaart 's slow backbeat .
Meanwhile , Paper Bag gets two visits ( the first a mix of wistful long sounds and short prodding phrases , the second a minimal piece of dreamy impressionism ) , and Bring Me the Disco King is a quiet piping piece of saxophone intimacy over a distant piano vamp .
It 's a laid - back , stripped - down venture compared to earlier forays into free jazz , electric and symphonic music , but many years of fiercer jazz - making have been the groundwork for this kind of sumptuous understatement ."
2012-09-14,"I liked it that David Bowie declined to appear at the Olympics despite his song Heroes being the unofficial theme of the Games .
His absence seemed to fit with his artistic single - mindedness during his heyday years , his perpetual state of otherness and his refusal to retrace former steps .
He has n't been a public figure for some time , but he 's been in the news lately because the Victoria and Albert museum has announced that next March it will be exhibiting a collection of items from his large private archive - stage costumes , musical instruments , photographs and so on .
Thinking about the exoticism of Bowie 's fame , it 's amazing to think that his rise to superstardom began at a pub called The Toby Jug in Tolworth .
I 'd never even heard of Tolworth until I ran through it last year , training for the London marathon , yet this uneventful suburb of pure Kingston semi - detachment was the birth place of Ziggy Stardust , the flame - haired Bowie alter ego for whom The Toby Jug turned out to be a launch pad for his conquering the world - having , of course , turned up in Heddon Street , W1 from whichever far out planet he was born on .
The extraterrestrial pop star has , in fact , been a very London artist , as I imagine the V&amp;A show will reflect .
Born in Brixton , raised in Bromley and a ravenous devourer of all the demimonde allure the capital could offer , he 's old enough to remember the London of dockers and bowler hats that his generation of pop stars transcended , out - dressed and outlived .
His song London Boys is a picaresque portrayal of Mod - era anxiety , his rendition of Gershwin 's A Foggy Day (
In London Town ) as eerie as the weather it describes .
He lives in New York now and his creative inspirations have been drawn from across the globe , but despite that or , perhaps , because of it , I think of him as a complete Londoner .

2012-09-21,"Pappy 's Last Show
Ever , Scunthorpe In 1973 , David Bowie announced his retirement from rock music , only to spend 40 years showing he 'd been talking out of his loon - panted arse .
It looks like reports of the demise of raucous sketch trio Pappy 's will prove to be similarly exaggerated .
This may be billed as their Last Show Ever , but based on the response it received at last month 's Edinburgh fringe Ã¢â¬ â including a nomination for the main comedy award Ã¢â¬ â there 's clearly an appetite for more among their admirers .
Where Pappy 's have always excelled is in matching original and imaginative ideas to a boisterous party atmosphere that can make their performances seem more like a rock gig than a sketch show .
The trio of Matthew Crosby ( bespectacled , slightly teacher - ish ) , Tom Parry ( overgrown child , both physically and mentally ) and Ben Clark ( ginger , always most likely to start giggling in the middle of a sketch ) have long made for a compelling combination , and it 's TV 's loss that it has n't yet found the right place for them .
For now , at least we can continue to enjoy them on the live stage , and there are few acts that look more at home there .

Cast your eye over the list of nominees for awards at this year 's fringe , and you see act after act that owes something to Key 's innovations .
The oblique , leftfield and multimedia - heavy stylings of exciting , critically acclaimed acts such as Claudia O'Doherty , David Trent and Sam Fletcher all point towards a promising , creatively dynamic future for UK comedy , and they 're all standing on the shoulders of Key 's previous work .
Having won the Fosters comedy award for his 2009 show The Slutcracker , he 's now touring the follow - up .
It 's a heady mix of offbeat physical comedy and Key 's trademark bad poetry ( made famous on Screenwipe ) .
Dense with well - developed ideas , this is a stage show you may need to see twice in order to take it all in .

Even when they do , you 'll rarely get more than one in the course of an evening , as if women are a novelty that needs to be strictly rationed ( by the way , did you know that in 11 series , there 's never been more than one woman in any episode of Mock The Week ? ) .

2012-09-24,"With his new album , True , the Dutch tenor saxophonist Yuri Honing sounds as if he has moved a considerable distance from the often fierce avant - fusion music he has made with his Wired Paradise band , and still more so from the wilful , wayward , post - Monk jazz he once shared with Netherlands piano legend Misha Mengelberg .
Honing 's new release has an impressionistic , tone - savouring atmosphere , although the leader 's fondness for warping pop songs is still intact , in interpretations of material by Goldfrapp and David Bowie .
Live in London , however , the spacious mood was punctuated with plenty of tough , sinewy improv , particularly in some edgy exchanges between Honing 's tenor and the dramatically inventive drumming of long - time playing partner Joost Lijbaart .
The band mixed fierce post - Coltrane sax oratory ( Honing 's own confection of shivery sustained sounds and downwardly skidding high - speed runs ) and quiet passages of shakers and piano trills on the opening
Black Is the Colour .
Goldfrapp 's Paper Bag then took off on Lijbaart 's glowering rimshot groove and Ruben Samama 's springy bass vamp , over which Honing first played soft , long sounds ( a gripping contrast with the emphatic percussion ) and then long , bending runs bumping down to resolving notes , like somebody noisily descending stairs .
The ruminative End of Friedrichsheim was a showcase for the leader 's tonal delicacy and pianist Wilfred Brederode 's wistful romanticism .
During the closing stages of the darkly powerful Borchardt , Honing and Lijbaart 's dialogue stirred thoughts of Wayne Shorter juggling ideas with his drummer Brian Blade .
In the second half , Brederode abandoned then rejoined the pulse with languid assurance on True , and both hard - edged jazz blowing and Honing 's world - music sensibilities jostled in the soundscape .
It 's been too long since this distinctive saxophonist last played the UK , and Honing 's new quartet adds clout to the case for the next trip happening a lot sooner .

2012-10-09,"Many bisexual people are the victims of prejudice , not just from homophobic heterosexuals but also from lesbians and gay men .
Many people 's perceptions of bisexuality are drawn from media reports on the lifestyles of the rich and famous , not serious studies such as the Kinsey report .
Pop music in particular has produced bisexual role models ; in the 1970s there was David Bowie and his bisexual alter - ego , Ziggy Stardust , and when Jessie J recently announced that she was bisexual , the gay rumour mill went into overdrive , with people speculating that she was really a lesbian .
But what is life Ã¢â¬ â and work Ã¢â¬
â like for the thousands of ordinary people who identify as bisexual ?
A recent report from Stonewall found that bisexual men and women were seven times more likely to disguise their sexual orientation in the workplace .
According to the LGB campaigning group 's latest Workplace Equality Index , while many employers have shown real progress in building the confidence of lesbian and gay employees , a lack of understanding of bisexuality seems to have resulted in bisexual people remaining largely invisible .
Part of the challenge for employers is that while they may have established an LGBT employee network , this may not be enough to reach out and engage with bisexual employees .
Stonewall 's research also found that bisexual men and women often feel excluded from LGBT employee networks , as these are perceived to primarily cater for lesbians and gay men , with little participation by bisexual employees or focus on bisexual issues .
These findings are echoed by Marcus Morgan from The Bisexual Index , who stresses that while existing employment law offers protection for bisexuals , the problem is implementation . ""
Most workplace LGBT networks are primarily lesbian and gay networks , "" he says .
"" Bisexual people have reported being made to feel unwelcome if they bring opposite sex partners to supposedly inclusive events . ""
So what can bisexual men and women do to increase their visibility in the workplace ?
According to Morgan : "" The main way to tackle biphobia at work is to realise that most of it is n't intentional . ""
He suggests the following steps : "" Research the amount of support available .
Deciding to come out is an immensely personal thing and no one should feel obliged to do so .
But if an LGBT employee network allows ' friends and allies ' that can be a good way to encourage people of all sexualities to join in .
""
Morgan recommends coming out at work one step at a time . ""
Mentioning that you were at a Pride march over the weekend and waiting to be asked : ' but if it 's Pride who were you there supporting ? ' can be as useful as coming straight out with ' it 's Bi Visibility Day on Sunday
so I 'm off to BiFest ' .
"" As for employers , Morgan suggests that anyone wishing to address biphobia in the workplace begins by reading a report produced earlier this year by research group BiUK and published by the Open University .
Bisexual Report :
Bisexual Inclusion in LGBT Equality and Diversity offers an in - depth analysis of the present situation , along with useful suggestions for implementing improvements .
These include : making specific reference to bisexuals in policy and decision - making , and recognising that using "" gay "" as shorthand for LGB in a sexual orientation strategy can give bisexual staff the impression that the policy or procedure is n't applicable to them .
"" We know that people perform better at work when they can be themselves , "" says Ruth Hunt , Stonewall 's director of public affairs .
"" But for many bisexual people this is impossible .
Employers need to learn that generic messages targeted at gay and lesbian people do n't necessarily resonate with bisexuals . ""

2012-11-07,"Yoko Ono has been named the next curator of the Meltdown festival at the Southbank centre in London .
The musician , artist , author and activist , who celebrates her 80th birthday in February , will organise the 10-day event in June next year .
Previous curators include David Bowie , Jarvis Cocker and Massive Attack .
Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons took charge this year , with a lineup that included an appearance by the reclusive Cocteau Twins singer Elizabeth Fraser .
Ono has performed twice before at Meltdown , which celebrates its 20th anniversary next year .
She appeared as part of Patti Smith 's Meltdown in 2005 and again in 2009 under Ornette Coleman .
Talking to the Observer , who are Meltdown 's media partners , Ono said of her putative programme : "" I 'm not pursuing big names for the sake of big names .
I 'm thinking along the lines of a concept , which is more refreshing .
There will definitely be an element of feminism and the plight of women , I am very interested in that .
All women are icons of feminism and we have a responsibility to that .
I am thinking of having one or two events where I ask men to say something strong about themselves too . ""
Ono added that she is "" deeply honoured "" to be curating this year 's festival .
Meltdown will take place from 14 to 23 June , and the full lineup will be announced next year .

A couple of months ago , BBC4 repeated David Bowie 's Top of the Pops performance of Heroes from October 1977 .
It 's an appearance understandably eclipsed in history by his performance of Starman five years before , where he camply slung his arm around Mick Ronson 's shoulder and pointed directly down the camera lens as he sang "" I had to phone someone , so I picked on you "" , as if issuing a personal invitation to every gay kid and teenage misfit who was watching .
This time around , he just stood there and sang , but the appearance is still remarkable , simply for the fact that he turned up at all .
It was the dawn of the video era , which meant that the really big stars Ã¢â¬ â Elton John or Rod Stewart Ã¢â¬ â no longer needed to schlep along to the BBC to mime when they had a new single out .
But there he was , the defining artist of the era , mucking in alongside Smokie and Tina Charles .
Perhaps he thought that Heroes needed an extra push : with its edge - of - hysteria vocal , lyrics in German and screaming guitar by Robert Fripp , it did n't sound much like anything else in the charts .
From the moment he told Melody Maker 's Michael Watts he was gay Ã¢â¬ â one of the great audacious moves in rock history from a man whose previous two albums had failed to even make the charts
Ã¢â¬
â Bowie has always shown a brilliant understanding of how to promote records .
Judging by its page on iTunes , the cover of his 24th album
The Next Day is the same as that of Heroes , with a large grey square covering most of the iconic photo of Bowie in a pose inspired by the paintings of Erich Heckel .
The lyrics of his first single in a decade ,
Where Are We Now ? , similarly hark back to the era and the city in which Heroes was made , depicting him "" walking the dead "" , wandering around a variety of Berlin streets , musing on the passing of time and the way inspiration strikes without warning : "" as long as there 's fire Ã¢â¬ Â¦ the moment you know , you know .
"" The video seems to be filmed in his old Berlin apartment , which has apparently been turned into an artist 's studio .
Even with his head stuck on top of the body of a soft toy , he looks in remarkably good nick for someone who was so widely rumoured to be terminally ill a few years back that the Flaming Lips wrote a song about it , called
Is David Bowie Dying ?
: indeed , he looks in remarkably good nick for a man in his late 60 who spent most his life smoking three packs of Marlboro a day .
On the evidence of Where Are We Now ? , the music on The Next Day has almost nothing in common with the stuff he and its producer Tony Visconti recorded 36 years ago .
It 's a beautiful , elegiac ballad , Bowie 's voice sounds gorgeously fragile Ã¢â¬ â not the fragility of someone nearing 70 who 's lost their vocal power to the ravages of age , but the fragility of someone who wants to communicate an aching wistfulness .
No one who hears it is going to be baffled or horrified or struck by the thrilling sense that pop music has been pushed into new , uncharted regions .
Perhaps Bowie 's finished with that kind of thing , having done more of it between 1970 and 1980 than almost any other artist , save the Beatles .
Where Are We Now ?
would n't have sounded out of place on 2002 's Heathen or 2003 's Reality .
Indeed , if it had been the lead single off Bowie 's new album in 2004 , it would have passed virtually without comment .
The reason it 's created such a fuss is partly because most people thought Bowie 's retirement looked pretty final .
He never said as much , but it felt right :
while his peers pragmatically chose to work the public 's thirst for nostalgia , playing the big hits on high - grossing tours and tacitly acknowledging that their best work was behind them , Bowie Ã¢â¬ â an artist who 'd never evinced much interest in looking back Ã¢â¬ â slipped into a dignified silence .
Like the guy singing Heroes on Top of the Pops , it seems remarkable that he turned up at all .
Of course , the main reason it 's created such a fuss is simply because no one knew .
It 's incredible that , in an era of gossip websites and messageboard rumours , one of the biggest stars in the world , presumed retired , can spend two years making a new album without the merest whisper of it reaching the public .
But somehow he did it .
The first speculation that something was afoot came literally hours before the single appeared : no blurry cameraphone shots of him leaving a recording studio , no MP3s of demos leaked on to filesharing sites , no slip - up by someone involved in its making on Twitter .
It 's the opposite of how you 're expected to do things : at the very least , a major artist releasing a new album is supposed to drop hints , create an online buzz of expectation , stoke the rumour mill , ensure the biggest audience possible is primed and waiting .
Bowie has done none of that : whatever The Next Day sounds like , he 's turned it into the biggest release of 2013 by the simple expedient of doing absolutely nothing other than make an album .
Furthermore , he 's managed to maintain the myth and mystique that was always central to his stardom and his art in a world where rock and pop music has almost no myth or mystique left , an age of 360-degree connectivity , where pop stars are supposed to be perpetually available to their fans via social networking .
But as we 've already established , David Bowie has always shown a brilliant understanding of how to promote records ."
2013-01-08,
2013-01-08,"The return of David Bowie had , perhaps , been expected Ã¢â¬ â but not in this fashion .
Not with a song booted out into the world without pageant or fanfare .
Where was the grand stage ?
The big gesture ?
That 's what had been predicted this summer , when rumour held that Bowie would make his return to live performance at the Olympics closing ceremony , only for fans to sigh at the anti - climax of filmed footage of Bowie appearing in the show 's whistlestop tour of British pop history .
And if the nature of Bowie 's return as he reached 66 was unexpected , so too was the song with which he came back .
Where Are We Now ?
proved to be the thing this most forward - looking of singers has always avoided : a look at his past .
"" It 's about Berlin in 1976 and 77 , "" said Bowie 's biographer , Paul Trynka . ""
He namechecks all the places he used to hang out with Iggy Pop and Martin Kippenberger .
That 's significant because he 's always eschewed nostalgia .
"" That very nostalgia is certain to fuel speculation .
Are these recordings Ã¢â¬ â
Where Are We Now ?
is to be followed by The Next Day , his first album in 10 years ,
in March Ã¢â¬ â to be
Bowie 's last ?
Is he looking back because the end is nigh ?
Rumours about Bowie 's health have circulated since he suffered a heart attack backstage at the Hurricane festival in ScheeÃÅ¸el in Germany on 25 June 2004 , immediately after coming offstage .
He cancelled the remaining 15 dates of his tour , and has not performed headline shows of his own since , though he 's hardly been a recluse Ã¢â¬ â he performed in New York with Arcade Fire in 2005 and 2006 , with Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour in London in 2006 , and curated an arts and music festival in New York in 2007 .
But pop abhors a vacuum .
So the absence of any substantive projects fuelled rumours of serious ill health , and Bowie 's own legendarily unhealthy past fed into them Ã¢â¬ â during the recording of his 1976 album Station to Station he reputedly existed on a diet of peppers , milk and cocaine , giving rise to his Thin White Duke persona .
Reading on mobile ?
Click here to view video Trynka , however , was sceptical about the stories of serious illness .
"" There would have been rumours whether or not he was actually ill , "" he said .
"" He got such a rude awakening to his own mortality with his heart attack , and I think that was a major shock . ""
Trynka said it was likely Bowie had simply decided to spend more time with his daughter Alexandria , who was born in 2000 , having failed to be a constant presence in the life of his son , Duncan , in the 1970s and 80s . ""
That would be one of several major factors in his absence , I expect , "" Trynka said .
"" He did n't spend a lot of time with Duncan , which he regretted . ""
Certainly , his return has been met with wild enthusiasm .
By noon on Tuesday , Where Are We Now ? stood at No 2 on the iTunes singles chart , kept from the top only by the omnipresent will.i.am , who promotes himself rather more heavily than Bowie .
But then Bowie did n't need to promote himself Ã¢â¬ â the very existence of the song was enough to generate coverage across all media , with even the Today programme , not always at its most sure - footed when dealing with pop culture , reporting on the release .
Then , inevitably , a new spate of rumours began Ã¢â¬ â would Bowie be playing Glastonbury , or its nearest US equivalent , Coachella ?
If Bowie were to return to the stage , then a series of high - profile , lucrative festival appearances would be the easiest way to do it .
In recent years , though , a number of his near comtemporaries Ã¢â¬ â notably Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen Ã¢â¬
â have been revitalised by taking on the kind of touring schedules that many a younger artist might balk at .
And given Bowie 's famously electric stage performances , he might actually want to tour Ã¢â¬ â the jaunt to promote his last album , 2003 's Reality , lasted a year before it was cut short .
Even if he does not tour , though , his profile this year will be bigger than at any time since his heart attack Ã¢â¬ â
he has opened his archive to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for the exhibition David Bowie is , which runs from March to July .
Arguably the biggest question about his return , though , is why a pop singer releasing a pop song should have provoked such a response . ""
Is n't he the last of the greats ? ""
Trynka suggested .
"" Where are the people who formed a lot of our cultural landscape ?
Elvis is dead .
The Beatles are gone .
This is n't just a single Ã¢â¬ â
it 's the latest event from someone who has defined our culture . """
2013-01-08,"David Bowie has celebrated his 66th birthday by releasing a new single ,
Where Are We Now ? , ahead of his first new album in 10 years .
The track was put on sale in the iTunes store in 119 countries on Tuesday morning and a video preview posted on his website , which has been relaunched for the occasion .
His 30th studio recording , The Next Day , would be released in March , said the Iso / Columbia record company .

He is seen looking in on footage of the auto repair shop beneath the apartment he lived in along with stark images of the city at the time .

"" I mention it because I think it is one of the titles that illustrates how weirdly our analogue industries represent their products within a digital world .
I 've always said I 'll know that ebooks have come of age when the images on your computer or device to represent them are n't artificially constrained by the shape that printed books are .
There is no need for ebook covers to be tall and thin and hard to fit text on .
The album sleeve that has prompted me to write about this , of course , is David Bowie 's The Next Day .
Jonathan Barnbrook has written about his design , and it contains what I think is a beautiful sentence : "" We know it is only an album cover with a white square on it but often in design it can be a long journey to get at something quite simple which works and that simplicity can work on many levels Ã¢â¬ â often the most simple ideas can be the most radical .
"" I 've seen criticism , of course , that you could knock up the final design in five minutes , but the process of getting there is intriguing to me .
I ca n't think of another artist who has taken one of their own iconic album artworks , and subverted it in this way .
It is more usual to recreate the image , as the Beatles did with the 1969 photographs in Manchester Square , which echoed the cover of Please Please Me and which were used for the Red and Blue albums , or as Sir Peter Blake did with a 2010 version of Sgt Pepper .
Another criticism I 've seen is the harsh contrast between "" the fine - grain mono background and harsh ' paint ' foreground "" .
Again I think this is an interesting mix of the analogue and digital .
Let us not forget that Bowie 's 70s artwork was n't perfect in itself .
The original UK vinyl issue of Ziggy Stardust featured a horribly obvious ugly cut - and - paste to change the catalogue number from the US edition Ã¢â¬ â the production method encroaching upon design .
Whether this design thinking translates to mass appeal is another matter .
Barnbrook says "" we worked on hundreds of designs using the concept of obscuring this cover "" but admits that "" we understand that many would have preferred a nice new picture of Bowie "" .
The risk for older artists is that new material can never recapture their glory years Ã¢â¬ â and choosing such an odd and aesthetically unappealing final image for The Next Day 's sleeve risks the accusation that the sleeve is as bland as the new material might be .
The fact that I still keep referring to it as a "" sleeve "" is telling .
While there may still be a physical release of the album , many people will this week be listening to lead single
Where Are We Now ?
on devices that represent the "" sleeve "" as a static image behind glass .
There has been precious little innovation in the way that artwork is presented alongside digital records or books .
Hack the Cover by Craig Mod was a fascinating essay looking at how to subvert the traditional expectations of the ebook cover , but few artists seem to be exploring similar possibilities with digital music files .
Even the fact that most albums feature exactly the same artwork for every track seems a wasted opportunity .
Only time will tell how well the design and the album itself stand up against the rest of Bowie 's impressive catalogue .
But would n't it be wonderful if an artist who had spent so many years reinventing his image , helped us to reinvent our expectations of what album covers could be in a digital era ?"
2013-01-09,"Despite its wistful lead single , David Bowie 's surprise new record is "" quite a rock album "" , his producer Tony Visconti said on Tuesday .
The Next Day is a mixture of "" classic Bowie "" and "" innovative Bowie "" , Visconti promised , made by an artist who is both happy and in good health .
The album was recorded in New York and in secret , on and off over the past two years .
"" We never spent more than two to three weeks at a time recording , "" Visconti told BBC News . ""
Usually we 'd work on one or two songs in an afternoon , and whip them into shape so they 'd sound like great rock tracks .
"" They would only add vocals later . ""
That 's the way I 've been working with [ David ] since The Man Who Sold the World [ and ] he has n't really changed in his approach .
""
Visconti Ã¢â¬ â who has now produced 13 Bowie albums Ã¢â¬
â said he was surprised with the decision to make Where Are We Now ?
the LP 's first single .
"" It 's maybe the only track on the album that goes this much inward for him , "" he said .
"" I thought to myself : ' Why is David coming out with this very slow , albeit beautiful , ballad ?
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
He should come out with a bang . '
But [ David ] is a master of his own life .
I think this was a very smart move , linking the past with the future , and I think the next thing you hear from him is going to be quite different . ""

Click here to view video Despite its melancholy , Where Are We Now ? was warmly received by Bowie 's fans .
Spandau Ballet 's Gary Kemp even said it made him cry .
But many listeners were n't just happy to hear a new song ; they were grateful
Bowie is healthy .
The 66-year - old has scarcely been seen in recent years , and has n't performed live since 2006 .
"" We all know he had a health scare in 2003 , 2004 , "" Visconti said , referring to an emergency operation after a heart attack in June 2004 . ""
But Ã¢â¬ Â¦ David is extremely healthy ,
he 's rosy - cheeked [ and ] he smiles a lot Ã¢â¬ Â¦
He still has that power in that chest and in his voice
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
When he starts singing [ I ] have to back off , and go into another room and just leave him in front of a microphone . ""
Bowie also left a positive impression on Jonathan Barnbrook , a graphic designer who worked on The Next Day 's album cover . ""
[ He is ] very intelligent , funny , serious when he needs to be and generous in his thoughts and actions , "" Barnbrook wrote on his firm 's blog .
Together , they conceived an unusual cover image : the artwork from Bowie 's 1977 Heroes LP , obscured by a white square , on which are printed the words The Next Day . ""
The obscuring of an image from the past is Ã¢â¬ Â¦ [ about the ] human condition ; we move on relentlessly in our lives to the next day , leaving the past because we have no choice but to , "" Barnbrook wrote . ""
[ It ] is about the spirit of great pop or rock music that is ' of the moment ' , forgetting or obliterating the past Ã¢â¬
Â¦
We want people to think about the time when the original album was produced and [ about ] now . ""
The Next Day will be released in March ."
2013-01-09,"I am about as big a fan of David Bowie as you will find on the planet .
Back when I hosted my Saturday morning show on Radio 2 ( for nearly 11 years ) , I ensured we played a track from the Great One every single week
Ã¢â¬ â every single week bar one , when Andy , the chap I worked with , forgot to play it .
It was the closest we ever came to falling out .
A few months later we tried to remedy this shameful blot on our record by playing every track from Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars in order , ( without really drawing attention to it ) throughout one programme .
Things have been pretty quiet on the Bowie front for a long time now .
After he last toured with his album Reality in 2003 , he walked away from performing and recording .
He had suffered a few health setbacks but also seemed , quite rightly , to be enjoying life on his own terms , as a husband and father to a young child .
It seemed to most of us that he had done with being a rock star .
I chatted about this with another legendary music genius one night ( a professionally miserable Mancunian of about the same age Ã¢â¬
Â¦ you can guess ) .
He thought it might be Bowie had figured he would never feel quite as relevant as he used to , never feel like he was at the centre of the cultural hurricane , so had maybe decided to cut his losses and ride off enigmatically into the sunset .
Certainly , when he made it clear he would not be appearing at the V&amp;A retrospective highlighting his style and influence in fashion , and then declined to appear at the Olympic opening ceremony last year , I had slowly tried to accept and make peace with the idea that he had really called it a day .
I tried to take solace in the fact that he appeared to have managed to escape more or less intact from showbusiness .
In short , I expected to see or hear nothing new from him , unless we were to meet socially .
Until Tuesday morning of course .
I had n't had the best of nights .
The norovirus struck the Ross household , and me , my wife and my poor daughter Ã¢â¬ â already worried about waking up to face the first of her mock GCSEs Ã¢â¬ â had all come down with it .
None of us had managed much sleep .
Indeed , I had spent most of the night firing murky liquids from my body .
So I was not quite certain I was n't held in some ghastly fever dream when I noticed two emails had arrived on my phone .
One was from Julian , who runs the Outside Group , Bowie 's management company the other from Duncan Jones , the great man 's son , with whom I 'd been in touch on and off over the last few years regarding not his genius father but his own remarkable talent , having co - written and directed two of the best and most sophisticated science fiction thrillers of recent years , Moon and Source Code .
My first panic - filled thought was that the worse had happened Ã¢â¬
Â¦
I felt even sicker than when I had been hunched kneeling in front of the toilet bowl an hour before and almost did n't open the mails .
Duncan 's began so cheerily ""
Hi Gang Ã¢â¬
Â¦ "" that I felt immediately calmed .
David Bowie had recorded a new album .
He had a new single , produced by one of his greatest collaborators , Tony Visconti , available for download right now .
After visiting iTunes I went to share on Twitter and of course found it had already spread , there , on Facebook and had even made the news Ã¢â¬ â the news !
I suspect the long hiatus and the surprise of the new single were deliberate , that 's the genius of David B.
In an age when we can follow our musical heroes ' every thought or whim on any number of social networks , when we can see a picture of Rihanna 's breakfast and check out what Lady Gaga thinks of Die Antwoord in 140 characters , to maintain complete radio silence for 10 years immediately puts you ahead of and above the pack , as well as creating a hunger , a desire , a need for information that we can barely tolerate .
So to burst back with a single , a video , the promise of an album , all on the morning of your 66th birthday that 's old school showbiz .
That 's something Colonel Tom Parker would have been proud of .
That puts you right back at the centre of the whole shebang .
It 's too soon for me to tell whether I 'll love the song as much as the others .
One of the miracles of the creative process is that I do n't think anyone knows for a while , regardless of whether they are the creator or the audience .
These things have to stay with you a bit before you can work them out .
But I like the sound of it .
It reminds me a little of Everyone Says "" Hi "" from 2002 's Heathen .
His voice sounds slightly less majestic , slightly older , perhaps inevitably .
But that gives it a quality that suits the song magnificently .
As does the video , which is at once both remarkably simple and somehow very touching .
The projected footage of late 70s Berlin is strange , it feels arbitrary , like random shots taken by a tourist .
But that very feeling of being inconsequential and marginal oddly lends it the weight of greater importance
Ã¢â¬
Â¦ it feels personal .
It feels real .
And I suspect it 's taking place in Bowie 's New York art studio , with sculptures and paintings and mini - installations that he 's been working on in between school runs and wandering the streets of Manhattan like a less flamboyant
but no less loved Quentin Crisp .
So we have the album to look forward to , but no news yet as to whether he will consider live appearances or even interviews .
Obviously , I laid down my marker right away .
So perhaps I will once again have the pleasure of saying "" Ladies and gentlemen , Mr David Bowie "" .
Or perhaps I wo n't .
Either way .
I 'm so very pleased he 's back ."

Click here to watch David Bowie 's comeback single ,
Where Are We Now ? , will be eligible for this Sunday 's UK charts , despite reports that the Official Charts Company had ruled it out of contention .
The confusion arose from the fact that anyone who has pre - ordered Bowie 's album
The Next Day has been given the song for free , and only paid - for songs are eligible for the chart .
Now the Official Charts Company has announced that paid - for downloads of Bowie 's song will make it a chart contender .
However , it 's dependent on retailers such as iTunes providing separate figures for paid - for downloads .
The chart compilers had yesterday said they would be unable to separate free and paid - for downloads and would be unable to give it a chart position .
Where Are We Now ? has been topping download charts across Europe since its surprise release on Tuesday morning , and now could become his fourth solo No 1 , and his first since Let 's Dance in 1983 .
In the meantime , the 66-year - old 's back catalogue is enjoying a little boost : The Best of Bowie has been hovering in the iTunes top 10 since Where
Are We Now ? was released , and HMV has announced it is expecting a sales spike with the renewed interest in the star .

2013-01-10,"It 's a belated happy new year from Music Weekly , and of course we have to start by discussing David Bowie and his masterstroke of misdirection : just how did he keep that new track a secret ?

2013-01-10,"Destiny 's Child have reunited .
In a week of surprise comebacks , their thunder might have been slightly stolen by David Bowie 's return , but to R&amp;B fans the announcement that was posted on BeyoncÃ© Knowles ' website earlier this afternoon was no less exciting .
"" I am so proud to announce the first original Destiny 's Child music in eight years ! "" she wrote .
It 's actually only one new song , called Nuclear and produced by Pharrell Williams and co - written by him and Michelle Williams , which will appear on the Love Songs compilation , which Amazon lists as having a 29 January release date .
The cover shows the three members who comprised Destiny 's Child last time out â
Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams joining Knowles â to be present and correct .
Destiny 's Child have been silent since their fifth album , Destiny Fulfilled , was released in November 2004 , since when Knowles has concentrated on her solo career , which has rather overshadowed those of Rowland and Williams .
While Knowles has been booked to perform at both of Barack Obama 's inauguration balls , Rowland has been a judge on The X Factor and Williams has appeared in the London production of Chicago .
In their first spell together , Destiny 's Child were one of the world 's most successful R&amp;B groups , creating groundbreaking tracks such as Bootylicious , Survivor , Say My Name and Bills , Bills , Bills .
They were also a huge concert attraction , headlining such unlikely gigs as Finsbury Park in London , normally more closely associated with boozy crowds of middle - aged men watching Madness , Bob Dylan or New Order .

2013-01-11,"There was plenty of excitement in the media this week about David Bowie 's surprise comeback single .
Although it has to be said some of it felt a bit like the kind of excitement you often find in those terribly sombre BBC documentaries where a man with a beard stands in front of a bookcase and says "" punk was the cultural chainsaw that transformed absolutely everything for ever .
Its influence is Ã¢â¬ Â¦ staggering "" over footage of drunk people jostling each other while a cross - looking man pretends he can play the guitar .
You know the kind of excitement : triumphant mid - life vindication excitement , the kind of excitement that might even seem a bit weird to the actually - young , for whom David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â while obviously , you know , great Ã¢â¬ â has perhaps already become a respectfully observed cultural display - treasure , the kind of old dude that old dudes will dangle as some kind of trouncingly authentic measure of their own incomparable teenage ultimacy .
No doubt Bowie can avoid this fate .
Genuine talent steps outside such narrow boundaries and his new single is a lovely thing .
Plus Bowie has already bridged this same old - dude hiatus several times in his career .
When he reappeared on Top of the Pops as Let 's Dance - era David Bowie in the mid-1980s I can remember finding him very confusing at first , assuming sympathetically that there must be something fundamentally quite wrong with this sweating waxwork propped up in a roadside speakeasy twitching and grimacing and shouting about the serious moonlight .
He seemed troubled .
Perhaps he was having problems using his legs .
In the middle of his next single China Girl , which is about having a Chinese girlfriend , Bowie suddenly shouted out "" VISIONS OF SWASTIKAS IN MY HEAD ! "" .
If I 'd been friends with Bowie 's girlfriend at that point I 'd have probably had a quiet word .
I 'm just not sure David 's right for you .
I know he 's nice .
I know he dresses well .
But I think he has visions of swastikas In his head .
No .
No , do n't call him .
In the event Bowie just slipped back into the swim of things , propelled by the simple fact of his own enduring talent , that mixed bag of glass - spider swastika - headed cross - generational brilliance , as he has again now pretty much straight off the bat : priestly , restrained , dressed simply in his favourite alien sex - jumpsuit , and looking as ever like the only man in the world who really understands how all this works .
And while it might seem on the face of it that Bowie has absolutely nothing at all to do with football , his presence was conjured again from an unexpected source during Swansea 's Capital One Cup defeat of Chelsea in midweek at a toxic and terribly discontented Stamford Bridge . ""
Oi Torres !
I could do BETTER than THAT ! ""
an angry in the home seats shouted as Chelsea 's ÃÂ£50 m record signing left the pitch , in the process ( a ) quoting word for word complete with the correct cadences and stresses a lyric from Queen Bitch , Bowie 's 1971 tribute to the Velvet Underground ; and ( b ) raising a very interesting broader footballing question .
Torres was bad against Swansea in a way footballers are n't often bad , going through the familiar muscle - memory patterns of being a footballer , still running and jogging and twisting and turning , but in a way that seemed horribly fractured and awkward , like a tearful moon - faced forgetful child being forced again to do PE in his underpants .
For once the suggestion that you could actually do better than that seemed , if in no way likely to be answered in the affirmative , then at least partly relevant .
This is after all a question everybody who watches football has asked themselves , even those of us who exist at a level of dismal park - pitch mediocrity .
My most recent personal assessment is that if I were to play the entire 90 minutes up front for Chelsea in every Premier League match for a full season , with the whole team geared towards providing me with ammunition Ã¢â¬ â Eden Hazard , Juan Mata and Oscar playing just behind me , both full - backs pushing on constantly to provide me with crosses
Ã¢â¬ â I would probably score five goals .
Stumbling , dizzy and incoherent with fatigue , I think I could force the ball over the line perhaps three times from open play , bobbled in off a heel or a shin , or perhaps , after some particularly fine Mata - Hazard interplay , poked into an open goal after a series of tearful air kicks .
The other two goals would be penalties ( I would insist on taking all the penalties ) although even then it 's hard to be sure .
I 've taken a penalty against a professional goalkeeper and what strikes you is how laughably slow - motion your shooting suddenly seems , how pathetically lacking in fizz , your finest corner - bound spank plucked tamely out of the air .
You probably think you could do better , but you could n't .
In fact one of the remaining measures of distance between our relentlessly over - exposed elite footballers and those who pay to watch them is the enduring and unbridgeable gulf in basic physicality .
This is particularly the case with footballers of the last 10 years , who have generally coalesced into a single highly specialised ideal of unattainable athleticism .
Obvious exceptions aside , footballers are no longer lanky , gangly , beefy , spidery and so on .
They are instead almost uniformly lithe and Olympian , their bodies remorselessly optimum - scaled , narrower , stringier , more compact .
I recently interviewed a Premier League defender and was struck by his basic absence of anticipated human bulk , his otherworldly dinkiness , a frame that looked so hulking and brutish on television but which in the flesh had me worrying that if I turned around too quickly I might accidentally squash him .
It has n't always been this way .
Years ago I used to see legendary Millwall midfield bouncer Terry Hurlock jogging around the streets of south london , and in a normal human setting even his head seemed frighteningly vast , stretched across between his tumbling curls like three heads jammed into one , hands like dustbin lids , arms as thick as legs , feet like breezeblocks .
In pre - modern times there might have been some physical common ground , a meeting point where I - could - do - better - than - that might have been briefly tested .
Not now .
No way .
Trying to play football against a proper modern footballer is instead a really good way of discovering that some human beings really can do very difficult things much better than you .
Some people get to be Bowie .
While you , you 're the bloke who stands at the back in Boyzone dancing and looking upset .
Last year I made the mistake of playing 11-a - side football against a team that had Robert Pires in it , Pires who had only recently been jeered away from a short spell at Aston Villa , unfit , slow , old and generally I - could - do - better - than - that .
And still trying to play against him was like pitting yourself against a Victorian ghost , the kind of eyeless spectre that comes veering past oblivious to your material existence , moving not just faster , but as though he has a Matrix - like vision of the space behind the space , angles and gaps and possibilities invisible to the human eye , already out of reach even as you start to flail and yank and hack at this neat little goatee - bearded silhouette .
For all the tears it was still a salutary experience , and one that suggested perhaps footballers deserve a little more species - respect than they are currently allowed .
Fantastically well paid as they are , there is a basic absence of any finer consideration for these expertly - poised human beings , floating in their tin can high above the world , rarefied performers who basically enter the stocks twice a week in order to be jeered and howled at by normal people in exchange for money .
They are , despite a consensus of near - inconsolable revulsion , engaged in a form of high - stakes physical ballet so well calibrated that even a moment 's slackness can look like evidence of irrecoverable decline .
And as a kind of apology for the ongoing obsession with Torres it is worth pointing out there is legitimate human interest here , not least as an indication of the fine margins at which these jeered and goaded and roughhoused specimens of species - level athletic intelligence operate .
There is a tendency to promote the idea of an egalitarianism of universal mediocrity , to deny that things like talent or expertise actual exist , and that the ability to take part is the same as actually being good at taking part .
It is nice sometimes to celebrate a little what the evidence suggests , that not everyone gets to be Bowie .
Just as not everyone including Ã¢â¬ â fascinatingly , and apparently for years at a time , Fernando Torres Ã¢â¬ â gets to be Fernando Torres ."

Ã¢â¬ â before everything kicks off
and it gets a bit aggressive .

2013-01-12,
2013-01-12,"On Tuesday morning , the astonishment that greeted the release of David Bowie 's first single in a decade seemed almost universal .
The shock was not merely that
Bowie Ã¢â¬ â long since presumed retired Ã¢â¬
â was back , with an album , The Next Day , to follow in March ; it was that one of the biggest stars in the history of rock music had managed to spend two years making a record without even a hint of rumour reaching the wider world .
This in an age of cameraphones and gossip websites and social media .
"" We have n't seen this before , a real legend dropping the announcement , the music , the photographs , everything in the blink of an eye , "" says Tim Ingham , editor of music industry magazine Music Week .
"" At 66 , he 's run the whole machinery of the music industry and the music media ragged , and he 's run social media ragged too .
Social media by its very nature demands facts or Ã¢â¬ â in the absence of facts Ã¢â¬ â speculation ; if it does n't know , it 'll make it up itself .
But the lack of chatter enhanced the PR impact .
In terms of a basic product announcement , which is all this is , he 's come back with more of a media storm than any other artist has produced in recent years . ""
At least part of the reason Bowie was able to keep his comeback a secret until the last minute is down to the remarkably low - key nature of his business arrangements : a reaction , long - standing producer Tony Visconti suggests , to the early 70s , when Bowie 's management company Mainman "" had about 45 people looking after him , or allegedly looking after him "" , an arrangement that ended in chaos and litigation .
Today , his New York office has a staff of one .
He has no official manager , relying instead on his business manager Bill Zysblat Ã¢â¬ â a figure "" as low - key as you can get , "" according to Bowie 's biographer Paul Trynka Ã¢â¬ â who began life as the Rolling Stones ' tour accountant before joining Bowie in the early 80s , and his fiercely loyal PA Corrine "" Coco "" Schwab .
The latter is something of a legend in Bowie mythology and rumoured to be the subject of his song
Never Let Me Down .
"" She 's been with him since the mid-70s , "" says Trynka .
"" Some of the musicians who worked with him hated her , but they invariably point out she 's smart , sometimes intimidatingly so , and utterly devoted to Bowie .
He trusts her absolutely . ""
"" It means you can react to things very quickly , you can do things incredibly secretively , which you could n't do if it was one of those situations where there are 20 different managers involved , "" says a source close to Bowie .
"" When David comes into Britain to do something like his appearance on [ Ricky Gervais sitcom ] Extras , nobody knows he 's here .
He 's very good at being low - key .
How many times over the last 10 years have you seen pictures of him ?
There have maybe been two or three paparazzi shots of him in a decade .
He 's not a recluse , but he 's seen when he wants to be seen . ""
His deal with his record label seems equally unique : he has no A&amp;R man supervising his work , which , says Visconti , "" is not normal for any star "" .
Even Rob Stringer , the president of the Sony Music Label Group and one of the most powerful men in the music industry , only became aware of The Next Day 's existence a month ago , when he was invited to the studio in New York to hear some tracks .
"" We still have n't given him a copy of the album , "" chuckles Visconti . ""
He came to the studio .
He was thrilled .
He said ' what about the PR campaign ? '
And David said , ' there is no PR campaign .
We 're just going to drop it on 8 January .
That 's it . '
It 's such a simple idea , but Bowie came up with it . ""
So relieved to talk about the new DB album after 2 years of silence on the subject , like a dam broke .
Ã¢â¬
â
Tony Visconti ( @Tonuspomus ) January 9 , 2013
Meanwhile , when I contact the British arm of Sony , they wo n't discuss the project at all , which could be related to rumours that while Bowie 's UK PR company , the Outside Organisation , were given notice last Friday , the label itself knew nothing right up until the point at which Where Are We Now ? materialised on iTunes at 5 am on Tuesday .
"" They certainly seemed as surprised as the rest of us , "" notes Ingham wryly .
By contrast , the people who actually worked on the album seem not so much happy as desperate to talk about The Next Day .
"" I was on the cover of Guitar Player magazine , "" laments Earl Slick , the Bowie sideman responsible for , among other things , the astonishing soloing on 1976 's Station to Station .
"" It was the Christmas issue , the one you want to be on the cover of , the one that 's on the newsstands twice as long .
And I 'm making a new Bowie album
and I ca n't tell them anything .
The only person I told was my manager . ""
Tony Visconti , who says he only finished work on the album last week and was n't expecting it to be announced on Tuesday Ã¢â¬
â
"" I thought they were just going to put out a single "" Ã¢â¬ â also seems delighted to be rid of two years of subterfuge , non - disclosure agreements and , as he bluntly puts it , "" bare - faced lies "" .
He told only his partner and his children what was going on . ""
People would ask ' what are you working on at the moment ? ' .
About a year ago , I started saying well , I 'm working on a very big project
but I ca n't tell you what it is .
That satisfied most people , but then a few people would say ' it 's Bowie , is n't it ? ' .
And I 'd go , I ca n't tell you who it is , even if you said the person 's name
I ca n't say yes
or no .
And they 'd go '
it 's Bowie ' .
And I 'd go ' no , really it is n't ' .
I was a little uncomfortable with that , but it was the only way to do it . ""
Now he 's free to gush about the album at will .
The elegiac balladry of
Where Are We Now ? is n't particularly representative , he says .
"" The album is eclectic , it 's got five really blistering rock tracks .
The rest is really mid - tempo , mysterious and evocative .
He 's been obsessed with medieval English history , which , believe it or not , makes great material for a rock song .
And contemporary Russian history , which makes a great rock song .
The subject matter he choses to write about is amazing .
The Next Day is a song about a tyrant , let me leave it at that .
One thing the album 's got is a lot of substance .
You 're going to have to listen to it many times , because the lyrical content 's going to take a long time to absorb .
He 's been obsessed with medieval English history , which , believe it or not , makes great material for a rock song .
"" It 's got an instantly familiar sound , because the band are rocking away and it 's David Bowie 's voice .
He 's singing very low - key on the single .
A lot of people have misinterpreted that , thinking that he 's going to sound old and frail on this record , but for that song he wanted to sound vulnerable .
Big difference .
Elsewhere , he 's singing in full voice , that voice you hear on Heroes , so loud that I literally had to step away from him in the studio . ""
Visconti says he was n't surprised when Bowie contacted him about recording two years ago , despite the fact that the singer had told him barely a year before that he had no interest in making more music and furthermore had n't written any songs , a statement he now thinks was a fib .
"" You know , he 's an artist , he ca n't sit on his creativity forever .
You could tell from the beginning that the songs were stunning even in primitive form .
They were obviously things that had built up over the past 10 years , sketches he had all along . ""
Complete secrecy was a precondition from the start : early on , they were obliged to move studios after the owners allegedly leaked information about who was working there .
"" We told them to keep it a secret and they blew it within 24 hours .
We had n't even started the album but we got a phone call : ' is it true
you 're making a record at such and such a studio ? ' .
We just denied everything .
Even when we made the first demos , we were sworn to secrecy .
The three musicians working on them Ã¢â¬ â me , Sterling Campbell on drums and Jerry Leonard on guitar Ã¢â¬
â had to sign a non - disclosure agreement .
It was unnecessary with the the three of us , we were long - time Bowie people
Ã¢â¬ â
if he 'd just said keep it a secret and do n't tell a soul , we would have done that without signing Ã¢â¬ â but later on , as the crew on the album got bigger , the NDAs were necessary because we did n't know everyone that well .
We got lucky with the studio , a place called The Magic Shop in SoHo .
Normally there are interns at studios , but whenever we were there , they gave their interns time off .
They did n't want them to witness it .
When we were working there , they had a skeleton staff of two , which is not normal . ""
Did the secrecy affect the sessions ? ""
Definitely .
We had to talk about it about it as a group , share our experience of the insanity , the frustration .
And David would just sit there smiling .
The fun we were having in the studio overshadowed all the neuroses , but there definitely were neuroses . ""
Even with security so strict that when Earl Slick turned up to work on the album last July , not even his own roadie was allowed in the studio Ã¢â¬ â
"" I told him to pick me up Tuesday at 1 pm and drop me off at the studio , but I said , they got guys to haul the gear in at the studio , you just sit in the truck "" Ã¢â¬ â Visconti seems astonished than no one found out . ""
The evidence was there , but no one put all the pieces together .
He was photographed near the studio .
Over a year ago , he asked Robert Fripp to play on the album and Robert Fripp put it on his blog , something like ' David Bowie 's asked me to play on his album
but I 'm too busy ' , and no one believed it !
If someone was actually monitoring all these leaks , they could have put it together .
"" I know we have the makings of another album No one did , enabling an artist who has always thrived on mystique to return in suitably mysterious style .
"" There might be a lesson in there for the wider music industry , "" suggests Tim Ingham .
"" We live in an age when distraction is everywhere , consumers are multi - screening Ã¢â¬ â and multi - screening is actually an acceptable verb Ã¢â¬ â and the industry assumes that to get what marketing departments call cut - through or mind - share for music you have to bombard people : artists are supposed to be in a constant dialogue with their fans , via Twitter or blogs or Facebook .
It 's a timely reminder that mystique is a valuable commodity .
You can perhaps give people more by giving them less . ""
As for Bowie , Tony Visconti seems confident that The Next Day is a new beginning rather than simply one last hurrah .
They ended up recording 29 songs , he says , and even on the deluxe edition of the album , there are only 17 tracks .
"" We have tracks left over that are really great , that just did n't fit with this batch , so I know we have the makings of another album .
And I know he wants to keep recording .
I 'm not sure when , but I think he 'll be back in the studio later this year . ""
Meanwhile , despite the fact that no live dates have been announced for the forseeable future , Earl Slick says he 'd like to tour the album .
"" Of course I would !
I 'm the biggest roadhog on the planet . ""
He 's not holding his breath , he says , but "" as far as I 'm concerned , anything he says or does could change .
Nothing he does surprises me , ever .
Never has , never will .
When he contacted me about working on the album it was like , what 's this about ? '
Are you available ? '
Yeah , I 'm available , what 's going on ? '
Well I wanna do some recording , ' Ã¢â¬ â like he was asking you to go have a cup of tea .
"" In the meantime , he says , he 's trying to work out which of the songs on The Next Day feature him .
"" You got ta understand , I have n't heard the finished thing yet .
He was still finishing and polishing the lyrics when I left .
I ca n't actually figure out the titles I 've seen .
I do n't know which ones I actually played on . ""
The last time Slick heard from Bowie , he says , it was via email : "" I got a nice message from him saying ' thank you for keeping quiet ' . ""
He laughs .
"" He knows what I 'm like .
I 'm a Brooklyn Italian ,
you know what I mean ?
I got a big fuckin ' mouth . ""
Ã¢â¬Â¢ This article was amended on 16 January 2013 .
The original said that Rob Stringer , president of the Sony Music Label Group , only knew about the release of the David Bowie album a month ago , when in fact he knew about it in October .
This has been corrected ."
2013-01-13,"Thilo Schmied is lost in thought , mulling over the days when David Bowie fell in love with Berlin , and Berlin fell in love with him .
"" Whenever he went into a record store , the word would spread and people would gather outside , and when he came out with his purchases , they 'd dash inside and ask the sales people what he had bought . ""
Schmied , a sound engineer , now offers tours of the Hansa studio , the place where Bowie spent so much of the fertile period which saw the recording of his Berlin trilogy of albums , Low , "" Heroes "" and Lodger .
The studio 's mahogany - panelled former ballroom â where "" Heroes "" was recorded â remains the destination for many fans seeking to get to the heart of Bowie 's mid-1970s Berlin experience .
Visitors are also taken to the former studio control room whose window once offered a view into communist East Germany , where Bowie and his producer Tony Visconti would look at the border guards looking back at them ; the same window from which Bowie says he saw a couple making out at the wall , giving him the inspiration for the track "" Heroes "" .
"" You will have to use your imaginations , "" says Schmied sadly , showing the group a photograph of the old view .
The window is now blocked by a red - brick firewall of a post-1989 new - build .
Bowie 's days are long gone .
The Hansa studio was known to the singer as the Hall by the Wall .
Bowie has talked affectionately of regular cycle rides there from the tenement flat he rented .
The studio , where he finished Low and recorded "" Heroes "" , was pockmarked with wartime bullet holes and made for a strangely isolated edifice .
It stood just metres away from the Wall and the sealed - off Potsdamer Platz , then in no man 's land .
Today it is pressed up against new office blocks in a rather soulless business district .
The facade and Ionic columns have , like much of post cold war Berlin , been thoroughly scrubbed and all traces of the Wall have gone , save for a bit of bumpy cobbled paving to mark its path .
Potsdamer Platz is buzzing once more and as we know from Bowie 's Where Are We Now ? , released so unexpectedly last week , the trains are also running there again .
This corner of Berlin , remembered to such elegiac effect in Bowie 's new work , is brighter , more prosperous and more efficient .
But it has n't quite got the charisma of the 70s .
"" That was an unrepeatable time of Sturm und Drang , "" says Jim Rakete , a leading German photographer and photojournalist who met Bowie in Berlin at the time and photographed him backstage , producing some of the most iconic images of Bowie 's Berlin days .
"" When he first got in touch with Berlin he was ready to explode , "" he told the Observer . ""
He was as broke as the city was , and people typically lived on just a couple of bucks a day .
Bowie would drive around the city and no one would recognise him or if they did , would leave him alone . ""
Bowie arrived from LA in 1976 , exhausted from drugs and fame , and would stay for two years , getting to know the works of Brecht and the BrÃ¼cke art movement , immersing himself in German electronic music and writing and painting . ""
He had a strange life , marooned inside communist East Germany in his west Berlin apartment just a stone 's throw from where his hero Christopher Isherwood had once lived , and surrounded by expressionist art , bars and other musicians and artists , "" says Tobias RÃ¼ther , author of Heroes :
David Bowie and Berlin .
The city had a profound healing effect on him and sparked what was arguably the most creative phase of his career .
And Berlin , or west Berlin , welcomed him with open arms .
West Berliners , RÃ¼ther says , "" were particularly flattered that he chose to live among them at such a difficult time during the cold war "" .
Berlin at the time was being kept alive by the state subsidies pumped into it and by measures such as allowing residents to forgo military service â a move that made the city a magnet for young bohemians who were looking for an alternative to both the communist east and the capitalist west .
Perfect for Bowie .
"" Everyone in west Berlin thought they had seen Bowie , "" says Rakete .
"" Either cycling past or eating a hamburger .
That 's partly how he became an accepted part of the city 's fabric . ""
Rakete remains fascinated by the extent to which Bowie was nourished by the strange nature of the enclaved city and appears to have been genuinely able to be himself . ""
He was surprised at the sense of freedom , he had n't expected it , "" he says .
"" He thought the Berlin Wall would be wrapped around the autobahn , suffocating the city and was amazed that here were two million people living in a couple of square miles surrounded by barbed wire and everyone believing that it would somehow stay like this for ever . ""
Bowie lived on the rather anonymous , unfashionable Hauptstrasse , in a seven - room apartment he initially shared with Iggy Pop , stocking the fridge with delicacies bought from the posh fine food department at the nearby KaDeWe department store .
While others chose the rather more funky hotspot Kreuzberg , "" Bowie was more at home "" there , says Claudia Skoda , a fashion designer friend .
Asked in an interview with Der Tagesspiegel a decade ago if he remembered his address , Bowie shot back : "" Hauptstrasse 155 in SchÃ¶neberg . ""
' You still remember it after 25 years ? '
the interviewer asked .
"" I will never forget it , "" Bowie replied .
"" They were very important years . ""
Today Bowie 's old flat is sandwiched between a physiotherapists and Fabio Denluca 's Lotus tattoo parlour .
The most memorable of the fans who have dropped in , says the 44-year - old Italian , "" was a British girl who wanted a profile of Bowie from China Girl tattooed just below her shoulder blade "" .
Denluca is genuinely surprised to be told that his parlour features in Bowie 's new music video in the shots of Hauptstrasse .
"" I suppose that is kind of cool , "" he says .
Skoda , who used to make clothes for him , recalls in an interview the time they first met . ""
He came knocking on my door looking for Klaus KrÃ¼ger , the drummer with Tangerine Dream , an electronic band
Bowie was very interested in .
That was the start of us working together during the day and going out together at night . ""
He threw himself into Berlin life , loving the quirkiness of it .
There was a workwear shop on Mehringdamm where he 'd buy himself workmen 's overalls and other things . ""
Sometimes she 'd cook for him "" but he was n't keen on German food , except for the scrambled eggs and brains he ate in [ the club ] Evil "" .
They spent most of their evenings in the Dschungel cocktail bar on NÃ¼rnberger Strasse ( where an expensive hotel now stands ) .
"" He was always on the search for one - night stands .
"" The "" weird people "" he frequently met in Dschungel probably summed up the strangeness of the city better than anything else .
He described : "" A girl â¦ who had a rat on her shoulder attached by a chain that ran over her dress ... "" and "" two blokes [ with ] bald heads ... dressed up as surgeons , complete with rubber gloves and stethoscopes . ""
Another favourite Bowie haunt was the nightclub run by Romy Haag , a beautiful transvestite with whom he was supposed to have been romantically linked .
"" Berlin was always a creative source for him , "" says the entertainer known for her sell - out drag shows .
Rakete witnessed what he believes might have been Bowie 's first ever encounter with Berlin , when he arrived on a train in the mid-1970s .
The word had got out among Bowie fans that he was stopping at Zoo Station , and Rakete , an eager young photo- reporter , was there .
"" Out of the train stepped this really polite young man , who introduced the small crowd to his fellow passengers , an old couple who had no idea who he was , "" recalls Rakete . ""
He said ' meet Mr and Mrs Schulze , who I 've just given my vitamin pills in return for their cigarettes ' . ""
So it was , perhaps , that the love affair began .
Berliners are immensely flattered that Bowie has now reignited the flame with Where Are We Now ? , lending as it does poetic status to the places mentioned in the lyrics and reminding the city just how much it has changed .
"" You feel the real sense of homesickness he has for Berlin and the extent to which he very much felt at home here , "" Haag says .
Thilo Schmied 's Bowie tours : http://www.musictours-berlin.com"
2013-01-18,"Legendary guitarist Robert Fripp has denied he turned down the opportunity to play on David Bowie 's forthcoming album
The Next Day , as suggested by producer Tony Visconti in the Guardian last week .
Visconti told the Guardian that the King Crimson mastermind Ã¢â¬ â also famed for his remarkable improvised playing on Bowie 's Heroes and Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) albums Ã¢â¬ â had inadvertently leaked the news that Bowie was recording an album after writing on his blog that he had been asked to contribute to the album .
Not so , wrote Fripp on his blog on Thursday .
"" I have n't spoken to David for a while
and I was n't approached Ã¢â¬
Â¦
If I was asked to take part in this totally excellent project , who asked ?
Nothing ever came to me Ã¢â¬ Â¦ My association with David and Tony has provided highlights of my life , not only my musical life .
I would regret if anything negative , completely invented , were to query the reality . ""
The guitarist announced last year that he had ceased making new music after becoming embroiled in a dispute with Universal Music Group , listing among his complaints "" 20 years of unpaid royalties "" on his two collaborative albums with the Police 's Andy Summers and Kanye West 's use of King Crimson 's 21st Century Schizoid Man on his track Power , which Fripp says notched up 1 m hits on YouTube before he was approached about the sample 's use .
Despite claiming that life as a professional musician had become "" a joyless exercise in futility "" that he was abandoning in order to fight UMG in the courts , Fripp told the Guardian that he "" would have had to seriously reconsider my non - public status "" had he been invited to play on The Next Day .
"" I 'm a great admirer of Tony , had piles of laughs with him and know there 's nothing mischievous involved at all , "" Fripp added .
The confusion appears to have arisen from a blogpost , written by Fripp in October 2011 , in which he described a dream he 'd had the previous night that Bowie was working on new material : "" It gradually appeared that David had some remarkable new ideas in process , not yet public , "" wrote Fripp .
"" These he presented indirectly , to allow the penny to drop without prompting .
Eno also got involved , and what a flowering of ideas ! ""
Without Fripp 's knowledge Ã¢â¬ â and indeed without any contribution from Brian Eno - the sessions for The Next Day had been underway for several months . ""
In the creative world , when someone begins thinking , other people sometimes hear what 's going on Ã¢â¬ Â¦ who knows on the unconscious - subconscious levels what gets overheard ? ""
Fripp wrote on his blog in an attempt to explain the coincidence . ""
Both Bowie and Eno are exceptionally sharp creative minds that read the zeitgeist , "" he told the Guardian .
"" Things happen around them that defeat rationality .
"" "" I 'm not angry at all , "" he added .
"" No one is hurt , I 'm not upset , just keen for clarity .
My respect for Messers Bowie and Visconti continues undiminished , untarnished .
The album is out there .
Fab ! """
2013-01-23,"If you follow modern art at all , it is easy to guess who made the video for David Bowie 's Where Are We Now ?
Those talking , or singing , heads squeezed melancholically on to stuffed mannequins like Francis Bacon sock puppets are a trademark of American artist Tony Oursler , who also has an exhibit at Tate Modern in February .
Bowie fans who did n't know about Oursler can find out more when his eerie images are projected among the weedy trees in what Tate is pleased to call its "" river landscape "" .
Oursler 's art is instantly recognisable ( when you have seen it once ) , in a way that raises a question about video art .
That very term "" video art "" already sounds old - fashioned , and that too points to the same question , which is : Does every successful video artist reinvent video art ?
When artists first began using film and video tape ( ah , the nostalgia ) in the 1960s and 1970s , their efforts were confined by technology .
It did n't matter whether they were recording pieces of performance art â like Chris Burden having himself filmed being shot in the arm in 1971 â or making critiques of network television , as in some of Richard Serra 's video works .
Their moving image works always looked like parodies , travesties of the mainstream cinema and TV of which they were low - tech reflections .
The first true "" video art "" , which went beyond experiment or recording and set out to be a new branch of contemporary culture , was still more self - conscious about the medium .
Nam June Paik made TV monitors the stuff of installations , as did Gary Hill , in a more philosophical manner .
Yet in the 1990s , as recording , editing and projecting technology became increasingly flexible , the moving image was set free and artists who used it could create their own visual worlds .
Oursler is a good example of an artist who has created his own art â a system of images all his own .
Puppets , faces , organic softness and claustrophobia : it is a singular repertoire .
Similarly unique in the 1990s was the art of Douglas Gordon , best known at that time for slowing down classic cinema .
Meanwhile , Tacita Dean used real celluloid film to create landscapes and portraits , and Matthew Barney concocted the extravagant cosmos of The Cremaster Cycle .
Are any of these artists doing the same thing as one another ?
It seems not .
So here is my theorem : every artist who makes really striking use of the moving image invents a new art of the moving image .
There are also a lot of bad uses of the moving image in contemporary art â and by the same logic each is bad in its own micro - discipline .
Excellence is rare in any medium .
Elizabeth Price is a truly powerful artist of the moving image , but she has nothing in common with previous British exponents of ( to use the archaic term one more time ) video art .
Her Turner - winning work is richly and darkly emotional .
Is this a new direction for multimedia art ?
No .
It is her unique version of it ."
2013-02-01,"1 T - Rex , Hot Love February 1971
Marc Bolan 's third huge hit in a row ,
No 1 for four weeks .
His Top of the Pops performance showed him going truly imperial , with flying - V guitar , pink trousers , silver jacket and , prompted by his friend and colleague Chelita Secunda , glitter on his cheekbones .
2 David Bowie , Queen Bitch December 1971
"" There should be some real unabashed prostitution in this business , "" Bowie told Cream magazine in late 1971 .
He did his best to make it happen with this Velvet Underground tribute , saturated in homosexuality and Manhattan sleaze .
Mick Ronson 's guitar slices through everything .
3 Alice Cooper , School 's Out April 1972 From Detroit by way of LA , these hard rockers had been wearing makeup and frocks since 1969 , so were well - suited to the glam imperative .
School 's Out was a definitive entrant in the teenage rampage stakes and scored hard with the kids , hitting No 1 for three weeks in the summer holidays .
4 Roxy Music , Virginia Plain August 1972
With Bryan Ferry 's ultra - stylised performance and Eno 's other wordly synth shrieks , this one definitely arrived from Planet Mars in the late summer of 1972 .
Chock - full of pop art and pop culture references , Virginia Plain was nothing less than a manifesto for a new age : "" So me and you , just we two , got to search for something new . ""
5 Mott The Hoople , All the Young Dudes
July 1972 Bowie may have provided the raw material , but Mott gave the definitive performance of this generation - defining song , with its sneering reference to the Beatles and the Stones .
The musicians curled and uncurled around Ian Hunter 's snarling voice : "" Oh is there concrete all around/
Or is it in my head . ""
6 Lou Reed , Vicious November 1972
Another Bowie production , and another career revival .
Vicious begins Reed 's second solo album in exactly the way that you would wish , with the poet laureate of Manhattan spitting out the Warhol inspired lyrics Ã¢â¬ â
"" Vicious : you hit me with a flower "" Ã¢â¬ â while Mick Ronson , cutting through everything , embodies the song 's threat .
7 David Bowie , The Jean Genie November 1972 Bowie reached back to his 60s R&amp;B days with this one , based on the old I 'm a Man riff but updated with Ronson 's buzzing guitar , burlesque rhythms , gay double entendres Ã¢â¬ â his by - now patented patch .
The band did a fantastic Top of the Pops performance , recently rediscovered .
8 Slade , Cum
On Feel the Noize February 1973
This was their fourth No 1 in 18 months , which gave guitarist Dave Hill an excuse Ã¢â¬ â as if he needed it Ã¢â¬ â to wear ever more outrageous outfits on Top of the Pops .
An anthemic chorus and a lyric that 's a direct invitation "" to get wild , wild , wild "" .
9 Roxy Music , Editions of You March 1973 "" For Your Pleasure "" Ã¢â¬ â with model and singer Amanda Lear on the cover
Ã¢â¬ â is one of the period 's few coherent albums , and this 120 mph rocker is one of its hidden pleasures : a camp - saturated male bonding song , featuring ooohs , sirens , and the immortal line , "" boys will be boys will be boyoyoys "" .
10 Bonnie St Claire , Clap Your Hands and Stamp Your Feet
May 1973
With its stomping tunes and rock'n'roll roots , glam was huge on the continent Ã¢â¬ â blending , as it would , into Europop Ã¢â¬ â and this is a great entrant from Holland , featuring Beach - Boys ' style backing vocals , terrace handclaps , and of course the ever - present Chuck Berry riffs .
11 T - Rex , 20th Century Boy
May 1973
It could have been any of the four top - two hits that T - Rex had in 1972 Ã¢â¬ â particularly Metal Guru Ã¢â¬ â
but this was the toughest of them all : a furious rocker with a heroic riff that showed , plain for all to see , just how well Bolan understood the nature of pop fame Ã¢â¬ â 20th century toy
, I wanna be your boy .
12 Iggy and the Stooges , Search and Destroy June 1973
Iggy wore silver , the Stooges were produced by David Bowie , the record sounded glam Ã¢â¬ â all treble tones and slicing guitar Ã¢â¬ â but Search and Destroy , like its parent album Raw Power , went much further and deeper than hardly anyone wished in 1973 .
Three years later , it would find its time .
13 New York Dolls , Trash July 1973 Simultaneously ludicrous and tough , sloppy and hard , vicious and tender Ã¢â¬
â just listen to those soaring , girl - group harmonies
Ã¢â¬ â Trash was , along with Jet Boy , the Dolls ' big pop move .
It being 1973 , of course , there could only have been one question : "" Uh , how do you call your lover boy ? ""
In the US , they did n't answer .
14
The Sweet , The Ballroom Blitz September 1973
The Sweet were on a roll after Blockbuster and this may well be the archetypal glam song : teenage hysteria Ã¢â¬ â check ; camp interjections and beyond over the top TV costumes Ã¢â¬ â check ; a stomping beat , tough guitar riffs and a fey vocal Ã¢â¬ â check .
Unstoppable and still thrilling : the contrived becomes real .
15 Mud , Dyna - Mite October 1973
Written by the Sweet svengalis , Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman , "" Dyna - Mite "" stays firmly within the ballroom
Ã¢â¬
â glam 's central location Ã¢â¬ â during this relentless stomper .
Mud yocked it up on Top of the Pops with ludicrous flares and a spot of aceing Ã¢â¬
â the biker 's dance , shoulder to shoulder Ã¢â¬
â and the future Sex Pistols were listening .
16 Suzi Quatro , Devil Gate Drive
January 1974 Quatro had gold - plated garage credentials Ã¢â¬ â her first band , the Pleasure Seekers , had recorded What a Way to Die in 1966 Ã¢â¬ â and this , her fourth hit ( No 1 for two weeks ) , mixes rock'n'roll with a hint of the Burundi beat , while continuing the explosive club / ballroom theme of the time with a hint of autobiography .
17 Sparks , This Town Ai n't Big Enough for Both of Us April 1974 Sparks were the late great glam flash : tricky , artificial , super - hooky and high - concept , with a hard rocking band and definitive high gloss sleeves .
They took a song with the lyric "" you hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos , elephants and tacky tigers "" all the way to No 2 , and made it seem natural .
18 David Bowie , Rebel Rebel US version May 1974
Bowie 's goodbye to the youth movement he had helped to form Ã¢â¬ â
"" You 've got your mother in a whirl , because she 's not sure whether you 're a boy or a girl
"" Ã¢â¬ â and his last top 10 hit for 18 months .
This US mix has dreamy backwards harmonies , extra percussion and phased guitar .
19 Iron , Virgin Rebels Rule June 1974 Almost all the great glam records were hits , but this is one of the best that was n't : an abrasive slice of Sweetarama from a Scottish band , who toughened up the teenage - rampage meme while wearing Clockwork Orange - inspired costumes .
The singer had a padlock on his crotch with the legend : "" No Entry . ""
20 Sweet , The Sixteens July 1974 A four - minute mini - opera on the theme of failed youth revolution , and a summer top-10 hit , this shows the renamed group Ã¢â¬ â having lost the definite article Ã¢â¬ â rising to the song 's complex structure with a totally convincing performance .
The Sixteens is a classic of teen disillusionment , at the point of glam 's supersession .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Glam !
The Performance of Style is at Tate Liverpool from 8 February Ã¢â¬Â¢ This article was amended on 6 February 2013 because the original said Hot Love by T - Rex was released in July 1971 .
This has been corrected to say February 1971 ."
2013-02-05,"So , what 's in a name ?
Just ask Reginald Dwight and David Jones .
Even writing Rocket Man and Ziggy Stardust ( respectively ) were n't enough for Elton John and David Bowie to risk a career in music under their dreary real names .
Of course , it helps if you come ready equipped with a birth name that sounds as if it were made for the stage .
Something unusual or unique .
Something like BeyoncÃ Â© .
Only the absolute finest in popstar pedigree gets to become a global - mega - superstar under one name alone , as if success under a single appellation underlines how impressive you are .
It 's this that makes BeyoncÃ Â© 's decision to tour under her married name , Mrs Carter , all the more surprising .
Here is someone at the top of their career , and they choose to reinvent themselves under their husband 's name .
The BeyoncÃ Â© brand is distinctive by modern celebrity standards for undergoing a slow evolution .
Unlike Madonna or Gaga , she has never made shutter - speed reinvention a part of what she does .
Beyonce 's early career in Destiny Child was characterised not just by great pop songs and , shall we say , a naive approach to style , but an absolute zero - tolerance policy to questions about her private life .
In an era when "" leaked "" nude shots are considered par for the course for young popstars , BeyoncÃ Â© was notable for keeping her private life off - limits .
But this has changed over time .
Having kept quiet about her relationship with Jay - Z for years , the singer eventually began talking about her new husband , and soon she was talking about their baby and then she discovered Instagram and , frankly , we 've not stopped hearing about it all since .
There is almost something subversive about waiting until the strongest moment of your career , which is where BeyoncÃ Â© finds herself now , to do away with the infamous glossy mononym in favour of a second name your own husband does n't even use .
Over time , BeyoncÃ Â© has not only allowed her personal life to become more public but decided to make family life her defining feature .
For her sixth album , BeyoncÃ Â© will be a mother , a devoted wife Ã¢â¬ â a single lady no more .
Of all the feminist issues that refuse to unite their disciples , the fact that taking your husband 's name is still an issue never fails to surprise me .
Women whose life is equality in practice , from splitting the bills to sharing childcare , will happily take their husband 's name .
It astonishes me , but then it is their choice Ã¢â¬ â and lest we forget , choice is what this whole feminism malarkey is all about .
And choice is nothing if it 's not about being able to make individual decisions .
Tina Turner chose to keep her husband Ike 's name because she had already become successful with it .
Cheryl Tweedy 's decision to take Ashley Cole 's name was n't half as baffling as it was to keep hold of it after discovering he had something of an open - bed policy towards other women throughout their marriage .
Still , some people ( of which I am one ) may be of the opinion that anyone who can get that tattoo ca n't honestly be trusted with basic adult decisions in the first place .
Ultimately , of course , BeyoncÃ Â© 's name - change ( albeit for one tour only ) is a marketing ploy .
To promote the Mrs Carter tour , she has chosen to pose in a regal looking outfit that references Queen Elizabeth
I , only a bit more leggy .
It 's a visual stamp of authority ; I , she is saying , am the alma mater of pop 's new dynasty , a point her husband also made on the 2012 album Watch the Throne .
But it 's also an unwitting ( I suspect ) reference to one woman who famously never had to take a husband 's name .
What do you think ?
Do you care that Bey has become Mrs Carter ?"
2013-02-07,"A new film will tell the story of Iggy Pop and David Bowie 's years in West Berlin .
The British - German co - production will be directed by Gabriel Range , best - known for his movie about an imaginary assassination of George W Bush . ""
[ This ] is not a traditional rock biopic [ because ] no one dies at the end , "" producer Egoli Tossell said .
Tentatively titled Lust for Life , Range 's film will explore the period when Pop and Bowie had relocated to Germany , collaborating on 1977 's Low and the Stooges leader 's first two solo albums .
It 's an era that Bowie himself has recently returned to , paying tribute to Potsdamer Platz and NÃÂ¼rnberger Strasse in his new single . ""
Berlin was the first time in years that I had felt a joy of life and a great feeling of release and healing , "" Bowie told Uncut in 2001 .
"" Some days the three of us would jump into the car and drive like crazy through East Germany and head down to the Black Forest Ã¢â¬
Â¦
Or we 'd take long , all - afternoon lunches at the Wannsee on winter days
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
At night we 'd hang with the intellectuals and beats at the Exile restaurant in Kreuzberg . ""
Lust for Life 's screenplay was written by Robin French , according to the Hollywood Reporter , based in large part on Paul Trynka 's books Starman and Open Up and Bleed , which look at the lives of Bowie and Pop respectively .
French is the co - creator of BBC3 's sitcom Cuckoo .
Tossell is producing Lust for Life with the British production company Altered Image .
They have development funding from Creative England and the German national film board ."

2013-02-08,"Morrissey has been forced to change the cover of a forthcoming single after David Bowie reportedly blocked the use of a photo featuring both men .
This is n't a new record : on 8 April , Morrissey is reissuing his 1989 single The Last of the Famous International Playboys .
And this is n't a new photograph : in 1992 , Linder Sterling snapped the unseen shot of Bowie and the Smiths ' former singer in New York .
But it would constitute a new use of Sterling 's photo :
Morrissey planned to swap out the single 's original artwork , an image of seven - year - old Moz climbing a tree . ""
Bowie refusal , "" runs the headline for the following post on True to You , a fansite Morrissey uses as a mouthpiece : "" David Bowie has ordered EMI UK not to run the proposed artwork for Ã¢â¬ Â¦
The Last of the Famous International Playboys single and CD Ã¢â¬
Â¦
Although Bowie has no legal rights to the photograph , most of his back catalogue is presently licensed to EMI .
"" It is not certain why Bowie may have leaned on EMI to block the photo 's publication .
The two men were friendly at the time the photo was taken , uniting on stage for a performance of Cosmic Dancer .
But the intervening years have clearly brought a schism . ""
[ Bowie 's ] a business , you know .
He 's not really a person , "" Morrissey told Jonathon Ross in 2004 .
"" I could tell you stories Ã¢â¬ Â¦ and you 'd never listen to Let 's Dance again . ""
Morrissey was even more cutting in a 2004 interview with GQ . ""
Bowie is not the person he was , "" he said .
"" Now he gives people what he thinks will make them happy and they 're yawning their heads off .
And by doing that , he is not relevant .
He was only relevant by accident . ""
With or without Bowie 's face , Morrissey will still reissue his 24-year - old single .
He is also reissuing his second solo album , Kill Uncle , with bonus songs and a reordered tracklist .
The 53-year - old is currently recovering from a bleeding ulcer and hopes to resume a US tour tomorrow night . ""
The reports of my death have been greatly understated , "" Morrissey quipped last week .
Bowie 's first album in 10 years , The Next Day , is released on 11 March ."

2013-02-18,"David Bowie has quietly announced a new single , his second in 10 years .
The Stars ( Are Out Tonight ) will be released on Tuesday 26 February , two weeks before his highly anticipated album , The Next Day .
Bowie unveiled the single 's title and release date on his website .
As with the cover of The Next Day , minimalism is the order of the day for the artwork : it 's a monochrome photograph of a sculpted bust , with plain white text .
Although some fans have guessed that it portrays Bowie himself , it 's actually sculptor Al Farrow 's 1990 rendering of the painter Egon Schiele .
As Bowie 's style retrospective gets underway at the V&amp;A museum , his label has also started revealing smaller details of The Next Day .
We now have separate release dates for every territory Ã¢â¬ â 11 March in the UK
Ã¢â¬ â and information on the album 's three release formats .
In addition to the standard CD , vinyl and digital versions , there will be a deluxe edition , with three bonus tracks , and a special Japanese Blu - Spec , with four extra songs .
Bowie has also divulged The Next Day 's tracklist , which includes songs such as Dirty Boys ,
I 'd Rather Be High and You Feel
So Lonely You Could Die .
These songs will be put into context with a new feature film , David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â Five Years , which BBC2 will air in May.
As well as touching on the making of The Next Day , the documentary examines five important years in the singer 's life : 1971 , 1975 , 1977 , 1980 and 1983 .
"" This is a project that has been in development for more than a decade , "" director Francis Whately said .
As reported earlier this month , Bowie is also the subject of a proposed film by Gabriel Range .
Now in pre - production , the biopic will centre on Bowie 's friendship with Iggy Pop during the late 70s , when they were living in Berlin .
Lust for Life is an English - German co - production .

2013-02-25,"When David Bowie chose to break a decade 's silence by releasing a single , Where Are We Now ? , on his 66th birthday , dissenting voices were hard to find amid the clamour made by people eager to welcome him back .
Some argued that the clamour was part of the problem : it drowned out the music , which perhaps was n't worthy of the noisy excitement it had caused .
The reason people were so thrilled Bowie was back , they suggested , was founded in the music he made in the 1970s , a decade when almost every new album he released was an astonishingly sure - footed leap forward into uncharted territory .
But Where Are We Now ?
was no Heroes or Sound and Vision .
Rather , it was a charming , fragile ballad .
Indeed , it was not unlike the stuff he had been knocking out immediately before his retirement , when Ã¢â¬ â presumably burned by the mixed response to his spirited 1990s attempts to seize the zeitgeist or dabble in the avant garde in the way he 'd done so effortlessly two decades previously Ã¢â¬ â Bowie settled on a more straightforward and comfortable kind of classicism .
Had
Where Are We Now ? been released in 2004 , they suggested , its reception would have been far more muted .
People were welcoming back an exhilarating , distant memory of Bowie , rather than the reality .
They had a point , but
Where Are We Now ? still carried with it some intriguing possibilities for the subsequent album .
The song found Bowie drifting nostalgically around his former adopted hometown , Berlin , suggesting that The Next Day might be that rarest of things , an autobiographical work from an artist whose nakedly autobiographical songs can be numbered on the fingers of one hand .
Such speculation was bolstered by the self - referential artwork of both the single and album : the former offering an inverted photo of a skeletal Bowie onstage in 1974 , the latter featuring the cover of 1977 's Heroes with the title redacted and a white square covering the famous image of the singer in a pose modelled on a painting by Erich Heckel .
Perhaps , came the excited suggestion , Bowie had spent the past decade ruminating on his past and was now issuing an album in lieu of a memoir .
Perhaps not .
There are certainly a smattering of knowing sonic references to Bowie 's past works .
If You Can See Me features the eerie sped - up vocal effect found on 1970 's After All and the climax of Hunky Dory 's The Bewlay Brothers , while You Feel So Lonely
You Could Die ends with a reprise of the drum beat that introduced Five Years , the opening track of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
And there are moments when you wonder whether some of the characters in The Next Day 's songs are n't founded in personal experience : certainly , the protagonist of Love
Is Lost Ã¢â¬ â appointed "" the voice of youth "" , marooned abroad , cosseted by luxury but fearful and paranoid , "" thinking like mad "" Ã¢â¬ â feels remarkably like a pen portrait of the poor , cocaine - ravaged soul in that inverted photo .
But elsewhere The Next Day offers what you might call an index of Bowiean obsessions .

In the first 10 minutes alone , you get the terror of life in a dystopian dictatorship teetering on the brink of apocalypse ;
a feral gang of vaguely homoerotic juvenile delinquents smashing things up ; the numbing isolation of stardom and the suggestion that stars themselves may actually be some kind of alien lifeforms "" soaking up our primitive world "" .
The mutual respect between Bowie and Scott Walker is well - documented Ã¢â¬ â an effusive 50th birthday tribute from the elusive former Scott Engel famously reduced Bowie to tears live on Radio 1 Ã¢â¬ â
and it 's Walker 's latterday work that much of The Next Day resembles , at least in that the lyrics are so dense and allusive you occasionally feel in need of a set of York Notes to get through them .
The present writer spent an alternately illuminating and rather trying few hours attempting to unpick the lyrics of
I 'd Rather Be High .
Perhaps the mention of "" Clare and Lady Manners "" drinking and gossiping about politics during wartime was a reference to The Coterie , the 1910s ' equivalent of the subsequent decade 's bright young things Ã¢â¬ â its male membership ultimately decimated in the trenches Ã¢â¬ â in which Lady Diana Manners played a leading role .
Or perhaps it was a reference to Officers and Gentlemen , the second novel in Evelyn Waugh 's Sword of Honour trilogy , in which a character based on Lady Diana Cooper ( nee Manners ) attempts to pull strings for Ivor Clare , a character facing desertion charges .
That seems more likely Ã¢â¬ â amid the subsequent lyrical references to the futility of conflict , there 's a mention of Egypt , where Officers and Gentlemen is partially set Ã¢â¬ â in which case , the song 's overall message might be summarised as :
Waugh Ã¢â¬ â huh !
Ã¢â¬ â what is it good for ?
But what does Officers and Gentlemen Ã¢â¬ â or , for that matter , The Coterie Ã¢â¬ â have to do with the opening line 's reference to Vladimir Nabokov 's life in 1920s and 30s Berlin ?
Pausing only to wonder whether there 's a certain cultural richness here that you just do n't find in , say , the oeuvre of the Vaccines , or whether Bowie has earned himself the exalted position where one takes for cultural richness the kind of thing you 'd ordinarily dismiss as agonising pretention Ã¢â¬ â and to note that either is deeply impressive Ã¢â¬ â the present writer gave up and decided to just enjoy the music .
This , it has to be said , is a relative doddle .
Producer Tony Visconti has suggested that The Next Day is of a piece with 1979 's Lodger and , as on that record , Bowie spends a lot of The Next Day experimenting with his vocal delivery , offering , among other things , a peculiar nasal drone on the title track and a doomy , tortured lowing that recalls Walker Ã¢â¬ â him again Ã¢â¬ â on the closing Heat .
The dense web of screaming feedback that ends
Where Does the Grass Grow ? recalls the climax of Boys Keep Swinging , while the fantastic If You Can See Me has some of the relentless propulsion of Move On , although it 's perhaps worth noting that the latter track was about the joyous freedom of travel , while the characters here are unable to escape the shadowy forces controlling their lives however far they run :
"" if you can see me , I can see you , "" reiterates the chorus , Big Brother - ishly .
That aside , the comparison with Lodger might be pitching it a bit high .
It 's perhaps the least well - regarded album of original material Bowie released in the 70s , but that tells you more about the astonishing quality of the records that preceded it than it does Lodger itself .
If there are some intriguing musical decisions on The Next Day Ã¢â¬ â the honking baritone sax that gives the feral gang of Dirty Boys a curiously lurching , ungainly gait ; the vocal rendering of the Shadows ' Apache that constitutes Where Does the Grass Grow ? 's hook , the ominous , fretless - bass - decorated shudder of Heat Ã¢â¬ â
there 's none of Lodger 's unfettered experimentalism , nothing as authentically bizarre as Yassassin or African Night Flight .
What The Next Day has that perhaps Lodger did n't is something more prosaic .
Whatever else he 's been doing , clearly at least some of the last decade has been spent carefully crafting inarguable tunes .
Its melody shifting from weary sigh to frantic angst
, I 'd Rather Be High is utterly beautiful ; The Stars ( Are Out Tonight ) supports its Brad - Pitt - is - an - alien thesis with a fantastic chorus , all the more potent for the fact that it takes an age to arrive ; Valentine 's Day is so deceptively sweet that the bleakness of its subject matter Ã¢â¬ â another tyrant , bent on crushing the world beneath his heels
Ã¢â¬ â does n't initially register .
Despite the lyrical density , The Next Day 's success rests on simple pleasures , not a phrase you 'd ever use to describe Lodger or Station to Station .
You could argue that means the naysayers still have a point .
For all the pointers it offers in that direction , The Next Day is n't the equal of Bowie 's 70s work : but then , the man himself might reasonably argue , what is ?
Perhaps it 's destined to be remembered more for the unexpected manner in which it was announced than its contents .
That does n't seem a fair fate for an album that 's thought - provoking , strange and filled with great songs .
Listening to The Next Day makes you hope it 's not a one - off , that his return continues apace :
no mean feat , given that listening to a new album by most of his peers makes you wish they 'd stick to playing the greatest hits .

2013-03-09,"The Queen should be replaced by an elected head of state , with JK Rowling a natural contender for the post , says Danny Boyle , architect of the Olympics opening ceremony which gave the monarch one of her most memorable starring roles .
Boyle makes the suggestion in a Guardian interview where he reveals the debt he owes to both the controversial former Downing Street adviser Steve Hilton and the ill - fated Millennium Dome , tells how he was rejected by Elvis Costello as well as David Bowie and discloses how he came to cast the Queen alongside James Bond .
The Oscar - winning director , who won near - universal plaudits for the London 2012 opening ceremony , comes out as a republican , one who believes Britain will abolish the monarchy in his lifetime .
Of the royal family , he says : "" I think the pressure on them is utterly impossible , as recent events show .
It 's a ludicrous spotlight they 're under .
You can still have a royal family if you like â¦ but actually have an elected head of state . ""
When asked if he would offer himself for such a role , he laughs off the idea - "" I 'm not looking for a job "" - suggesting instead the Harry Potter creator , Rowling .
Boyle also sheds new light on his refusal of a knighthood at the end of last year .
"" Not my cup of tea , never has been .
I believe in being an equal citizen rather than a preferred subject . ""
He does , however , praise the Queen for her acting performance in the short , filmed sketch where she appeared alongside Daniel Craig . ""
She 's very sharp , "" he says , adding that as a public figure "" she has a natural sense of rhythm "" .
He reveals that the monarch kept her cameo role with 007 a secret from her own family , ensuring the Windsors were as surprised as everyone else on the night .
Boyle discloses that his link with government was Hilton , one of the few people allowed a sneak preview of the ceremony 's contents .
He says the former advisor "" understood it "" , acting as an interpreter to the rest of Whitehall .
Ministerial interference was minimal , says the director , because politicians feared a repeat of the Dome fiasco and did not want their "" thumbprints "" on a failure .
He says he knew his Oscar success with Slumdog Millionaire gave him the clout to do the show on his own terms , admitting that there were a couple of times when he had to say to organisers , "" If you want it to be that way , I 'll walk away . ""
He also pays tribute to Ken Livingstone whose role in the Games was "" a bit forgotten "" on the night .
To make amends , Boyle has ensured a shot of the former London mayor is visible in the DVD of the ceremony .

2013-03-10,"The thought of their own mortality does peculiar things to people .
Often it makes elder statesmen release records such as Johnny Cash 's American Recordings suite Ã¢â¬ â a final corpus of work that retroactively imparts all that came before with more gravitas .
In his seventh decade , David Bowie remains unlike all the other old dudes .
Death stalks his 24th album
Ã¢â¬ â one crafted in secrecy redolent of the tomb .
But it is n't necessarily Bowie 's own death .
The Next Day is packed with murderous tyrants , school massacres - to - be and snipers wishing they were dead .
Its killer line has just a frisson of autobiography , from a singer whose work has rarely been self - referential , at least not in the mewling sense .
"" I stumble to the graveyard and I lay down by my parents , "" Bowie sings on
I 'd Rather Be High , "" Whisper : '
Just remember , duckies , everybody gets got . '
""
A heart attack truncated Bowie 's last tour back in 2004 .
Obituaries might well have been kept on standby thereafter as this once - dissolute pop star , one who had repurposed emaciation into a Romantic trope , became a near - recluse .
Had Bowie 's final word been 2003 's serviceable Reality , his legacy as the British art - school pop star nonpareil would have retained its rude health .
If there were one final single Ã¢â¬ â Where Are We Now , say Ã¢â¬ â its quavering tone and rheumy backwards glances at Bowie 's Berlin period would have made for a tidy coda .
The Thin White Duke , after all , would have looked good in a convalescent day bed .
Instead we have The Next Day , a dense , angry , complex rock album .
It 's priapic with saxophone and studded with riffs on old Bowie , rich with internal assonance ( the vocal melody of Where Are We Now taken up by the guitar on Valentine 's Day ) and many Davids singing ( he 's like Scott Walker on the album 's closer , Heat ) .
A week on from its debut on iTunes , it 's still hard to separate the quality of songs such as the excellent Dirty Boys from our collective need for this album to be a return to form , a scourge to those furred arteries , a bony two - fingered salute to the worms .
If it is the mark of a satisfying album that you want to absorb every last note and reference , then The Next Day is a banquet , but one in which superfoods and gristle both feature .
Boss of Me sits ill here , from the ugly Americanism of its title to the lacklustre rock of its execution .
If You Can See Me is , meanwhile , a drum'n'bass cut whose strangeness does n't overcome a 90s hangover .
The verses of
( You Will ) Set the World on Fire
are let down by its chorus .
There are links backwards to Reality and 2002 's Heathen , most obviously Bowie 's desire to make statements about war , where in his pomp he just made up exotic and strange things .
But the tracks that bristle with guns
Ã¢â¬ â
I 'd Rather Be High
, How Does the Grass Grow ?
Ã¢â¬ â are rich and gory and recall ( of all people )
PJ Harvey .
And if Bowie wants to cast celebrities as undead aliens , "" sexless and unaroused "" , preying on humanity , as he does on The Stars Are Out Tonight , then there are few stars who could do so with more authority .
Most satisfying of all , perhaps , is the swell of
You Feel
So Lonely
You Could Die , which updates the Bowie of Rock'n'Roll Suicide .
A bleak waltz that cries out for a lyric sheet
, it 's the song that really nails the argument in favour of this late comeback , as vicious as it is bitter .
Does he really sing , "" I can see you as a corpse /
Hanging from a beam "" ?
Yes .
Yes he does ."
2013-03-12,"The tux Has anyone ever looked more incredible in a tux than David Bowie at the 1975 Grammys ?
I think not .
Will you just look at him in that hat , which is angled just so , with his cheekbone slightly rouged ?
We all know Bowie could win the prize for the best haircuts in the history of pop music hands down , but his brilliance at using a hat to add mystery and glamour is often overlooked .
The lapels on this tux are fantastically wide and of their era , but the white bowtie on a white shirt ?
That is totally ripe for revival .
Hunky Dory slacks
During the Hunky Dory period , around 1971 , Bowie was often seen in bellbottoms , floppy hats and shoes by Terry De Havilland .
In his book When Ziggy Played Guitar , Dylan Jones compares Bowie 's "" great cheekbones "" to those of Katharine Hepburn Ã¢â¬ â and both fashion icons share a fancy for wide slacks worn with a classic shirt sensibly tucked in .
It has also been frequently suggested that Hepburn looks like Bowie in the 1935 film Sylvia Scarlett .

what with the Tilda - Bowie hair - off , Swinton in a gold shellsuit and visor , Saskia De Brauw rocking vintage Bowie - a - like slacks and Andrej Pejic just generally being fabulous .
Bowie himself looks impeccable throughout in a Lanvin suit , a McQueen coat , a mustard cardigan ( yellow again ) and in a particularly excellent check blazer from the spring / summer Louis Vuitton catwalk .
Plus , new black - and - white images of the singer wearing ripped jeans , black jacket and hat , prove that you can do denim in your 60s .
Just keep everything else pared back .
Loud suits
Throughout his career
Bowie has embraced suiting that most men , even glossing over his knit catsuits , would file under "" snazzy "" .
The singer favours colourful tailoring in shades of green , cobalt or red , while he has always seemed particularly partial to drop of yellow .
This glorious 1970s mustard double - breasted number with turnups , brilliantly styled with a yellow striped shirt , was to be followed by a looser cut two - piece , in an 80s - friendly pastel - lemon hue , during his winning Let 's Dance phase .
Even in the early 90s , the Tin Machine years , the singer wheeled out more yellow tailoring .
Note : colourful suiting , from Gucci to H&amp;M , is very in this season .
The fancy jacket High - waisted white sateen trousers , tucked into a pair of laceup boots , would seem a stretch even on the most racy of catwalks today , but then this outfit was worn on a poster for the Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars tour , when Bowie was at the height of his one - legged - ensembles - and - lashings - of - eye - makeup era .
Once you accept the sateen and move on , just have a look at that hair .
How many whippersnapper indie singers have taken this picture to the salon ?
Plus , a patterned jacket , particularly a bomber , is pretty hot right now .
The statement details Hair , cheekbones , hats Ã¢â¬ â check , check , check .
But Bowie is also partial to using specs as an outfit exclamation point .
Helmut Newton photographed the singer in 1982 wearing a pair of amazing angular metal - framed opticals with a workwear - inspired jumpsuit ( very Richard Nicoll autumn / winter 2013 ) .
See also The Man Who Fell to Earth in which he wore some quite similarly splendid glasses .
In this film , Bowie demonstrated how to shoulder - robe an oversized herringbone coat ( very next season ) , with a trilby .
Minimalism When Bowie is n't doing flamboyant , alien - weird or bold - as - you - like colour , he often goes sleek and grey .
This outfit from 1994 is a triumph of the decade 's minimalism ( how 90s is that polo - neck ? )
but because of the sweeping lines of the coat , it is just the right side of boring .
In fact , this shape is very much the mannish silhouette favoured in recent years by Stella McCartney or Phoebe Philo for womenswear .
In 2005 , for Fashion Rocks in New York , Bowie performed in a Thom Brown three - button grey suit , featuring the designer 's trademark cropped trousers , once again proving his knack for choosing ahead - of - the - curve looks .
The trench
Bowie 's late-70s Berlin period is said to have inspired his new album The Next Day .
It is also provides countless brilliant images of the singer in black trenchcoats worn belted tight at the waist , so the coat 's skirt flares out over wide trousers .
FYI : there 's something quite Bowie - Berlin - ish about the last Raf Simons menswear collection for Jil Sander from autumn / winter 2012 , with its strict leather coats .
The other top trench Bowie moment is a picture from 1980 taken by Masayoshi Sukita , who has photographed Bowie for over 40 years .

2013-03-14,"David Bowie 's wife may have inadvertently divulged that her husband is booking some concerts .
With rumours swirling about the singer 's return to the stage , Iman has suggested that the 66-year - old plans to tour .
Iman made the comment as part of an interview with Grazia Live , while discussing the couple 's 12-year - old daughter , Alexandria .
"" We 'll have to go visit [ David ] , but we wo n't be on tour with him because she 's in school , "" the supermodel said .
"" Our schedule is around her , so I do n't know .
"" It 's just a throwaway line , but it could be a major revelation : Bowie has n't performed live since a November 2009 gig with Alicia Keys .
Just as he kept recording of The Next Day secret , Bowie has n't made any announcements about whether he plans to hit the road .
His collaborators have received differing messages .
"" I would say [ odds are ] 50:50 , "" Gerry Leonard told Rolling Stone .
Earl Slick presented a similar view : "" I would n't be surprised if [ Bowie ] did call about live dates , and I would n't be surprised if [ he ] did n't . ""
But Tony Visconti , Bowie 's producer , showed even less optimism . ""
[ David 's ] fairly adamant he 's never gon na perform live again , "" Visconti revealed to NME . ""
One of the guys would say , ' Boy , how are we gon na do all this live ? '
and David said , ' We 're not ' .
He made a point of saying that all the time . ""
Despite her own remarks , Iman said there 's nothing unusual about the way Bowie kept everything out of the papers .
"" Everyone asks , ' How did he keep it so quiet ? ' "" she said .
"" But [ the musicians ] were loyal to his vision [ and ] they just kept it under wraps until it was released .
They were just happy he was working on something
and it 's just great to hear him . ""
Whether or not Bowie is planning a tour , the singer 's year is already off to an excellent start .
The Next Day is on course to debut at No 1 , with 66,000 copies sold in its first two days .
The lead single ,
Where Are We Now ? , reached No 6 ."

David Bowie Is David Bowie 's song
Andy Warhol celebrates Ã¢â¬ â or does it satirise ?
Ã¢â¬ â the enigmatic guru of New York Pop .
Bowie 's concept of art pop was steeped in the attitudes and music of Warhol 's Factory house band , The Velvet Underground , and he was to become close to its singer and rhythm guitarist
Lou Reed Ã¢â¬ â
although apparently Reed eventually beat Bowie up at a restaurant in 1979 .
That was a bit mean after Bowie had co - produced Reed 's classic album Transformer and tried to turn the curmudgeonly street poet into the artful pop star
Bowie himself became .
What I 'm saying is , David Bowie was mixing art and pop in sometimes magical ways when the Damien Hirst generation were ... listening to his records .

2013-03-16,"David Bowie is having a pretty good year , for someone who is "" too old to lose it "" , as he himself once wrote .
Bowie , who now qualifies for a pensioner 's bus pass , released a surprise single ,
Where Are We Now ? , on his 66th birthday in January .
That was followed by a critically acclaimed video co - starring Tilda Swinton for a second single , The Stars ( Are Out Tonight ) .
And when the album from which those songs are taken , The Next Day , was released last week it went straight to No 1 on iTunes .
This weekend it is likely to become Bowie 's first No1 album in the official UK charts since Black Tie White Noise in April 1993 .
For the Victoria and Albert museum , the return of Britain 's foremost pop genius to centre stage has spectacularly paved the way for one of its most eagerly awaited exhibitions .
Demand for tickets to David Bowie Is Ã¢â¬ Â¦ , which opens this week , is breaking all previous records at the museum .
More than 42,000 advance tickets for the in - depth retrospective have been sold , more than double the advance sales of previous exhibitions .
The V&amp;A is hoping that international interest in the show , which runs until August , will take off , according to director Martin Roth , who called Bowie "" a true icon "" .
The merchandise is already doing a roaring trade , from coffee - table books to the budget range of the V&amp;A
Bowie Paper Doll Ã¢â¬ â the "" best dress - up fun you 'll have with a pair of scissors "" .
The timing of the exhibition , whose curators have had open access to the David Bowie Archives , is surely no accident , although the release of the new Bowie songs had been described as "" the best kept secret in rock "" by Rolling Stone .
The exhibition opens on Saturday 23 March , and the museum is staying tight - lipped about whether or not the man himself will be attending the preview party on Wednesday .
Curators Victoria Broackes and Geoffrey Marsh have gathered more than 300 objects from the archive , include more than 60 of the flamboyant stage costumes that marked Bowie 's many theatrical personas from Ziggy Stardust to the Thin White Duke and beyond .
This weekend also sees another retrospective exhibition at the Snap Galleries in London of David Bowie images dating back to 1972 from Japanese photographer Masayoshi Sukita , who took the image for the cover of the album "" Heroes "" .
But while excitement and critical acclaim of the latest Bowie album grow , the big question is whether or not we will see a 66-year - old Bowie on stage .
The star 's album producer and long - time studio collaborator Tony Visconti has previously rubbished reports that the singer could tour . ""
He made that very clear to the label that he was n't going to tour or do any kind of ridiculously long album promotion , "" he said in January .
"" I spoke to him two days ago and he said , ' I 'm really adamant
I 'm not gon na do a tour . '
And he said , ' If I might , I might do one show . '
But who knows when ? ""
But Bowie 's wife , businesswoman and model Iman Abdulmajid , appeared to hint that a tour might be on the cards in an interview to a magazine journalist last week , saying : "" We have a 12-year - old [ daughter , Alexandria ] in school , so we are stuck , we ca n't travel .
Our schedule is around her , so I do n't know .
"" We 'll have to go visit him , but we wo n't be on tour with him because she 's in school . """
2013-03-16,"The return of David Bowie is allowing all sorts of middle - aged kooks to look back at their lives and the Dame 's part in them .
I Dressed Ziggy Stardust ( Saturday , 10.30am , R4 ) zooms in on his role in the lives of teenage girls from British Asian families and wonders what he means to them now .
Those teenage girls are presenter Samira Ahmed , campaigner Shami Chakrabarti , sociologist Rupa Huq and the infallibly value - for - money hackette Shyama Perera .
Unlike the rest , Shyama did n't remain in her bedroom , mooning over pictures from Fab 208 .
She got to know Bowie 's people , rang up RCA and pretended to be from Fleet Street to blag photos , nabbed tickets for the final Ziggy Stardust show , and may have inspired one of Bowie 's signature costumes .
Women are always better at talking about pop than men , and this lot keep the ball in the air engagingly , with help from professional witnesses such as former Bowie PR Cherry Vanilla and his wardrobe mistress Suzi Ronson .
All agree that Bowie 's outsider status found an echo in their own semi - detached relationship to this country , and that their parents were reassured by the fact that Bowie seemed , as rock stars go , a nice young man .
Furthermore , as one of them appreciatively observes , no matter how androgynous he appeared , his tight costumes provided clear evidence of his maleness .
Not having seen the 1996 TV series of Neil Gaiman 's Neverwhere ( Saturday , 2.30pm , R4 ) nor read its novelisation , I 'm coming to his story of a struggle between characters in the real London and an imaginary London Below purely via this star - studded radio adaptation , which begins on Radio 4 and continues on 4 Extra .
At a recent press conference , Gaiman was asked what he gained through taking his story to radio rather than to the big screen .
His answer was "" an infinite budget "" , which seems about right .
The original story is good , and Dirk Maggs 's adaptation is excellent , but in the end it 's the quality of the characterisation that brings home the bacon .
Regardless of whether your taste normally runs to fantasy fiction , Neverwhere is a reminder of what an extraordinary arsenal of acting talent we have in this country .
James McAvoy is Richard , the perplexed hero , who finds himself separated from his old life by the arrival of distressed damsel Door ( Natalie Dormer ) , harried by the murderous duo Croup ( Anthony Head ) and Vandemar ( David Schofield ) , and thrown into the company of the Marquis ( David Harewood ) , who takes him to London 's highest point to meet Old Bailey ( Bernard Cribbins ) .
Also in the cast are Benedict Cumberbatch as The Angel Islington (
the sound of his unfurling wings is provided by two anoraks being shaken , apparently ) , Christopher Lee as the Earl of Earl 's Court , and Johnny Vegas as Lord Ratspeaker .
Maggs , who adapts and produces Ã¢â¬ â as he has previously on The Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy Ã¢â¬ â deploys voices , sound and music brilliantly to conjure the feeling of rain , the smell of tarmacadam , the gusting grit from a Tube tunnel and the lurching terror you feel when the lift door opens and you 're suddenly in a very high place .
But what makes it worth listening to more than once is the way he also gets nuggets of comedy from the manners of the characters ' non - fantasy lives .
When Door gives James a chaste peck on the cheek you hear his unscripted appreciation .
You can almost see him blush ."
2013-03-17,"On the one hand , a vast , career - spanning exhibition about David Bowie , with unprecedented access to the artist 's own archive , is a no - brainer .
It 's hard to think of a more visually arresting artist whose work touches on as many areas of the arts : no wonder it 's the fastest - selling event in the Victoria and Albert Museum 's history .
On the other , David Bowie Is sets itself a tough task .
It 's hard to imagine anyone does n't already know Bowie 's story : as you read this , there are hitherto uncontacted tribesmen in the Mato Grosso greeting explorers with a rough precis of what happened to him in the 1970s ( "" we hear he flew on a big silver bird to Berlin , the better to escape the cocaine addiction that plagued him during the making of Station
To Station "" ) .
Unless it 's content to retell a very hackneyed story indeed , David Bowie Is has to find a way of casting new light on some of the most over - analysed and discussed music in rock history .
Perhaps understandably , it 's more interested in setting Bowie in a wider artistic context than it is in delivering a definitive career summary .
Virtually the first thing you see is film not of Bowie , but of Gilbert and George , who worked out that you could cover yourself in makeup and become a piece of art while Bowie was still gamely pretending to be a hippy : which , as a subsequent room dedicated to his 1960s work demonstrates , was not something he was terribly good at .
Destined to find fame playing the role of a musical demagogue and to spend the 70s as the figurehead of a cult , he was not a man cut out for flower - power egalitarianism , no matter how hard he tried .
His photostated proposal for an Arts Lab in Beckenham attempts to embrace the spirit of the times , but ends up sounding a bit creepy : "" A secondary objective of this proposal is that through communication with local children we should be able to communicate ideas to the parents "" .
Occasionally , the contextualisation feels a little speculative Ã¢â¬ â you could argue long into the night about whether Bowie 's career - making 1972 performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops has much to do with JG Ballard 's concept of Inner Space Ã¢â¬ â
but it 's never less than thought - provoking ,
And besides , Bowie 's archive is so extensive Ã¢â¬ â
he appears to have kept everything Ã¢â¬ â that even when the exhibition is covering well - trodden ground , it manages to dig up stuff that 's fresh and illuminating .
A scrawled early synopsis of the "" Ziggy thing "" reveals that , at that stage , the prospective song titles for Bowie 's most famous album included Out - Hipping Them
At Zipps ' , Death In Mad Sound , and the thought - provoking Bum .
A Thierry Mugler outfit from 1997 suggests that he was dabbling in androgyny decades after he was presumed to have recanted his earlier professions of bisexuality , albeit so subtly you 'd barely notice : Mugler 's suit is straightforward and beautifully cut , the shirt comes with a collar pin , but the shoes that accompany them have kitten heels .
A page of what appears to be Bowie 's own journal , from January 1975 , offers a tantalising glimpse of the day - to - day life that Bowie has spent four decades successfully shielding from public view , or would if it made any sense : as it is , it 's hard to work out if the fractured prose bears testament to Bowie 's use of the cut - up technique he borrowed from William Burroughs or just the vast amounts of drugs he was taking at the time .
Sometimes it 's the prosaic details that are striking : the plaintive note Bowie attached to a sketch of a 1979 costume so elaborate he had to be carried on stage in it , asking the designer to try to make "" access in and out of it easy "" ; the tour itinerary showing that , mere days before he was triumphantly killed off on stage in front of DA Pennebaker 's cameras and a star - studded audience , Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars were touching down in the decidedly uncosmic environs of Bridlington Spa Rooms and Torquay Town Hall .
Sometimes , for all the explication and context , you just gawp at the sheer ferocity with which his talent burnt at its height .
The painstakingly meticulous handwritten directions for the lighting of his 1976 Station
To Station tour speak very loudly about the iron grip Bowie maintained over every aspect of his work .
There are more ideas crammed on to the A4 sheet that contains an early draft of the lyrics to 1980 's Because You 're Young than most artists have in their entire careers .
Those looking for gaps in the story will note that it treads very gingerly around the 80s , a decade in which Bowie appeared to lose interest in music , but , alas , failed to see that as a reason to stop making records .
That said , you get the occasional hint of the rot setting in .
Placed next to the iconic black waistcoat and dress shirt from the Station
To Station tour , a beige military suit from 1983 's Serious Moonlight tour looks like something you 'd wear if you were appearing as Buttons at the Bradford Alhambra .
Money - spinning showbiz has overtaken cutting - edge artistry .
You could argue that Bowie has spent the rest of his career struggling to redress the balance , with varied results : the quality of his comeback album
The Next Day suggests he might be capable of scripting a pretty triumphant final act .
The curators found out about The Next Day 's existence at the same time as the rest of us , which actually works much in the exhibition 's favour : it 's mentioned only in passing , which means you never get the sense of an event that exists to puff a new album .
But David Bowie Is ends in triumph anyway .
The floor - to - ceiling screens showing live footage are genuinely awe - inspiring , a final room collects together umpteen examples of how his influence has leaked not just into music but everyday life : fashion , packaging , video game design , advertising .
As it turned out , the plan about communicating ideas that Bowie outlined in the Beckenham Arts Lab proposal seems to have worked out perfectly .
David Bowie is is at the V&amp;A in London until 11 August ."
2013-03-18,"David Bowie 's first album in a decade has become the fastest selling of the year , hitting No 1 in its first week of release .
The Next Day is the singer 's first
No 1 since 1993 's Black Tie White Noise .
The album sold 94,000 copies this week , according to the Official Chart Company , outselling the number two album from Bon Jovi two to one .
The announcement of The Next Day took the world by surprise in January , when Bowie released the single Where Are We Now ? and broke the news that he had also recorded a full album .
Those involved in its making had been sworn to secrecy .
Writing of the record in the Observer , Kitty Empire said "" if it is the mark of a satisfying album that you want to absorb every last note and reference , then The Next Day is a banquet "" .
The album 's appearance coincides with the start of David Bowie is at the V&amp;A museum in London , a retrospective of the 66-year old 's career and influence .
Critic Alexis Petridis said that "" even when the exhibition is covering well - trodden ground , it manages to dig up stuff that 's fresh and illuminating "" .
Bowie 's wife Iman also hinted last week that the singer may , contrary to denials , soon head out on tour .
The Next Day 's first week sales beat that of the previous fastest - selling UK album in 2013 , Biffy Clyro 's Opposites which sold 71,600 in its first week on sale in January .
As well as
Where Are We Now ?
it has also yielded the single The Stars ( Are Out Tonight ) ."
2013-03-19,"From hippie singer / songwriter , Ziggy Stardust , the ' plastic soul ' phase , experimental electronic albums to 1980s global megastar , David Bowie 's radical changes in musical style and image have been his stock in trade for decades .
On top of this , he has confounded critics and fans alike by taking on serious acting roles ( with even a few good notices ) , becoming an internet pioneer , venturing onto Wall Street with his Bowie bonds and dabbling in the art world .
A new ebook
Bowie :
A life reviewed tells that ever - changing David Bowie story as reported by the Guardian and the Observer .
Starting with his elevation to pop stardom via 1969 's Space Oddity it covers most of the classic albums and tours through contemporaneous reviews , interviews and features , coming right up to date with the release of The Next Day .
After the success of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars , by 1972 Bowie was at the forefront of the British glam rock scene , as the Guardian 's Martin Walker reported in September 1972 : Not surprisingly , many of the earlier Bowie articles were more about his image - the clothes , hair , sexuality , and his fans - rather than the actual music .
However , from Low ( 1977 ) onwards , the actual sounds on the records began to be discussed , as illustrated by the following Observer review of "" Heroes "" from 1978 .

2013-03-21,"Having spent the last month on the other side of the world ( Australia , since you ask ) , I 've only just succumbed to the current Bowie mania .
But as a worshipper from the Hunky Dory era , I was fascinated by Jon Savage 's account of a conversation the thin white duke had with William Burroughs in Rolling Stone magazine in 1974 .
Savage concentrated on the musical synergies Ã¢â¬ â particularly the cut - up technique that Bowie picked up from Burroughs ' work which , he explains , "" would enable Bowie to renew his entire method of writing lyrics and making music "" .
But after tracking down the original interview , I was struck by the following exchange : Burroughs :
What is your inspiration for writing , is it literary ?
Bowie :
I do n't think so .
Burroughs :
Well , I read this "" Eight line poem "" of yours and it is very reminiscent of TS Eliot .
Bowie :
Never read him .
Burroughs : ( Laughs )
It is very reminiscent of "" The Waste Land "" .
Do you get any of your ideas from dreams ?
Bowie : Frequently .
There follows a long disquisition on Burroughs ' dream life , which is of less interest 40 years on than the eight - line poem he mentions Ã¢â¬ â
so I went in search of it and ,
of course , there it is in all its Eliot - esque glory , piercing straight through to my old vinyl memories of Hunky Dory :
Tactful cactus by your window Surveys the prairie of your room Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They 've opened shops down west side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
So here 's a question .
Was Bowie fibbing when he claimed never to have read "" The Waste Land "" Ã¢â¬ â or did he steal his tactful cactus from Eliot 's "" The Hollow Men "" :
This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images Are raised , here they receive The supplication of a dead man 's hand Under the twinkle of a fading star ?
Bowie acknowledged his debt to Burroughs ' own work Ã¢â¬ â in particular his novel The Wild Boys Ã¢â¬ â but what other literary influences , conscious or not , can be found in his music ?"

2013-03-22,"The exhibition David Bowie Is opens at the V&amp;A museum in London on Saturday .
At its launch on Wednesday , Tilda Swinton gave a speech , in the absence of Bowie himself .
The actor recently appeared in the video to the singer 's latest single The Stars ( Are Out Tonight ) .
The exhibition features 300 Bowie - related artefacts , including photographs , film , set designs , handwritten lyrics and 60 stage costumes .
Swinton 's speech Ã¢â¬ â via the V&amp;A 's website
Ã¢â¬ â was as follows :
Dear Dave
When I asked you if you wanted me to say anything here tonight , you said : "" Only three words , one of them testicular Ã¢â¬ Â¦ "" So I 'll pass that on .
Here I am at surely the most eclectic of all the London branches of Bowie Anonymous .
All the nicest possible freaks are here .
We 're in the Victoria and Albert museum preparing to rifle through your drawers .
It 's truly an amazing thing .
This was my favourite playground as a child .
Medieval armour : my fantasy space wear .
And , alongside , when I was 12 Ã¢â¬ â and a square sort of kid in a Round Pond sort of childhood , not far from here Ã¢â¬ â
I carried a copy of Aladdin Sane around with me
Ã¢â¬ â
a full two years before I had the wherewithal to play it .
The image of that gingery boney pinky whitey person on the cover with the liquid mercury collar bone was Ã¢â¬ â for one particular young moonage daydreamer Ã¢â¬ â the image of planetary kin , of a close imaginary cousin and companion of choice .
It 's taken me a long time to admit , even to myself , let alone you , that it was the vision and not yet the sound that hooked me up Ã¢â¬
â
but if i ca n't confess that here and now , then when and where ?
We all have our own roots Ã¢â¬ â and routes Ã¢â¬ â to this room .
Some of us Ã¢â¬ â the enviable Ã¢â¬
â found the fellowship early in the funfests of Billy 's Bowie Nights or equivalent lodges from San Francisco to Aukland to Heidelberg and all points in between .
For others , it was a more lonesome affair , paced out in a sort of private morse code like following bread crumbs through a forest .
I 'm not saying that if you had n't pitched up I would have worn a pie crust collar and pearls like some of those I went to school with .
I 'm not saying that if you had n't weighed in , Princess Julia would have been less inventive with the pink blusher .
Simply that , you provided the sideways like us with such rare and out - there company .
Such fellowship .
You pulled us in and left your arm dangling over our necks .
And kept us warm Ã¢â¬ â as you have for , is n't it ?
Ã¢â¬
â centuries now .
You were Ã¢â¬
Â¦ you are Ã¢â¬ Â¦ one of us .
And you have remained the reliable mortal in among all the immortal shapes you have thrown .
Nothing more certain than changes .
Always with a weather eye out .
Always awake and clocking the fallout
Those Mayans must have known something when they set their calendar down before January 2013 .
Because , of course , now all bets are off .
I know , because you told me , how tickled you were to knock Elvis Ã¢â¬ â for once !
Ã¢â¬ â out of the headlines on your shared birthday this year .
There 's so much for all of us to be happy about since then .
Yet , I think the thing I 'm loving the most about the last few weeks is how clear it now is Ã¢â¬ â
how undeniable Ã¢â¬ â that the freak becomes the great unifier .
The alien is the best company after all for so many more than the few .
They wanted a Bowie fan to speak tonight .
They could have thrown a paper napkin and hit a hundred .
I 'm the lucky one , standing up to speak for all my fellow freaks anxious to win the pub quiz and claim their No 1 most super - fan T - shirt .
I want to give thanks to the Victoria and Albert museum for indulging us so .
For laying on our dream show .
For showing us Ã¢â¬ â look at their advance ticket sales Ã¢â¬ â that , as is written along the bottom of this month 's Q magazine , "" why we all live in David 's world now "" .
To Gucci and Sennheiser for putting up the cash , laying on the sound and vision .
To Geoffrey and Victoria for curating an entire universe so beautifully , on behalf of us all .
When I think of what it used to feel like once : to be a freak who liked you ; to feel like a freak like you
Ã¢â¬ â a freak who even looked a little like you Ã¢â¬
Â¦
And then I think of the countless people of every size and feather who are going to walk through this trace of your journey here and pick up the breadcrumbs in the great hub of this mothership over these spring and summer months Ã¢â¬
Â¦
And how familiar and stamped you are into ALL of our our collective DNA
Ã¢â¬

Listen here Phoenix 's new single Entertainment â the first to be taken from their forthcoming album , Bankrupt !
â gallops out of the traps via a ludicrous synth riff that 's part 80s children 's TV theme and part David Bowie 's China Girl after too many coffees .
It 's the sort of song that sounds so chipper on first listen that it must be masking a deep sadness , and that seems to be the case as singer Thomas Mars concludes the chorus with a surly sigh of "" Oh , I 'd rather be alone "" .
Even the children 's choir that arrives around the three - minute mark is just there to facilitate the gloom .
For his remix â premiered here and available as a free download from the player above â producer Dev Hynes , AKA Blood Orange , slows the tempo , adds a meandering funk bassline and some echoey , downbeat drum claps and lets the inherent sadness slowly bubble to the surface .
While the original careens around chasing that synth riff , Hynes 's version shuffles the chorus to the beginning and replaces Mars 's soft voice with the incredible harmonies of a certain Mutya Keisha Siobhan , who have recently been working with Hynes on their anticipated sort - of debut album
( they 're the original Sugababes , obviously ) .
"" I wanted to showcase how melodically brilliant the song was , "" Dev told the Guardian .
"" I was in the studio with MKS while I was working on the remix and their vocals along with Thomas 's is like a dream to me . ""
There 's an amazing moment around the 90-second mark when the music drops out to leave a ticking beat underpinning the chorus as it glides in for the second time , and as MKS croon "" I 'd rather be alone "" , Hynes unleashes a completely OTT guitar solo that pierces the thick smoke like a laser .

Bankrupt ! is due on 22 April via Loyaute / Glassnote / Atlantic Records ."
2013-04-09,"It 's the modern festival experience : Ben Watt from Everything
But the Girl giving a talk on a book he 's written about his parents , following Paul Morley speaking on David Bowie , above a pub in Aldgate East .
Increasingly , rock music is a literary pursuit
Ã¢â¬ â
these kind of salons are popping up all over the place as the industry tries to get its legacy in perspective , but the Irish festival Other Voices has been holding "" banter "" sessions for years (
past subjects have varied from discussions on masculinity to lessons in how to grow your own vegetables ) .
Last weekend , Other Voices made its London debut at Wilton 's Music Hall , in partnership with the Barbican .
In essence the festival is an intimate live TV broadcast for the Irish channel RTE , with seats offered to the public through a lucky draw .
There are tight , 45-minute sets from a dozen acts from Laura Mvula to Laura Marling , John Grant to Matthew E White .
There 's an unspoken no - old - stuff policy , and an invitation to use the slot as a testing ground for new material .
Imelda May reads lyrics scribbled on foolscap paper in the back of her cab from Kentish Town , and Derry - born , 16-year - old SOAK has a song so new it 's just called New Song .
The venue , nestling in the shadow of a tower block next to a Victorian school for seamen 's children , is the oldest surviving music hall in Europe , and the Barbican has been putting on shows here for a few years now .
The stage is cast in a soupy vert - de - gris glow , and amid the peeling paintwork there are frescoes of ladies playing exotic flutes and sitars , recalling the days of the East India Company and the 19th - century gentlemen Ã¢â¬ â the Pips and Dorian Grays Ã¢â¬ â who came here to indulge their darker sides .
In short , Wilton 's Music Hall has seen stranger things than Kevin Rowland , and the colourful grotesquerie of Dexys and their latest album , One Day I 'm Going to Soar , suits this space on Saturday evening : there he is , in a clinch with his leading girl ( the actress Madeleine Hyland ) , part dirty uncle , part Dirk Bogarde in Death in Venice .
The band 's vintage aesthetic has settled on baggy pants and Hawaiian shirts of late : there are costume changes
Ã¢â¬ â someone will disappear and make a grand entrance in a different flat cap Ã¢â¬
â which , together with all the melodrama , makes for a pleasingly am - dram experience ( "" Kevin
, do n't talk to me , I do n't even want to see you ! "" ) .
You 're so close to the musicians in this venue , you can see how hard they 're working , her mascara streaked with tears , him trembling on one knee .
Geno is pulled from its classic , swaggering pace and worked up into a kind of Cuban rumba .
Generally , Other Voices does n't have much time for old songs .
"" Everyone 's a musician now , "" says someone in the pub , "" just as everyone 's a photographer and a writer Ã¢â¬ â but ultimately the cream continues to rise to the top .
"" SOAK ( she once said her name came from "" a mixture of soul and folk "" ) is the latest in a long line of acts to sign a major record deal since her first appearance at the festival .
Villagers ' loyalty to the "" brand "" is obvious when Conor O'Brien turns up for a solo set , adapting the lavish arrangements of their latest album , Awayland , for his tiny acoustic guitar in a state of trance - like , almost meditative concentration .
His songs bob along on a stream of abstract thought , untethered by clear verse - chorus structures , and he chews over his words like an Irish Alex Turner Ã¢â¬ â
another young writer made older somehow by the power of wit .
It 's heartening to see how quickly someone can go from newcomer to "" conquering hero "" on the strength of one album , and Saturday night really belongs to John Grant , whose Queen of Denmark was the "" cream "" of 2010 , a debut so memorable that , unusually , the public really cared what he did next .
Grant , who used to work as an interpreter and collects languages the way old ladies collect walking - stick badges , recorded his follow - up , Pale Green Ghosts , in Iceland and got himself a new band there
Ã¢â¬ â all of whom look a little bit like him , and make a burly team of men singing in harmony about his past loves .
He 's one of the great rock'n'roll personalities of recent years :
needy , confessional , sardonic , lovable Ã¢â¬ â his voice
wraps you up in a warm golden fleece and rolls you in space dust .
But this close - up performance reminds you what a careful musician Grant is , and how much of his humour is rooted in that strange precision Ã¢â¬ â in his habit of compressing long thoughts into tight tunes , or seating himself regally at his synth and playing just five or six notes that ring out like the theme from a cosmic scene in a 70s Bond movie .
His band attack the vast bank of nobs and effects pedals as if it were an orchestra , and Wilton 's turns into a cavernous sound lab where everything digital seems to be living and breathing .
There are flashes of exotic life Ã¢â¬ â a hippie commune in Richmond , Virginia , to be exact Ã¢â¬ â with Matthew E White 's headline set on Sunday night .
Introduced by the actor Aidan Gillen as "" big , groovy , loose , sexy , spacey "" , White deals in a kind of lush , psychedelic soul - rock that is so brimming with pleasure
Ã¢â¬ â so utterly "" switched on "" Ã¢â¬ â
it 's only mildly irritating you ca n't hear a word he 's saying because his drummer is too loud .
This is their debut television performance and they seem to be on another planet
Ã¢â¬ â watching them sashaying , grooving , grinning , you just want to be in that band .
It makes you wonder about Paul Morley 's prediction , back in the pub , that the rock music of the future will be something utterly unrecognisable , bizarre , something we simply ca n't imagine yet .
The best acts at Other Voices are proof that to make music sound new , you only need to play as though it 's never been done before ."
2013-04-25,"Another week , another David Bowie exhibition .
BOWIEVIRUS by photographer David Sims has just opened at the ICA in London , meaning that the man behind Ziggy is currently dominating the capital 's art scene , what with the Bowie blockbuster at the V&amp;A.
All this and a new album too .
That 's enough now , please .
Ashes to ashes , let it rest .
I have tried to enter into the spirit of the Bowie revival that is overwhelming museums , galleries and the wider world , but I just ca n't .
I loved Bowie when I was 15 .
He was having a comeback then , too , with Scary Monsters showing the New Romantic kids how it should be done .
But I can not revive the flame .
Recently I was bereaved , and in the black days between a death and a funeral I listened to a lot of music .
It was the best thing .
The music that moved and nourished me was eclectic , and good taste could go to hell .
It included Bach and Bruce Springsteen , ranged from keening Irish pipes to Nirvana , from To Live is to Fly by Townes Van Zandt to Spem in Alium by Thomas Tallis .
The music I needed was music with soul .
But one thing did not work at all .
Given that Bowie 's V&amp;A show and return to the studio were all over the news , and I had spent so many teenage hours listening to him , I played some Bowie .
But across the golden years , not a single song spoke to my inner being .
Bowie , when I needed him , sounded as brittle as broken glass .
Heroes , maybe ?
But then , what is it even about ?
The ICA is never likely to stage a Bruce Springsteen exhibition Ã¢â¬ â way too uncool Ã¢â¬ â
but there is more poetry and truth in Springsteen 's Racing in the Street than in everything Bowie has ever recorded .
Great music , pop or classical , is universal Ã¢â¬ â but Bowie is all about Bowie .
His art is a dressing - up game , fun but a bit silly .
Lou Reed 's Heroin is a punch in the face , a terrifying message in a bottle ; listen to that next to Bowie at his best and you will see what I mean .
I feel plenty of nostalgia when I listen to Bowie Ã¢â¬
â
but it cloys quickly , this old masquerade ."
2013-04-26,"David Bowie has n't been treading the interview circuit to promote his new album
The Next Day .
But he has broken his silence about it , albeit in the most cryptic way .
The novelist and sometime Guardian writer Rick Moody asked Bowie to supply a "" work - flow diagram "" for a piece for the Rumpus Ã¢â¬ â "" because I wanted to think about it in light of what he was thinking about it , I wanted to understand the lexicon of The Next Day "" .
And Bowie obliged .
Moody wrote that Bowie 's list of words was "" really excellent , and exactly in the spirit of this album , and the list is far better than I could ever have hoped , and it 's exactly like Bowie , at least in my understanding of him : impulsive , intuitive , haunted , astringent and incredibly ambitious in the matter of the arts .
Bowie is a conceptual artist , it seems to me , who just happens to work in the popular song , and he wants to make work that goes somewhere new , and this is amply demonstrated by the list . ""
And , without further ado , here is the list : Effigies Indulgences Anarchist Violence Chthonic Intimidation Vampyric Pantheon Succubus Hostage Transference Identity Mauer Interface Flitting Isolation Revenge Osmosis Crusade Tyrant Domination Indifference
Miasma Pressgang Displaced Flight Resettlement Funereal Glide Trace Balkan Burial Reverse Manipulate Origin Text Traitor Urban Comeuppance Tragic Nerve Mystification
That clears everything up , then .
Unless it does n't ."
2013-05-05,"If you 've been enjoying David Bowie 's comeback ( and who has n't ? ) , then you 'll relish Simon Goddard 's offbeat paean of man - love to his earlier incarnation .
Goddard offers a thrillingly unusual slant on how Ziggy Stardust , the bisexual Tintin - quiffed space saviour who 's still probably
Bowie 's most famous persona , came into being , writing his time- and globe - spanning epic with a theatrical relish that does its subject 's most baroque moments credit .
Unlike his earlier books about Morrissey and the Smiths , Mozipedia and Songs
That Saved Your Life , Goddard eschews in - depth technical detail about the writing , recording and performance of the songs that made up the albums in the heyday of Ziggy and his backing band , the Spiders from Mars .
Instead , what the book offers is an ambitious and in - depth social history of how Ziggy came to be , and how his success began to destroy him .
After some sweeping opening chapters offering potted biographies of the likes of Elvis , HG Wells and Beethoven , who would all be influences on the character in some form , Goddard shows how the "" slightly camp "" music - loving schoolboy David Jones was transformed first into the talented but initially underachieving singer - songwriter David Bowie , seething in the shadow of Marc Bolan , and then into the messianic rock god Ziggy .
His central thesis , that Bowie "" became "" Ziggy in the same way that a method actor might become their character and had to symbolically kill him to escape him , is n't as wildly original as he seems to think , but it 's still written with appealingly vivid , if sometimes melodramatic , panache .
His narrative device of reaching inside Bowie / Ziggy 's head for imagined insight is startling at first in its audacity , but as the book builds to a surprisingly affecting conclusion , he succeeds in making a story many have heard before seem fresh and exciting ."
2013-05-07,
2013-05-07,"Truth be told , outside friends and family , David Bowie has been the most important person in my life .
I 'd put forward a case for him being one of the most important artists of the 20th century
but then I 'm a Bowie freak , so I would .
And skipping along to the White Cloth Gallery for an exhibition of Brian Duffy 's Bowie photographs , I was as giddy as a penguin in a water park .
Duffy , who died in 2010 , is known for his fashion and advertising photography of the 50s , 60s and 70s and his work with David Bowie on the albums Aladdin Sane , Lodger and Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) .
Along with David Bailey and Terence Donovan , Duffy was part of the ' Terrible Trio ' seen as defining and capturing the London of the ' Swinging Sixties ' , moving models from studios and elevating successful photographers to celebrity status .
Cntrl - click here to open gallery in a new window
So let 's look at these photos chronologically .
There 's a series of twelve , back - lit , slow exposure Ziggy Stardust pics , Ã¢â¬ â stunning but almost standard fare for that well - chronicled period , although the big prints throughout the exhibition add a new depth to everything .
The main event has to be the Aladdin Sane photos . '
The Mona Lisa of album covers ' is obviously a subjective statement , but Aladdin Sane is certainly one of the great , iconic covers .
When I first saw the eyes open version it was so shocking that I imagined it 'd been Photoshopped , which it clearly had n't .
The negative version of the cover is the pearl of the exhibition ; its black and white translucence could be seen as more in keeping with the album Ziggy Goes to America , written during his 1972 US tour .
The lightning bolt on the front cover is said to represent schizophrenia or a duality of the mind .
Bowie saw America as both dangerous and exciting and has also said that "" the lad insane "" was inspired by his older half - brother who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic .
The Aladdin Sane contact sheet takes the breath away .
I 'd ridiculously imagined there was only one pic and if there were a series they 'd all be eyes shut .
All the others with eyes open and at different head angles almost manage to de - mystify this classic cover .
Three pictures of ' the Spiders ' simply emphasise how photogenic Bowie was .
It 's good to see Mick Ronson and , 20 years after his death , it brought to mind how musically crucial to early 1970s
Bowie ( and related projects )
Ronno was ; his solo album Slaughter on 10th Avenue is a masterpiece of that Ronno / Bowie period .
The four Thin White Duke photos ( 1976 ) are stunning and stand out as the only none - studio based images and capture David at his coolest .
Of the two ' behind the scenes ' Lodger pictures , the dressing room one stood out as unusual Ã¢â¬ â Bowie as a normal bloke Ã¢â¬ â as did the single Man Who Fell To Earth
image Ã¢â¬ Â¦ almost .
The Lodger cover was blurred Polaroid and possibly the most startling image of the whole exhibition is the clear Kodachrome version showing the shockingly distorted face , broken nose and all .
The other most heavily featured album is Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , which saw Bowie usher in the New Romantics and return to full , theatrical make - up for the first time since Aladdin Sane&gt;. The series of six pictures , in preparation for the shoot , are lovely insights into how much skill and patience went into the final images .
There 's a never - before - seen contact sheet from the album shoot which reminded me of a B / W , unscribbled on version of the four sets of stamps given away inside the single Ashes to Ashes .
One of Bowie 's gifts was carefully selecting who he worked with Ã¢â¬ â that Bowie asked Duffy speaks volumes for him as a photographer and artist .
It 's quite a coup for a relatively small Leeds gallery to get some previously unseen pictures of Mr Bowie .
The current exhibition at the V&amp;A is a sell - out , with pre - ordered ticket sales more than double any other exhibition the museum has curated .
White Cloth Gallery is a two minute walk from Leeds train station Ã¢â¬ â one minute if you skip .
I 'd make that trip and witness a stunning slice of rock'n'roll history .
The exhibition runs until 15 July .

There 's no shortage of symbolism in the new Bowie clip , then .
But what does it all mean ?
Amateur Bowieologists Ã¢â¬ â let us know your interpretations .
Is it deep , or just racy ?"
2013-05-08,""" Rebel rebel , you 've torn your dress , "" observed David Bowie in 1974 , setting the bar rather low for aspiring nonconformists .
Under the jurisdiction of the Thin White Duke , anyone old enough to snag their Sunday best while shinning up a tree could be declared a rebel , although for many of us the whim to sin came hand in hand with puberty .
Becoming a teenager carried with it an unspoken order to pass on school , collect 20 Marlboro Lights , and proceed to the playing field to master the art of inhaling without coughing up a lung and being tarnished with the original sin of being uncool .
Of course , this rite of passage often resulted in being hoiked to the deputy head 's office for much mea culpa - ing in response to the empty threat of a letter home , but that was all part of it .
You were successfully fighting the system , one badly smoked fag at a time .
It may come as a disappointment to teens everywhere , then , that the electronic cigarette is gradually being banned in secondary schools , although primary school kids , it would seem , may puff on in all their faux - fag glory .
You 'll have seen e - cigs being smoked inside before , especially at darkened gigs , where they light up eerily like glowsticks , their uncoolness acting as a handy warning signal that an idiot is nearby .
Could it be that teenagers are actually becoming less rebellious ?
I certainly would never have been caught dead with an e - cig .
Head teachers are calling the liquid - nicotine vaporisers a "" gateway drug "" , but if the youth of today are depending on toy cigarettes to get their rebellion fix , the kids are not all right .
Rebelling by dabbling in drink , fags , sex â the list goes on â is part of growing up .
Based on the people I used to drink Cointreau with in the school dinner queue ( when raiding your parents ' drinks cabinet , always go for the least - touched spirit ) we all turned out all right , and without any crippling addictions .
In fact , our daily diet of pre - Jamie Oliver chips and gravy probably did us more damage than the hesitant sips of booze concealed in Sprite bottles .
I 'm not advocating that parents start offering around after - dinner cigars or begin brandishing condoms at their offspring when they bring someone of the opposite sex round for an awkward evening of watching TV from opposite ends of the sofa ( though subtly placing them in the bathroom cabinet is fine ) .
The whole point of the average rebellion is that it is n't policed by parents , and although the Facebook generation could end up being haunted by images of their first dalliances with weed well into their 50s , at the time the sweet nectar of rebellion tastes so good because your superiors are , for the most part , completely oblivious .
Of course , there will be the thrill of occasional detentions and the embarrassment of realising that your parents are fully aware that your stomach bug is , in fact , a hangover , but the sneaking and hiding and longing are all part of the rebellion itself .
As a teenager I smoked ( badly , occasionally ; I do n't any more )
I drank ( often , because there was n't much else to do in my snoozefest of a Midlands village ) and did a lot of other naughty things that caused me a lot of grief in the short term and nothing but amusing memories in the long term .
I regret nothing , because at the time it was all stuff I needed to do to get it out of my system .
Addictions are not something to trivialise , but the majority of bright young things will emerge from the chrysalis of their teenage years a whole lot wiser , smarter and freer than they were before , with no desire to revisit the era of experimentation .
And those who are n't able to trip the light fantastic thanks to a fake ID , sample booze purchased by someone 's older brother or sneak out the house after dark will have to do all this in their 20s and , believe me , coughing up a lung after one toke of your boss 's cigarette is not a good look at the office Christmas party ."
2013-05-10,"We 're starting with a dead funny clip this week

2013-05-17,"David Bowie has won frenzied acclaim for the videos from his new album
The Next Day , but it 's a cover version of one of his songs that has caused an online buzz this week .
Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield recorded a version of Space Oddity on board the International Space Station , and it turned the spaceman Ã¢â¬ â already well known to Twitter and Facebook users Ã¢â¬ â into a YouTube sensation .
Even Bowie retweeted it , and posted linked to it from his official Facebook page , where it says Hadfield 's cover is "" possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created "" .
Ironically , given the costs of getting Hadfield into space , it 's probably also the most expensive Bowie vireo ever created .
In case you had n't noticed , a certain French dance act have a new album out next week .
The promotional push behind Daft Punk 's Random Access Memories has been relentless , but one strand that stands out is the "" unboxing "" video released this week .
Simultaneously futuristic in its Blade Runner - esque visuals and nostalgic in its retro vinyl appeal , it conveys all the anticipation of opening a gatefold LP for the first time .

Finally , among a slew of big - budget videos , Jonny Lawrence 's hand - drawn animation Maker vs Marker really stands out .
Featuring an epic stop - motion battle between a character and the animator 's hand , it draws on references to the likes of Street Fighter , Transformers , The Matrix and Godzilla .

Ã¢â¬ â was described by journalist Mick Wall as a "" gay alien from outer space "" , but it was n't just the singer who looked and seemed extraordinary .
Guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer Mick "" Woody
"" Woodmansey were visions of platinum blonde and satin ; bassist Trevor Bolder had outsize silver sideburns .
As someone who watched it as an eight - year - old in Leeds , I can vividly remember straight - faced discussions in the playground over whether this strange creature that landed on our screens was an extra - terrestrial .
Back in those innocent pre - internet days , few of us could have guessed that the "" Starman "" was actually born David Jones in Brixton , or that the Spiders from Mars were actually from Hull .
In fact , the Bowie legend 's unlikely roots in East Yorkshire go even deeper than Bolder , Woodmansey and former gravedigger Ronson 's pivotal roles on many of Bowie 's classic early 1970s albums , up to and including Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane .
Late-60s / early-70s drummer John Cambridge still lives in Beverley and John "" Hutch "" Hutchinson , also from Hull , played with Bowie from 1969 to 1973 , and on an early version of Space Oddity .
Not that you 'd know any of this from visiting the Hull area today , where you do n't hear Moonage Daydream blasting out over Hull City 's ground or find statues of the Spiders next to the one of Philip Larkin .
Instead , their only visible legacy is a ghastly , unloved old stage in Hull 's Queen 's Gardens , rather embarrassingly signposted the "" Mick Ronson Memorial "" .
Earlier this year , when I tracked down various undersung characters from Bowie 's past , Woody Woodmansey talked me through the unlikely process of how musicians from an isolated East Riding fishing port became Spiders from Mars .
Woodmansey , Cambridge , Bolder and Ronson played in the Rats , Hull 's top band of the late 60s , before Cambridge played with Bowie in the London - based Hype and returned to recruit Ronno , who subsequently recommended the others for the Spiders .
When Woodmansey met Bowie , it was a "" culture shock .
He had on bright red trousers , red shoes with blue stars on them , a rainbow T - shirt you needed sunglasses to look at and bangles .
Even the girls in Hull did n't wear many bracelets .
I was thinking : ' Are we on the same planet ? '
But he was 24/7 , a rock star already .
We 'd never met people who wanted to do it as much as we did and knew how to do it . ""
Reading on mobile ?
Watch here
Bowie opened the Rats - turned - Spiders to culture , even the ballet . ""
But to watch the lights , not the performance , "" explained Woody .
"" In those days rock lighting was red and green .
He 'd say : ' Watch how they use the lighting at the ballet to create atmosphere on stage . '
People in pop did n't do that then . ""
Ironically , given how images of a glammed - up Bowie and Ronson have become some of the most iconic in pop , Ronno needed most convincing to don the platinum hair dye and androgynous , space - age costumes . ""
He packed his suitcase and went to the station .
He said : ' I 'm a musician .
I 've got friends .
I do n't want them seeing me like that . '
But we coaxed him back .
Eventually we all realised you could n't sing about a Starman who 'd fallen to earth if you were wearing ripped jeans . ""
As Woodmansey tells it , the roots of that famous Starman performance were honed in tiny pubs , where Bowie benefited from his bandmates ' superb musicianship , born of years of playing in East Riding pubs and clubs and in lost bands such as the Crestas and the Mariners .
"" It was effectively the same show as the Ziggy Stardust tour .
It felt strange doing it pubs .
Dangerous .
When we started , they were throwing things onstage .
The girls started to go for it and the guys did n't like that . ""
Then suddenly , that Top Of The Pops changed everything .
Woodmansey remembers the 1970s as a time of "" garbage on the streets and the three - day week .
Then along came Starman and took people out of the gloom .
"" I 'd have loved to speak to Trevor Bolder about those times too , and about his ferociously groovy bass playing , whicht took the likes of The Jean Genie and John , I 'm Only Dancing to another level , but a scheduled interview in January was cancelled because he needed an operation and his tragic death yesterday sadly leaves Woody Woodmansey as the last surviving Spider .
When the sad news of Bolder 's death broke last night , I found myself remembering the silver sideburns and impact he and his pals had on mine and other generations , watching that Top of the Pops in 1972 .
Somehow , the discovery that Bowie 's most famous backing band were n't from outer space but were ordinary northern working - class blokes with Yorkshire accents did n't break the spell but strengthened it .
When three mates and I subsequently trudged into Toni 's barber shop on Town Street in Horsforth and asked the hatchet - faced demon barber for "" a Bow - eh "" , it was because the Spiders from Mars had taught us that the mundane could be transformed into the magical .
Indeed , that pop heaven came from Hull .
Recently , Spandau Ballet 's Steve Norman and Gary Kemp and Def Leppard 's Joe Elliott have been among musicians leading the cry for a proper memorial to Mick Ronson in his hometown .
Surely that call must now be extended to one for a lasting tribute in Hull to the city 's greatest band ."
2013-05-24,"Like everybody else who was taking solids on 6 July 1972 , I genuinely remember seeing David Bowie perform Starman on Top of the Pops .
It 's one of the few historic pieces of pop television I recall clearly .
I knew who David Bowie was , had already bought his records and had even seen him wearing a dress on the cover of Melody Maker .
That short appearance with the Spiders From Mars , doing a song that only got on the record because somebody at RCA thought it was a hit , felt like an arrival .
It was n't just the clothes .
Lots of acts raided the dressing - up box .
What struck me then and strikes me now is the way he worked out which camera he was on and , through it , looked unflinchingly and winningly into our homes .
It was as if all the appearances before that one , from his interview at the age of 17 with Tonight 's Cliff Michelmore in 1964 , earnestly advancing the cause of the Society For The Prevention of Cruelty
To Long Haired Men , to his performance of song of the year Space Oddity at the none - more - stuffy Ivor Novello Awards in 1970 where he 's backed by an orchestra who contain their excitement most effectively , via an appearance advertising Luv , Lyons Maid 's short - lived attempt to deliver Swinging London in the shape of an ice - lolly , were merely leading to this massive moment of coming out .
Talking of coming out , he 'd already declared himself gay a few months earlier to journalist Mick Watts but , like so many interviewers since , Mick was n't sure whether to take him at his word or not .
All the Bowie interviews conducted in front of a camera are on YouTube for us to reprise at our leisure , usually to the discomfiture of his star - struck interviewers and the cheerful indifference of Bowie , who has a flair for rising above last year 's sartorial gaffes that should be a lesson to us all .
There he is being interviewed by Jools Holland in 1987 for the release of Never Let Me Down , sporting a quiff that could have your eye out , about to tell us how good a skier Iggy Pop is when Jools , concealing his terror behind a veil of cool , only wants to know who played on the album .
Most of the time Bowie is a lot less pretentious and defensive in interviews than his interrogators are expecting .
He tends to mirror their approach , which is why his artsy side , first reflected in the 1974 Arena film Cracked Actor , is less appealing than his showbiz side , which saw him demonstrating his karate on the Dinah Shore show just a year later , though Wogan certainly earned his fee the night in 1991 he had to pretend to interview Tin Machine , the band
Bowie was hiding in at the time .
The best interview clip is an appearance on TFI Friday in 1999 when Chris Evans was smart enough to let him rip and Bowie filled the silence with a monologue about writing songs on drugs , the difficulty of crossing Hammersmith bridge and the Indonesian gun runner who offered him the favours of his daughters .
Many interviewers ask Bowie about his acting , as if this was a Good Thing .
One look at Baal , the BBC Brecht adaptation in which he starred in 1982 , should make them reconsider .
His most convincing small screen acting is in Extras , where he plays himself opposite Ricky Gervais and does it brilliantly .
He 's similarly comfortable playing a double - knit version of himself in the introduction to the 1983 edit of The Snowman .
He knows that Christmas is a good time to be seen , which must be how he came to duet with Bing Crosby on The Little Drummer Boy on the crooner 's Merrie Old Christmas in 1977 .
It 's possible neither knew much about the other but they both instinctively grasped the mathematics of celebrity wherein one plus one can soon add up to multi - platinum .
The promo videos , which are thrown out with tiresome regularity from the 80s on , are only as good as the songs they were there to push , which means that China Girl is worth revisiting for the song 's supple groove rather than the singer 's bare bottom rolling around in the surf , which was quite controversial in 1983 .
Photographer Mick Rock 's barely - synced clip for The Jean Genie has the acrid tang of 1973 .
It 's amazing to reflect that there was just 10 years between the two .
Trawling YouTube tends to dissolve chronology .
You can see Bowie rehearsing the song 1984 for the American TV programme
The 1980 Floor Show , which was actually filmed at the Marquee in 1973 and never shown in Britain , signing an autograph for the driver of the train that delivered him to Waterloo station in May 1976 and being inserted into his Ziggy Stardust costume halfway through the show in the tiny dressing room at Hammersmith Odeon .
There he is presenting Aretha Franklin with a Grammy in 1975 , an incident of which he has no memory .
Which is doubly a pity because John Lennon is in the audience .
You can even enjoy Stuart Maconie 's survey of his changing teeth .
But with Bowie the best things always happened when he inserted himself into an established format , going along with its rules while introducing something all his own .
It 's here in this version of Queen Bitch recorded in the tiny confines of studio Pres B in TV Centre in 1972 ( vocals live , everything else mimed ) and also in his introduction of Fame on Soul Train in front of an audience of African - American dancers who had the good manners to overlook the fact that he did n't dance quite as well as they did .
It was probably also present in the performance of Starman that he recorded for the ITV show Lift Off With Ayshea three weeks before that historic Top of the Pops appearance .
But ITV lost the tape , which seems typical somehow .

David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â Five Years is on BBC2 on Saturday at 9.20pm"
2013-05-27,"Music documentaries can be quite tedious things , especially if the subject of the documentary is n't taking part Ã¢â¬ â on account of being dead maybe , or simply too mysterious and enigmatic to be involved .
So you 're left with archive clips , which will be frustratingly short for lovers of the music who will want to hear whole songs .
Interspersed with the clips there 'll be talk , by people who worked with the subject back in the day .
There 'll be stories of good times , hedonism and demonstrations of significant chord changes .
If the subject of the film is very famous , the collaborator will maybe show off a little about just how well they knew / know them , personally .
And music journalists and cultural commentators will be competitively insightful .
You know the genre .
Francis Whately 's film David
Bowie Ã¢â¬ â Five Years ( BBC2 , Sunday ) is all of the above .
No , do n't stop , more !
Of Queen Bitch , Suffragette City , Fame , Golden Years , Young Americans , Ashes to Ashes ,
even Let 's Dance .
They 're all rudely interrupted though .
By Rick Wakeman , saying : "" I got a call from Dave , he called me directly . ""
A direct call , eh Rick ?
He talks us through the piano chord structure of Life on Mars : you think it 's going there , but it 's going here , there 's an unexpected E flat thrown in , only David would do that .
Producer Ken Stott remembers bumping into David in a corridor ; guitarist Earl Slick remembers not remembering very much because everyone there was on drugs ; drummer Woody Woodmansey remembers David having breakfast , guitarist Carlos Alomar remembers David being white ...
And yet this is better than most music documentaries .
Aloma 's white memory is adorable .
"" I did n't know who David Bowie was , but I did know that this was the whitest man I 'd ever seen Ã¢â¬ â
I 'm not talking white - like - pink
, I 'm talking about translucent white . ""
As is his orange one : "" And then he had orange hair .
I 'm not talking about mama 's orange , I 'm talking an - orange orange . ""
Woodmansey 's breakfast memory Ã¢â¬ â ""
he would eat breakfast as a superstar "" Ã¢â¬ â is significant because it 's part of Bowie 's construct ,
what ( the Guardian 's own )
John Harris says is his ability "" to essay the experience of stardom "" .
And Rick Wakeman 's unpicking of Life on Mars is fascinating , because it 's Life on Mars
and it 's Rick Wakeman (
plus I 'd show off a bit if Dave had phoned me , directly or otherwise ) .
All the contributors Ã¢â¬ â Camille Paglia ( ! ) , Nelson George , Charles Shaar Murray , Brian Eno , Nicholas Roeg , Nile Rodgers and many more Ã¢â¬ â have something interesting to say .
But mainly it 's better because of the subject .
The footage Ã¢â¬ â some rare , some unseen Ã¢â¬ â is mesmerising .
He 's just so bloody beautiful and extraordinary , every one of him Ã¢â¬ â from fedora - wearing hippy through various aliens , insects , ghosts , etc to the tanned blond yuppie pop star of the Serious Moonlight tour .
I love the outtakes of recordings that go wrong Ã¢â¬ â Life on Mars and Queen Bitch
Ã¢â¬ â when you see him suddenly crash out of character .
His humour too , mischievous and sarcastic , is evident in a hilarious interview with Russell Harty .
That 's not to say Bowie does n't take himself very seriously : he is controlling and a bit preposterous too .
It 's nicely put together .
And though DB is obviously far too mysterious and enigmatic to take part , the gems are strung together using archive audio interview so it sounds as if he 's narrating his own life story .
I 'd like the songs to have gone on longer , but I can always go and listen to the music , starting , as the film does , with Hunky Dory , moving on to Ziggy Stardust .
That 's the bank holiday soundtrack sorted then .
From Suffragette City to Clare Balding 's Secrets of a Suffragette ( Channel 4 , Sunday ) , about Emily Davison , who died at the Derby 100 years ago .
As a member of the racing community , Clare has been brought up to believe that Davison deliberately threw herself under a horse that happened to be the King 's .
What about the return train ticket found on her , though , and the suffragette ball that very night ?
"" God , that would have been a blast , "" says Clare 's brother , about the ball
( she 's chatting it over with her racing family ) .
Clare laughs , then suddenly remembers allegiance to her gender .
"" This is the world I grew up in , "" she says , with some exasperation .
It 's not just bantery chat around the kitchen table to uncover familial prejudice though ; this is a thorough Ã¢â¬ â and fascinating Ã¢â¬ â investigation , using the latest forensic techniques , the results of which cause Clare to gasp .
It seems that martyrdom was n't the aim , Davison wanted the King 's horse to cross the line wearing suffragette colours .
Perhaps , as a fitting centenary tribute , the Women and the Church campaign should attach a banner demanding women bishops to Prince William 's helicopter .
Do be careful though ."

2013-06-18,"A signed set of David Bowie 's handwritten lyrics to The Jean Genie are scheduled to be auctioned next monthand are expected to sell for between ÃÂ£12,000 and ÃÂ£15,000 .
Bowie wrote the lyrics in 1972 , sending them as a gift to Neal Peters , the head of his American fan club .
Consisting of 18 lines "" in black ballpoint pen on cream lined notebook paper "" , according to Bonhams , the pages are accompanied with "" documents relating to ... the work [ Peter ] did with the fan club during its infancy "" .
In addition to these lyrics from Bowie 's Aladdin Sane album , the 3 July auction includes Robbie Williams ' lyrics to Deceiving Is Believing , the Small Faces ' Ivor Novello award and Marc Bolan 's old Afghan coat .
There 's also a contract for Bowie 's concert at the Ealing College of Technology on 29 April 1969 , "" between the hours of 12:30 and 13:30 "" .
Bowie and his then - guitarist , John Hutchinson , were to receive a payment "" of Twelve ( 12 ) pounds "" .
There 's even something for creepy Rolling Stones fans or DNA - hungry mad scientists : one of Mick Jagger 's ex - girlfriends is selling a lock of his hair .
Offering a 50-year - old parcel of "" washed and trimmed "" brown hair , Chrissie Shrimpton hopes to raise around ÃÂ£2,000 for the Changing Faces charity .
She claims her grandmother tucked it away , unbeknownst to her , while she and Jagger were visiting .

Click to view Back in June 1985 , rival rock gods Mick Jagger and David Bowie were momentarily united on the moral high ground , adding their support to Live Aid with this cover of Dancing in the Street .
Vocally the duet has become a collector 's item
Ã¢â¬ â two such differently stellar singers in one Motown classic .
But the visual juxtaposition of the two men 's dancing is no less cherishable , and no less revealing of their personal style .
Jagger 's body language
Ã¢â¬ â as always Ã¢â¬ â is dominating by his mouth .
Snarling , growling , pouting or violently pursed , it has a choreography all of its own .
The sound that comes out of it is also phrased for maximum attack , belting vocals that pounce on the rhythmic emphasis .
But if you watch Jagger 's dancing , it , too , is all about nailing the beat .
In the opening seconds of this video [ 0.27 ] , he sets up a characteristic syncopation between the upward aerobic spring of his jumps and the clipped angular pumping of his arms .
It cinches the beat no less than the flamboyant semaphore of his gestures , and the cut - and - thrust of his pelvic moves .
David Bowie 's voice , by contrast , tends to weave around both the harmony and the rhythm , and his dance moves are similarly lighter , more detached , and very slightly parodic .
At our first glimpse of him [ 0.38 ] , he 's got his hands pushed deep into the pockets of his trenchcoat Ã¢â¬ â a pure statement of cool Ã¢â¬ â and in place of Jagger 's rock - star grind he 's allowing himself an ironic , loose - hipped sway .
Then look at them when they 're out on the street .
Jagger is bounding along , impatient to show off the stamina that he 's apparently developed from 12-mile runs and a daily ballet class .
Bowie is almost mooching along beside him and , showman that he is , reserves his energies for more calculated special effects :
the leap into frame at 0.43 , the Latin diva pose at 1.56 and the slightly surreal hand flourishes ( back turned to the camera )
[ 2.10 - 15 ] , that remind us of the early apprenticeship Bowie served with the great mime artist Lindsay Kemp .
Reading on mobile ?
Click to view I love this duet , but my heart still belongs to Martha and the Vandellas , who first recorded the song in 1964 .
The three women are dancing the tight , snappy routines that characterised all those Motown singers .
Formally dressed in matching cocktail frocks Ã¢â¬ â or , in the later footage , the newly hip trouser suits of the 60s Ã¢â¬
â they mostly limit themselves to coolly coordinated shimmies of the shoulders and hips and to unison hand jives ( the opening shout - out at 0.10 , though , is surely a gesture that Jagger was referencing in his own routine [ 0.26 ] ) .
Yet it 's the restraint of the women 's performance that 's key to the intoxicating effect of the song .
The moments where Martha Reeves curves her voice into an upper emotional register of rebellious exhilaration [ at 1.07 , 1.42 , or 2.02 ] and it is all the more infectious because of the overriding control of the music and dance formation .
It 's that tension between tightness and ecstasy that made Dancing in the Streets one the great anthems of pop Ã¢â¬ â and the reason why it can still fill a dancefloor half a century later ."
2013-09-01,"Job : musician , actor Age : 66 Industry : music , digital media New entry
It makes a ch - ch - change to have a singer in the MediaGuardian 100 but David Bowie makes the list on the back of the single most successful marketing stunt of the year , across both traditional and digital media .
Only a select few knew that Bowie was back in the recording studio , let alone about to release a new album , when its opening single , Where Are We Now ? , appeared on iTunes on the morning of the singer 's 66th birthday , 8 January .
The "" no - launch "" launch caught the world on the hop , generated no end of media coverage and added yet more mystique to Bowie 's secretive ( not retired as it turns out ) persona .
Once upon a time , pre - Heat , pre - Twitter , all celebrities were like this .
"" The way he released the album has to be recognised , "" said our panel .
"" It just dropped into the world , as if from nowhere . ""
In an age of always - on media , less really can be more ."
2013-09-06,"It 's a building steeped in history , where David Bowie bade farewell to Ziggy Stardust and Kate Bush recorded her only live concert performance .
But for much of its life the Hammersmith Odeon has been a dark , dingy place with sticky carpets and gruesome bars .
But on Friday , after a nine - week closure and refurbishment , it was revealed in a far more glorious light .
"" I think it is one of the best art deco buildings in London , "" said architect Edmund Wilson in the totally transformed interior .
"" It is up there with the Savoy and other art deco buildings on the Strand . ""
The 1932 building designed by Robert Cromie began life as the Gaumont Palace before becoming the Hammersmith Odeon and , in 1999 , the Hammersmith Apollo .
From now on , it will be called the Eventim Apollo after the German ticketing company which co - owns it with AEG Live , owners of the O2 .
Most people 's memory of the building will be for what was on stage rather than the unmemorable facade or interior .
Now a wealth of original art deco features have been uncovered , not least the beautiful terrazzo floor in the entrance , hidden for years under carpet .
"" We knew it was there because of old black and white photos , but we did n't know the condition , "" said Wilson .
"" But we had a peek and saw it was really something . ""
Beautiful friezes by the artist Newbury Abbott Trent , also in the entrance hall , have been restored and now radiate , while blacked out windows in the circle bar have carefully had paint removed to reveal their elaborate original frosting .
The main auditorium now screams art deco , with the gloomy purples and pinks replaced by original greens and blacks , although "" we made a few adjustments to slightly darken it down to keep it rock'n'roll , "" said Wilson , of Foster Wilson Architects .
"" We did n't want to lose its moodiness . ""
The venue is one of the UK 's best known , hosting many memorable performances and concerts , not least the one in 1973 when Bowie closed the gig with Rock'n'Roll Suicide , bringing down the curtain on Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
More recently it has hosted BBC1 's Live at the Apollo series .
AEG Live 's chief operating officer , Colin Chapple , recalled paying ÃÂ£2 to see Alexander O'Neal in the SOS Band there .
He said consumers now expected a lot more from venues than in previous years . ""
Then the music industry was really about the recording side and not the touring , while today it 's turned on its head . """
2013-09-16,"No 6 , the Prisoner - themed festival season closer held in the bijou Italianate village of Portmeirion , produced unlikely heroes : the security guard cajoled into joining the impromptu ukulele orchestra on the ornate colonnade ; the Tron drum troupe leading Saturday 's dusk procession and their robot marchers , neon tubes on every limb ; the 50s housewives singing calypso tunes from a dinghy in the fountains and the Brythonthiaid male voice choir , welcomed to the piazza stage for their choral covers of Chic , New Order and Muse so rapturously you 'd think David Bowie had joined .
Festival
No 6 is the first UK festival where the canvas is as important as its contents .
This second year , the spectacle has expanded from Prisoner recreations to hallucinogenic carnivals and pop - up performance pieces .
Only the most imaginative bands competed with the stunning setting .
Neon Neon accompanied their 80s electro - flashdances with footage of communist luminaries and signs that read "" Resist Phoney Encores "" .
Public Service Broadcasting built electro - rock squalls around antique newsreel announcements , right down to their prerecorded audience banter .
On Friday , headliner James Blake created the future of soul by imagining the xx fronted by Antony Hegarty .
Representing the ultimate monstrous evolution of the guitar , My Bloody Valentine headlined on Saturday , their vocal subtleties sacrificed for churning volume .
Some people ran screaming from noise tornados mischievously titled things like Only Tomorrow and Softly Mauve , others basked in the violent , amorphous magnificence of the song
Soon , which resembles Pet Shop Boys cast into hellfire .
The 10-minute holochord segment of You Made Me Realise was one endurance test too far for many in the audience .
Another endurance test came on Sunday , when howling winds and rainstorms closed secondary tents .
Survivors were treated to an encore of hits ; a smattering of Smiths from Johnny Marr , Chic 's disco inferno and Manic Street Preachers , whose comeback show mirrored their career by flip - flopping between genius and mundanity .
Roaring punk classics Motorcycle Emptiness , Revol and You Love
Us gave way to slippered stumbles from their acoustic - led new album Rewind the Film , saved only by Richard Hawley 's charmed guest spot .
A damp finale , but the magic of No 6 remains unquenched ."
2013-09-18,"It is always a question , in the Victoria and Albert museum , of deciding not just where one is , but also when .
One minute we 're in medieval Flanders with a load of brown pots , the next peering at David Bowie 's trousers .
Finding myself amid a display of 1930s Hollywood costumes , I almost wish I could try them on .
It is a way of dealing with all the slippage â between one time and another , between real life and the museum .
I 'm not alone in this .
The attendants here are on constant alert , to stop people jumping on the Great Bed of Ware .
Strolling along one of those dim corridors the V&amp;A is riddled with , I took a turn and accidentally found myself in a spacious private apartment .
Could this be the V&amp;A director 's secret pied - Ã  - terre ?
Sumptuous rugs on the floor , a jacket on a door handle , a bunch of flowers left casually on an antique whatnot , a bunch of keys thrown in a dish of small change with a receipt from a New York bar .
The place looks lived - in , but there 's no one home .
I feel like Loyd Grossman in Through the Keyhole .
Popping into the next room , I find a schoolboy lurking in the empty fireplace .
Miserable and afraid , the cowering child does n't move an inch .
Maybe he came on a school trip and lost his way .
His portrait hangs above the mantelpiece .
Perhaps he is a ghost .
Time has stopped in this apartment .
The newspapers lying around ( an Evening Standard , the Daily Telegraph ) are all dated August 2011 , the week of the Worst Scenes Since The Blitz , as the headlines described the riots after the shooting of Mark Duggan by armed police on 4 August .
It was a Thursday .
I know where I was that week
and it was n't here .
Yet here I am .
The place gives me the creeps .
Maybe it 's the stultifying decor , the air of neglect kept just at bay .
The plaster moulders where there 's been a leak .
Water drips into a bucket , marking its own time .
A monstrous sculpted head sits on a plinth , and in the nearby ashtray a cigar , half - smoked .
The rooms go on and on .
I pad about , at once a creeping connoisseur of the things these rooms contain and a prying snoop .
There are lots of unpaid bills , all addressed to Norman Swann .
I eye up the armagnac on the drinks trolley , roam the glass - fronted bookcases and rifle through the drawers , having a good rummage .
Looking for secrets , if there are any .
There 's always something .
Everywhere there are clues â photographs , letters , souvenirs â but to what ?
A framed poster for the Whitechapel Art Gallery 's 1956
This Is Tomorrow exhibition hangs in a corner .
Elsewhere there are dodgy antique paintings , fine engravings , and paintings and drawings of young men posing casually .
The table is set for dinner , but something seismic happened here , leaving a crack running right through the tabletop , through the chairs , and even the plates that lie in its path , like a fault line opening up .
Valuable antiques are strung out along the top of a bookcase .
Those candlesticks look like they might be worth a bit .
There 's a delicious green art nouveau ceramic pot displayed among the books , and a cheap tin teapot .
The place is a hodgepodge of tastes .
A guess : whoever lives here carries the baggage of inherited wealth , displays an anxious striving to be modern and distinguish himself , and is burdened with a repressive finickiness that borders on the fastidious .
Our Mr Swann is also given to florid outbursts of baroque vulgarity .
Witness the bedroom down the corridor , which has a shiny , polished metal vulture looming on the bedpost , beyond which lie the rumpled sheets of his unmade bed .
I had made it to the bedroom in haste , hearing the shower running behind a closed door on the way .
The maid loitering in the corridor did n't move .
I do n't think she 's any more real than that schoolboy .
This , I finally surmise , is the home of an architect , though it does n't look as if he 's been very active recently .
His old Mac Classic computer is defunct .
Who uses floppy disks nowadays ?
In his cluttered office , models of modernist buildings teeter on shelves or piles of magazines .
Another vulture perches beside his desk .
But , it seems , he 's moving out .
Cardboard boxes stuffed with bric - a - brac sit about the floor .
Someone 's just installed a swanky new kitchen and had a go at painting the wall .
Swann is bankrupt , old , and on his uppers .
He has more life behind him than in front .
The For Sale sign goes up next week , beside the entrance to the V&amp;A.
There 's more , much more , and I could spend hours here .
The rooms reminds me of those dreams where you suddenly find yourself on stage in a play , with all the actors looking at you expectantly , waiting for you to speak lines you have n't learned .
But there is a script , after all , found in a pile of little books beside the door .
Tomorrow , it 's called , "" Scenes from an unrealised film by Elmgreen and Dragset "" .
This entire suite of rooms and everything they contain are a set for Mr Swann 's fictitious life .
Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset were invited to make this mise - en - scÃ¨ne for the V&amp;A two years ago .
Using the former tapestry galleries of the museum , which have lain unused for several years , they have built walls , decorated the rooms with objects , paintings and prints from the V&amp;A collection , and added further artworks , furniture and clutter they have manufactured or sourced themselves .
Tomorrow follows the collector 's houses they created at the Venice Biennale in 2009 , and a vast project in Rotterdam in 2011 .
An Ingmar Bergman quote opens the little book : "" I write scripts to serve as skeletons awaiting the flesh and sinew of images .
""
Elmgreen and Dragset 's story is a dismal drama , and in any case you can invent your own .
The artists have given us all the images we need : the furnishings , the books , the mementoes , the antiques ; and Mr Swann 's former self , the boy haunting the fireplace .
I wonder if , in the artists ' imagination , he is the same boy who rode the bronze rocking horse in their recent commission for the fourth plinth in London 's Trafalgar Square ?
Swann is still in the shower .
He 'll be in there for months .
We should ask him .

2013-09-26,"Right now is a pretty good time to be working for LVMH Ã¢â¬
â think of it as the Man City of fashion .
First the French luxury conglomerate announced the significant coup of signing JW Anderson to their group over arch rival Kering ( Chelsea , if you will ) , and that the London talent will take over at their brand Loewe .
And now come reports that David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â fashion 's favourite recluse Ã¢â¬ â will appear in the brand 's L'Invitation au Voyage campaign due to be released later this year .
While pictures have yet to be released , the musician will reportedly star with model Arizona Muse ( who featured in the first of the ad 's series ) , and there may be a hot air balloon involved .
Ground control to Major Tom jokes to be inserted here .
While representative for Bowie offered no comment on the story , and LVMH could not be reached , this is clearly a big deal Ã¢â¬ â arguably on a par with the Anderson one .
Since the David Bowie Is exhibition at the V&amp;A this summer , the zeitgeist 's gaze has been firmly focused on Bowie and his shape - shifting , visionary looks have been discovered by yet another generation .
Having him in your advert is something to celebrate .
Champagne corks will no doubt be popping at the LVMH HQ c'est soir ."
2013-09-26,"Just over a week ago , over a year and a half after it was first uploaded to YouTube , a video by an obscure soul singer called Milky Edwards suddenly started to go viral .
The clip features a faceless record collector taking what he describes as a "" hard to find "" vinyl copy of Starman by Milky Edwards and the Chamberlings out of its sleeve and placing it on his record player .
A reassuring crackle follows the needle hitting the wax and then the song begins : an introduction seemingly lifted from You Keep Me Hanging On by the Supremes , a "" huh ! ""
worthy of Edwin Starr at his peak , and then a supercharged , hand - clapping , foot - stomping , gospel soul cover of David Bowie 's Starman that knocks the original into the next solar system .
Reading on mobile ?
Watch here
In the right - hand column beside the video lurked two more cuts from the album , both Bowie covers : Soul Love and Moonage Daydream , also given a righteous soul makeover .
And peering closely at the album cover displayed on the minimalist Milky Edwards website , it appeared the record featured every song from Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars , presumably injected with the same irresistible fervour .
On YouTube , the comments were delirious . ""
Awesome !
Sounds like this has come from another dimension .
Somewhere out there is a black David Bowie with a successful soul music career ! ""
raved one new convert , while another summed up the rest of the posts with a simple : "" I want this ! ""
Further investigation , however , turned up a surprise .
The crate - digging forums had been aware of the video for months , unsurprisingly , and the general consensus among the soul and funk fanatics was that the Milky Edwards album was a hoax .
The recordings felt "" treated "" rather than authentic , and the cover art Ã¢â¬ â highly reminiscent of the 1968 Supremes album Reflections Ã¢â¬ â was in a style that would have fallen out of fashion by the early to mid-1970s .
And one sleuth had spotted that the font on the cover was a modern one Ã¢â¬ â Mojo Standard .
Graphic designer Brian Borrows , who used the font on the cover of What It Is Y'All by Senor Soul , which was released in 2002 , agrees : "" Yes same font .
They 've even squished and pulled it like mine Ã¢â¬ â this can only be done on a computer .
In the 70s , everything was pretty much done by hand .
My gut tells me that the Milky Edwards sleeve was created on a Mac . ""
Reading on mobile ?
Watch here
So it 's definitely a fake .
Which just leaves the obvious question : why ?
What could possibly be gained from recording such spectacular cover versions and then pretending that they were actually from the 70s ?
Someone had even gone to the trouble of posting a YouTube comment in February of this year that Milky Edwards and the Chamberlings had been signed to Mercury , but the singer had become a Satanist and committed suicide , at which point the label deleted most of the band 's back catalogue .
All very entertaining , but it did n't succeed in generating interest Ã¢â¬ â at that point , the videos had been viewed 600 or so times .
This was a scam that was being ignored .
You do n't have to look very far back through pop history to find a similar con - trick that worked very well from the outset .
In 2006 , Interscope released Make Believe , a "" lost "" album from 1974 , by a band called Platinum Weird , which was supposedly a collaboration between Dave Stewart and a singer / songwriter from New York called Erin Grace .
Interscope 's marketing team had a slightly larger budget than Milky Chambers ' , and the hoax was supported by a slew of fake fan websites and videos of Mick Jagger , Ringo Starr and Stevie Nicks reminiscing about the band .
By the time it emerged that Platinum Weird was actually Stewart and contemporary songwriter Kara DioGuardi , and that Starr had drummed on two tracks on the album , it was already a hit .
But not every hoax of this nature is simply an elaborate marketing stunt .
When Cliff Richard released a white - label dance remix of his single , Ca n't Keep This Feeling
In , under the name Black Knight in 1998 , he was trying to sneak past what he thought was an unofficial radio ban of his music .
And he succeeded .
London dance station Choice FM played the track for four days before the penny dropped .
"" If we knew it was by Cliff , we would never have played it , "" admitted Choice DJ Jerry Bascombe at the time , "" so it proves his point .
"" In 2004 , the Alarm repeated the trick by releasing a song as the Poppy Fields .
It was the band 's first hit in more than a decade .
There can be a lot riding on a successful music hoax : a career might be extended , or a newcomer might blag their way into the music industry
( a fake Radiohead song gained Toronto songwriter Christopher Stopa 15 seconds of internet fame ) .
But not every record hailed as a con turns out to be a work of fiction .
When Livin ' Love , the sublime album by 1960s girl group the Feminine Complex was first reissued in 1996 , it was dismissed by a few critics as the work of "" latter - day pranksters "" , supposedly "" indie luminaries "" dabbling with the girl group sound .
As the review in Uncut later put it : "" Could a Nashville girl group really be this good and remain undiscovered ? ""
But fans went on to track down photographs of the band and genuine eyewitness accounts of their gigs , and this story of the hoax - that - wasn't - a - hoax has given a "" what if ? "" sparkle to every scam attempted since .
So maybe the Milky Edwards album is n't a fake after all .
Could the sleeve be modern but the music genuine ?
And , ultimately , does it really matter whether it 's "" 4 Real "" or not ?
The Milky Edwards fans on YouTube certainly do n't think so .
"" I do n't care if it 's a hoax , this is fantastic , "" enthuses one .
"" I need the whole album , "" agrees another .
And David Bowie 's official Facebook page does n't care about its authenticity either . ""
Sadly , the evidence points to this actually being a modern day hoax and that Milky Edwards and the Chamberlings never really existed , "" ran a statement last week .
"" But do n't let that put you off .
The three tracks available on YouTube are still well worth a listen and let 's hope that whoever is behind this deceit gets around to recording the rest of the album soon .
We 're looking forward to Rock'N'Roll Suicide with a Detroit Emeralds twist and Star in the style of the Temptations . ""
And , of course , there 's still the possibility that this is an established artist toying with the system .
The name that comes up again and again on the forums and on YouTube is Tom Jones .
He certainly had the raw soul power back in the day , as northern soul classics such as The Lonely One and Hide and Seek inarguably prove .
And whoever 's singing the Milky Edwards covers does sound spookily like Jones at full tilt .
Alas , Jennie Harris of Jones 's management , Valley Music , says we 're pinning our hopes on the wrong Starman .
"" It 's definitely not Tom Jones , "" she confirms .
So who is behind this curious mystery ?
Perhaps now the videos have finally gone viral
we 'll find out .
Will the real Milky Edwards please stand up ?"
2013-09-29,"It must have seemed a great idea over a couple of Belgian beers and a glass of scotch while listening to David Bowie .
Then the furniture removers arrived at Benjamin Carle 's Paris flat and stripped it almost bare .
Out went anything foreign - made including the fridge , washing machine , most of his clothing and his British - made bicycle , leaving Carle , 25 , with an old table , a chair and a second - hand wardrobe .
At that point , minus the beer , whisky and Bowie , the young documentary - maker might have been forgiven for abandoning his nine - month "" economic patriotism "" experiment , in which he uses and consumes only French - made products .
Thankfully , Loon the cat , made in France but named after the late Keith Moon ( "" the Loon "" ) , British drummer with the Who , was allowed to stay .
"" I do n't think my girlfriend was very impressed when she came home , "" admits Carle .
"" She must love me because it 's no fun for her . ""
Since May , he has become Monsieur Made - in - France for a television documentary , to be screened next spring , about the difficulties of consuming exclusively French products .
The idea was inspired by the political debate during the 2012 presidential election , which reached a high point when Arnaud Montebourg , the Socialist minister for industrial renewal , posed in a natty Breton T - shirt to extol the merits of buying French as a way of supporting Gallic industry .
Sitting in a French cafe in Belleville , an ethnically mixed area of north - east Paris , Carle drinks Perrier water from a glass that may or may not be French ( "" that 's not as important as what 's in the glass "" ) .
From the Ã¢âÂ¬90 ( ÃÂ£75 ) cap ( Larose ) to the Ã¢âÂ¬80 trainers ( Dutt ) , via his corduroy trousers , white T - shirt , blue sweatshirt ( Bleu de Paname ) , his clothes were all made in France .
Carle is adamant his underpants are also French - made , but does not reveal the label .
And his socks ?
There is an awkward silence .
"" It 's a bit embarrassing because we make a lot of socks in France , but I ran out .
It 's quite hard not having a washing machine , "" he says .
It is an interesting and occasionally exaggerated premise for a television programme ; however , Carle insists the experiment has a serious point .
"" I am not someone who is particularly patriotic
and I 'm not at all nationalistic .
Like many young people , my cultural influences are mostly Anglo - American .
It 's an experiment to see if it can be done , and if it could save jobs in France .
"" It 's harder than you 'd think , "" Carle says .
"" I thought I 'd have some small electrical things , but I discovered they were all made in China .
"" I can have HÃÂ¤agen - Dazs , Coca - Cola and McDonald 's because they are made in France , but I can not listen to David Bowie , even on the radio in a French - made car .
"" I do n't have a fridge so I ca n't eat frozen food , and I am only eating fruit and vegetables that are grown in France , so they are in season . ""
Carle admits the experiment has made him think about how people consume .
"" We have totally lost the idea of seasonal products .
We think it 's normal to have strawberries in January and tomatoes in March .
I feel like I 've gone back to an earlier time , to the values and constraints of , say , my grandfather 's generation . ""
It has made me think and I do have the impression that I am supporting employment in France .
It 's a similar feeling to buying fair trade products . ""
On a wage of Ã¢âÂ¬1,800 ( ÃÂ£1,513 ) a month he can not afford to replace everything the removal men took .
"" It 's slightly more expensive to buy French , but is n't that a good thing ?
There 's a reason things made in China are so cheap , and that 's low wages .
But it does take a lot more time finding French - made things like food and clothes . ""
Carle says the government needs to do more to support domestic industry , particularly the manufacture of textiles "" as they have done with the French car industry for the last 20 years "" , and persuade French companies to keep or return production to France .
He says calling the documentary Made in France ( in English ) was ridiculous Ã¢â¬ â but says this was foisted on him by the television company .
There is n't anything he particularly craves ( though he misses HP sauce ) .
"" There is n't any one difficult thing , it 's more an accumulation .
Sometimes I find alternatives , but honestly , Corsican whisky is not as good as scotch .
I ca n't listen to David Bowie , or go to a pop concert if a foreign group is playing , or watch an American blockbuster or television series , which I like , but I have discovered some French alternatives . ""
But wait !
What 's that iPhone doing on the table ? ""
While I 'm researching the documentary , I have to keep my phone and computer , but for the last two months I will give them up .
I 've no idea how I 'm going to communicate with people , "" he says .
There are , however , scarier alternatives .
If David Bowie is out , whose music is he listening to Ã¢â¬ Â¦ national crooner Johnny Hallyday ?
Carle splutters over his Perrier . ""
Er no , I draw the line there .
"" Buying British
I 'm Backing Britain was a spasm of economic patriotism aimed at boosting the British economy in 1968 .
Unfortunately , the campaign 's T - shirts were made in Portugal .
The earlier Buy British Campaign of 1931 was the government 's attempt to tackle a balance of payments crisis without initially resorting to tariff protection .
The operation , organised by the Empire Marketing Board , vaunted the benefits to the balance of trade , the value of sterling , the value of employment and commercial relations with the empire by buying British .
The campaign enjoyed limited and temporary success ."
2013-10-01,"As a new version of the exhibition David Bowie Is opens this week at the Art Gallery of Ontario , curators have revealed a list of his top 100 must - read books , giving a fascinating insight into the mind of the influential musician and style icon .
The show , which offered unprecedented access to Bowie 's own archive , became the most popular ever mounted by London 's V&amp;A when it ran there earlier this year .
As the Guardian 's Alexis Petridis pointed out at the time , the Bowie story is so well - known that "" unless it 's content to retell a very hackneyed story indeed , David Bowie Is has to find a way of casting new light on some of the most over - analysed and discussed music in rock history . ""
The reading list , with books presented in chronological order rather than order of preference , provides Ontario with a new angle .
American classics of the 50s and 60s are strongly represented Ã¢â¬ â
On the Road by Jack Kerouac , Truman Capote 's In Cold Blood Ã¢â¬ â as are tales of working - class boys made good , which emerged in the postwar years :
Keith Waterhouse 's Billy Liar and Room at the Top by John Braine , and The Outsider by Colin Wilson , a study of creativity and the mindset of misfits .
RD Laing 's The Divided Self speaks to a fascination with psychotherapy and creativity , as does The Origin of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , by Julian Jaynes .
There is no evidence that Bowie 's scientific inquries extend beyond psychology Ã¢â¬ â
Stephen Hawking 's cosmic theories are out Ã¢â¬ â but his tastes are otherwise broad .
Political history features , in titles such as Christopher Hitchens ' The Trial of Henry Kissinger , and Orlando Figes ' A People 's Tragedy , as well as collections of interviews .
A broad taste for fiction emerges , too , from early Ian McEwan (
In Between the Sheets ) and Martin Amis 's definitive 1980s novel , Money , to 21st - century fictions such as Sarah Waters ' Fingersmith and Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz .
He also displays a penchant for irreverent humour , with the inclusion of Spike Milligan 's comic novel Puckoon , and the entire oeuvres of Viz and Private Eye .
And , of course , there 's music Ã¢â¬ â with soul music especially prominent .
Bowie selects Sweet Soul Music : Rhythm and Blues and the Southern Dream of Freedom by Peter Guralnick , and Nowhere to Run : The Story of Soul Music by Gerri Hirshey , as well as Charlie Gillett 's The Sound of the City : The Rise of Rock and Roll .

2013-10-02,"Just when I thought it was n't possible to love David Bowie any more than I do , I find it is .
At my age it 's very "" heaven "" , the discovery of another chamber in my heart .
Just for him .
This might be embarrassing were it not for the fact that this love supreme is shared by so many .
This bringer of joy remains a constant in my life , ever since he first crashed into our crowded living room radiating all kinds of possibility .
Of what , I was n't sure , but of an existence so arousing , so alive , so damn clever .
Some of it was to do with music but some of it was way beyond music .
Maybe it was "" art "" but , back then , art was just something that girls who were n't good at science did .
Maybe it was sex .
At the time , the world was obsessed with gender bendery .
Did he ever look like a woman ?
Seriously ?
No .
But he made many boys tart themselves up enough to be desirable .
Even to me .
Decades later he pops in and out of the house all the time .
Recently he was in the kitchen singing the backing vocals to Lou Reed 's Satellite of Love .
He is now on the mantelpiece ; my youngest made me a birthday card : a picture of me asleep , eyes closed , wonky mouth surrounded by handwritten Bowie lyrics .
Cut and pasted .
At 12 she may not know about Burroughs cut - ups or have read Bowie and Burroughs bitching about what a weird colour Warhol was , or riffing on Genet .
But when I see Space Oddity on her iPod
I think , as ever , the little girls know .
She asks me why someone so weird seems so normal as she has only ever seen him on Ellen .
I have no answer .
I just marvel at his reach .
To me , to her , to one of my eldest 's boyfriends Ã¢â¬ â who , inspecting my CD collection , told me that I really should do myself a favour and really listen to Ziggy .
And now after the exhibition and the magnificent not - dead - yet album , the man who inspires gives us a reading list :
100 best books and I want to rush into every school and say here you go .
Read this .
Yukio Mishima , George Orwell , Angela Carter , James Baldwin and above all Viz .
It 's like "" someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road unchained "" .
Some say he inhales books .
Some say it 's all show , the trunk of books he lugged to the desert when making the Man Who Fell to Earth .
But I do n't mind .
I am not obsessed like the fans in Fred Vermorel 's immortal Starlust who fixate on Bowie .
He appears in their dreams but if he wo nt befriend they become angry .
They want so badly to connect , they will kill him . ""
Then at last he 'll be mine Ã¢â¬ â like that guy who got JFK . ""
No , I am the other way inclined .
When we were both in the druggy basement of a New York club in the 80s , I pretended I did n't know who he was .
When I saw him years later at an art do , I studiously ignored him because rushing up and saying , "" You are life itself to me , "" seemed a bit inappropriate at a cocktail party while he was next to his stunning wife .
Then , when Brian Eno kindly agreed to come and be interviewed by me for the students at St Martins and rushed in from the studio saying , "" I did n't know whether to bring David or not , "" I mumbled , "" I could have coped with that , "" which was a complete lie .
So perhaps knowing he laughs at Viz and Puckoon makes him a little more human .
Perhaps the time - lapse grace of
Where Are We Now ?
makes him more mortal .
But when he sings of the Earth only having five years left in Ziggy Stardust , he 's already acknowledged mortality in a way I was yet to .
In 1972 , in a Rolling Stone interview , Bowie told William S Burroughs : "" Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things they thought they wanted .
The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything Ã¢â¬ Â¦
it 's no hymn to the youth as people thought .
It is completely the opposite . ""
So he resonates for each generation , his relevance accelerating .
Each fan carrying their own personal Bowie , Starman , coked out and lost in Be My Wife , the Thin White Duke , the soul man , the bricoleur showing us synths and Krautrock .
And now , nonchalantly , he chucks us an idea of what to read .
Not enough poetry for a poet perhaps .
But so much contemporary stuff , new fiction .
John Cage , Burgess , Laing .
Every book a book of dreams and imagination .
And connection , from a guy who got the internet long before most of us .
Only two of the books were written before he was born but then the boy who went to Bromley Tech is an autodidact who gave birth to all of his own incarnations .
And so the story goes , the years of being a Bowie fan are their own reward .
He opened my eyes , my ears and my mind .
He changed me because he changed popular culture . ""
Pretty soon you are gon na get a little older . ""
Indeed .
"" Time may change me but I ca n't trace time . "" But does anyone else trace time and space quite so brilliantly ?
Thank you , sir ."
2013-10-02,"A piece about David Bowie 's top 100 books , revealed as part of the David Bowie Is exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario , has led to a tip - off about another artist 's reading list
Ã¢â¬ â this time a chronology of every book read by Art Garfunkel during the past 44 years .
The painstakingly detailed list charts what he read and exactly when Ã¢â¬ â
so we know that in the months leading up to the release of Bridge Over Troubled Water in January 1970 , Garfunkel was reading Norman Mailer 's Miami and the Siege of Chicago ( in June 1969 ) ,
Shakespeare 's Hamlet ( in July 1969 ) , and a non - fiction account of the student uprising at Columbia University in 1968 , The Strawberry Statement by James Simon Kunen , which he read in August 1969 .
Garfunkel 's list of favourites is strong on the classics , from the BrontÃ Â« sisters , Jane Austen and Thomas Hardy to Virginia Woolf , George Eliot and DH Lawrence , as well as Russians Ã¢â¬ â Vladimir Nabokov , Fyodor Dostoevsky Ã¢â¬ â and Americans from Stephen King to John Updike and Jonathan Franzen .
But he 's not coy about the breadth of his reading : the most recent addition to his favourites , in June 2012 , was Fifty Shade of Grey by EL James .
It got me wondering which other artists ' bookshelves I 'd love to have a good nose through :
Prince ?
That would be a wild afternoon ; I imagine sex , psychotherapy , a little fantasy and lots and lots of art .
I 'd be intrigued to know Tori Amos 's favourites : alongside the American classics I see old European folktales and fables , a little politics and some select biographies , not of politicians or historical figures , but late-20th - century musicians and artists .
And Nick Cave ?
Would he read horror ?
I think so .
Mythology , certainly .
And probably a few graphic novels .
Whose bookshelves would you be intrigued to hunt through , and what do you imagine you 'd find there ?"
2013-10-07,"Nestling at the top left - hand cover of the newly - redesigned NME , just out of reach of a startled looking David Bowie , is the telling phrase : "" more new music ; more reviews ; about % # @!ÃÂ£ time ! ""
It looks , to all extents and purposes , an admission of what critics have been saying about NME for a long time : that it has lost its way , that it does n't go deep enough into the music , concentrating instead on celebrity titbits from Peter Doherty et al .
( Not for nothing has the magazine been dubbed "" the indie Hello "" on the crueller music message boards . )
Acknowledging the critics like this is a bold move by NME editor Mike Williams , who took over from Krissi Murison in July 2012 .
But you do wonder if we have n't been here before , specifically in April 2010 when the magazine underwent its last re - design and Murison promised "" content which focuses on being in - depth , opinionated and above all knowledgeable "" .
In doing so , Murison steered the title away from the tabloid - y feel it had under long - standing editor Conor McNicholas .
His last re - design , in July 2007 , had placed an emphasis on user - generated content and reader interaction , including the introduction of a weekly planner and a "" your photos "" section .
The new design , then , is more evolution than revolution .
It promises more pages for the Radar section , which focuses on new bands , new regular features , including Soundtrack of my Life , Anatomy of an Album and Lost Albums ; and an enhanced reviews section .
NME.com is also getting a refresh to "" ensure a superior user experience "" and there will presumably be more crossover between the two , following the recent experimentation with a paid "" enhanced digital "" version of the magazine 's cover story online .
Possibly the most striking aspect of the re - design , however , lies in the magazine 's cover .
It will not only feature "" new high - quality matt cover stock "" , but the refreshed magazine 's first issue ( which hits newsstands on Wednesday , 9 October ) also sports a clean , bold cover design that concentrates uniquely on one feature , in this case the return of David Bowie .
Whether this single - mindedness will continue when the magazine does n't have a star of Bowie 's quality to call on remains to be seen .
But the relaunch issue at least reflects Williams ' vision of the NME as "" a more dynamic , modern magazine that is heavy on content and depth of delivery "" .
The choice of Bowie as cover star is telling .
Williams tells NME.com that Bowie "" is the cosmic umbilical cord that connects the past , present and future of music "" and this is precisely where the new NME wants to be , so much so that it has made "" the past , present and future of music "" its new strapline .
It is a decision that makes sense .
While all music magazines have suffered huge declines in sales over the past few years , this drop has been most noticeable in weekly titles like Kerrang !
and NME , which cater for a more youthful Ã¢â¬ â and therefore digitally savvy Ã¢â¬ â audience .
Mojo , for example , saw its circulation fall 5.2 % in the first half of 2013 to NME 's 13.2 % decline .
NME needs to attract older readers and the new design sees the introduction of a From the Vault section , delving into the magazine 's 60-year archive to reprint classic features .
( Sister title Uncut also makes a good use of the extensive IPC archives ) .
At the same time , NME Ã¢â¬ â which I also write for as a reviewer Ã¢â¬ â can not risk its position as an authority on new music , hence the delicate balancing act between breaking bands and classic artists .
Pull this off Ã¢â¬ â attracting readers who are interested in the classic acts but do n't feel quite ready for the Van Morrison hinterland of Mojo Ã¢â¬ â and NME can add print readers .
Fail , and the magazine risks falling between two stools .
Reinventing NME wo n't be an easy task , of course , and people have long been predicting the death of the print title .
Then again , as the shock return of David Bowie showed , there are no certainties in pop music ."
2013-10-16,"David Bowie has been named the best - dressed Briton in history , topping a poll by BBC History magazine .
The Thin White Duke defeated bona fide royalty , including Queen Alexandra , Henry III and Georgiana Cavendish , Duchess of Devonshire .
More than 4,000 people submitted their votes on the magazine 's website , selecting from a shortlist of historical figures assembled by historians , curators and fashion experts .
"" Bowie had to overcome a king , two queens and a political heavyweight to triumph in our poll , and in doing so has struck a blow for 20th and 21st - century fashions , "" editor Rob Attar said .
"" David Bowie has received many accolades in his glittering career , but surely none of them compare to [ this ] .
"" Even the notorious dandy George "" Beau "" Brummell , who popularised the modern man 's suit , was no match for Bowie .
The 66-year - old singer received a stunning 48.5 % of votes , almost quadrupling the support for the first runner - up , Elizabeth I. Bowie was nominated for the prize by Red or Dead designer Wayne Hemingway , who described leaving a 1973 David Bowie gig "" utterly blown away by [ his ] music and style ( and already planning a change of hair colour ) "" .
Bowie 's recent retrospective exhibition at the V&amp;A was the fastest - selling event in its entire history .
More than 67,000 advance tickets were sold , and a record 311,000 visitors saw the show .
It has now relocated to Toronto , the first stop on a three - year world tour .
The Next Day , Bowie 's first new album in 10 years , is a favourite for this year 's Mercury prize ."
2013-10-16,"Sales of vinyl albums have doubled in 2013 so far in the UK , buoyed by the popularity of LPs from Daft Punk , David Bowie and Arctic Monkeys .
Music industry body
the BPI says that nearly 550,000 vinyl albums have been sold so far this year , predicting an end - of - year total of more than 700,000 , which would mark the biggest year for the format since 2001 .
"" The LP is back in the groove .
We 're witnessing a renaissance for records
Ã¢â¬
â
they 're no longer retro - mania and are becoming the format of choice for more and more music fans , "" said chief executive Geoff Taylor .
Vinyl remains a niche within the overall music market in the UK , albeit a rapidly - growing one .
With 15,000 LPs being sold every week , vinyl now accounts for 0.8 % of UK album sales , up from 0.1 % in 2007 .
Daft Punk 's Random Access Memories is the biggest - selling LP so far in 2013 .
This may be analogue music , but digital is playing a role in vinyl 's resurgence , with an increasing number of LPs being sold with codes enabling the buyer to download MP3s of the tracks for listening to away from their record player .
The BPI estimates that LP sales could reach ÃÂ£12 m in the UK this year , with ÃÂ£2 m of that having been spent on a single day , 20 April , which was dubbed Record Store Day as a celebration of independent record shops .
""
Record Store Day has been incredibly important as a catalyst for the resurgence of vinyl , "" said Kim Bayley , director general of industry body the Entertainment Retailers Association ( ERA ) which organised the nationwide event .
"" The fact that indie record shops managed to sell a huge ÃÂ£2 m worth of vinyl in one day puts paid to the idea that either vinyl or record stores themselves are on the way out . ""
Earlier this year , ERA announced that Britain 's remaining 300 independent record stores saw their album sales increase by 44 % in the first half of 2013 , accounting for 3.2 % of all album sales in the UK , but more than 50 % of vinyl album sales .
Vinyl buyers may still be relatively small in number , but they 're committed .
The BPI surveyed 1,700 in September to find out more about their habits , and found that one in five buy at least once a week , while seven in 10 buy at least once a month .
The BPI 's survey also shows that the average vinyl buyer has 300 LPs and 80 singles in their collection .
35.3 % of vinyl buyers are aged under 35 , but some stereotypes remain intact : 87.4 % of the survey 's respondents were men .
The BPI 's stats on 100 % year - on - year growth for vinyl sales in the UK comes from data supplied by the Official Charts Company , but it 's backed up by earlier figures announced by Amazon in September , when it said vinyl sales on its site had also doubled compared to 2012 .
The company launched a feature called AutoRip in June , providing MP3 downloads when customers bought CD or vinyl versions of more than 350,000 albums .
The BPI 's survey found that besides indie stores and Amazon , eBay , label websites and charity or second - hand shops are also popular hunting grounds for LPs ."
2013-10-19,"David Bowie was described as "" useful and reasonably small "" ; Elton John was said to have "" precious little musical ability "" ; the Who turned up 25 minutes late and Roger Daltrey seemed "" quite with - it , although the voice quality was quite harsh and unpleasant "" .
Such were the comments placed on the files of the BBC back in the days when the only way bands could get on to the airwaves was via the corporation 's auditions process , explored by Pete Paphides in Auditioning
For Auntie ( Monday , 4 pm , R4 ) .
He talks to people who used to work in the department , which was retired in the early 70s .
The tapes inevitably went in a skip but Ã¢â¬
â this being the BBC Ã¢â¬
â
the correspondence remained , and from it we can still make out the faintly exasperated tone of corporation lifers having to tolerate outsiders who do n't know how lucky they are to be allowed to play with their train set .
A session with the then - unknown Pink Floyd is disrupted by "" one gentleman freaking out "" and going missing .
The letter of apology from their manager Pete Jenner Ã¢â¬ â ""
this has never happened before "" Ã¢â¬ â is still there on the file .
The Kinks actually sent a doctor 's note to explain their failure to turn up .
Paphides talks to auditionees Judy Dyble , Shane Fenton and Peter Hammill , who all remember the magical thrill of just being in a studio .
From the other side of the glass , veteran producer Jeff Griffin has somehow rescued a tape of the Rolling Stones ' second audition , which had been solicited by a very polite letter from Brian Jones .
It 's got the chilly sound of a parish hall rather than the 2120 South Michigan Avenue vibe they were probably looking for , but as he says , "" In those days bands had 20 minutes to come in , set up , record three numbers and get out . ""
No wonder the anonymous reports on the file place such stress on things like professionalism and politeness .

2013-10-28,"As a teenager I would try to imagine what I would say to Lou Reed if I ever met him .
I 'd turn questions over in my mind : perhaps I 'd be able to eke out some hitherto unrecorded detail of Factory life , or draw him on the meaning of an obscure lyric .
Maybe he could tell me whether he 'd really been about to kiss David Bowie in that famous picture .
Or whether he did in fact detest poor Nico .
But no question I could think of felt right .
He 'd be bound to get pissed off , which would be the last thing I 'd want .
My fantasy ended with us just sitting there in silence , and he 'd smile at me .
I 'd smile back .
That was enough .
Lou Reed was my idol .
Out of place and out of time , for sure .
When I wrote about what his most famous solo album , Transformer , meant to me , some readers seemed to feel I was n't qualified .
I was born six years after it was released .
So no , it was n't on the radio ( or being banned from it ) when I first started going out or smoking weed or falling in love .
But it was on my tape deck , so who cares ?
A really great artist is n't tied to the time and place
he or she worked in , though I can understand the impulse to try to claim someone like that as your own .
It 's a way of showing how much they mean to you .
But it is selfish .
As long as there are misfits , and gay people , and transsexuals , and kids festering in the suburbs ( or out on the island ) , dreaming of a life that suits them better , there will be fans of Lou Reed .
And as long as mainstream culture caters to the optimistic , law - abiding , career - minded heterosexual ( which , by definition , it always will ) , new people will discover him , and he will be their means of escape .
They will be transported back to New York in the 1960s and 70s , but also to a place outside of time , like Christopher Isherwood 's Berlin or Armistead Maupin 's San Francisco .
Reed as an icon will be analysed and theorised endlessly in the coming days .
And of course he was a cultural phenomenon .
With those shades and that blank expression he communicated something far more menacing to middle - class America than the curly haired man with the harmonica .
We 're not just talking opposition to the Vietnam war and a few tokes on a reefer .
He shot up heroin and speed and went out with a transsexual .
He sang about dumping an overdose victim out in the streets so that "" by the morning she 's just another hit and run "" .
The darkest sides of human nature were front and centre for Reed ;
no apologies , no compromise .
But he also wrote brilliant songs .
His mentor at Syracuse University was the poet Delmore Schwartz ( another count on which Reed beats Bob Dylan is as a lyricist : his writing does n't strain to impress or bamboozle .
It makes very direct , very human sense . )
And his instinct for irresistible hooks was first harnessed as a staff songwriter for Pickwick Records .
Both talents combined to push the genre to its limits : Reed could make great art out of pop .
Just listen to
I 'll Be Your Mirror , a conventionally structured song of such heartbreaking tenderness it can stop you in your tracks .
And there have been times I could n't bear to play Coney Island Baby , with its refrain of "" I wanted to play football for the coach "" , its quiet nostalgia like a punch in the stomach .
Anyway , now he 's gone
and I 'll never get to talk to him .
I would n't have taken the chance even if it came up .
The disillusionment would 've been awful : the Lou Reed I knew and loved was n't the man himself , but the result of some unlikely alchemy between his recordings and the mind of a 13-year - old from the East Midlands .
He held the promise of everything strange and exciting the world might have to offer .
Luckily that promise is still there , and always will be , just out of reach Ã¢â¬ â thanks to those exquisitely painful songs ."

2013-10-31,"He might not be the hard - drinking rockstar of old but classically - trained pianist James Blake proved that cerebral compositions on a keyboard are no barrier to success after he was crowned winner of the coveted Barclaycard Mercury prize .
Blake , a 25-year - old who missed out on the prize in 2011 , toasted the biggest accolade of his career as he overcame the odds to beat David Bowie and Arctic Monkeys to the 21st album of the year award .
"" The dreams you have when you 're punching through water and if you 're lucky [ you ] dream hitting them right on the nose .
When what you thought was n't going to happen does , that 's very surreal , "" he said , clutching his award backstage .
Blake 's win caps a meteoric two - year rise for the former Goldsmiths student , whose transcendent voice and ambient tracks have proved a critically acclaimed hit against a wall of traditional guitar music and electronica .
He said he would celebrate by getting drunk but pledged of his ÃÂ£20,000 cheque : "" I will not piss it up the wall . ""
Despite Lauren Laverne mistakenly introducing him on stage as James Blunt during a televised ceremony at the Roundhouse in Camden , north London , Blake beat stars including David Bowie to win the ÃÂ£20,000 prize for Overgrown , his second album .
The musician , whose father was a member of the band Colosseum , produced his second album himself and it features contributions from Brian Eno and RZA from Wu - Tang Clan .
The judges described it as "" Late night music for the digital age .
An inventive , poignant and poetic record of great beauty . ""
Asked how it felt to beat Bowie , Blake said : "" I do n't think I beat him .
It 's amazing to be in the running for this prize .
A lot of people do their best work when they 're young
and it 's always disappointing to me when they do n't continue in that vein and innovate .
David Bowie is an example to people like me to keep on innovating . ""
Blake also saw off competition from 19-year - old chart - topper Jake Bugg , raucous drum'n'bass electronic outfit Disclosure and previous winners Arctic Monkeys .
Blake was a 20 - 1 outsider before the event , with the Birmingham - born singer - songwriter Laura Mvula the runaway favourite .
Speaking after the awards , NME 's Kevin Perry described Overgrown as "" one of the least commercial records on this year 's relatively populist list "" . ""
James Blake 's announcement was met with genuine surprise here at the awards , "" he said .
"" It 's an innovative and nuanced record , and although it has n't matched the likes of [ Arctic Monkey 's album ] AM or [ Foals ' ]
Holy Fire for popularity in the NME office
, it 's a worthy winner . ""
JJ Dunning , editor of indie magazine the Fly , said the selection confirms suggestions the Mercury prize is not "" into picking edgy music "" .
"" He 's been unfairly derided as a bit mopey by some , but there is an extraordinary quality to James Blake 's music that makes it worthy of an accolade .
Perhaps just not this accolade . ""
Fans hoping Bowie would cap this year 's unexpected comeback with a surprise appearance at the Roundhouse were disappointed .
Instead of his first on - stage performance in seven years , viewers were shown the video for his track Love Is Lost .
Music critic Simon Price said awarding the prize to Bowie would have been a "" sentimental "" vote ahead of next year 's 50th anniversary of Liza Jane , his first single . ""
His album was sprung upon us as a surprise and it looked for a moment like it was Bowie 's year , but that moment has passed , "" he said .
"" Bowie has been keeping a very low profile so he 's going to want to break his silence on a bigger stage than a room full of luvvies in the middle of London . ""
Mvula was one of five artists to make the annual list with their debut album , alongside Bugg and post - punk outfit Savages , who played their first gig last year .
The other first - timers are drum'n'bass quartet Rudimental and electronic duo Disclosure ."

2013-11-13,"James Lavelle , the DJ , co - founder of Unkle and head of Mo'Wax label , will curate the 2014 Meltdown festival at London 's Southbank Centre .
Each year , the 10-day event is curated by a cultural figure .
In 2014 , the prolific electronic artist and producer will follow in the footsteps of past directors David Bowie , Patti Smith , Morrissey , Jarvis Cocker and Massive Attack .
Next year 's Meltdown is a triple celebration , not only marking the 21st anniverary of both the festival and Mo'Wax , the label Lavelle founded when he was 18 , but also coinciding with the musician 's 40th birthday .
"" I want to bring together my influences from the past and the present , and my work as an artist in contemporary society , "" said Lavelle , "" as well as transform the space in a way that 's never been done before , both artistically and musically .
"" The 2014 festival will include an interactive exhibition , entitled Urban Archaeology , planned with Southbank Centre to commemorate the label 's output . ""
In curating Meltdown I have a responsibility to inspire the next generation of young artists in the same way that I was inspired as a teenager , "" Lavelle said .
"" Together we will push boundaries , shoot for the moon and create something that people will never forget . ""
Yoko Ono curated last year 's Meltdown , which included performances by Peaches , who performed Ono 's seminal work , Cut Piece , and Laurie Anderson .
Over the past two decades , the festival has been punctuated by some significant moments , including Jeff Buckley 's final UK show , the first live performance of John Lennon and Yoko Ono 's Double Fantasy album , and a rare show by Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins Ã¢â¬ â as part of Antony Hegarty 's Meltdown Ã¢â¬ â in 2012 .

2013-11-20,"Let 's be honest : after a string of intimate shows billed as "" fake art band "" The Reflektors , we all saw an Arcade Fire arena tour coming .
What we did n't , though , is that they would continue to reinforce its dress code of "" formal attire or costume "" .
Imagine that : a stadium full of people who look like they fell into that new David Bowie Louis Vuitton advert .
Amazing .
As someone who saw The Reflektors at the Roundhouse last week , however , I can say with a heavy heart that gig - goers do not do fancy dress well .
Fans had taken to Twitter to express their outrage at having to wear something other than Converse and skinny jeans and , in retaliation , turned up in painfully terrible attempts at costumes .
It led the Fire 's Win Butler to tell the audience that he was n't going to apologise for ( loosely ) enforcing such a dress code .

Simply blow up a balloon , layer it with newspaper and papier - mache paste , leave to dry , paint it
Ã¢â¬ â not forgetting to do a black stripe across your eyes

Or , if you really want to freak everyone out , make one of your favourite pop star instead .
Do n't : wear an animal - themed onesie Be warned , these toasty all - in - ones are not built with gigs in mind .
I saw sharks sweating buckets , lions crumpled on the floor , and a grown man , tiring of the shenanigans , sling a bear around his neck and walk around for the rest of the gig in his pants .
At festivals , they just about serve a purpose Ã¢â¬ â doubling up as a sleeping bag , storing cans of beer in your kangaroo pouch Ã¢â¬ â but at indoor shows , you 'll regret feeling like you 're sloshing around in an elephant 's womb .

It says "" formal attire or costume "" , but what does that really mean ?
Should you go as Wonder Woman or Tank Girl ?
A policeman or a 1920s acrobat ?
Deliberate no more
: Arcade Fire have actually made their fancy dress theme easy for you .
Win Butler described his band 's new album as "" a mash - up of Studio54 and Haitian voodoo "" : think Spandex - tight disco pants and grass skirts , Burt Reynolds ' moustaches and tribal face paint , floaty white dresses , skeleton jewellery and enormous Afros , and Grace Jones 's Bond character if she was in Live
And Let Die instead of A View To Kill .
Do n't : wear a hat
I 'm pretty sure that when Arcade Fire stipulated "" formal attire "" they did n't mean the sort of thing you could turn up in straight from work ; their shows were full of people who looked like they 'd come for a Foxton 's training course .
Many of them , however , also took the opportunity to "" spice up "" their suit with some headgear , and fedoras , top hats and trilbies were everywhere .
This needs to stop .
I do n't care if you 're a tall person having the best time you 've ever had in a bonnet : no one likes the person blocking everyone 's view .
Do : make it DIY ( but not too DIY )
There 's a fine line between an effortless costume and looking like you 've been rooting around in a bin ( like the girls at the gig who were wrapped in tinsel ) .
If you 're still dead set on creating your own costume , however , here 's a simple checklist for getting it right and making it gig - proof :
Has it taken you more than 30 minutes to make ?
Have you managed to combine more than three items from your kitchen drawer ?
Did you remember to use marker pen instead of those water paints you keep for rainy craft days ?
If the answer to all three is yes , your outfit is probably awesome ."
2013-11-25,"The second batch of new David Bowie music this year did n't generate quite the same excitement as the first .
When news broke of The Next Day in February , the response was excited news pieces , a race to early reviews and social media going mad .
Earlier this month , when 10 more new recordings emerged on the "" deluxe edition "" , there was little more than a shrug : "" He saved new songs for an expanded version , in time for Christmas ?
Do n't they all ?
"" You do n't even have to be a superstar to get the deluxe - edition treatment Ã¢â¬ â this year 's albums by Yo La Tengo and Kurt Vile are among those expanded for the Christmas market .
The Next Day symbolises something wider that is taking place in the music industry .
In an age of sales uncertainty and hesitancy , box sets and collectors ' editions are as close as the record industry gets to a banker .
Overall , sales of recorded music are tanking .
In 2006 , 154 m albums were sold in the UK , but last year the figure had fallen to little more than 100 m .
The average spend on recorded music in the UK was ÃÂ£41.04 last year , down from ÃÂ£42.87 two years previously .
Prices are also falling .
The average price of a single - disc album in 2002 was ÃÂ£10.60 .
Last year it was ÃÂ£7.27 .
It 's no surprise , then , that labels are ploughing their efforts into premium products to help bolster their bottom line and also to make physical products attractive again in an age of Spotify , YouTube and torrent sites .
Vinyl 's share of the market is growing , albeit from a small base ( just 0.6 % of all record sales in the UK last year ) and these days can cost three or four times what the CD equivalent sells for .
And right at the very top of the product range is the deluxe box set , boasting not just three or four discs , but dozens of them , featuring hours of unheard material , replicas of posters and tickets as well as sumptuous books with lengthy essays and moody photos .
The deluxe box normally starts at around ÃÂ£80 , with many selling around the ÃÂ£160 mark , but the most expensive box set in recent years was The Smiths Complete : Deluxe Collectors Box Set .
It featured all of the band 's albums and singles on vinyl as well as the albums again on CD .
Its global average retail price was ÃÂ£250 and 7,000 copies were sold .
That 's a retail value of ÃÂ£1.75 m for one release .
The maths is simple : just four or five successful , high - priced box sets , and you 've got millions coming in .
Is ÃÂ£250 as expensive as the box set can go ?
"" I would n't rule out us doing something more expensive if the content justified it , "" says Dan Chalmers , president of Rhino UK , the catalogue division of Warner Music that put out the Smiths ' set .
This , though , was an exceptional case Ã¢â¬ â where the size , age and wealth of the fanbase created a perfect market .
For most labels , the price can only be pushed to a certain point .
"" We try and keep things under ÃÂ£100 where possible , "" says Adam Velasco , the MD of Cherry Red Records , which specialises in crate - digger friendly collections of rather more obscure material .
"" For something to cost more , it would have to be pretty special . ""
The box - set market even produces its own , subsidiary market , just as new albums lead to deluxe editions .
Labels will issue a "" cut down "" version of big - ticket releases Ã¢â¬ â perhaps a two - disc version of a multi - disc set Ã¢â¬ â to appeal to a more mainstream shopper and increase sales , which helps cover the investment necessary to compile a worthwhile product , especially given the time they take to compile .
For example , it took eight years for Cherry Red to be able to put out a box - set version of Hawkwind 's Warrior on the Edge of Time , which was down to getting all the band members to sign off on it . ""
It takes a long time to get bands to agree to things , "" Velasco explains .
"" Some things you can do and some things are just not feasible . ""
Meanwhile , this year 's deluxe box set of Fleetwood Mac 's Rumours was supposed to come out a decade ago to mark its 25th anniversary .
This delay was down to "" various discussions with the band "" , says Chalmers .
One can only imagine the protracted debates and inter - band wrangling in that most fractious of groups .
Getting artist consent ( or the consent of their estate if they have died ) is key to a successful set , especially if they can also help promote it Ã¢â¬ â as the Moody Blues did for their ÃÂ£180 17-disc Timeless Flight box set , building a world tour around its promotion . ""
The more an artist is involved , the greater appeal it has to fans , "" says Karen Simmonds , MD of Universal Music Catalogue .
"" You have to talk to the artists to ensure that they are comfortable with it and they are often contributing to what is going on . ""
Despite the money - spinning potential of these releases , there are some holdouts .
"" Not every artist wants to reissues their catalogue , "" says Chalmers . ""
Joni Mitchell , for example , does n't want to reissue Blue at this stage .
Whereas we would love to .
So there is a continual discussion with her and her camp . ""
On the inverse of this are REM whose manager , Bertis Downs , is working on a five - year plan for a series of major box sets with Rhino including their MTV Unplugged performance in 1991 and the following year 's Automatic for the People , following a series of carefully curated and well received reissues of their first six albums .
Rhino is also planning major box sets for New Order and Led Zeppelin .
While it 's often the labels that drive the reissue market , there are artists who want to define their own legacy , too .
Paul McCartney owns all his post - Beatles catalogue and his company , MPL , decides what gets the box - set treatment and when they are released , with recent sets including Band on the Run in 2010 and Wings Over America this year .
"" We market and distribute it , "" says Simmonds of Universal 's involvement with the McCartney reissues , "" but the actual box sets are pulled together by MPL . ""
Looking across the range of box sets in the market , they betray something of a bias towards rock music .
Will other genres , like pop , ever get the same treatment ?
"" I think Madonna 's True Blue would work brilliantly , "" Chalmers says .
"" We are talking to Madonna and her reps about various product plans Ã¢â¬ â but a record like that would work perfectly .
I do n't think it 's limited to specific audiences .
"" The prevalence of the box set may be read as a reaction to the increasingly intangible nature of entertainment Ã¢â¬ â from movies on Netflix to books on Kindles Ã¢â¬ â and allows labels to charge a premium price for scarcity in an age of digital ubiquity .
A limited - edition release appeals to the super - fan as much as it appeals to the general collector .
"" We do get customers who buy two copies , "" says Velasco of the box sets Cherry Red puts out .
"" One to open and one to keep .
A lot of people see them as an investment as well . ""
That said , they also have to migrate digitally as labels look to exploit every revenue opportunity they can Ã¢â¬ â but not in a way that cannibalises the box - set sales .
The price will be significantly lower on download stores
Ã¢â¬ â the 20th anniversary box set of Nirvana 's In Utero
was ÃÂ£80 for a physical copy but only ÃÂ£29.99 on iTunes Ã¢â¬
â and that is partly down to the fact that it wo n't come with the DVDs or the coffee table books
Ã¢â¬ â all you get is the music .
"" iTunes ca n't retail the audio and the DVD content together , "" Simmonds says .
"" So there might be 10 discs of audio but then you have to buy the DVD element on iTunes separately .
"" There are other , wider , retail issues here as well .
The slimming down of HMV means fewer high - street music - retail outlets ; while for the shops that remain , box sets take up a lot of shelf space .
That means labels are increasingly selling box sets via Amazon but also selling them through their own online retail channels , which removes the retailer 's cut and make the boxes even more lucrative .
There is an old joke in the record business about albums shipping platinum ( 300,000 records going to retailers ) but returning gold ( 100,000 of them coming back unsold ) .
Box sets rarely face such embarrassing overproduction issues as they are generally around acts with a known fanbase and , being limited runs , they can sell quickly . ""
These box sets are expensive and time - consuming to do , "" says Velasco .
"" We would n't start it unless we were very confident of it washing its face . ""
If anything , box sets are going to become even more important to labels , especially following recent changes to UK copyright law covering sound recordings , extending the copyright term to 70 years .
Within these changes is what is termed a "" use it or lose it clause "" which says the recordings can revert back to the artists if the copyright owners , in this case the labels , do not commercially exploit them .
So more box sets will be inevitable to avoid labels losing control of their catalogues .
"" It 's great for us
and it 's great for the artists as well , "" says Chalmers of the copyright term extension .
"" There are a number of PD [ pubic domain ] reissues going to market that , in a lot of cases , are substandard . ""
The record industry swelled its coffers in the 1980s and 1990s with the CD reissue boom , cannily getting people to buy their record collections again on a more expensive format .
Box sets are an extension of that logic , so if labels can get super - fans to shell out three figures on a single release , then that 's a hell of a trick to pull off .
And it 's not one they 'll want to stop trying any time soon ."
2013-12-06,"Noel Gallagher expects to release his next solo album in 2015 .
After what he describes a "" dog - shit year "" , Gallagher plans to spend most of 2014 recording the next outing of his band High Flying Birds - and hoping to run into David Bowie .
"" I do n't think I 'll ever take this much time off again , "" Gallagher revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone .
While the 46-year - old wrote new songs this year , he said he has n't started recording them yet .
"" I was kind of going to see the rest of [ 2013 ] out and then kind of spend most of next year in the studio .
I hope to do some recording in New York , because I 've never done it before , and maybe on the off chance I might bump into David Bowie somewhere on the street , and get him to come down to the studio , dressed as an elf , and do a little mime while I 'm putting [ sic ] an acoustic guitar track . ""
Gallagher is definitely not intent on mimicking Arcade Fire 's recent collaboration with Bowie , however .
Whereas Bowie 's The Next Day is "" a fucking masterpiece "" , Gallagher described Arcade Fire 's music as "" shit disco "" .
And that 's without listening to their new double album .
"" Anybody that comes back with a double album , to me , needs to pry themselves out of their own asshole , "" Gallagher complained .
"" Who has the fucking time , in 2013 , to sit through 45 minutes of a single album ? ""
Nor is he a fan of Arcade Fire 's dress code .
"" Everybody 's dressed as one of the Three Musketeers on acid . '
What was the gig like ? ' '
I do n't know , everyone was dressed as a teddy bear in the 70s . ' '
Yeah , but what was the gig like ? ' '
Ah , fuck knows , man , I have no idea .
I was dressed as a flying saucer . '
""
Thankfully , Rolling Stone also surveyed Gallagher 's views on some of 2013 's other major releases .
Disclosure : "" Truly fucking amazing . ""
Miley Cyrus : "" not very good . ""
Robin Thicke : "" a one - hit wonder . ""
Gallagher likes "" half "" of Arctic Monkeys ' AM , thinks Kanye West 's Yeezus is "" fucking great "" and describes Daft Punk 's song
Get Lucky as "" effortless and brilliant "" .
And as for Lady Gaga ?
"" She 's probably doing a shit on top of a boiled egg right now . ""
Noel Gallagher 's High Flying Birds was the UK 's second highest - selling rock album of 2011 ."
2013-12-11,"Stars including Benedict Cumberbatch , Gillian Anderson , Nick Cave and Neil Gaiman turned out to perform at charity event Letters Live on Tuesday night .
Reading extracts from Simon Garfield 's To the Letter and Shaun
Usher 's Letters of Note books , the actors , writers and musicians brought to life the power of letters .
The many highlights included Anderson 's moving reading of a letter from Katharine Hepburn to Spencer Tracy ; Cumberbatch and Kerry Fox reading a couple 's wartime correspondence ; Peter Serafinowicz doing a David Bowie impression ; and Cave reading his infamous message rejecting an MTV Music Awards nomination .
At the end of the evening , Anderson chaired an auction of books , with Cumberbatch gamely holding up a signed volume .
Gaiman joked that the book 's value would be increased by it containing DNA from Cumberbatch 's sweaty hands ; Anderson then licked it in an attempt to boost the bids even further . ""
Imagine the cloning possibilities ! ""
said Gaiman .
Bidding proceeded at a spritely pace , with a cartel formed by Times columnist Caitlin Moran , writer John Niven and musician / BBC 6 Music presenter Guy Garvey taking a prominent part .
In the end , the auction raised more than ÃÂ£10,000 for literary charity the Reading Agency
Ã¢â¬ â surely something worth writing about ."
2013-12-13,"This morning , the UK awoke to the news that BeyoncÃ Â© 's fifth had dropped overnight .
It materialised on iTunes without fanfare or preamble , not unlike the return of David Bowie via his single , Where Are We Now , in January .
Everyone believed , though , that The Dame was ailing , allowing Bowie to plot in total secrecy .
With Queen Be , clues littered the floor , like designer clothes at a styling : a couple of sort - of singles doubling as adverts , that could not exist in a vacuum ; the fact that Be5 should really have come out months ago .
These things tend to go tongue - in - groove with singles , world tours , Super Bowl gigs and the public filming of videos in various exotic locations .
The announcement a few days ago of further Mrs Carter UK dates in February made most fans drum their fingers even more expectantly .
Everybody knew a Be opus had to materialise , and one of the best times for a major US pop artist to descend into the marketplace is in the lucrative fourth quarter .
The surprise here is the format , not the delivery .
BeyoncÃ Â© is a "" visual album "" , in which every song comes with a short film .
According to the press release , it 's a "" fully immersive multi - platform experience "" that completely "" chang[es ] the way her fans consume music "" .
Well , no : there are just lots of videos , magisterially shot by names such as Jonas Ã
â¦ kerlund and Hype Williams ( but also Terry Richardson ) , all more or less circling one familiar Be vibe : lush porny luxe ( or , indeed , luxe porny lushness ) .
As befits an album of mixed media , the messages are mixed too .
There is a hell of a lot of high - quality come - hithering , in song and on film .
The first visual message is that BeyoncÃ Â© has got her body back , and she intends to use it .
No Angel is pretty much as described : a winningly stark baroque'n'B track in which BeyoncÃ Â© declares she is no angel , and neither is the object of her affections , who seems to live in the less salubrious postcodes of Atlanta and sport a grill .
Blow ( oh yes ) is a straight - up funk cut with shades of Prince in which BeyoncÃ Â© 's "" cherry "" is "" turned out "" .
Drunk in Love , meanwhile , finds BeyoncÃ Â© rapping lasciviously and making eyes at her husband .
It 's about 100 times better than that description allows for , and the video finds them on a beach
Ã¢â¬ â somewhere in the Med , at a guess
Ã¢â¬ â acting drunk and in love .
Less originally , the high - concept Haunted video finds BeyoncÃ Â© in a posh hotel populated by sexually motivated freaks , with many shades of Madonna invoked .
The song itself ?
It 's a classy dance - pop tune about being haunted in love that begs a play untethered from all the high - end fashion shoot furnishings .
But BeyoncÃ Â© has plenty of depths as well as curves and swish .
There are home videos of her winning things as a child , and cameos by her sister Solange and various Destiny 's Children .
Even better , there are at least two baldly ( post-)feminist statements here , at either end of the album .
Pretty Hurts is Ã¢â¬ â broadly Ã¢â¬ â 21st - century soul music , in that BeyoncÃ Â© is questioning the relentless need for women to beautify themselves when "" it 's the soul that needs the surgery "" .
Obviously , the beauty pageant video makes much of her own prettiness , but there 's some perspective in the painful depilating , pill - popping and toilet - hugging details .
Further in is Flawless ( known in an earlier version as Bow Down Bitches ) , in which BeyoncÃ Â© relocates to some black - and - white gritty fashion shoot , complete with skinheads , once again to question the tyranny of judging books by their covers .
Best of all is the mid - song excerpt from a TED speech by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie , despairing of how we raise girls to be good wives , not to have "" too much "" ambition .
Sometimes , BeyoncÃ Â© ( the album ) suffers slightly from the need to borrow Ã¢â¬ â curiously , since BeyoncÃ Â© ( the person ) is one of pop 's most recognisable auditory and visual presences .
It 's not a bad track at all , but YoncÃ Â© has more than a few shades of MIA .
BeyoncÃ
Â© 's slightly more Caribbean cadences , meanwhile , owe more than a little something to Rihanna .
The duet with Drake , Mine , just does n't ignite , chiefly because the chemistry that fires in Drake and Rihanna 's collaborations is utterly absent here .
There is goo here too , in the form of Blue , in which Blue Ivy Carter is dandled on a Brazilian beachfront video shoot .
Fans are thanked with XO , which is less mawkish and noisome than most teary - eyed tributes to the people who shell out increasing quantities of money to see their idols play live .
BeyoncÃ Â© 's thoughts are with those ordinary civilians on Ghost , in which she raps about her gilded life versus "" all those people working 9 - 5 just to stay alive "" over a nicely arrhythmic heartbeat .
Blue aside , there are really none of the dire ballads that so often mar pop R&amp;B releases .
BeyoncÃ Â© 's vocals span some squeaky sexed - up falsettos , hood rat rapping , wordless ecstasies and effortless swoops .
The best surprise of all , in an autumn in which BeyoncÃ Â© 's closest competitors Ã¢â¬ â Gaga , Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus Ã¢â¬ â made underperforming bids for the throne , is how thoroughly assured , immersive and substantial this album is ."
2013-12-19,"Trent Reznor , bandleader of Nine Inch Nails and Oscar - winning composer , has written a passionate appreciation of David Bowie in The Hollywood Reporter .
Earlier in the year , Bowie released his new album The Next Day without any warning , and it went on to be hailed as one of the best from his later period .
Reznor is full of praise for the album , saying that after a period of thinking it was "" conservative "" , it became one of his favourites of the year . ""
When I 'm sitting alone to listen to music , I reach for The Next Day , "" he writes .
"" I 'm still unraveling the riddle that he presented , I 'm still getting new meanings out of the lyrics .
What I thought was conservative production now feels forward - thinking . ""
He describes Bowie as "" the most important figure to have inspired me .
To a kid growing up in rural Pennsylvania , out of reach of college radio and on the wrong side of the Internet Ã¢â¬ â in isolation Ã¢â¬ â to see this alien creep in , this larger - than - life character who was smart ... he 's been a consistent reference point as somebody who is uncompromising . ""
Reznor also praises the marketing , where Bowie released the album with none of the preamble and fanfare that usually surrounds album campaigns ( a tack recently taken by BeyoncÃ Â© ) .
"" The marketing , too , felt like a breath of fresh air .
It was n't like the Arcade Fire album [ Reflektor ] and its yearlong rollout , where it was like , '
OK , I get it .
You 've got an album out , you 've played every TV show in the world . '
"" Nine Inch Nails released their own album Hesitation Marks this year , after they returned with a new lineup
Ã¢â¬ â King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew later left the band weeks before they were due to go on their current world tour .
During an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit a fortnight ago , Reznor announced that Nine Inch Nails would return for another leg of the tour in 2014 .
"" We 're currently rehearsing with a new incarnation of the band for what 's ahead , "" he said .
"" This keeps things fresh from a musician 's perspective , but also keeps things interesting for fans in an era where every show ends up on YouTube .
The setlist and presentation moving forward will be very different from what we just did . ""
A six - date UK tour begins on May 18 in Birmingham .
Reznor is also on the team launching Beats Music , the music streaming service from Dr Dre 's hugely successful headphone company Beats Electronics , which launches in early 2014 and could become a chief competitor to Spotify and iTunes ."
2013-12-20,"Two tracks from BeyoncÃ
Â© 's self - titled new album are now available on Spotify :
Drunk In Love with husband Jay Z , and XO .
The album was announced without any preamble last week , appearing for download on iTunes with videos accompanying each track , and now is being broadened out to the streaming service .
BeyoncÃ
Â© 's move
surprised many , but was another instance of artists suddenly announcing albums rather than trailing them for weeks beforehand , with David Bowie and My Bloody Valentine using similar strategies recently .
However , BeyoncÃ Â© 's was perhaps the most high - profile and successful , generating massive sales : nearly 900,000 sold in three days .
It further suggests that physical copies of music are increasingly unnecessary for many consumers , and that bonus content Ã¢â¬ â here , the beautifully styled videos from the likes of Jonas Akerlund and Terry Richardson Ã¢â¬ â is increasingly valuable .
The fact that single tracks from the album are currently still unavailable will also have driven the uptake of the whole LP .
It could also be said that her strategy shows it 's worth staying away from streaming services , at least initially .
Albums from stars like Adele did n't see a dip in sales because they did n't feature on streaming sites Ã¢â¬ â and arguably may have actually sold more as a result .
However , Spotify countered those claims last year , saying that there was n't "" a molecule of evidence that there is any cannibalistic effect "" on iTunes sales from their service ."

2014-01-03,"Morrissey : Lord of the Flies Wave upon wave upon wave upon wave
washed me up on the desolate , disconsolate island of Rock Celebrity .
A drummer called Martin Joyce and a bassist , whose name I could n't remember , dragged my naked body through the undergrowth to a campfire where lawyers and record executives pranced , danced and tranced to a third rate David Bowie soundtrack . ""
The Beastie is among us , "" they shrieked , their laughs ringing , singing , pinging through the hot night air .
I rose unsteadily to my feet , my body weak with hunger and blood pouring from the stigmata . ""
The Beastie is you , "" I whispered .
My words , like the birds , went unheard .
They pushed me to the ground .
First they sliced off my left leg .
My right leg was not even fully severed before I felt teeth tearing the flesh from my sighing thigh . ""
Forgive them Father , for they know not what they do , "" I cried as I died .
As the sun rose the following morning , the drones moaned and groaned , yearning for a forgiveness that would never be theirs .
Morrissey :
The Outsider It was wet .
Very wet .
My mother had died last week .
Or maybe the week before .
Nancy died yesterday .
Or maybe today .
The number 38 bus from Bury had skidded out of control on an icy pothole and crushed her against the wall of the Job Centre .
I did n't go to their funerals .
Why should I ?
What difference would my hollow tears make to ease their passing .
Besides which it was still wet .
So I stayed indoors to watch Coronation Street .
The rain stopped briefly so I went outside .
I started walking along the canal , doing my best to avoid the dog shit and the crumpled beer cans .
The rain started falling again .
At first lightly , but then ever more heavily .
I took off my coat to allow my clothes to get soaked .
A man appeared .
"" It 's me , Johnny Marr , "" he said .
"" Do I know you ? ""
I asked .
He claimed that I did , but I had no recollection .
His persistence annoyed me
so I clubbed him to death with a bunch of gladioli .
I carried on walking .
It was still raining .
The police came to my bedsit to arrest me . ""
Why did you kill him ?
"" they asked .
"" That 's such a boring question , "" I replied .
"" How should I know ?
It was wet .
That 's all I can say .
"" The judge sentenced me to death .
What did I care ?
I was dead already .
And it was still very wet .
Morrissey :
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
We were somewhere on the edge of Salford industrial estate when the peppermint tea took hold .
It was Keith , my friend from Didsbury , who was driving the second - hand Austin Maxi who spotted Brian standing outside the fish and chip shop that had been shut down the week before . ""
Thanks for picking me up , "" said Brian .
"" Are you going to the model railway convention in Rochdale as well ? ""
Keith nodded and handed Brian a ginseng cigarette .
We sat in silence as Keith gunned the car up to 30 mph before slowing down for a red light on the A58 junction with Edinburgh Way .
The receptionist gave us a slightly odd look as we checked in to the Premier Inn .
I pretended I had n't noticed and took the lift to room 312 where I unpacked my overnight case .
I laid out my stash of herbal remedies on the spare bed and poured two litres of rosemary oil into a hot bath .
My head started spinning .
"" Are you coming down to the convention ? ""
Keith asked .
"" There 's a fascinating demonstration of some new adhesives . ""
"" I do n't think I 'll bother , "" I said .
"" I rather fancy an early night .

What do you think Morrissey 's debut novel will be about ?
Give us your interpretation in the comments below"
2014-01-07,"Capacity : 2,450 in the main room , 300 in the basement .
Who plays there : Big names from Rock City 's past include Nirvana , Oasis , David Bowie , REM , Guns N ' Roses and Blur .
The roster is slanted towards rock , as the name would imply , but other genres still get a look in ; to the disgust of regulars , Blue played here in 2013 .
The NME tour is an annual fixture , as are the Dot to Dot and Hit the Deck festivals , covering indie and rock respectively .
Other recent acts include Two Door Cinema Club , the Deftones , Foals , Bastille , Suede , Public Enemy , Alt - J , the 1975 , Johnny Marr , AlunaGeorge , Gary Numan and Disclosure .
Cloakroom :
Yes , but expect to queue on the way out .
Admission :
ÃÂ£10 to ÃÂ£25 .
You can avoid booking fees by paying cash at the box office , which is open from 10 am to 6 pm Monday to Saturday .
Bar :
There are two bars at either side of the main room , and there are also bars in the basement and balcony .
There can be quite a crush on busy nights , but service is quick and efficient .
For the iron - bladdered , two - pint beer cups are available .
Food :
No .
Toilets :
One set in the entrance lobby , and a much larger set at the back of the main hall , with attendant .
Wheelchair access : In theory , there 's ramped access at the rear of the building Ã¢â¬ â but it 's not the main entrance , and you 'd need to let the venue know in advance .
In practice , you 'll rarely see a wheelchair at Rock City on a gig night .
If you 've ever been there , you 'll understand why .
Sound : Reliably crisp and clear , punchy and full .
Where to stand : Aim towards the right - hand side of the venue , and you 'll find there 's less of a crush ; you 'll also get served quicker at the bar .
The back right - hand corner of the main floor is usually comfortable , even on sold - out nights ; turn left just past the mixing desk and squeeze your way down the steps .
If you ca n't face the main floor , the balcony has recently been extended on the right - hand side , but you should still arrive early to claim a front - row spot ; arrive late , and you 'll struggle to get a good view .
Alternatively , position yourself directly behind the sound desk for a perfect view of the stage .
Avoid the raised area at the very back of the venue ; it 's often the most crowded part of the whole room , and sound and vision are much better elsewhere .
If you arrive early , you can also bag a good place on the stepped area at the right of the floor Ã¢â¬ â but in truth , the back of the floor is n't nearly as scary as some seem to think .
( That said , big mosh circles regularly form in the middle , even for acts as notionally sedate as Alt - J. )
Overall : Rock City 's reputation as one of the best venues in the country is long held , and well deserved .
It 's a favourite stop - off for many acts , and the atmosphere on a big night ca n't be beaten .
The over - controlled corporate feel of the big national chains is mercifully absent Ã¢â¬ â although the security staff are far from cuddly Ã¢â¬ â and the venue 's legendary sticky floors are an integral part of its authentic , no - frills charm .

2014-01-15,"Fashion 's love of rock'n'roll stars is as old as the hills .
See a young Mick Jagger photographed , hood up , by David Bailey in 1965 or Jean Paul Gaultier 's costumes for Madonna 's Blond Ambition tour in 1990 .
The latest incarnation of this love story is a trend for ditching models Ã¢â¬ â traditionally a blank canvas for brands Ã¢â¬ â and replacing them with something a bit more Ã¢â¬ â in the nicest possible way Ã¢â¬ â craggy .

2014-01-27,"The Arctic Monkeys saw off formidable competition on Monday evening from David Bowie 's critically acclaimed first album for a decade to win the pop music award at the 2014 South Bank awards .
Other winners included artist Tracey Emin , who received an Outstanding Achievement Award .
She was presented with the award by comedian Frank Skinner .
The awards , which were presented on Monday evening in an event hosted by Melvyn Bragg , will be shown on Thursday on Sky Arts , sponsors of the 17-year - old event .
Her success meant that there was double disappointment for Steve Coogan , who was making his third consecutive appearance on the shortlist , but missed out winning the comedy award for his film , Alan Partridge :
Alpha Papa .
The Oscar - nominated film Philomena , in which Coogan also starred , lost out in the film category to The Selfish Giant , Clio Barnard 's story of the life of a teenage scrap scavenger .
In other results , the theatre award was won by Let The Right One In ( National Theatre of Scotland ) , beating Othello ( The National Theatre ) and Chimerica
( Headlong and Almeida Theatre )
while Life After Life by Kate Atkinson won the literature award .
ITV thriller Broadchurch , starring Olivia Colman and David Tennant , won best TV drama , beating the BBC 's Top Of The Lake and The Fall ."
2014-02-19,"Arguably the biggest surprise would have been if he had turned up , but David Bowie proved some stars are big enough not to have make themselves available when he won the British male solo artist award at the Brits Ã¢â¬ â and used his proxy acceptance speech to ask : "" Scotland , stay with us . ""
The win made the 67-year - old pop legend the oldest ever winner of a Brit , passing Tom Jones , who won the outstanding contribution award in 2003 , when he was a mere 62 .
Kate Moss accepted the award from Noel Gallagher on Bowqie 's behalf , reading out a statement that was equal parts baffling and gracious .
It was Bowie 's first recognition at the Brits since his 1996 outstanding contribution award , and his first for a specific year 's work since he won best British male in 1984 .
He had been nominated for last year 's Mercury Music Prize , but failed to win Ã¢â¬ â and did n't turn up to that ceremony either .
Bowie 's return to the pop fray with The Next Day last year
Ã¢â¬ â 10 years after his previous album
, Reality Ã¢â¬ â proved to be a masterpiece of campaign management .
His 24th album was announced without any hint of warning in January 2013 , trailed by a mournful , elegiac single , Where Are We Now ?
And despite the incredible amounts of press coverage his re - emergence provoked , the man himself stayed silent , leaving his friends and collaborators to do his talking for him .
The silence was in keeping with the recording of The Next Day Ã¢â¬ â although the album had been two years in the making , no word of it had crept out .
As Bowie insiders told the Guardian last year , he was able to keep it that way because the team around him is so small that very few people even knew he was recording .

Watch David Bowie 's video for The Next Day here Not that the silence was always willing .
"" I was on the cover of Guitar Player magazine , "" Bowie 's longtime guitarist Earl Slick told the Guardian .
"" It was the Christmas issue , the one you want to be on the cover of , the one that 's on the newsstands twice as long .
And I 'm making a new Bowie album
and I ca n't tell them anything .
The only person I told was my manager . ""
However , sales of The Next Day were , while decent , hardly spectacular .
And it 's notable that Bowie won the male solo artist award , rather than the best album prize , for which he was also nominated .
The Next Day 's sales of just over 250,000 paled in comparison to those of the other nominated albums Ã¢â¬ â 550,000 for both Bastille 's Bad Blood and Arctic Monkeys ' AM , and around 450,000 for Disclosure 's Settle and Rudimental 's Home ."
2014-02-19,"Arctic Monkeys have won British album of the year for AM at this year 's Brit Awards .
AM , their fifth studio album , beat off competition from Bastille 's Bad Blood , David Bowie 's The Next Day , Disclosure 's Settle and Rudimental 's Home to win the Philip Treacy - designed statue .
Having won British group earlier in the evening , they have become the first band to do the double Ã¢â¬ â win British album and British group Ã¢â¬ â three times .
Coldplay and Manic Street Preachers have both won the double twice . ""
That rock'n'roll , it looks like it 's fading away , but it 'll never die , "" Alex Turner said in an acceptance speech that was so laconic it bordered on self parody .
Released through Domino in September 2013 , the album , which includes the rhetorically - titled singles R U Mine ? ,
Do I
Wanna Know ?
and Why 'd You Only Call Me
When You 're High ? , has been instrumental in the group 's reaching a milestone in American music culture : selling out a US arena tour for the first time .
The Arctic Monkeys first broke on to the Brits scene when they beat the likes of KT Tunstall and James Blunt to win British breakthrough act back in 2006 .
Since then , they have won a clutch of awards .
Despite their success , the band have had a colourful relationship with the annual pop awards .
In 2007 , they did n't attend but accepted their prizes over video dressed first as Village People lookalikes , and then as characters from the Wizard of Oz .
In 2008 , dressed as country gentlemen , they had their acceptance speech cut short by ITV bosses for their slurred disses of the Brit school ."
2014-02-19,"The 2014 Brit awards opened in a hail of bad publicity , although there were at least some voices keen to drum up excitement about the forthcoming ceremony . ""
Stars arrive in London for the Brits "" offered the giant Sky News screen in London 's Victoria station before the ceremony began , gamely illustrating its story with a photo of David Bowie .
It was tempting to suggest that Bowie was no more likely to turn up at the Brits than he was to turn up at Victoria station and start flogging mocha frappe lattes on the Caffe Nero stand by Platform 18 , but there was always the chance he 'd been persuaded to draw a line under a decade of zealously guarded privacy not merely by the prospect of snatching the best British male prize from under the noses of Jake Bugg and Tom Odell , but the enticing opportunity to sit in the O2 Arena and watch Bastille and James Corden .
But even the wild suggestion that the reclusive chameleon of rock might show up was drowned out by the din caused when an angry broadsheet journalist went public with the list of demands made upon attending members of the press by sponsors MasterCard 's PR agency , in which regularly and enthusiastically mentioning the credit card and its slogan Priceless Moments on Twitter figured heavily .
By mid - morning , the slogan had been hijacked : the social media site was indeed awash with the # PricelessSurprises hashtag , alas attached to tweets suggesting surprises including "" being told you 've got chlamydia "" .
The Brit organisers might reasonably have surmised that things could only get better once the ceremony was under way , which they duly did .
Despite triumphing in his category , Bowie was a no show Ã¢â¬ â perhaps he was busy knocking up a chai latte by platform 18 in Victoria station - which meant he missed not merely Corden making jokes about cocaine and daringly marking the passing of the watershed by saying "" shit "" , but the Brits going about their usual thing of presenting awards to exactly the artists you 'd expect , the Brits being in the business of rewarding success .
It would have been nice had John Grant unexpectedly walked off with the best international male , but it was never going to happen in a category that also featured Bruno Mars ; whatever the qualities of their fellow nominees , Bastille were always going to win best newcomer , because they 'd sold more albums .
In fairness , they told you what you already knew with a greater degree of panache than last year , when the Brit Awards ' deathless quest for what their chairman describes as "" gravitas "" led them to put together an awards ceremony that had all the gravitas and indeed all the entertainment value of a meeting of the environment food and rural affairs committee .
They pulled off a number of coups , a lot of which involved the curious business of , as Corden put it , "" celebrating a year in which British acts have taken the world by storm "" by getting acts who were n't British to turn up .
Prince was inveigled into presenting an award , there were performances from Pharrell Williams , Lorde and BeyoncÃ
Â© , the latter clearly the star of the show , particularly given that Lorde 's much - vaunted collaboration with Disclosure did n't really spark in the way you might have hoped .
But not all : they got the Arctic Monkeys to open the show , which was certainly an advance on previous years , when they 'd either declined to turn up or turned up and been so rude about the performing arts school funded by the Brits that their acceptance speech was cut off .
Indeed , given that Noel Gallagher Ã¢â¬ â who some years ago enlivened proceedings with the intriguing suggestion that "" there 's only five people in this room who really know what 's going on in this country and that 's me , our kid , Bonehead , Alan Mcgee and Tony Blair
"" Ã¢â¬ â appeared onstage without incident , you could say that the 2014 ceremony was marked by formerly errant attendees being brought to heel .
There was a hint of the chaotic spirit of Brits past when model
Rosie Huntingdon - Whitely left a dramatic pause before announcing One Direction as winners of a category in which they 'd already been announced as winners by means of a lengthy video , but that 's about as dangerous as it got , unless you count David Bowie 's acceptance speech Ã¢â¬ â read by Kate Moss Ã¢â¬ â in which he appeared to throw his weigh against Scottish independence .
Still , given that last year the main danger at the Brits was one or more of the viewers expiring from boredom , then that might be considered an advance ."
2014-02-19,"Prince will make an appearance Given that Prince has been turning up at front rooms , concert halls and quite possibly your local laundrette to play until the early hours , it would have been a bit useless if the Brits couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have got him to appear for them as well .
The five - time Brit winner will be presenting the nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first award with his band
3RDEYEGIRL and we can only hope he throws some additional live action in at some point too ( although his fondness for noodling on past the curfew might not go down to well with organisers
Ã¢â¬
â just ask Adele ) .
Will David Bowie win again ?
It was 30 years ago that David Bowie won his first Brit award Ã¢â¬ â for British male solo artist .
Can he do it again , now that his rivals ( Jake Bugg , John Newman , James Blake and Tom Odell ) are all young enough to be his grandchildren ?
Sam Smith will be the next solo person to win a criticsÃ¢â¬ â¢ choice award
In the seven years since the criticsÃ¢â¬ â¢ choice award was introduced , the Brits has yet to award it to a band or even a duo .
Adele , Florence , Ellie Goulding , Jessie J , Emeli SandÃ Â© and Tom Odell have received it in the past , but if you think this category lacks verve and rebellion then fear not : this year it goes to that bloke who sang on a Disclosure record .
Arctic Monkeys could do a historic double Winning the best album and the best group award is what all bands dream of , or at least it might be if any band had ever dreamed about the Brit awards in any capacity whatsoever beyond the one where theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re suddenly at the ceremony , naked , and have no idea where their clothes are .
Anyway , three bands have won the double twice : Coldplay , Manic Street Preachers and Arctic Monkeys .
But only the Monkeys have the chance to make it three on Wednesday night as theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re nominated once more for both gongs ( see the full nominees list here ) .
A lot of new artists could win awards Nobody could really hail the sales success of Bastille as a sign of a changing of the guard in pop .
If guitar music is to ever make a full - scale assault on the music scene again youÃ¢â¬ â¢
d imagine it needs something a bit more incendiary to spark it off .
But the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s four nominations put them alongside dance duo Disclosure as acts who could potentially gain a massive lift in exposure from the night .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not the only new artists nominated , either , with Rudimental , London Grammar , Laura Mvula , John Newman and Naughty Boy all up for awards .
There will be some not very British performances Live performances on the night come from those famous chroniclers of this septic isle Katy Perry , Pharrell Williams and Bruno Mars .
The Arctic Monkeys are also playing , although given that they live in LA these days and spend much of their time sounding like Elvis fronting a desert blues band , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not entirely clear if they count .
For those who genuinely do get quite nationalistic about this kind of thing , though , fear not : Ellie Goulding , Rudimental and Bastille will be flying the flag for the British pop .
John Grant will battle it out with Eminem Sadly not via the medium of battle rap Ã¢â¬ â although admittedly organisers are yet to rule this out Ã¢â¬ â but in the category of best international male , which sees the songwriter behind the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s second best album of 2013 ( Pale Green Ghosts ) also take on Bruno Mars , Drake and Justin Timberlake .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s our favourite mismatch since Cat Power took on BeyoncÃ Â© , Pink and Nelly Furtado back in 2007 .
The Brits will go punk
Not the event itself ( obvs ) but the award statuette .
Fashion designer Philip Treacy is behind this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
trophy , following in the footsteps of Vivienne Westwood , Peter Blake and Damien Hirst .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bit more understated than usual Ã¢â¬ â black - and - white statuette with , er , a massive great mohawk on it .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hope the winners are careful Ã¢â¬ â you could have someoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eye out with that etc etc .
You will spend the night on Twitter
Suddenly the music industry is getting all modern , compiling the Top 40 using track streams and announcing that this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s British video award will be voted for on Twitter .

2014-02-19,"Like many groups who came to prominence in 1977 and 78 , Devo had been around in various forms for several years .
Beginning in the comparative isolation of Ohio Ã¢â¬ â where , as a student , co - founder Gerald Casale had witnessed the 1970 Kent State shootings Ã¢â¬ â Devo were fully formed , with several recordings and a whole aesthetic ready to go , by the time they played New York in the summer of 1977 .
On the strength of those shows Ã¢â¬ â and with the endorsement of Iggy Pop and David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â Devo signed a contract with Warner Music ( Virgin in the UK ) and began to create a rapid and successful sequence of recordings that culminated with Whip It , which reached No 14 in the US in spring 1980 .
Admirably suited to the MTV age , Devo were Ã¢â¬ â for many young Americans
Ã¢â¬ â the first new wave band of any consequence .
But their super - stylised image of black humour , dazzling visuals and catchy synth - pop hooks caught the attention of weirdos and outcasts everywhere .
Jocko Homo
As an intro to their early shows , Devo would play a 10-minute video titled In the Beginning Was the End :
The Truth About De - Evolution , which let audiences know what they were in for .
Made in 1976 and directed by Chuck Statler , it placed the band Ã¢â¬ â wearing face masks and uniform boiler suits
Ã¢â¬ â in various post - industrial locations , set to harsh analogue synthesiser tones .
Deliberately robotic , kitsch , wickedly funny : no one had seen anything like it before .
There were two performances , both interspersed with surreal , devolved scenarios : a killer version of Johnny RiversÃ¢â¬ â¢ 1966 hit Secret Agent Man , and this , an early version of their first single and mission statement , Jocko Homo .
You can get a flavour of the film from the Booji Boy segment at the opening , while the writhing human maggots give a foretaste of the audience rapture to come .

Devo had punk energy , but they were not afraid to experiment : a tough rhythm section enabled the synth and lead guitar to spiral off Ã¢â¬ â not a general punk trait .
Despite the VHS frazzle , you get the essential strangeness : the uniforms and robotic stances work against the wildness of the music , just as the underlying emotion cuts through the groupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s avowed distance and satire .
The audience just stand there .

In the infamous promo for the groupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best known song , from 1980 , everything comes together : the band uniforms Ã¢â¬ â those ziggurat hats !

I love how the band plays against the repetition to work up an incredible tension : this one still cuts it on the dancefloor .

2014-02-20,"David Bowie used his platform as the winner of the best British male solo artist on Wednesday night to make an unexpected intervention in the the debate over Scottish independence .
In a statement delivered by the model Kate Moss , who accepted the prize for him , Bowie said , "" Scotland , stay with us . ""
Bowie 's intervention was welcomed by those fighting independence .
The Labour MP Jim Murphy tweeted : "" David Bowie has had his say .
Now you can do your bit to back Scotland . ""
Senior figures in the yes campaign appeared to maintain a dignified silence .
The yes campaign for Scottish independence has come under unprecedented pressure in recent days .
George Osborne , the chancellor , said that a newly independent Scotland would not be allowed to re - enter a currency union with the rest of the UK , and JosÃ Â© Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission , said that Scotland would not automatically become a member of the European Union .
Bowie , at the age of 67 , is the oldest artist to win the best British male award .
The award was presented by Noel Gallagher , who remarked that Bowie was "" too cool "" to attend in person .
Bowie remained at his home in New York .
In his place , Moss said : "" Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
David has asked me to say this .
I 'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male Ã¢â¬
â
but I am , are n't I , Kate ?
Yes .
I think it 's a great way to end the day .
Thank you very , very much Ã¢â¬ Â¦ and Scotland , stay with us . ""
It 's not clear where Bowie 's attachment to Scotland derives from .
His father was a Yorshireman with a family name , Jones , often linked to Wales , while his mother was from Kent , although her maiden name was Burns .
Bowie was born and brought up in London .
Bowie 's win comes 30 years after he last collected the same title .
He made a surprise comeback last year when he released a new single on his 66th birthday and followed it up with an album weeks later , the Next Day , his first in 10 years .
Also on Wednesday , Danny Alexander , the chief secretary to the Treasury , told the Scottish Parliament 's economy committee that Scottish homeowners could face average annual mortgage increases of almost ÃÂ£5,200 under independence if the Scottish government walks away from its share of national debt .
He said any threats by Scotland 's first minister Alex Salmond to refuse to take a share of the debt as a result of the UK government 's rejection of a currency union could have a "" huge effect on mortgages and businesses "" ."
2014-02-20,"Amid the relentless Ibizafication of popular music that was the Brits last night , a welcome moment of real - worldery appeared at its close .
Kate Moss delivered a New York message from David Bowie , in which he cryptically accepted his lifetime award , but declared with ringing clarity at the end : "" Scotland Ã¢â¬ â stay with us "" .
Any hope that Bowie the icon might induce genuflection among the referendum don't - knows was instantly dashed on Twitter .
The # scottishbowie hashtag immediately wrestled him down into the dusty kailyard .
Ziggy played Stranraer , Scary Monsters ( Super Neeps ) , Speyside Oddity , Black Tie White Pudding , The Spiders from Largs , Hunky Doric , Under Perthshire Ã¢â¬ Â¦
The hits kept on coming .
But how will Bowie 's love - bombing play in the debate ?
It 's a truism about the yes campaign that they are teeming with stellar artists in all genres , who see a natural fit between their own , opportunity - friendly lives and the collective leap towards full independence .
This is in comparison with the somewhat threadbare Ã¢â¬ â or in Scots , shilpit Ã¢â¬ â pantheon of the no campaign .
Their most recent cultural intervention was a toe - curling Burns night viral video from John Barrowman , draped in the kind of tartan usually seen in dog mangers and over car seats .
( There are strong rumours that the Krankies , Barrowman 's partners in Glasgow panto , have also recorded a no endorsement .
Given Barrowman 's reception , we may need the data - retrieval powers of an Assange or Snowden to unearth that one . )
But though I am partisan , Ã¢â¬ â as a musician and Yes Scotland board member Ã¢â¬ â I would concede that Bowie has mildly troubled a few indy - minded creatives .
Mogwai 's Stuart Braithwaite is probably paradigmatic : "" I somehow forgave Bowie for the Placebo collaboration .
I 'm sure I can forgive him for this folly too . ""
Pro - yes comedian Frankie Boyle noted : "" I completely respect Bowie 's right to express views on independence , just as I 'd respect Iggy Pop 's opinions on the Cern particle accelerator . ""
The dramatist David Greig went into a meltdown of ambivalence : "" The weird thing is , I 'm feeling giddy that HE NOTICED US !
David Bowie mentioned Scotland !
We exist !
We 're real !
HE LOVES US !
And we love him .
"" I doubt this will dent the implacable momentum of the cultural supertanker behind yes ( see this list from the movement 's Diego Rivera , National Collective ) .
But it 's worth a second or two dwelling on Bowie 's own motivations here .
I recall his guano - spattered union jack frock coat , designed by Alexander McQueen , on the cover of his 1997 drum'n'bass record Earthling .
There are two ways to read this , of course .
Is Bowie displaying how disrespected and deconstructed the union flag is ?
Or , as his defiant stance might suggest , is he the last man standing to defend green and pleasant Britishness against detractors from all sides ?
But this is , of course , Bowie at his best Ã¢â¬ â bringing ambiguous art power into the pop mainstream .
Morrissey 's parallel Britology sends his devotees into just as many twisting spirals .
Certainly , deploying Kate "" she 's got the London look "" Moss to deliver a sentimental plea to rebellious Scots shows that the Dame has been reading the Danny Boyle , post - Olympic playbook of pluralist , capacious unionism .
Another thing : Bowie is 67 , and thus with some connection to a postwar generation which can feel Britishness in its bones , via a victorious war and a welfare state .
As any biography will also tell you , for all his shape - shifting brilliance , Bowie is a Royal Variety Performance vaudevillian at heart .
I can imagine him enthroned in his techno - lair in Manhattan , sampling news feeds from the old country , allowing tendrils of moist patriotism to penetrate his otherwise steely alien mind .
But from the indy side , we say : you can be The Man
Who Fell to Perth any time you like , David .
The saltired , heather - dusted frock coat has already been tailored , and awaits your beloved , skeletal frame .
We may borrow your line "" We can be heroes , just for one day "" , if that 's OK .
Though please explain that Japanese rabbit - on - the - moon reference in your speech before you come over .
On second thoughts Ã¢â¬ â mibbes naw .

2014-02-20,"Ã¢â¬Â¢ Not the best of months , perhaps , for the Scottish yes lobby , with the UK parties vowing not to share the pound and the EU president suggesting it might not let an independent Scotland join Ã¢â¬ â all topped off , most painfully of all , with the loss of David Bowie .
So hurrah for the curling , the ( Scottish ) sport in which five ( Scottish ) women on Thursday claimed bronze in Sochi , and five ( Scottish ) men compete on Friday for gold .
Were the country to sever from the union , indeed , the sport could provide a flagship industry for the new independent economy , with 70 % of the world 's curling stones manufactured by one small Kilmarnock company , Kays of Scotland ( got that ? ) .
The Sochi stones were made at Kays , quarried , like the rest , from the tiny Ayrshire island in the Firth of Clyde , Ailsa Craig , whose dense microgranite is commonly agreed to make the finest stones in the world .
The small workshop produces about five ÃÂ£400 stones a day , says the factory 's manager Bill Hunter , but production might have been down a bit this week as they have all , understandably , been gripped by the unfolding events on BBC Sport .
So was the women 's medal a victory for Team GB or for Scotland ? ""
As a personal view , albeit they are all Scots , it 's a British victory , "" says Hunter .
Oh dear .
Why ?

Twitter : @estheraddley"
2014-02-23,"A more childish aspect of the suddenly invigorated debate on Scottish independence was last week revealed in the response to the New York - based message of David Bowie , relayed through the unlikely figure of Kate Moss .
She had accepted Bowie 's award for best solo artist at the Brit awards . ""
Scotland stay with us , "" the 67-year - old icon had asked .
The subsequent outpourings on Twitter were mostly negative , puerile and cumulatively underlined the message that , without a sharp reversal of course , the Scotland debate that ought to be an important platform for a modern , informed and progressive exchange of views on the meaning of national identity , the value ( or otherwise ) of the union , and the possible development of a more positive form of nationalism , will prove elusive .
A few days before Bowie , JosÃ Â© Manuel Barroso , the European Commission president , had said it would be "" extremely difficult , if not impossible "" for an independent Scotland to join the EU .
George Osborne had already warned Scots that if they voted for separation they would not be able to join a currency union or use the British pound .
He was immediately accused of "" bullying "" .
The first opinion poll since his remarks showed a slight increase in support for independence .
The debate had appeared moribund , so the current flash and fire is welcome for its ignition , if not its erudition .
But we require fewer threats and fewer insults and a more informed discussion .
It would be good to hear the positive , uplifting and exciting aspects of both nationalism and the union , not least because , whatever the vote , the English and the Scots will need to live side by side .
The debate should be passionate , but also an adult , thoughtful , compelling exchange around the critical cultural , social , economic and political issues that the continuation Ã¢â¬ â or not Ã¢â¬ â of the 307-year old union presents ."
2014-02-28,"The debate about Scottish independence has been clattering away in the background for some time but with the vote now just six months away the noises off seem to have ratcheted up a level this week , transformed from a vague burble of hectoring anxieties into what can only be described as a slightly louder burble of hectoring anxieties .
Particularly striking was the news that David Cameron had let out "" a little cry of joy "" while watching David Bowie 's acceptance message at the Brit awards last week , when the Thin White Duke lectured via his proxy an audience of cocaine - fuelled music industry hangers - on about the overriding cultural importance of Scotland remaining part of the historic union .
It is easy to picture the reaction to this in the prime ministerial quarters .
The sudden cocking of the head .
The rustle of monogrammed pyjama .
The quivering upper lip .
The single hank of hair falling across that clammy dome .
And finally , in a reverie of snow - white alien pop god androgyny striding across the Tory blue re - election stage in spangled Tartan hot - pants , the little cry of joy , the retreat into moody silence , the half hour in the Chesterfield recliner listening to the Little Drummer Boy ( feat Bing Crosby ) .
This is a very important issue and there are clearly plenty of English people who do feel a distinct cultural connection with Scotland Ã¢â¬ â even a select class who tend to own large parts of it and see the Highlands in particular as a kind of rambling ancestral back garden tended by whisky - soaked tenant farmers .
But for many southerners the relationship with Scotland is , out of a combination of ignorance and distance , often quite vague .
It is a relationship that has in the last few decades been defined most obviously by sport ; and above all Ã¢â¬ â with all due apologies to everyone concerned Ã¢â¬ â by football .
The Scotification of English football goes back right to the start of things , a beautifully fertile process so deeply ingrained it could be argued there has never actually been a purely English club game at any stage .
Instead , pretty much every significant English club football triumph has had a Scottish tinge , from the early "" Scotch Professors "" who transformed the FA 's primitive dribbler 's blueprint into the combination game that is the basis of all modern football to the gaggles of ball - playing inside - forwards flushed from the Highland undergrowth by lasso - wielding speculator - agents to staff the newly booming southern leagues
Indeed in the past 25 years , the English top tier has been won 18 times by three different Scottish managers and just once by an Englishman .
And yet this is a relationship where independence has already effectively been declared .
The disappearance of Scottish players and Ã¢â¬ â yes , they 're coming for you
too Ã¢â¬ â Scottish managers from England 's top division is one of the unremarked slow - motion footballing tragedies of the past 20 years .
This week the current round of Champions League ties passed its midway point with four English clubs involved and just one Scottish player , Darren Fletcher , available to them .
This in itself seems poignant given the gloriously defining role Scotsmen have played in so many of English club football 's best moments overseas .
The years when English clubs dominated the old European Cup were essentially an AngloÃ¢â¬âScottish pact of iron , with at least three Scots in each of the Liverpool , Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa teams that won it six seasons out of eight between 1978 and 1984 .
This was the real golden age of the Anglo - Scots club game , a period when not only did Scotland produce the only genuinely brilliant football film ever made ( Gregory 's Girl , naturally ) but tough , inventive , alluringly distinctive Scottish footballers just seemed to fall from the skies like ripe autumn fruit .
There was a majesty to that generation of tightÃ¢â¬âshorted , skinny - legged Scots , a marriage of wiry power and grace in a player such as Alan Hansen , who did n't really look like a footballer at all but resembled instead some baleful , sardonic long - striding , new - romantic android warrior .
There were brilliant Scots everywhere , from Archie Gemmill , a small , galloping nodule of footballing gristle ; to the mooching , dreamy Steve Archibald , who carried with him the air of a languid and cosseted sixth form poet ; to Graeme Souness , the best kind of surprisingly sensitive terrifyingly angry hard man , the kind of surprisingly sensitive terrifyingly angry hard man who looks like he might insist on sitting you down and explaining exactly why it 's necessary to stamp his great thick stumpy little hatchet - man 's boot down on your ankle , doing it so eloquently and persuasively and with so many thrillingly enjoyable finger - stabs to the solar plexus that by the end you 're practically begging him to get on with it .
And yet somehow all this fine - point talent has disappeared .
By all accounts the problems in Scottish football are pretty much the same as those facing English football , just on a more annihilating scale : wider societal habits , lack of resources , clubs who buy in rather than train up , and a cycle of apparently irreversible hierarchical waste .
In the end Scotland 's decline just looks like another part of the wider falling away of the traditional northern European game , a concussive , mud - bound kind of footballing beauty that has no place in what is basically a summer sport now , dominated by more refined and systematic nations .
Independence for Scotland may or may not come about Ã¢â¬ â and there were even some weird political nuances in the unveiling this week of the national teams 's new away kit in the racing colours of the Earl of Rosebery , Old Etonian prime minister and a staunch opponent of Irish independence in his time , an act of subtextual football kit politics that might even have drawn yet another little gasp of joy No10 Downing Street .
But whichever way this ends up going , one thing is certain .
We will always have football , an indissoluble shared Anglo - Scottish sporting history , and that brief glorious period when together we were kings ."
2014-03-02,"It was the fastest - selling show the Victoria and Albert Museum has ever staged .
But when the David Bowie Is exhibition moves to Berlin this summer , there will be a few notable tweaks .
Bowie 's cathartic years in the chrysalis of divided Berlin are counted as among the singer 's most innovative .
And so the show will be transformed from the excesses of glam to the more subtle influences that mid-1970s Europe exerted on the Thin White Duke .
Gazing out of a studio window at the Berlin Wall one day , the story goes , David Bowie watched a couple kissing under a watchtower .
Inspired , he scribbled the lyrics for Heroes , in which a pair of star - crossed lovers are briefly reunited across the Iron Curtain .
The anthem forms the audio backdrop to the specially curated Berlin version of the exhibition , which opens in May at the Martin - Gropius - Bau near Potsdamer Platz , a stone 's throw from Hansa studios where the artist recorded part of his Berlin trilogy , Low , Heroes and Lodger . ""
The song revolves around the idea that anyone can be anything , which is fundamental to Bowie , "" said Geoffrey Marsh , director of the V&amp;A 's Department of Theatre and Performance and co - curator of David Bowie Is .
"" Berlin played such a critical part in Bowie 's development , we wanted to include more about the city while there . ""
The reworked multimedia installation , envisaged as a highlight of the exhibition 's two - year international tour , will trace Berlin 's influence as a treasure trove of history , art and culture on Bowie 's avant - garde views on personality and self - expression .
Landing in west Berlin in the summer of 1976 , on the run from fame and excess , Bowie found release in the anonymity of the enclaved city state . ""
He disappeared , "" said Marsh .
"" It was critical not only for his health but also his musical and cultural development . ""
With no cameras in his face and no one breathing down his neck , Bowie was free to reinvent himself musically .
In collaborations with Iggy Pop and minimalist artist Brian Eno , he ushered in a new era of sound with cutting - edge synth equipment , some of which appears in the exhibition .
Yet Berlin had a profound effect on more than Bowie 's music .
Intimate items from his own personal collection , including clothes , diary entries , handwritten lyrics and sketches inspired by visits to the BrÃÂ¼cke expressionist museum , show how he worked Berlin "" like a scavenger picking over the ruins and assembling them "" , said Marsh .
One exhibit , a letter from Bowie 's hero and Berlin chronicler Christopher Isherwood , lays bare the singer 's fascination with the German capital 's layered history , from Weimar and nazism up to the brutal cold war division outside his studio window .
But the exhibition shows it was chiefly this sharp contrast between bohemian , libertarian west Berlin and the drudgery Bowie saw on visits to the authoritarian east that meant he returned to the US two years later a changed man . ""
Suddenly he was thinking differently in the way people saw him , communicating differently with the world , "" said Marsh .
By the time he left , Bowie 's sketches and film clips show his politics was firmly based on the idea that anybody should be what they want to be . ""
A lot of that came from being a natural rebel , but also from being in Berlin and seeing those two sides , "" Marsh said .
David Bowie , 20
May-10 August , Martin - Gropius - Bau , Berlin .
Tickets on sale here"
2014-03-02,"It is a scene that could be soundtracked by David Bowie 's Always Crashing in the Same Car .
ArsÃÂ¨ne Wenger biting hard into his lower lip after an anaemic defeat : Arsenal fans suffering a painful version of March Madness as another season without silverware looms ; the bookies easing the Gunners from contenders to stragglers .
Wenger called Saturday 's defeat at Stoke City a "" massive setback "" .
Their next Premier League defeat is likely to be a death blow for their title hopes .
If fatalism has a scent , Arsenal supporters wear it like eau de toilette .
But you can not blame them .
They have been here before .
At the start of March in 2007 - 08 the Gunners were three points ahead of a Manchester United side that won the Premier League and Champions League .
They ended up third , four points back .
In 2010 Arsenal were three points off the pace at the start of March .
They finished 11 points back .
In 2011 they were four points behind at this stage but ended 12 points back .
What makes it worse is that when it came to the crunch Arsenal used to bite down hard .
From 1998 to 2006 , when the trophies flowed as easily as the football , Wenger 's side had a higher average points tally between March and May than from August to February in seven of nine occasions .
This season they led the league almost continuously from mid - September to late January .
But that run , albeit impressive , was misleading .
As Prozone 's Omar Chaudhuri points out , the Gunners have had the easiest schedule in the Premier League , based on the average points per game of their opponents , adjusted for home and away fixtures .
Chaudhuri makes another point : when you look at the location and type of shots Arsenal have attempted and conceded they are scoring more and letting in fewer than expected of a "" typical "" team from the same locations .
Their points tally has exceeded their general play .
The impression of Arsenal withering under pressure , of allowing another title to slip away , is unfair .
That does not mean their fans ' frustration is not understandable , given the price of season tickets and the lack of trophies .
Their club has turned into the equivalent of the speed dater who repeatedly gets told he has a nice personality but ends the night without a phone number .
But arguably Arsenal 's season has panned out better than expected .
Last August we knew they were missing a top striker and were fourth favourites for the Premier League .
That is true today , too .
But some of the questions raised back then about their goalkeeper , defence and central midfield have been answered .
Wojciech Szczesny has made fewer kamikaze charges and clumsy errors and his save percentage has improved too .
The defence has conceded the second fewest goals in the Premier League .
And Aaron Ramsey had gone from boo - boy to contender for player of the year before straining his thigh .
In fact Arsenal have been unlucky with injuries .
Ramsey , Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade - Chamberlain have made only 29 Premier League starts this season and played together only once .
If they had stayed fit , where would Arsenal be now ?
We can not know , of course , but the loss of Ramsey and Walcott has certainly wounded them .
Ramsey 's average goals per 90 minutes puts him 16th in the Premier League while he is 10th in the assists charts per 90 minutes played .
And while Walcott is still seen as an eager ferret who is just as likely to do a thrilling loop - the - loop as scamper down a blind alley , it is worth remembering that he was Arsenal 's top scorer last season with 21 goals .
And in 2013 - 14 he is fifth in Premier League for average assists per 90 minutes ( Pablo HernÃÂ¡ndez , David Silva , Wayne Rooney and Luis SuÃÂ¡rez rank higher ) and 13th for average goals per 90 minutes , above Rooney and Olivier Giroud .
Where Wenger 's critics are undoubtedly right is in his lackadaisical , almost quixotic , approach to bolstering his strike force .
The average goals total for the top scorer at a Premier League winner since 2001 - 02 is 23 goals .
Giroud performs a valuable job but he has scored only 12 in the league .
Wenger has his fingers on most levers at the Emirates and has a prudence that is in many ways admirable .
But it is one thing to be controlling and judicious , another to bathe in inertia .
Of course Arsenal 's season is not over .
They are still in the FA Cup and , by a thread , the Champions League .
In the Premier League they are four points behind Chelsea , whom they face in three weeks ' time .
They are also level on 59 points with Liverpool , a side everyone is drooling over .
The title is still up for grabs but their next league games loom like Himalayan peaks : Spurs away , Chelsea away , Manchester City home , Everton away .
They could do worse than gaze back at the past for motivation .
In 2001 - 02 Arsenal were third at the start of March , with 54 points from 27 games , before completing a glorious 13-game winning streak brought them the title by seven points .
But that double - winning side had David Seaman in goal , Sol Campbell and Tony Adams in defence , Patrick Vieira in midfield and Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry up front .
It did not have only strength , pace and quality to burn .
It had backbone too ."
2014-03-06,"David Bowie has offered to write original songs for Claudia Lennear according to the backing singer , who is one of the classic vocalists featured in the Oscar winning documentary 20 Feet From Stardom .
Four decades after she is rumoured to have inspired his song Lady Grinning Soul , Lennear claims that her and Bowie will work together on a new project .
Ã¢â¬ÅI got a call from David Bowie out of the blue two days ago , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Lennear told the New York Post earlier this week .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe it when I first heard his voice .
We havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seen each other in 20 years ...
He told me he wanted to write my next project.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Lennear , who is now in her 60s , was at one time a sought - after back - up singer , performing with stars like George Harrison , Ike and Tina Turner , and Joe Cocker .
She was romantically linked with Bowie as well as Mick Jagger , and is said to have inspired the Rolling Stones song Brown Sugar .
But although Lennear released one solo album , 1973Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Phew ! , she never became famous in her own right , and eventually quit the music industry .
Now however , LennearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s star is on the rise .
20 Feet From Stardom won this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Oscar for best documentary feature and
Jagger reportedly wants to turn the film into both a Broadway musical and a scripted TV series .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is bringing so many gifts back from my past , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Lennear told the Post .
While she said she has yet to decide how to move forward with her Ã¢â¬Ånext projectÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , Ã¢â¬ÅI will definitely hold David
[ Bowie ] to his promise.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
No further comment has been given by Bowie at this stage .

2014-03-23,"From glittery eye makeup to punk chic , Mick Rock is the British photographer credited with constructing and capturing the subversive face of rock music Ã¢â¬ â from David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust to Debbie Harry 's Blondie .
His camera gave the world of music several of its most famous album covers , including Lou Reed 's Transformer and Queen 's Queen II .
Now 65 , and working with contemporary bands such as the Killers and the Black Keys , Rock has taken part in a new project designed to celebrate his best - known images .
With the help of young Brooklyn singer - songwriter Danielle Parente , the veteran photographer Ã¢â¬ â who has homes in his native London and Staten Island , New York Ã¢â¬ â has been recreating his "" greatest hits "" .
The "" man who shot the 70s "" calls his project The Revisit .
To reconstruct a key Debbie Harry shot ( which he calls Blue Debbie ) , he used a Nikon DF camera with one of his favourite lenses , the 28 mm that he used for a famous shot of Pink Floyd 's Syd Barrett .
Three members of Parente 's band also joined her for a revamp of the Queen II cover , which itself had been recreated in the Bohemian Rhapsody music video .
So much for nostalgia .
Speaking to the Observer before the exhibition , Rock said he was unsettled by the dominance of image over music in the industry today .
Present - day artists such as Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga , he argued , operated primarily as visual products rather than creative musicians .
"" When I was photographing in the 1970s it was to accompany the music .
It was clearly adjacent to it , "" he said .
"" We were living in a much less visual universe and before we took pictures we often used to lie down , light a joint and listen to the music .
Now the song is a mere accompaniment to the images . ""
Looking back at his work , Rock said it was clear that the music business had changed .
"" This may be a golden age of photography , in as far as many people can take a lot of quality shots , "" he said .
"" But we are all now so aware of the power of imagery that in the case of someone like Miley Cyrus , and even with Lady Gaga , clearly the image comes first .
I know what Miley Cyrus looks like , but have to admit I do n't really know what she sounds like . ""
After meeting Bowie in 1972 , Rock took the famous shots of the singer making himself up as Ziggy .
The images had come to symbolise the era , he said , yet they had no idea they would last . ""
In those days , you did n't know if your pictures would have any afterlife , so in a funny way they were more disposable , "" said Rock .
""
A photo session was more relaxed .
These people were friends of mine , whether it was David , Debbie Harry , Lou Reed , Iggy Pop or Freddie Mercury .
"" Drugs were a part of the path to creativity .
"" I had to take LSD before I could pick up a camera , "" he said .
"" That , and the yoga I was practising from early on , opened me up .
"" I have become so universally identified with that era that they say I shot the 70s , "" Rock said .
"" But I never shot REO Speedwagon , the Carpenters or the Strawbs . ""
He did , however , shoot well - known images of Pop , Mercury , Bryan Ferry , Mick Jagger , Alice Cooper and Reed .
"" I might have been a writer or a lecturer if I had not picked up that camera , "" said the former Cambridge modern languages student .
"" Certainly that is what my mother thought .
She was very concerned at the time .
Now , at 93 , she feels a bit differently .
She knows I am a relic . ""
He first turned to rock photography after university precisely because it was not cerebral , so he finds it hard to accept that his work is now on show in museums and cultural centres .
"" What was once rock'n'roll and very disposable is now art .
My vision , for better or worse , has been pure music , "" he said .
Rock suspects his old collaborator Bowie is equally disconcerted by the modern emphasis on image over music .
"" It is true that a lot of my images defined David , but I always think of him as being magical and super - intelligent .
He does n't always like being taken quite this seriously as a cultural figure , I think .
He did not want to be directly involved with the recent V&amp;A show about him .
David is quite a light spirit and his main concern is his music .
That can get a bit lost now . ""
Rock said he regards his own talent as an "" aptitude "" rather than a creative vision and that he has thousands of unseen images of Bowie from the Ziggy Stardust era
Ã¢â¬ â and possibly more of the late Lou Reed .
Although Rock thinks drugs were a useful way of opening up his own mind to a new way of life , he said he did not believe they were crucial to the artistry of the stars he photographed . ""
Lou 's song Perfect Day was a love song really , I believe , "" he said , referring to the persistent claim that Reed wrote the song in praise of heroin .
"" There were a certain amount of chemicals involved then for many of us , it is true , but it was almost peripheral , really .
Creatives are creative people and they are going to create whatever . ""
These days , the kind of cool cats that Rock photographs are rather different . ""
If I am taking shots for pleasure now , I tend to take them of my Maine Coon cat .
It really is a spectacular breed , "" he said ."
2014-03-26,"A Canadian astronaut may seem an unlikely choice of ambassador for Tourism Ireland , but the country is hoping their new appointment will help draw visitors to the emerald isle .
Chris Hadfield , who became an internet sensation last year after posting a YouTube video of himself performing David Bowie 's Space Oddity on board the International Space Station , stars in a series of four new films promoting Ireland to prospective holidaymakers .
The films were made earlier this year and feature Hadfield visiting some of the country 's most popular attractions and experiencing Irish culture .
The first film , which launched today , features Donegal and the Inishowen peninsula as well as footage of Hadfield learning Gaelic from local school children .
The other three films , which will be launched from tomorrow , will feature the Titanic Belfast , the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin and footage of Hadfield trying out the Gaelic sport of hurling .
Although his appointment may seem surprising , the charismatic astronaut won a following in Ireland after tweeting pictures of the country from space , along with messages in Gaelic .
His daughter is currently studying at Dublin 's Trinity College .
Ireland 's minister for transport , tourism and sport Leo Varadkar said : "" Chris Hadfield is one of the few people on earth who has seen Ireland from space , and on the ground . ""
"" We 're delighted that Chris had such a good time during his stay and hopefully he 'll be back for another visit in the near future . """
2014-04-02,"My partner , Roger Greenslade , who has died from lung cancer aged 55 , was a painter , musician and sports coach Ã¢â¬ â an unusual combination , but he was passionate about all three .
He was performing in the indie / electro pop band Raus when I met him , playing the guitar and piano , and performing lead vocals .
Later on , having realised he was not going to be the next David Bowie , he became a full - time sports coach , but he was still performing with the band last year .
Roger was born in Bradford , West Yorkshire , to Barbara , a pianist , and Albert , a draughtsman .
He attended Wyke Manor school in Wyke , Bradford .
The family business was butchery , and when he left school after his A - levels his grandfather offered him the chance to take over .
He turned the offer down and announced his intention of moving to London to become a painter .
Combining his Yorkshire sense of humour with his love of art , music and sport , he spent the next two decades painting , performing in bands , writing and playing as much cricket as possible while also working at various jobs ranging from theatre flyman to market researcher .
When our first child was born in 1995 , he decided to go to university and took a BA Ã¢â¬ â and then a master 's Ã¢â¬ â in philosophy and critical theory from London Metropolitan University .
He was able to combine this with looking after the children while I went back to work .
Roger played excellent cricket for many teams , including the Camden Labour Club , where his team - mates included the young Miliband brothers .
He was also a member of the travelling side the Jesters and Bedfordshire 's Eversholt Cricket Club , which was runner - up in the National Village Cup in 2000 , when Ã¢â¬ â as twelfth man
Ã¢â¬ â Roger fulfilled his dream of playing at Lord 's .
With our children at school he then decided to concentrate on cricket coaching full - time and for more than 10 years worked in schools and the local community , inspiring a generation of London youngsters to play and love cricket via clubs such as Islington Cricket Club and the schemes Capital Kids Cricket and Chance to Shine .
During his illness he coached Hampstead Ladies and continued as a coach with London Schools Cricket Association until the end of last season .
Before his diagnosis he had taken up a role with the newly launched London cycle hire scheme , which he passionately believed in .
During the three years of his treatment he managed to keep cheerful and positive .
He was a lifelong Guardian reader who always read the sport section first , particularly anything about his beloved Manchester United .
He is survived by me and our children , George and Eliza ."
2014-04-08,"Pop stars and celebrities can protest against their status as role models as much as they like but it 's an unfortunately unavoidable part of being famous .
This is why Jessie J stating that her bisexuality was just a phase feels like such a loss for young gay or questioning people who look up to her .
Ambiguous sexuality has long been a selling point for pop stars , David Bowie being the most obvious example .
However , Jessie J did n't foster a studied ambiguity about her sexual preferences but instead openly came out as bisexual .
I would never deny Jessie J , or anyone else , the right to define themselves , identify with whatever sexuality they want or reject labels altogether .
However , since she so publicly and boldly came out as having had relationships with both men and women , it feels all the more disappointing .
To have such a strong , female , bisexual role model speak in a way that clearly distances herself from her bi and gay fans is a big letdown .
Jessie J 's assertion that she wants to "" stop talking about it completely "" is directed at a media fond of asking her questions about her sexuality , but however justified her frustration , the message to young women and men questioning their sexuality is that she 's over it , she does n't want it to be a part of her life anymore , it 's something that she wants to move away from .
Many people could n't understand why lesbians were so excited about Ellen Page coming out . ""
How is this news ?
"" was a fairly common observation .
It was news because the lack of female , gay role models for young women is astonishing .
I get excited when I see a high - profile gay woman because I see myself in her ; being successful , being accepted .
Jessie J has described her relationships with women as a phase .
It 's an unhelpful term as this is an idea that gay people find themselves constantly battling against .
Jessie J does n't have to be bisexual if she no longer identifies that way .
Who are we to dictate her sexuality or make her talk about it at all ?
But having already entered into a public discussion about it , to dismiss her previous brave coming out as something she did when she was young and naive , just "" a part of growing up "" , is a real shame .
Jessie J remains a fantastic female role model , that has n't changed .
She is a breath of fresh air as a pop star , outspoken , bold and interesting .
However , when she says she wants to move on from her declaration , the hearts of all those who saw it as an inspiring , hopeful moment will sink ."

In Singles Club we have tracks from the Roots , Ed Sheeran and Boots .
David Bowie is singing about gnomes , Sandy Shaw is winning the Eurovision Song Contest for Great Britain , and Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Heats Club Band is just around the corner .

2014-05-14,"Want to watch an astronaut perform a David Bowie song in space ?
Unfortunately , it may be too late now .
A year ago , Commander Chris Hadfield performed Space Oddity aboard the International Space Station .
Already an internet sensation thanks to his spectacular tweets from space , his cover soon racked up millions of views on YouTube .
Sadly , from today , you will no longer be able to watch this hugely popular viral video because , according to Hadfield , they only had permission from Bowie 's people to keep it up for a year .
In a tweet on Tuesday , the now retired astronaut said : Posting on Reddit , Hadfield and his son Evan , who helped create the video , expanded on their reasons for taking the video down and said they were working on renewing the license at a later date .
It has been a year since my son and I created and released the Space Oddity video .
We have been amazed and delighted that so many people enjoyed it - and maybe saw what spaceflight can really be like .
It helped show that humans have left Earth , and that the Space Station is a new stage , for not just science and exploration , but for our art and music too .
With exploration comes insight Ã¢â¬ â with perspective comes self - realization .
We had permission from David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s people to post the video on YouTube for a year , and that year is up .
We are working on renewing the license for it , but as there are no guarantees when it comes to videos shot in space , we thought you might want to have one last look before we take it down .
Thanks for everything .
You 've all been incredible throughout .
While the original video has been made private , a number of copies and parodies can still be found on YouTube ."
2014-05-22,"From its maniacal sound to its provocative cover art , The Man Who Sold the World was the album that began David Bowie 's musical odyssey into the strange and unexplored .
Now , for the first time in 40 years , two musicians who were instrumental in creating Bowie 's third studio venture , from 1970 , will reunite to perform the album .
Tony Visconti and Mick "" Woody "" Woodmansey , who became part of Bowie 's legendary backing band the Spiders from Mars , will play the album in its entirety at a show in London in September .
Visconti , who has produced most Bowie albums since 1969 , including his most recent release , The Next Day , will revive his role as bassist on the songs for the first time since originally playing on the album .
Woodmansey will play drums , as he did on the original record and two subsequent Bowie albums , Hunky Dory and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust .
The two Spiders from Mars members will be joined by an ensemble of 10 other musicians , including Spandau Ballet saxophonist Steve Norman and Glenn Gregory of Heaven 17 .
Woodmansey said the time was right to revive the album that first brought him , Visconti and Bowie together , and that it would be a fitting tribute to Mick Ronson , the guitarist and musical genius behind Bowie 's most successful run of albums , who died in 1993 .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Man Who Sold the World was the first album Mick Ronson and I played on , our first even in a proper London studio , yet it never got played live , "" Woodmansey told the Guardian .
"" It was the forerunner of what we could do sound - wise , and we just let rip .
We spent three weeks recording [ it ] because we were creating the songs as we went .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was the album that showed Bowie trying out things and finding his direction .
The Man Who Sold the World was his first step into rock'n'roll .
It got critical acclaim , but we never toured it , and in the live shows the album tracks never got touched on .
So the idea of being able to go out and finally play some of those great tracks live was just so exciting . ""
Songs on the album , such as After All and Saviour Machine , were really atmospheric , and they reveal another dimension to Bowie 's writing that he 's never gone back to , so it will be great to finally bring that to a live audience.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
While Woodmansey has not played with Bowie since 1973 , following the release of Ziggy Stardust , the singer has given his blessing to the project .
Even the cover of The Man Who Sold The World courted controversy .
The iconic photograph of Bowie , which evoked pre - Raphaelite paintings , showed him sprawled effeminately across a chaise longue in a silk dress .
The image was considered so controversial that the record was given a different cover for its US release .
The gown used in the artwork was even worn by Bowie to his first interview with Rolling Stone magazine in early 1971 to promote the album .
"" I refuse to be thought of as mediocre , "" Bowie said .
"" If I am mediocre , I 'll get out of the business .
There 's enough fog around .
That 's why the idea of performance as spectacle is so important to me . ""
Tony Visconti said he was looking forward to bringing the album back to a live audience . ""
The Man Who Sold the World became the blueprint for the rest of DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , "" he said .
"" Virtually everything heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s done since , you can trace back to something on that album .
Ã¢â¬ÅI've since rarely played anything as ambitious and demanding as the music of that great batch of songs conceived by David Bowie .
With Woody Woodmansey and Mick Ronson Ã¢â¬ â two of the finest musicians I 've had the pleasure of recording and playing with Ã¢â¬
â
we set out to create something new and classic . ""
Steve Norman said the performance would be an homage to the influence The Man Who Sold the World has had on music .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is not so much a tribute band , but a collection of musicians who were really influenced by Bowie and that era of music , myself included , "" Norman said .
"" Without Bowie , I do n't know how Spandau Ballet would have existed . ""
The opportunity to play with Woody Woodmansey and Tony Visconti , well it 's the nearest you get to seeing the Spiders from Mars , apart from having Bowie there himself.Ã¢â¬

Tony Visconti and Woody Woodmansey will perform The Man Who Sold the World on 17 September .

2014-06-12,"Nile Rodgers has said he working on a new Chic track featuring "" almost everybody "" who has sung with him .
The ambitious concept could make for a song that might include everyone from David Bowie to Daft Punk , not to mention Madonna , Joss Stone , David Lee Roth , Paul Simon , Robert Plant and Sam Smith .
Rodgers ' tease came at around 3 am on Wednesday , right before he flew out for a gig in Ibiza .
"" I 'm just finishing up a new song for Chic that 's going to feature almost everybody that 's ever sung with me , "" he tweeted .
"" I ca n't wait to do that session .

Maroon 5 , Britney Spears , Adam Lambert , Bryan Ferry , Mick Jagger and even the late Michael Jackson .
It 's anyone 's guess as to which of these luminaries will turn up at Rodgers ' studio .
But the Chic leader 's stock has arguably never been higher : after playing on three recent Daft Punk songs , including Get Lucky , the 61-year - old is flitting from major festival to major festival .
For his new record , the first in about two decades , Rodgers has reportedly been collaborating with producers including David Guetta , Disclosure and Avicii .
With Guetta , "" it felt like it was if we were back in the 80s , "" he said last year .
Rodgers has also apparently been writing material based on Chic demos from 1983 , recorded while he was working on
Bowie 's Let 's Dance .
"" I like to affectionately call [ them ] the ' Lost Chic Tapes ' because they just disappeared until recently , "" he told Digital Spy in February .
"" I 've already written hooks to five of the songs .

One more win would do wonders for that argument .
It could very well be on Sunday , when Game 5 kicks off in San Antonio 's AT&amp;T Center ( no matter what the air conditioner status might be ) .
We 'll be covering it here at the Guardian live , hopefully you 'll join us .
Thanks to all who followed along with this liveblog , especially those who contributed , that 'll be the end of this from our end .
Ciao !
Stunning .
This is a great Miami Heat team .
This might be a HISTORICAL Spurs team , I ca n't even exaggerate .
I 'm devastated , personally , I was hoping for a seven - game series , or at least my checking account was .
That looks doubtful now .
The Spurs are now 3 - 1 and heading back home for Sunday 's Game 5 .
Which could very well be the end of this series .
Shockingly .
More random people I do n't care about and you do n't care about make or miss shots .
I 'm not going to bore you here .
IT 'S OVER !

Holy heck , Magic freaking Johnson .
Spurs 93 - 71 Heat , 5:03 remaining , 4th quarter
The former editor checks in , taking a World Cup coverage break .
I do n't think anybody did , these teams looked equally matched .
Even in the first two games .
Dwyane Wade picks up another foul and we have a TV timeout .
Spurs 93 - 71 Heat , 5:30 remaining , 4th quarter Nope .
Leonard makes a jumper , Diaw assists on Duncan on a layup .
Duncan has a double - double .

Can the Heat get some momentum for a final big run here ?
Spurs 89 - 67 Heat ,

Heat take a 20 second time out .
Spurs 89 - 66 Heat , 7:47 remaining , 4th quarter
And then Mills takes a charger to get the ball back to the Spurs , and is retired for Kawhi Leonard .
With that , LeBron is back as well .
Leonard strikes first , with a jumper and the clock .
The clock it 's ticking .
Spurs 87 - 66 Heat , 8:45 remaining , 4th quarter
The Heat have memories of Game 6 , they know what KG knows anything is possible .
Including yet another Patty Mills three , unfortunately for the Heat .
Spurs 84 - 66 Heat , 9:04 remaining , 4th quarter
James still on the bench , Miami have been having some luck with this smaller Wade / Haslem old - school Heat line up .
Spurs 84 - 66 Heat , 9:04 remaining , 4th quarter
Aram sums up what may be the current state of the Heat fan
Spurs 84 - 66 Heat , 9:04 remaining , 4th quarter Wade hits one from ten feet and that 's a 7 - 0 run by Miami and the Spurs call a timeout .
Interesting .
Spurs 84 - 64 Heat , 9:32 remaining , 4th quarter Fifth foul on Danny Green , another shard of hope for Miami .
Wade gets fouled almost , but not quite , on the three - point lead .
He makes one of two free throws .
Spurs 84 - 63 Heat,10:14 remaining , 4th quarter
Chalmers dishes an assist to Wade to cut down the Heat score by two and then , well then , Haslem actually does something offensively .
Wade passes to Haslem for a dunk and it 's 2006 all over again in Miami !

remaining , 4th quarter Haslem in the game now , my predicted lineup is starting to form here .
ANOTHER three - pointer from My Australian Guy !
Spurs 81
- 59 Heat,11:34 remaining , 4th quarter
Andersen makes a layup ( that 's good ! ) and then picks up his fifth foul and has to be replaced ( that 's ungood ! ) .
Dear Narrative Creators :
This is the fault of everyone but LeBron here tonight .
Remember this .
He 's the only one not wetting himself at this point .
Oh my stars yes .
Watching the Spurs these last two games is like watching basketball be played as close to perfect as humanly possible .
Andersen fouls Kawhi Leonard on what the Miami Heat faithful are
CONVINCED is a clean block .
They got ta have something to hold to on after that third quarter .
Leonard makes one of two free throws and that 'll do it for the scoring in the third quarter .
Do we even need a fourth quarter here ?
Spurs 80 - 57 Heat , : 47 remaining , 3rd quarter
LeBron James now has 19 points in the quarter after a three - point shot , but he 's the entire team now .
Then Tiago Spillter dunks and the Spurs bench applauds in response .
We are in "" so much blood "" territory for the home team .
Spurs 78 - 54 Heat , 1:31 remaining , 3rd quarter Technical on Chris Andersen , but Ginobili misses the resulting free throw .
Two free throw misses !
Everything 's coming up Miami - house !
And then Tony Parker gets on the line and makes his two so
yeah ,
sorry about that Miami .
Spurs 76 - 54 Heat , 2:08 remaining , 3rd quarter
Andersen fouls Parker , it 's a shooting foul , and Parker makes one - of - two , which at this point is the best news the Heat have heard in a while .
Spurs 75 - 54 Heat , 2:08 remaining , 3rd quarter
And Kawhi Leonard hits another three - pointer .
No this was n't a copy - and - paste error .
James hits a three - pointer in response , and you have to feel he 's in ""
I guess I 'll have to do everything myself "" mode .
Spurs 73 - 51 Heat , 3:15 remaining , 3rd quarter
Okay Hamilton is inactive , but you get what I 'm saying .
Driving layup by LeBron James , the only one doing anything here at this point .
Spurs 73 - 49 Heat , 3:47 remaining , 3rd quarter Kawhi Leonard three pointer and ,
wow , that 's ...
Oof that seems like a backbreaker as difficult as it to say about this Heat team in just the third quarter .
The Miami Heat take a timeout , but it 's starting to look like Toney Douglas , Greg Oden , James Jones , Justin Hamilton and Udonis Haslem might play the entire fourth quarter at this rate .
Spurs 70 - 49 Heat , 4:03 remaining , 3rd quarter
Another great pass , this time by Boris Diaw ( quietly having a podium game ) who gets it to Tim Duncan for a one - hand slam
and wow this looks effortless on San Antonio .
Spurs 68 - 49 Heat , 5:31 remaining , 3rd quarter
The crowd is chanting , they know that the Heat have to start thinking clock already and need a run here .
Desperately .
They get ... a foul on Kawhi Leonard .
That 's a start .
James gets free throws , only makes one of two .
They 're going to need every point here so .
Spurs 68 - 48 Heat , 5:39 remaining , 3rd quarter Spurs 68 - 48 Heat , 5:39 remaining , 3rd quarter
What the heck
Boris Diaw ?
Thunderous layup after Ginobili forces Wade into a turnover .
Man is someone going to overpay him this offseason .
20 point Spurs lead again and Miami Heat timeout again .
Spurs 66 - 48 Heat ,
6:46 remaining , 3rd quarter
Leonard makes a jumper .
Foul on Ginobili , with Ray Allen on the ground .
Not a flop this time .
Spurs 64 - 48 Heat ,
6:46 remaining , 3rd quarter
Wade fouls
Diaw , when did he become so enforcer - esque , and Diaw makes one of two free throws .
Spurs 63 - 48 Heat , 7:37 remaining , 3rd quarter Ginobili , gets this , passes it up ,
Diaw gets it to Duncan
( I know who knew that there would be more passing here ) and , of course , Duncan makes his shot .
Did I just criticize Gregg Popovich 's coaching decisions ?
In a game where they have a ridiculous lead again ?
I can not even remember the last time I did that , but a 10 - 2 Heat run is exactly the opposite of what the Spurs need .
Spurs 61 - 48 Heat , 7:56 remaining , 3rd quarter
Parker fouls
LeBron , another good sign for Miami , he needs to make it to the line more .
Play inside .
Be aggressive .
He makes both free throws .
Popovich pulls Green , AGAIN , one good way to break up a streaky player 's confidence that .
Wade assists James for another layup and Popovich takes a timeout , and he 's honestly a minute or two late here .
Spurs 61 - 44 Heat , 8:33 remaining , 3rd quarter Parker makes a jumper , he can make those of course but the Spurs may not want to settle for those here , and Mario Chalmers ( there we go ) makes a layup to add to the Heat score .
Spurs 59 - 42 Heat , 9:27 remaining , 3rd quarter
LeBron knows he has to take over this half for Miami to have a shot , he makes a nine - footer , he 's getting closer to the basket a bad sign for San Antonio , and a driving layup .
Spurs 59 - 38 Heat , 10:34 remaining , 3rd quarter Just like old times , Wade to James for the layup .
Unfortunately , Tony Parker answers right back with a long jumper .
We 're back !
Diaw starts things off immediately for San Antonio with the first shot of the second half .
Email from Michael Aston :
Yes indeed Duncan has been quite the quiet giant of the NBA a class act .
I love the stoic and cerebral types and Tim just keeps on pushing on .
Now that 's a role model
Absolutely .
I will admit it 's easier to appreciate him with Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili ( and
now Kawhi Leonard ) getting more of the offensive load .
When he was the main scoring option for the Spurs , not exactly must - see television , not like this .
Oh and here 's a fun little fact
, Tim Duncan has had himself a nice little career , especially since it 's not over yet
and , if the Heat keep playing like this , he might have yet another achievement to add to his already impressive list .
The Splitter dunk Toney Douglas is one of the top trending topics on Twitter , do n't tell me people are n't paying attention to this NBA Finals .
Crazy first half , again , for San Antonio .
Can the Heat figure out a way to complete a second half comeback tonight , or will this be a repeat of Tuesday 's game ?
We want to hear your thoughts , just email Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet at @HunterFelt
and we 'll incorporate what you have to say to the multi - media mess that is this liveblog .
Holy crap , the Spurs are doing it again .
Wow .
LEBRON JAMES JUST HITS
A THREE POINTER AS THE SHOT CLOCK WOUND
DOWN .
If the Heat can somehow dig themselves out , use that to get come confidence and momentum coming out of halftime , that will loom large .
Ginobili misses the last shot of the half .
Spurs 55 - 33 Heat , : 56 remaining , 2nd quarter 20 point lead .
Again .
I guess being battle - tested in the Western Conference rather than the East might have helped him .
Oh , hey a Kawhi Leonard jam .
The Heat fans are now very much booing .
And I ca n't blame him .
Leonard then guards James in the next possession where James misses a layup .
No air conditioning failure to blame here , that 's all Kawhi .
Spurs 53 - 33 Heat , 1:36 remaining , 2nd quarter Ginobili is wide open for a great shot , but he passes to Patty Mills , just in the game , and Mills LANDS a three - pointer .
That is Spurs basketball , holy freaking heck .
20 second Heat timeout .
Spurs 48 - 33 Heat , 2:26 remaining , 2nd quarter
Danny Green fouls
Dwyane Wade , which brings Pop to take him out after 30 seconds and replaces him with Patty Mills .
Wade makes both of his .
Spurs 48 - 31 Heat , 2:33 remaining , 2nd quarter
Wade fouls Leonard , who makes one of two and then ...
HEY it 's MARIO CHALMERS !
He made a jumper !
Bless his heart .
Spurs 46 - 29 Heat , 3:24 remaining , 2nd quarter Ray Allen , however , does foul Tim Duncan who gets on the line .
He makes one of two free throws .
On and FINALLY LeBron gets to the line , maybe the Joey Crawford factor is n't so much happening , he makes one of two .
Oh wow , Miami is getting so desperate , they have brought in Toney Douglas .
This is a hail mary .
Spurs 44 - 28 Heat , 4:00 remaining , 2nd quarter Mario Chalmers , sigh , is not having that night I predicted .
Not only can he not stop Tony Parker from an easy bucket , he ca n't even get a foul call there to make him earn it on the line .
Spurs 42 - 28 Heat , 4:39 remaining , 2nd quarter Rashard Lewis throws a terrible , terrible Favrian interception that Tim Duncan corrals .
Somehow the Heat dodge a bullet and San Antonio can not convert it to points .
Spurs 42 - 28 Heat , 5:20 remaining , 2nd quarter
And more chilling discoveries in American Airlines Arena
Where 's Eric Cantor ?
Oh , right ,
yeah that thing happened .
Spurs 42 - 28 Heat , 5:20 remaining , 2nd quarter Kawhi Leonard throws down a layup right out off of the timeout
, that 's one way to get the momentum back .
As will a Ginobili three - pointer .
And then the Miami Heat take their timeout .
Spurs 37 - 28 Heat , 6:26 remaining , 2nd quarter
I am going to send a tweet out to the players telling them not to score when my internet is flickering out .
I think that should solve things .
Spurs 37 - 28 Heat , 6:26 remaining
, 2nd quarter Boris Diaw makes a dunk , which leads us into a TV timeout ( i.e. time for the second reboot of the laptop ) .
By the time I get running again , all heck as broke lose .
A Ray Allen three - pointer , a Tiago Splitter dunk , two Chris Bosh free throws , a Tony Parker two point shot and another Ray Allen three .
Which takes us to a Spurs timeout .
Spurs 31 - 20 Heat , 9:25 remaining , 2nd quarter Norris Cole , one of the Heat role players that 's been mostly faultless this series , makes a two - pointer .
Miami needed that .
Then Chris Andersen gets fouled by Patty Mills , makes only one of two free throws .
Spurs 31 - 17 Heat , 10:49 remaining , 2nd quarter
And then Diaw steals from Wade and on that possession , he gets it to Patty Mills ( who 's been a fine distributor this series , like the whole team really ) who dishes out to Danny Green from way outside who knocks down another one of those threes that he can hit from time - to - time ( upgrades to always - to - always for the Finals ) .
Spurs 28 - 17 Heat , 11:41 remaining
, 2nd quarter Tiago Splitter starts the second quarter and gets an assist from Patty Mills and brings home a layup .
Spurs again seem to catch the Heat surprised a bit .
Really , the celebrities at Heat games do nothing to help the poor reputation of Heat fans .
James makes a 12-footer , which Patty Mills answers with a layup and the Heat get the last shot .
Long , 23-foot jumper at the buzzer that does n't go from LeBron James .
Oof , not the "" right basketball decision "" there .
Spurs 24 - 15 Heat , 1:07 remaining , 1st quarter
Checking back real quick
I find that Bonner fouls
Chris "" Birdman "" Andersen ( not an upcoming Michael Keaton movie ) who makes both shots .
Ginobili is fouled by Ray Allen , is awarded free throws and he makes them .
At least I missed nothing while rebooting the computer .
Spurs 22 - 13 Heat , 1:32 remaining , 1st quarter
A warning my internet is a tad sporadic here , so there may be a few longer breaks than usually here tonight .
Apologies in advance .
Kawhi Leonard gets to the line , makes both of his free throws .
LeBron James responds with a three - pointer , the Heat needed that .
But Matt "" Coach B "" Bonner makes his first shot of the game and then Patty "" MY AUSTRALIAN GUY "" Mills hits a three .
Spurs 15 - 10 Heat , 3:46 remaining
, 1st quarter Parker makes a jumper .
Wade is awarded two free throw attempts but he ca n't make either , yipes
, he 's definitely not totally healthy here .
Spurs 15 - 10 Heat , 4:58 remaining , 1st quarter Fadeaway jumper by Tony Parker just as the shot clock goes off , reminds me of his every - second - of - the - shot - clock game winning play back in the last NBA Finals .
Oh okay he 's back .
Our twenty second national nightmare is over .
LeBron James has headed to the locker room .
EVERYBODY PANIC !
Spurs 13 - 10 Heat , 4:58 remaining , 1st quarter
And we have a ballgame this half !
Bosh makes a jumper , cuts the Spurs lead to three and San Antonio will use their first timeout .
Spurs 13 - 8 Heat , 5:26 remaining
, 1st quarter Green ca n't keep hold of a LeBron James turnover , so this is n't perfect Spurs basketball like last time .
So hey .
And Miami is getting into form a bit earlier this time .
Dwyane Wade makes a shot , Chris Bosh makes a layup .
It 's Joey Crawford .
They will get to the line .
But Miami needs points any way they can get them right now .
Spurs 13 - 4 Heat , 6:52 remaining , 1st quarter
This feels sickeningly familiar if you 're a Heat fan .
Spurs 13 - 4 Heat , 6:52 remaining
, 1st quarter Parker makes a jumper .
The Spurs are on another one of those runs .
And Danny Green tries another steal on LeBron James , he did that a lot on Tuesday , but gets called for a foul here .
So next possession he goes back to his pre - Game 3 form and drills a three - pointer and that will lead to the first Heat timeout .
Spurs 8 - 4 Heat , 8:11 remaining , 1st quarter
Okay , not so good for Mario Chalmers so far
, he fouls Boris Diaw , a shooting foul , and Diaw makes one of two of his free throws .
Oh
but Chalmers does find Rashard Lewis , who makes a jumper .
That 's a bit better .
Oh but Danny Green decides he 's back to making three - pointers again .
Spurs 4 - 2 Heat , 9:11 remaining
, 1st quarter Green gets fouled by Wade , expect them to pay him more attention tonight after what he did on Tuesday .
Kawhi Leonard gets things started here , dishing an assist to Tim Duncan for a layup
and then Tony Parker makes a seven - footer .
Another good start for SA .
Spurs 0 - 2 Heat , 10:37 remaining , 1st quarter Miami Heat 's first possession goes nowhere , but neither does the Spurs .
It 's Chris Bosh who breaks the seal with the first made shot of the night .
And we 're off !
Julia Dale is great , but I still prefer Al Green .
And hey I knew that there would be a way to tie this in to the World Cup , this is the Guardian
so that 's actually mandatory for all sports coverage , Joey Crawford , for those not in the know , is basically the closest thing there is to a FIFA referee .
Yeah .
THAT bad .
How much does the NBA want this to be another long series ?
GUESS WHO IS REFEREEING TONIGHT
SPURS FANS ?
So , yes , the biggest camera - hogging ref in US sports history is working tonight 's Game 4 .
Watch for several utterly ridiculous calls only made so that Crawford can get his precious , precious screen time .
And expect LeBron James to live on the free throw line tonight .
The Spurs ' road to get a commanding 3 - 1 Finals lead just got a bit tougher .
Okay we 've already showcased the deadpan humor of Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra .
Now here 's the master , Spurs coach Gregg Popovich :
Miami Heat starters
No Beasley again ?
Marijuana can make nothing happen to you too .
Center :
Chris Bosh Power forward :
Rashard Lewis Small forward :
LeBron James Shooting guard :
Dwyane Wade Point guard : Mario Chalmers Inactive : Justin Hamilton , Michael Beasley .
San Antonio Spurs starters Boris Diaw is getting the start over Tiago Splitter again , not too shocking as it worked kinda okay in Game 3 Center : Tim Duncan Power forward :
Boris Diaw Small forward :
Kawhi Leonard Shooting guard :
Danny Green Point guard :
Tony Parker Inactive : Austin Daye , Damion James .
The big thing I 'm looking for tonight is if Bobby Ramos will be asking any questions at tonight 's Game 4 postgame press conference .
Ramos won the internet 's heart on Tuesday with his baffling questions to Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra and LeBron James .
An example :
Predictions Okay , what does everyone think ?
Do the Miami Heat tie the series up tonight ?
I say yes , the Heat will win a squeaker , like 100 - 98 .
I expected the Heat to get a home split , and well that would require a win tonight .
Thought it would be Game 3 , but Kawhi had other ideas .
Your predictions ?
We 'll use them here , just email them to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt .
Did we say Carmelo Anthony news ?
Are we referring to ourselves in the plural ?
Yes on both counts .
Apparently , the Miami Heat are looking to snag Carmelo Anthony , the New York Knick volume shooter who will be a free agent this offseason to join up with LeBron James , Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh .
That seems too expensive to work , without like having a bench of nothing but Toney Douglases , but I said that before the Big Three came together the first time .
Different CBA this time though .
So , okay , things did n't go so well for the Miami Heat last time around .
This is , in fact , an understatement so big it borders on a flat out lie .
The San Antonio Spurs unleashed the greatest offensive first half in NBA Finals history , aided by 22-year old Kawhi Leonard 's 29 points , and eventually defeated them 111 - 92 to take a 2 - 1 series lead .
Imagine , how embarrassed Miami would have been had Aron Baynes 's late three - pointer not been downgraded to a two - pointer , what a rout it would have been then !
But , as you may have heard , the Heat tend to pull off a playoff win every time they suffer a playoff defeat , and they have to hope that this trend keeps up .
Failing to win a single home game before heading back to San Antonio 's AT&amp;T Center would essentially end up being a death sentence for the team .
They need to salvage a split at American Airlines Arenas if they want to win this series , so this is essentially a Game 7 for them .
The question is who will be the main narrative of this game ?
So far it 's been Game 1 :
AT&amp;T Center 's Air Conditioning .
Game 2 :
LeBron James revenge game ; with a sweet Chris Bosh cameo .
Game 3
: Kawhi Leonard goes into God Mode .
My guess for Game 4 :
Mario Chalmers .
Yes MARIO CHALMERS !
Calm down there Stephen A. Smith
, I 'm being serious , he 's been the worst key player for either team during the Finals , and that 's going to have to change .
I think it will tonight , as long as LeBron and Dwyane Wade start yelling at him again , that is .
Why break a routine that works ?
As always we want to hear from you throughout the game .
You can email us your thoughts , comments , questions and jokes to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt and we 'll use them throughout this liveblog .
Okay , this may be partly my attempt to get , you , the readers , to do some of my writing for you , but hey it works for Simmons in his mailbags
so why should I feel ashamed ?
It 's Game 4 of the NBA Finals tonight featuring the San Antonio Spurs vs the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena !
Tip - off will be somewhere after 9:00pm EST/2:00am BST , but we 'll be back beforehand with predictions , starting lineups and Carmelo Anthony rumors !"
2014-06-26,"Bowie and Berlin go together like Ziggy and Stardust , so it 's fitting that the V&amp;A 's massive exhibition David Bowie Is has arrived in the German city where the singer created the Low , Heroes and Lodger albums in the 1970s .
In London there was a whole room devoted to Bowie 's "" Berlin years "" , and there 's now an extra selection of exhibits about his time in the city , but the show is less revealing about his exile than it is about another aspect of his work : theatre .
Bowie 's performances as an actor have been mixed , but his theatrical imagination is a chief driving force of his creative process .
In 1976 , he said in an interview : "" I 'm Pierrot .
I 'm Everyman .
What I 'm doing is theatre , and only theatre Ã¢â¬ Â¦
What you see on stage is n't sinister .
It 's pure clown .
I 'm using myself as a canvas and trying to paint the truth of our time on it . ""
This manifesto was surely generated in the formative years he spent with Lindsay Kemp , the mime artist and choreographer , who told a journalist in 1974 that he had "" taught David to free his body Ã¢â¬ Â¦ to exaggerate his body as well as his voice , and the importance of looking as well as sounding beautiful "" .
Bowie himself expressed a wish to bring mime into the heart of his work , to focus the attention of the audience with stylised movement .
While I could see no mention in this exhibition of his 20-minute solo mime piece at the Royal Festival Hall in the late 1960s , there are some telling fragments of his fascination with a mimetic , almost pantomimic style .
If you want a flavour of what he was doing with Kemp , this video of the Pierrot in Turquoise production will give you a good idea .
It does n't take much of a leap to realise that his Pierrot re - emerged as the clown in the groundbreaking Ashes to Ashes video .
Was it
Bowie 's fascination with the stage hit Cabaret that took him to Berlin ?
He later sought out Christopher Isherwood to discover what inspired his Berlin novels .
Perhaps fixated with Berlin 's swinging 1920s , Bowie ventured into a movie that flopped , Just a Gigolo , largely lured by the promise of appearing with one of the faces of 20s Berlin , Marlene Dietrich .

All of this found its way into the stunning staging
Bowie chose for the US TV appearance where he performed The Man Who Sold the World with German singer Klaus Nomi at his side , both of them in Bauhaus - influenced costumes .
It 's fitting that it is the V&amp;A 's theatre curators , Geoffrey Marsh and Victoria Broackes , and not the fashion ones , who made this exhibition happen .
The innovative presentation of the V&amp;A 's show makes it behave more like a piece of contemporary immersive theatre than a museum exhibition .
I 'm no fan of audioguides , but in this case putting on headphones takes you into an intimate Bowie world , where it feels as if he is talking to you .
Sennheiser , the sponsor of the show , have developed some special technology for the event .
Sound samples and music , which operate almost like a score , are triggered when you stand in a particular spot , or in front of an artefact .
They then seamlessly fade and dissolve into each other as you move around the exhibits .
The theatrical design group responsible for the staging , 59 Productions , had a hand in the celebrated Olympic 2012 opening ceremony in London and in Katie Mitchell 's groundbreaking Miss Julie at the SchaubÃÂ¼hne .
The exhibition couples sound with visuals and settings that can be both subtly and brashly immersive .
In the centrepiece 3D audio room , you are surrounded by 6.5m - high video screens , flashing camera bulbs and an almost overwhelming concert soundtrack .
You are , for a moment , immersed in the crowd of a Bowie gig as well having the sensation of being thrust on to the stage with him .
On the more subtle end of the spectrum , you have a lifesize video image of Bowie singing Starman on Top of The Pops .
For a moment you experience what a generation of artists Ã¢â¬ â including choreographer Michael Clark and
Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant Ã¢â¬ â felt when Bowie looks dead straight into the camera and sings , "" I had to phone someone
so I picked on you - hoo - hoo . ""

2014-07-09,"The Rolling Stones , the Who , Rod Stewart , Elton John , David Bowie ,
Ten Years After and many other bands can all be thankful for the part played on their way to fame and fortune by the manager of the Marquee Club in the 1960s , John Gee , who has died aged 86 .
He also had a particular passion for the music of a previous era and its performers Ã¢â¬ â Count Basie , Louis Armstrong , Sarah Vaughan , Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra Ã¢â¬ â and was the first British journalist to interview Duke Ellington .
Originally from east London , during the second world war he was evacuated with his mother to Berkhamsted , Hertfordshire , to be near his father , who was stationed nearby with the RAF .
John , an only child , won a place at the local grammar school , where he discovered his love of a good book ( he was an avid reader of Dickens ) and jazz .
His first jobs were as tour manager and publicist for two of the great dance - band leaders of the day , Ambrose and Ted Heath , and he even continued to promote Heath by arranging cricket matches between an RAF XI and the band while doing his national service ; like his father , he was in the RAF .
During the late 1950s his great fondness for big bands and Sinatra helped to secure the interview in Paris with Ellington ; he also attended several Sinatra recording sessions in London .
At this time he became associated with Jazz News , a publication owned by Harold Pendleton , who also owned the Marquee Club in central London .
Some years on , John became the respected manager , club secretary and , most importantly for rising pop musicians and groups , main booker at the Marquee .
It was often mooted that all that was needed to get your group a gig there was to engage John in conversation and make sure he was aware that your greatest hero / influence was Sinatra .
This was not strictly true , but a Sinatra conversation was a sure - fire introduction .
He joined Radio Luxembourg in 1969 , working at the station 's offices in central London for the next 23 years , before retiring happily to Carshalton Beeches , south London .
I first met John in 1964 when I was trying to get a booking for an R&amp;B group I managed at the time , and so began a friendship lasting 50 years , as a result of which he came to regard my family as his own ."
2014-07-15,"Haunting portrait photographs , including a swan - necked David Bowie photographed in 1978 , the playwright Nell Dunn looking startlingly like a long - lost Bowie twin , and Vita Sackville - West , the writer , gardener and former lover of Virginia Woolf who was still formidable in the year before her death in 1962 , have been donated to the National Portrait Gallery by the society photographer Lord Snowdon .
The gift of 130 original prints , including photographs of his former in - laws from the years he was married to Princess Margaret , is one of the largest ever to the gallery .
Other portraits gifted to the gallery feature actors John Hurt and Alan Bates , writers Kingsley Amis and Graham Greene , musicians Yehudi Menuhin and George Melly and artist Barbara Hepworth .
Several of the portraits will be exhibited for the first time in a free exhibition on his life and work opening at the gallery in September .
The exhibition was already being curated from works that Snowdon donated last year .
The director of the NPG , Sandy Nairne , said : "" These are wonderful portrait images of some most creative and engaging contributors to Britain in the second half of the 20th century . ""
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Snowdon :
A Life
In View will run at the National Portrait Gallery , London , from 26 September 2014 to 21 June 2015 ."
2014-07-19,"Once upon a time , 12 years ago to be precise , David Bowie said something very perceptive . ""
Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity , "" he told a New York Times reporter . ""
So it 's like , just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again .
You 'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that 's really the only unique situation that 's going to be left .
It 's terribly exciting .
But on the other hand it does n't matter if you think it 's exciting or not ; it 's what 's going to happen .
"" I thought of Bowie and his perceptiveness last week , when Ã¢â¬ â in a rare piece of corporate carelessness Ã¢â¬ â Amazon inadvertently provided a fleeting glimpse of what it has in store for the publishing industry .
A new page appeared on its website only to be very quickly withdrawn , but not before it had been cached by Google and spotted by a hacker website .
What was on this elusive page ?
Why , nothing more or less than an introduction to a new service called "" Kindle Unlimited "" .
Subscribers will be invited to "" enjoy unlimited access to over 600,000 titles and thousands of audiobooks on any device for just $ 9.99 a month "" .
One commentator described it as "" Netflix for books "" .
David Bowie would doubtless have said that it 's the turn of books to become like running water or electricity .
Bowie was perceptive because he understood early the implications of ubiquitous connectivity .
When Apple first cracked the problem of selling music tracks online , people collected the tracks in little electronic containers called iPods and carried them around , much as tourists in undeveloped countries carried personal supplies of clean water in bottles .
But once safe piped water became readily available , the importance of having one 's own bottle declined .
The same thing happened with online music , which is why we now have services such as Spotify into which subscribers can tap whenever they please ( and have a network connection ) .
Kindle Unlimited is based on exactly the same logic .
Indeed , it 's extraordinary how closely it adheres to the original Apple template : the Kindle e - reader is the equivalent of the iPod ; and the Kindle store is the counterpart of the iTunes one .
The difference is that Amazon is already working on the next move
Ã¢â¬ â making the transition from selling discrete units to streaming Ã¢â¬ â with which Apple has struggled ( and which explains why Apple bought Beats Ã¢â¬ â not for its daft headphones but for its streaming music service ) .
Amazon 's move will be as discombobulating for the book publishing industry as the advent of Spotify was for the music industry .
Stand by , therefore , for howls of protest from publishers and authors on how streaming produces infinitesimal royalties compared with the old publishing paradigm .
All true , and a reminder of Joseph Schumpeter 's conception of the waves of "" creative destruction "" with which capitalism renews itself .
Each wave has two dimensions : a creative one in which new possibilities , industries and business models emerge ; and a destructive one in which old ways of doing things ( including things that were genuinely valuable ) are destroyed .
The analogy between the Kindle and the iPod is instructive in other ways too .
Amazon 's device came with networking built - in from the beginning , whereas the iPod relied initially on a physical connection to a laptop or desktop machine for its connection to the online store .
And the connectivity of the Kindle has led to some interesting side - effects .
Obviously , users can highlight and annotate passages as they read ; but if they so choose they can also opt to see what passages other readers have highlighted , which means that one has the strange sensation of seeing what other people regard as interesting or important in the book one is reading .
That 's not necessarily great news .
Your networked Kindle tells Amazon where you 've got to in each book .
This is so that if you switch to , say , the Kindle app on your smartphone , you can pick up exactly where you left off .
But this also means that Amazon knows not only what you 're reading , but even where you 've got to .
So anonymous reading goes out of the window .
And this has led to some ingenious attempts to spot the most unread bestsellers de nos jours [ unitalics ] .
One commentator , for example , claims that Thomas Piketty 's Capital in the 21st Century currently holds that title .
But since his gleeful article appears in the Wall Street Journal , the Mandy Rice - Davies qualification applies .
He would say that , would n't he ?"
2014-07-26,"Susan Sarandon has spoken of a sexual relationship she had with David Bowie just over 30 years ago , describing the singer as "" worth idolising "" .
The Thelma and Louise co - star said they got together at around the time when both were working on the British horror film The Hunger . ""
He 's worth idolising .
He 's extraordinary .
That was a really interesting period .
I was n't supposed to have kids , and I 'm the oldest of nine and had mothered all of them , so I was n't ever in a mode where I was looking to settle down and raise a family , so that definitely changes the gene pool you 're dipping into
, "" she said in an interview with The Daily Beast . ""
But Bowie 's just a really interesting person , and so bright .
He 's a talent , and a painter , and Ã¢â¬
Â¦ he 's great . ""
Sarandon married Chris Sarandon in 1967 and divorced 12 years later .
She had a relationship with the actor Tim Robbins from 1988 to 2009 and has two sons with him .
She has a daughter with the Italian film director Franco Amurri . ""
But in terms of hooking up with movie stars , I got married really young , which knocked out most of my 20s to be fucking around .
There have been a couple of famous , pretty interesting ones .
One rock star , and another actor .
But I 'm pretty much a nester and tend to be monogamous , "" she said .
She also said she had "" issues "" with Woody Allen over his marriage to Soon - Yi Previn , the adopted daughter of his former partner Mia Farrow . ""
I think he really tore that family apart in a way that was horrible , and has n't really dealt with the aftermath .
He 's always had a reputation for being with younger girls , I mean younger girls .
And also , that young woman was very vulnerable , and I think it was very hard for the siblings , and certainly for Mia .
You just do n't go there .
You do n't go there , "" she said ."

I was hooked immediately , and watched our VHS copy Ã¢â¬ â complete with adverts , having been recorded off the telly Ã¢â¬ â so many times it eventually warped and then snapped .

However , when she accidentally calls upon the story 's cruel goblin king , Jareth Ã¢â¬ â played by Bowie Ã¢â¬ â to take Toby away
, she 's forced to embark on an expedition through a seemingly nonsensical labyrinth to rescue her half - brother from the castle beyond the goblin city .
But this is n't just a story about fiction becoming a reality , or goblins and Bowie 's impressive trouser bulge : for Sarah , this is a journey into womanhood .
As she passes through the labyrinth , she learns to cast aside the oft - repeated cry of "" It 's not fair "" and instead tackle its deadly challenges and baffling riddles through logic , friendship and bravery .
She is growing up .
Sarah befriends various bizarre creatures , and this motley crew Ã¢â¬ â Hoggle , a particularly ugly dwarf ; Ludo , a slightly dim , giant fur monster ; and Sir Didymus , a heroic fox - terrier knight who rides an old English sheepdog Ã¢â¬ â provided me with company as an only child .
But as a teenager , it was Sarah 's ability to make sense of a world that did n't make sense that drew me to her .
Burgeoning new sexual desires had sent my head spinning and my body was quickly changing .
People suddenly treated me differently , men looked at me differently and London was opening up as an overwhelming city in a way it never had before .
I was scared and confused , but Sarah 's perseverance in the labyrinth gave me courage and still inspires me to keep going when things get tough .

It 's this cusp between childhood and adulthood , between hedonism and maturity , that Jennifer Connelly Ã¢â¬ â 15 at the time of shooting Ã¢â¬
â captures so beautifully .
She is confident and good - looking , yet not as overtly sexual as women are so often portrayed on - screen Ã¢â¬ â a much stronger female role model than many available today .
However , the sexual tension between Sarah and the controlling Jareth is hard to ignore , despite Labyrinth being considered a children 's film .
When she finally reaches the castle , he begs her : "" Just fear me .
Love me .
Do as I say and I will be your slave . ""
But Sarah resists his attempts to seduce her .
She has learned that she 's in control
Ã¢â¬ â that she 's now responsible for her own destiny .
"" My kingdom is great .
You have no power over me , "" she replies , remembering the words from her book and Jareth 's kingdom dissolves .
It 's a line I often repeat to myself when dealing with real - life goblins .

2014-08-13,"Although he hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t toured since 2004 , David Bowie is to make a remarkable comeback in Australia , when an exhaustive retrospective of his 50-year career Ã¢â¬ â on a globe - trotting tour
Ã¢â¬ â will visit Melbourne in July 2015 .
David Bowie Is , an expansive study of the musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s generation - defining work curated by LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Victoria and Albert Museum , opened to rave reviews and sell - out crowds in March 2013 .
More than 300,000 people saw the show , which covers every aspect of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , including his wide range of influences .
There has been a similarly ecstatic reception during stops in Toronto , Sao Paulo , Berlin and Chicago .
Paris is also due to present it , before it arrives at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image ( ACMI ) in Melbourne .
Although Bowie has had no direct involvement , the singer is said to have given the curators carte blanche with his enormous private archive , which houses more than 75,000 items .
The V&amp;A curator , Victoria Broackes , says the sheer scale proved a little overwhelming .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is an archive of his own designs , drawings , ideas , photographs , costumes and so on , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Broackes of the vast , museum - like warehouse where she began sourcing the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s contents .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor the most part , a lot of it was simply kept .
It just wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t thrown away .
And then about 10 years ago , it was gathered together and added to .
It really is quite extraordinary .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nothing like it in popular culture.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Broackes worked her way through its digitised library for two years with her co - curator , Geoffrey Marsh , fashioning the shape and size of the show through key themes and threads .
The show stretches back in encyclopaedic fashion to the postwar rationing era of the 1950s , when a young David Jones ( he changed his name to Bowie in 1965 to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees ) first discovered rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll through Little Richard and Elvis Presley , while growing up in drab , suburban south London .
Broackes credits the 2007 costume - led show , Kylie : The Exhibition , as a turning point for the once - stuffy V&amp;A museum , paving the way for a show like David Bowie Is to flourish .
As with its Berlin incarnation , the Australian show will shine a light on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s time on local soil .
He first toured Australia in 1978 Ã¢â¬ â playing to massive outdoor stadiums for the first time Ã¢â¬ â and shot two of his most famous videos , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance and China Girl , in the country in 1983 .
The video for LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance Ã¢â¬ â BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest - selling record , produced with Nile Rodgers Ã¢â¬ â shone on a light on the plight of Indigenous Australians , with startling images referencing domestic slavery , the stolen generation and the British nuclear testing of the 1950s .
Emma McRae , the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Australian curator , says sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hopeful she can find the space to explore both clips in more detail , once the show is fully mapped out .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re very interested in the moving - image aspects of what Bowie did in Australia , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says , Ã¢â¬Åand to see whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in the archive , in terms of storyboards and anything else that Bowie might have done for the clips .
We just have to see how much we can add Ã¢â¬ â and where Ã¢â¬ â given how big the show already is.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Among the more bizarre delights already among the 300-plus items on display is a hand - written mileage chart by Bowie from his early , pre - fame touring days as Ziggy .
A dizzy array of costumes , lyrics , records , books , art and music are set against a hi - tech visual experience .
McRae says itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the extent of this material Ã¢â¬ â together with the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s diversity Ã¢â¬ â that has been wowing audiences around the world .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe show really demonstrates BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s connection with so many different areas of culture , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt looks at how he relates to music , musicals , theatre and mime , as well as film and the moving image Ã¢â¬ â he works across all those areas .
And it looks like heÃ¢â¬ â¢
s kept everything.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie managed to surprise the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s curators even further last year when he returned from a 10-year hiatus with a new album , The Next Day , recorded in secret and released without fanfare , to rave reviews .
The extraordinary breadth of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , particularly during his game - changing 1970s heyday , has led to interest in his output soaring once again , despite his reticence to return to the stage ( or , for that matter , to speak in public ) .
One of his long - time collaborators , David Mallet Ã¢â¬ â who directed the LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and China Girl clips Ã¢â¬ â still marvels at the manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ability to over - achieve ( and , at 67 , surprise ) in almost every aspect of his career .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you want to sum up what makes David stand head and shoulders above most other artists , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Mallet says , Ã¢â¬Åit is that he is songwriter , record producer , arranger , visual interpreter , art director Ã¢â¬ â everything .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all built in there .
He can do the lot , and he can usually do it much better than normal mortals like us .
Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s why heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stayed ahead of the game for more than 40 years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬Â¢ David Bowie Is will be at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image from 16 July to 1 November , 2015"
2014-08-23,"Unsurprisingly , for the man who covered David Bowie in the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first space gig and flew fighter jets for a living
, Chris Hadfield doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t see his latter years being dominated by a spot of golf and slumbering in a leather wingback chair .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople talk about retirement .
I have no desire to do nothing .
Why would you want to do nothing?,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he tells me over a cup of tea .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt seems odd.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hadfield , the Canadian astronaut who gathered more than a million Twitter followers during his stint as commander of the International Space Station , is in town for the Melbourne writers festival .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
spend my whole life just preparing for things , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to do something , right ?
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t watch TV.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Hadfield picks up a spoon and examines it thoughtfully .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhy
would you say Ã¢â¬ËI have the desire to have the same output as this spoon?Ã¢â¬
â¢ Well , no , not even that , because the spoon still has a purpose.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Now departed from the space program , Hadfield is certainly not short of purpose .
Inspired by the 1969 moon landing , he made his mind up to be an astronaut at the age of nine .
Undeterred by the fact he was born 200 m from the US border in Canada Ã¢â¬ â a country which at the time did not have a space program
Ã¢â¬ â Hadfield rose through the ranks as a leading jet fighter pilot to become arguably the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , his childhood heroes .
Now his attention has turned to writing , and public speaking , although in truth Hadfield has been doing both , less formally , for a number of years .
He says he enjoys writing .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s penned a few editorials and written an introduction to a new edition of the Martian Chronicles .
His first book , An AstronautÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Guide to Life on Earth , took him two years to write , from scrawled plans on the back of a Sudoku puzzle to being published in 14 languages .
Ã¢â¬ÅSomeone wanted to write my biography 15 years ago after the first time I went to space
and I thought there was nothing to write about yet as I hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t done anything
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut then my wife said that even Britney Spears has a biography .
Ã¢â¬ÅI got a general framework of an idea , the stories I wanted in there , and then called an author friend to ask how you write a book .
He said : Ã¢â¬ËTrust me , get an agent.Ã¢â¬ â¢
So I did , which was the right thing to do , because he led me through the whole process and put me in touch with professional writers
so I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make stupid mistakes.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
HadfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book is hard to define , probably the closest thing IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever read to self - help .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also far more enjoyable than that makes it sound .
Along with incredible insights of life in space , there are long ruminations on how to prepare for the worst eventualities and advice on how to make life easier for those around you
Ã¢â¬ â professionally and personally .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe publisher
didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know what section to put the book in , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hadfield says .
Ã¢â¬ÅDoes it go in the self - help section or biography ?
Some stores have put it in the astronomy section .
Astronomy !
Some people have said it isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really a biography , but it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t supposed to be , nor was it is a treatise on insects .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s truly an astronautÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guide to life on Earth.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Hadfield said his experience as a jet fighter pilot , followed by 21 years at NASA , gave him some Ã¢â¬Ågenerically useful ideasÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ he wants to pass onto readers .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heartened by the fact some people have been able to use the advice in their lives .
Much of the advice concerns the importance of preparation .
One section details how Hadfield was told Elton John would be appearing at an event he was also attending .
Hadfield , an accomplished guitarist , spent hours practising various songs in the remote possibility John might invite him on stage for a number .
Ã¢â¬ÅLife is in the small details , I think ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
The risks of being a jet pilot and astronaut arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Ã¢â¬ÅthrillsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he adds .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ d describe them as narrowly avoided deaths .
No one wants an adrenaline junkie as an astronaut .
If IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m relying on a last - ditch action to keep myself alive , I havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t planned properly .
We are constantly digging into the source of danger .
Once you figure out the source of danger , your fear goes .
In the cockpit , we say : Ã¢â¬ËOK , whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the next thing that will kill us?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I ask him whether he thinks we had lost our sense of wonder at space exploration before his stunning visualisation on social media ?
Were we taking it for granted ?
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think we have
but you can only land on the moon for the first time once
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅNASA Ã¢â¬ â no ,
the American public Ã¢â¬ â would like to have a landing on the moon about once a year.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And now people are saying we have to land on Mars , he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no reason to go to Mars .
WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the point ?
If the reason is we want to recreate the excitement of landing on the moon , then you are a very poor student of history .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what follows which matters .
We now have six people living permanently off Earth on the International Space Station , doing incredible work.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Perhaps one thing Hadfield wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fully prepared for was the fandom , the flattery of celebrity .
His cover of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Space Oddity , suggested and then edited by his son Evan , has been viewed a huge number of times on YouTube .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie said it was the most poignant version of the song ever made , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hadfield says .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe sent me several emails complementing the video .
I made it one afternoon in a couple of hours .
It was me all by myself with a camera , kind of inventing space music videos.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Other videos , showing Hadfield preparing a meal in zero gravity or his ode to Canada , have also proved popular .
He will now consult on a US TV show , based on his book , about an astronaut struggling to return to domestic life following his descent from space .
But he is probably more comfortable being strapped into a tiny pod attached to eight million horsepower rockets than talking about being a internet sensation .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was the top test pilot in the US air force , the top test pilot in the US navy , I intercepted Soviet bombers in Canadian air space and I commanded the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spaceship , so
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s funny when people say IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a YouTube person
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , his moustache dancing a slight jig of agitation on his top lip .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf people want to celebrate me , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he says , adding that public appreciation of the space program is his primary goal .
As he stresses during a fascinating one - off show at the Melbourne Writers Festival later in the day , the celebrity factor has paid dividends .
More people are interested in NASAÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , and millions of schoolchildren have been inspired by space exploration .
But while the audience is engrossed by the facts ( did you know you see 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets a day when in space ? ) and awed by HadfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pictures , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s noticeable how any reference to pop culture sparks heightened interest .
Ã¢â¬ÅI have severe issues with Gravity , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hadfield tells the Melbourne Town Hall crowd , screwing up his nose .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Earth is the wrong side and it was like George Clooney was trying to pick up Sandra Bullock .
And what would she be doing in space after just six months training?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hadfield finishes the show on the guitar , in an impressive abridged version of Space Oddity .
And then off to retire , but only for the night .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Melbourne writersÃ¢â¬ â¢ festival runs from 21 - 31 August in venues across the city Ã¢â¬Â¢
Chris HadfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book , An AstronautÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Guide to Life on Earth , is published by Pan Macmillan Australia ."

2014-10-06,"Former My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way says he wants to Ã¢â¬Åsonically galvanise peopleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with his first solo album .
And what better way is there to stun your audience , not with spoon solos , say , but with a celebration of that much - maligned instrument , the guitar ?
Utilising what Way describes as currently the Ã¢â¬Åleast radio - friendly instrumentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Hesitant Alien draws from the iconic guitar - led sounds he grew up with Ã¢â¬ â particularly David Bowie circa TVC 1 , Britpop and his guitar heroes during art school , Mary Timony and Carrie Brownstein .
Ã¢â¬ÅI wanted to make the small things sound big , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says about Hesitant Alien .
Ã¢â¬ÅI knew there would be lots of fuzz pedals .
I knew I would play Fender instruments.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Lifted from the album is his new single , Millions , which is released on 17 November and comes backed with a video that looks as if it was inspired by Talking HeadsÃ¢â¬ â¢
Once in a Lifetime , or a Neneh Cherry creation from the 90s .
Watch the premiere below , and let us know your thoughts ."
2014-10-12,"It says something about the position David Bowie has skilfully manoeuvred himself into over the last 18 months that the fact heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s added a new track to a greatest hits collection is treated as news .
That kind of thing has been standard music industry practice since at least the mid-80s , a means of convincing fans to part with cash for an album largely comprised of stuff they already own , and it doesnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t usually attract the attention afforded Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) : no one was obliged to come up with an instant track review when the Police stuck DonÃ¢â¬
â¢
t Stand
So Close To Me Ã¢â¬ â¢ 86 on Every Breath
You Take :
The Singles .
But then , the new track that gets stuck on a greatest hits as an inducement usually feels like an afterthought , and whatever else it may be , Sue ( in a Season of Crime ) clearly isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that .
The greatest hits collection
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s promoting
, Nothing Has Changed Ã¢â¬ â something like the 18th best of collection of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career Ã¢â¬ â
has a rather bullish air to it : in its deluxe edition , presented in reverse chronological order , it takes a CD and a half to reach what most people consider BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s classic period .
Sue ( in a Season of Crime ) is the first thing you hear : seven - and - a - half minutes of occasionally atonal brass , drums cantering at a speed that could make listeners recall his experiments with drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass on 1997Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Earthling , and agonised vocals .
It would be wrong to say that his collaboration with New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Maria Schneider Orchestra
hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t got a tune , but you have to search for it .
It feels as much a statement as a song .
Once the excitement of his unexpected return had died down , the one criticism levelled at last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Next Day was that it sounded not a million miles removed from the albums that Bowie was making before he vanished .
It was superior but relatively straightforward rock music : the Bowie who spent the 70s confounding expectations and leaping into the unknown had clearly left the building .
The main message of Sue ( in a Season of Crime ) seems to be :
no he hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
Something about the pained vocal style recalls latterday Scott Walker , the living embodiment of the celebrated rock star whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cut all ties with his past and fully immersed himself in the avant garde ( WalkerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence could also be detected in the dense mass of historical and literary allusions that comprised some of The Next DayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lyrics ) .
Jazz is one area that Bowie has rarely dabbled in : at last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s V&amp;A exhibition , you could hear him dismissively talking about trying to convince himself he liked Eric Dolphy in his mod years .
On those occasions when it has touched his music , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s used it in an ornamental way :
Mike GarsonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
piano on Aladdin SaneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title track , the presence of Art Ensemble of Chicago founder Lester Bowie on 1993Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Black Tie White Noise .
Sue feels far more immersive : whether itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a one - off or an indication of a new path Ã¢â¬ â and indeed what the jazz world makes of Bowie fronting one of AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most celebrated big bands
Ã¢â¬ â remains to be seen ."
2014-10-30,"Ã¢â¬ÅI saw the lineup he had behind him
and I thought ,
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to learn the saxophone .
When I grow up , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to play in his band .
So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
David Bowie describes the moment that inspired him to be a musician .
He watched Little Richard perform A Girl CanÃ¢â¬
â¢ t Help It when he was just nine years old .
Jayne Mansfield may have been swinging seductively across the film set , but it was the saxophone section that really did it for David .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s try and relive that moment with a clip from the film with that title .
The saxophone has blown hot and cold in terms of being fashionable , but its attractions remain undeniable .
Beloved of characters as diverse as Van Morrison to Bill Clinton and Lisa Simpson , it is seductively curvaceous , shiny and expressive .
Gerry Mulligan described its versatility when he said Ã¢â¬Åyou can make a saxophone into an electric organ Ã¢â¬ â you can do anything with itÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Charlie Parker , who did indeed do just about anything with the instrument , advised others : Ã¢â¬ÅDonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t play the saxophone , let it play you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Another jazz great , Stan Getz , expressed one key quality in saying Ã¢â¬Åif you like an instrument that sings , play the saxophone .
At its best itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like the human voice.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ The vocal quality is a really key point .
The sax can sing , dance , cry and laugh , be smooth or guttural , but above all , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s emotional .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s have a look at some of these qualities by watching a couple of players from an even earlier era
Ã¢â¬ â the 1920s Ã¢â¬ â demonstrate .
Gee , they sure are a couple of swell fellows .
So this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s song nominations , learned RR listeners , must all feature the saxophone in a dominant role or having a key moment , or indeed any that are about the instrument itself .
The topic is prompted by two events , the recent death of that great player Raphael Ravenscroft , who significantly boosted the saxophoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s profile with a famous solo , and because next week , on 6 November , when a final A - list of such songs will be published here , is the bicentenary of the instrumentÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Belgian inventor , Adolphe Sax .
Looking to create a new instrument that combined the reed mouthpiece of the clarinet with the resonance of the French horn , Sax produced an unusual hybrid ,
musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s equivalent of the liger or zorse .
It was a cousin of SaxÃ¢â¬ â¢ s other inventions , the ophicleide , saxtromba , saxhorn and saxtuba , but surpassed them all in time .
In the 1840s it met the approval of composers including Hector Berlioz and a family range of nine versions eventually appeared , in increasing sizes : the sopranissimo , sopranino , soprano , alto , tenor , baritone , bass , contrabass and subcontrabass .
So first letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s have a listen to one of SaxÃ¢â¬ â¢ s original instruments , sweeter and mellower perhaps than some modern models .
How low can we go ?
I always like to push things to the max in RR , so
letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s have a blast on the contrabass saxophone .
And now , brace yourselves , for the biggest daddy of them all , the subcontrabass .
Check out the size of those pad cups and holes .
It looks like it could eat a person whole .
The sax also has a few odd cousins , such as a bamboo model or the saxello , but they all count , and whether your suggestions appear in classical , jazz , funk , ska , military marching , pop , rock or any other genre , now is the time to blow your horn about it .
This weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s

2014-11-05,"Some fashion trends are never going to go mass , especially in menswear .
Take animal print .
It is no doubt laughable in certain quarters , confined to the wardrobes of showmen such as David Bowie or Rod Stewart .
But like tie - dye , which had a mini - moment earlier this year , clothes that make a statement will always find an audience .
Leopard skin is no exception .
And before anyone gets worked up Ã¢â¬ â
no , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not saying itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the new navy .
Animal print accessories are one of the easiest places to start .
The high street will service you well with leopard skater shoes that are easy to slip on with jeans or , if you want to deviate slightly from straight - up leopard , NikeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Jordan Spizike hi - tops come decorated with an alternative Ã¢â¬ÅelephantÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ print .
Designer brands , from Valentino ( trainers ) to Saint Laurent ( backpacks ) , are also ticking the animal - pattern box this season , although if I were dipping my toe into leopard , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d blow the budget with a Christopher Kane cashmere scarf .
Jolly knitwear Ã¢â¬ â from fuzzy fronts to graphic slabs of colour Ã¢â¬
â is in endless supply this winter , so an animal - patterned sweater is another route in .
London - based knitwear trio
Sibling is a good first port of call : this season theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve fused red leopard with Fair Isle into one jumper .
For something a tad more stealth Ã¢â¬ â yes , animal print doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to shout Ã¢â¬
â try GucciÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cashmere crew neck , which wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t look out of place under a suit jacket for a relaxed evening look .
Reiss has also come up trumps with its cotton plum crew knit , which will definitely turn heads during the festive season , which is sometimes the point , isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t it ?

Finally , if all else fails , make your leopard look go with a Saint Laurent pout and swagger .
Animal patterns are the perfect rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll motif for Hedi SlimaneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s revved - up clothes for the French house Ã¢â¬ â and this autumnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nippy runway bikers , featuring slabs of leopard , have been a sellout .
I was going to leave you with the warning that the only thing not to do with leopard is to wear it on your legs ( thanks , Rod Stewart ) .
But then , Sir Paul SmithÃ¢â¬ â¢ s narrow leopard - print slacks are actually surprisingly palatable .
If you think of them as an alternative to the tuxedo trouser and donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t ask anyone if they think youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re sexy , you should be just grand ."
2014-11-06,"Ever since Bob Dylan went electric and a fan cried Ã¢â¬ÅJudas!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ stars have alienated fans with unexpected new directions .
US rock star Gerard Way previously fronted the popular American rock band My Chemical Romance , whose darker anthems found favour with emo fans .
However , recent solo debut Hesitant Alien saw him significantly change tack , a shorter haircut reflecting his new songsÃ¢â¬ â¢ mix of David Bowie , Suede and Britpop .
The fans here are hardly disowning him , though .
One mimics WayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new look down to an identikit suit and flame - red hair .
Another holds a banner reading : Ã¢â¬ÅThanks to you IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m no longer afraid to keep on living.Ã¢â¬

The star arrives to a screaming noise like a giant kettle boiling .
Way doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t miss a trick to keep the audience on his side .
He makes grand speeches supporting his ( huge ) female and transgender fanbases .
Perhaps , if the East Grinstead Railway Modelling Society were in the building , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d aim a speech at them as well .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all geared towards making the musical volte - face less difficult than it could be .
Although the sound system Ã¢â¬ â cranked up to compete with the screaming crowd Ã¢â¬ â renders some of the songs slightly shrill , the trickiest bit might be reaching an older crowd beyond the MCR fanbase .
HeÃ¢â¬

as his closing cover of the Jesus and Mary ChainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Snakedriver , although snappy , arty , swaggering anthems such as Brother and No Shows get arms swaying like a 70s glam rock gig .
A charisma - dripping showman to the last , Way drops to his knees like Elvis and Ã¢â¬ â when he plucks a girl from the crowd to play tambourine and leaves her with a bear
hug Ã¢â¬

he gives one young fan a moment to remember for the rest of her life .

2014-11-13,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest collection , Nothing Has Changed , is released on Monday , trailed by a new song , Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) .
Reviewing the song in October , Alexis Petridis wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅIt feels as much a statement as a song .
Once the excitement of his unexpected return had died down , the one criticism levelled at last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Next Day was that it sounded not a million miles removed from the albums that Bowie was making before he vanished .
It was superior but relatively straightforward rock music : the Bowie who spent the 70s confounding expectations and leaping into the unknown had clearly left the building .

2014-11-13,"Ã¢â¬ÅHeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
not even dead!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
says one stunned young visitor to the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s smash - hit exhibition on David Bowie , the subject of this highly enjoyable documentary tribute .
It stages dramatised tableaux around the exhibition space , interviews Bowie scholars , collaborators and fans , and showcases fascinating archival material .
Bowie emerges as an aesthete and a rebel , a figure of dissident , unrepentant gorgeousness .
( Oddly , the movie doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t comment on the different - coloured eyes that were part of his exotic charm . )
He was a master and inspirer of many genres , including the lost art form of the 12-inch album cover , and his videos from the early 70s still stand up Ã¢â¬
â although he was always a better actor in the videos than in his feature films .
Watching this movie is reminder of how BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s compelling Space Oddity intuited the real fear Ã¢â¬ â now forgotten Ã¢â¬ â that the Apollo 11 crew would conquer the moon but not return .
As this is a movie which concerns itself with the evanescent forms of style , I would have liked to see it say something about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very brief , unhappy flirtation with fascist posturing Ã¢â¬ â a flip , ironic provocation , not helped by drug issues .
But even the greatest figures can do foolish things .
As a child , David Bowie passed his 11-plus but chose to go to Bromley technical high school , where he neglected his schoolwork and nourished his brilliance and self - belief .

2014-12-03,"1 Space Oddity
When David Bowie hit No 5 in 1969 , he must have thought heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d finally made it , but his inability to follow Space Oddity with another song that captured the nationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s imagination would see him drift back to outsiderdom for a few years yet .
In modern times , artists signed to major labels are rarely afforded the luxury of even three strikes before theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re out , which is in sharp contrast to the many years a young David Jones spent as a second - rate Anthony Newley impersonator , trying on different styles and attempting to figure out what it was he wanted to do .
His first hit in 1967 , The Laughing Gnome , was a novelty single that still causes him embarrassment , and then his first bona fide smash came two years after that , given a massive leg - up thanks to its topical subject matter .
Long time producer Tony Visconti passed over the opportunity to work on Space Oddity to Gus Dudgeon , calling it Ã¢â¬Åa cheap shot , a gimmick to cash in on the moon landingsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
( though he recently admitted regretting his earlier sniffiness ) .
There was certainly more than a hint of opportunism , but the song has maintained devotion , and is arguably BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most famous song , thanks to the epic sci - fi production , catchy close harmonies , intriguing narrative and the all - too - human dialogue between Major Tom and Ground Control that drifts closer to pathos with each passing minute .
The handclaps donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do it any harm either .
The disappointment of falling out of the publicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s affections so quickly after such a long wait must have hurt Bowie , but also galvanised him , and he soon learned the importance of communicating a strong concept .
Within three years that notion would foment into a pop apotheosis .
It was called Ziggy Stardust .

The Bewlay Brothers
What , no Life on Mars ?
If choosing 10 tracks from the career of David Bowie is difficult , then trying to isolate a best moment from Hunky Dory is impossible .
Life on Mars ?
written as a kind of riposte to My Way and in many ways more overblown , was not for nothing voted greatest all - time Bowie song by readers of Digital Spy in 2012 , though it loses points here because its lyrics are largely gibberish .
Not that The Bewlay Brothers doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t keep us guessing with its poetic abstraction and folky weirdness , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s somehow an altogether more cohesive conundrum .
There are moments that creep into the hinterland of childish nightmares , the line about frightening Ã¢â¬Åthe small children awayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and the disturbing nursery rhyme sing - songiness of the conclusion ( Ã¢â¬ÅLay me place and bake me pie/ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m starving for me gravy Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) which unsettles as much as it astounds .
It was more or less written and recorded over the night of 30 July 1971 with producer Ken Scott , according to Nicholas PeggÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Complete David Bowie , and the singer once said people could Ã¢â¬ËÃ¢â¬Åread whatever in hell they want to read into itÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Some have come with a theory that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s relationship with his schizophrenic half - brother Terry Burns , and his own fears of mental illness .
Terry committed suicide in 1985 , a subject written about later on 1993Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Jump
They Say .
3 Mott the Hoople Ã¢â¬ â All the Young Dudes
If BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own career hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been entirely rebooted yet in May 1972 ( it was still another six months before Ziggy would fall to Earth ) , then the gift of All the Young Dudes to a floundering
Mott the Hoople was the first salvo in a sideline career that saw him bequeath Lazarus - like extra lives to old favourites ; his amazing restorative powers would raise American rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll legends Lou Reed , and later Iggy Pop , from their slumbers .
Mott the Hoople had actually split up , or were in the process of doing so , when the call came with the offer of a new song Bowie had just written .
His benevolence saw these builders in blouses take his glam rock teen manifesto to No 3 in the charts , their biggest hit .
Ã¢â¬ÅSpeed jive , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ croaked Ian Hunter , Ã¢â¬ÅdonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t wanna stay alive when youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re 25Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ .
It was a song that was clearly dangerous , and with a line like Ã¢â¬Åman
I need TV when I got T RexÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
, it was dangerously sarcastic , too .
Bowie recorded a glut of rollicking glam rock classics : Drive In Saturday , The Jean Genie , Diamond Dogs and Suffragette City to name just four , but none were more exuberant than All the Young Dudes , and certainly not BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own version , which was lacklustre in comparison .
4 RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Suicide Again , how do you even begin to decide on just one track from The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars ?
RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Suicide just about gets the nod for its sheer ambition .
It begins with a simple acoustic strum , takes in horns , a compound duple time signature that gives it a walzy feel and a whiff of the old French chanson thrown in along the way , and a mesmeric finale of orchestration and Bowie screaming Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not alone!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ at the top of his voice .
Though just three minutes long , it creates the illusion that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at least twice that length .
As the final song on Ziggy , it is a timeless , bravura piece of songwriting to conclude one of the finest collections of songs ever thrown together .
Ziggy was the Bowie incarnation that resonated most with people , and at times during the cocaine madness he even admitted he became frightened Ziggy was taking him over .
The character had to go , and while many were shocked to see him killed off so soon , it was probably best for BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sanity that he dispensed with him after just two albums , The Rise Ã¢â¬ Â¦ and Aladdin Sane .
Ziggy was essentially a rock opera that was bound to end tragically , and the clues were all there in the lyrics for anyone paying close enough attention .
5 Young Americans
If Bowie knew all about breaking through with concepts pertinent to his audience , then he had to resort to writing about things that would be familiar to a US audience to score his first hit across the Atlantic ( even if some of those things werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t entirely flattering ) .
Young Americans peaked at No 28 on the Billboard chart and included a Richard Nixon name - check , as well as alluding to Joseph McCarthy and also the civil rights movement in the lyrics .
To be fair , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s obsession with American soul music went much deeper than just the desire for a hit .
The musical transition from Diamond Dogs was a dramatic one , and all achieved in the space of 11 months .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Ã¢â¬Åplastic soulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ period was a fine approximation of contemporary R&amp;B with a soupÃÂ§on of gospel , aided by American musicians that included backing singer Luther Vandross , Sly and the Family Stone drummer Andy Newmark , and Puerto Rican guitarist Carlos Alomar , who , on meeting Bowie , described him as Ã¢â¬Åthe whitest man IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever seenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
David SanbornÃ¢â¬ â¢ s saxophone break at the beginning may be one of the coolest and most iconic in pop , while near the conclusion Bowie cheekily slips in words borrowed from A Day in the Life by his pal John Lennon .
The ex - Beatle appeared on the follow - up single Fame and LennonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stardust propelled Bowie towards his first US
No 1 .

Always Crashing in the Same Car Heroes might well be the populist choice from Berlin - era Bowie if you had to nail down just the one song , but Always Crashing in the Same Car is a more nuanced and enigmatic beast .
Moody and paranoiac at the outset
, it then develops a sense of motion , a Ballardian union of man and machine that borders on the sexual .
The song was inspired by Bowie writing off his Mercedes in a Berlin parking lot while under the influence ( Ã¢â¬ÅI was just goinÃ¢â¬ â¢ round anÃ¢â¬ â¢ round/
The hotel garage/ Must have been touching close to 94Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , but thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s surely little doubt the voracious bookworm would have read Crash Ã¢â¬ â which came out in 1973 Ã¢â¬ â by then .
The culling of the Spiders seemed cruel , and giving Mick Ronson the boot utterly ruthless , and yet Bowie proved himself not for the first time ( and certainly not the last ) a canny operator where collaborators were concerned .
Guitarist Ricky GardinerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s solo here is one of the most evocative and breathtaking of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s oeuvre , standing shoulder to shoulder with some of RonsonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest moments .
If Low was an album of two halves , with the latter part swathed in ambient compositions made with Brian Eno Ã¢â¬ â all produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti by the way Ã¢â¬ â then
Always Crashing in the Same Car was a track that attempted hardest to bring together the worlds of pop and the avant - garde .
7 Ashes to Ashes
Bowie struck lucky once again with a familiar figure , scoring his second Major Tom - themed No 1 , and if Space Oddity concealed a clandestine metaphor about heroin addiction , then in 1980 we find Tom way down in the hole , Ã¢â¬Åhitting an all - time lowÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
By invoking the character that kickstarted his career , Bowie seemed to be drawing a line and moving on from one of the most productive decades of work by any artist in pop history , and if that was indeed the case , then he was going out on a ( strung - out ) high .
For readers of a certain age , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s difficult to disassociate the music with the startling , spooky video , recorded at popular suicide spot Beachy Head , and featuring a young Steve Strange and three other Blitz kids plucked from obscurity when Bowie dropped in on the nightclub one evening in 1979 .
Another clue Bowie was looking backwards was in the makeup he wore in the promo , harking back to his days under the tutelage of mime artist Lindsay Kemp , but Ashes to Ashes Ã¢â¬ â one of his most beautiful and frighteningly original works Ã¢â¬
â also gave birth to the new romantic movement .
It should also be noted it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t short on new musical techniques either ; itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s surely the most moving song to ever feature slap bass .
8 Modern Love Presided over by Bowie and Nile Rodgers ,
1983Ã¢â¬ â¢ s album
LetÃ¢â¬
â¢ s Dance sold in the region of 7 m copies worldwide , making it BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s most successful album to date .
While it subsequently spent time in the wilderness , rejected by many because of its 80s production values , a reappraisal was all but inevitable and has coincided with a renaissance in RodgerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career and an outpouring of love for the unprecedentedly successful producer / guitarist .
Modern Love bursts with the kind of ebullience that was more characteristic of another stateside - straddling British solo singer Ã¢â¬ â
Elton John Ã¢â¬ â at the time , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not difficult to imagine how it might sound with EltonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocal over the top .
While weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d now moved into an era where the certainty everything Bowie touched would become a stone - cold classic was behind us , Modern Love , with its sassy , sophisticated brass and nod to the call and response stylings of Little Richard , is just that .
Director Noah Baumbach included the song almost in its entirety in 2012Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Frances Ha , and the moment Greta Gerwig is shot running in black and white to that frenetic beat and those familiar spoken words Ã¢â¬ÅI know when to go out , and when to stay in Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ is one of the most exhilarating scenes in recent cinema .
9 Absolute Beginners
If his re - emergence in early 2013 following a 10- year interregnum was spectacular , then Bowie always moved in mysterious ways .
In 1985 , a group of session musicians working with Thomas Dolby at Abbey Road studios were handed letters from EMI requesting they work with a Ã¢â¬ÅMr XÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be unsurprised to learn that Mr X turned out to be yet another nom - de - guerre for Mr Bowie .
Players on the sessions included Steve Nieve on keyboards , Kevin Armstrong ( guitarist with Steve McQueen - era Prefab Sprout ) , and Rick Wakeman , who added Rachmaninov - style flourishes of piano throughout .
It also featured BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most iconic sax break since Young Americans .
The track , written for the movie of the same name , came together quickly according to those involved , and as well as being one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best songs , it arrived in isolation during one of the more forgettable periods of his career .
Heartbreakingly romantic and optimistic , it tipped a fedora to the 1950s in homage to the writings of hip cat Colin MacInnes , though the film would turn out to be an overbudget turkey of huge proportions .

Where Are We Now ?
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just that the song was great , but it was also about how it arrived , from out of nowhere on a bleak January morning in 2013 .
Rumours had persisted about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s health , and many assumed he would never make another record .
And then there it was , a single video uploaded to YouTube , proof that Bowie was back and he meant business .
Among all the topical cavalcades and the shitstorms , this song represented a genuine moment of unbridled joy for his fans , a distillation of all their hopes into one song , hopes that he might one day return with something we could fall in love with again .
Here the Thin White Duke took the opportunity to look back again , this time at his Berlin years , and the unashamed fragility in his voice was all too much for some people .
The old master had outfoxed us again , and the mind boggled at how heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d managed to keep this operation a secret ( with military precision and signed contracts threatening to sue anyone who opened their mouths , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how ) .
If Bowie had influenced the new romantics and the glam rockers and the punks , then here he was again shaping popular culture , with everyone from BeyoncÃ Â© to Skrillex and most recently U2 following his lead by releasing music onto the internet without prior announcement and a preceding PR campaign .
Each had their own variations and gimmicks , but it was Bowie who did it first .
Rihanna may be next .
The Next Day followed Where Are We
Now ?
a few months later , and finally we had a new Bowie album that could genuinely lay claim to being his best since Scary Monsters .
It was certainly his best since LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance ."
2014-12-04,"Dave Grohl has detailed his failed attempts to record music with both Prince and David Bowie , revealing that the former snubbed him and the latter claimed to be too busy .
Ã¢â¬Å[Bowie and I ] were , uh , maybe gon na do a thing together and it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really pan out , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Grohl told radio host Howard Stern .
Ã¢â¬ÅI had an opportunity to do a song thing for this movie , and I thought ...
it would be really fun to get someone else to sing on it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
After contacting Bowie through producer Tony Visconti , Grohl tried to schedule a recording session .
It never happened .
Ã¢â¬Å[It was just ] logistics , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Grohl said .
Ã¢â¬ÅSometimes you want to do something and thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no time.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Foos leader claims they now sometimes email .
With Prince , GrohlÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
plans were rejected with even less fanfare .
They met backstage in 2011 , after the Purple One performed at the Los Angeles forum .
Prince apparently suggested that they could Ã¢â¬ÅjamÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ together at a show the following Friday .
Ã¢â¬ÅI waited for [ Prince ] to call all week , [ and ] he never called , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Grohl said .
The Foo Fighter showed up anyway , and they ended up playing together at soundcheck - Grohl on drums , Prince on bass .
Ã¢â¬Å[HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ]
shred[ding ]
the bass like IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never seen anyone play it ...
Then we start playing [ Led ZeppelinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ]

To Grohl , the jam seemed Ã¢â¬ÅamazingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But Prince Ã¢â¬ÅdidnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to do itÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as part of that nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s show .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe goes , Ã¢â¬ËWhat are you doing next week?Ã¢â¬ â¢
And then I never saw him again.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
This was apparently PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s way Ã¢â¬Åof blowing me offÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Despite his poor luck with Prince and Bowie , Grohl has performed with almost every other rocker under the sun , from Paul McCartney to Jack White .
And as part of his new documentary series , Sonic Highways , Grohl even sat down with the president : Barack Obama appears on the seriesÃ¢â¬ â¢ final episode , airing this week .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe walked in the room , he loosened his tie and we talked about Dylan and the Stones , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Grohl said .
Sonic Highways has been broadcast in conjunction with the release of the Foo FightersÃ¢â¬ â¢ album of the same title .

2014-12-07,"Our brother , Ian Fraser , who has died aged 81 , conducted the 1961 West End hit Stop the World Ã¢â¬
â
I Want to Get Off , and was Julie AndrewsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical director for 40 years .
Ian went to the US with Stop the World in 1962 , but he enjoyed working with British musicians and returned to the UK from time to time for recordings and broadcasts .
He directed Bing CrosbyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Merrie Olde Christmas for BBC television ( 1977 ) , conducting Bing in both his last rendition of White Christmas and the hurriedly composed duet Peace on Earth , sung with David Bowie .
IanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last visit to Britain
was in 2010 , to conduct his own score for AndrewsÃ¢â¬
â¢ s telling of her life story , The Gift of Music , at the O2 arena in London .
Ian made his home in Los Angeles and it was there that he made his major contribution to music .
Ian is one of the most Emmy - honoured composer / conductors in television history , with 32 nominations and 11 wins for outstanding music direction .
He conducted the 52nd presidential inaugural gala , for Bill Clinton ( 1993 ) , with Aretha Franklin , Michael Jackson , Elton John and Barbra Streisand , and Christmas in Washington .
This televised variety show , traditionally attended by the president and his family , has run for more than 30 years under IanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s baton and has featured singers ranging from Andrea Bocelli to Annie Lennox .
Ian was born in Hove , East Sussex , to Sheila ( nee Watson ) , and raised by his grandmother , taking her maiden name of Fraser .
Sheila appeared in Wake Up and Dream on Broadway at the age of 16 and later married Frederick Sykes , our father , an army padre , who also supported Ian .
At Eastbourne college , IanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wide - ranging musical talent won him awards for singing , drumming , bugle and piano .
He auditioned to be an organ scholar at KingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s College , Cambridge , playing for Boris Ord , but on being warned by Sir Adrian Boult that music was a precarious living he decided on a military career .
Training at the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall in the early 1950s led to five years in the Royal Artillery Band as a solo concert pianist , harpist and percussionist .
On leaving the forces , he played in clubs and accompanied singers .
In 1959 , while working with Anthony Newley in a Decca recording studio , Ian met Leslie Bricusse , who wrote Stop the World .
They worked together thereafter .
Around this time we would tune in to the ITV music programme
Oh Boy ! ,
looking out for Ian at the piano in the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s resident band , Lord RockinghamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s XI , which had a hit with Hoots Mon ( 1958 ) .
Ian is survived by his wife , Judee , whom he met in the US and married in 1964 , by us , and by three children , six grandchildren and three great - grandchildren ."
2014-12-07,"The next giant leap for mankind should be back on the moon not Mars , the astronaut Chris Hadfield has said .
Famous for sporting a military moustache , tweeting spacewalk selfies and strumming David Bowie songs on board the International Space Station ( his hugely popular cover of Space Oddity has recently been reposted on YouTube with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s consent ) , Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space and became the first Canadian commander of the ISS when he took the reins last year on his final space mission .
Speaking at a Guardian Live event at the Royal Geographical Society in London on Sunday , Hadfield criticised the current scramble to put an astronaut on the red planet .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf we started going to Mars any time soon everybody would die , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know what we are doing yet .
We have to have a bunch of inventions between now and Mars.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He believes our level of unpreparedness is even worse than that of the 1845 expedition to chart the Northwest Passage , an attempt which ended in tragedy with the death of the entire party including its leader , Sir John Franklin , who was a founder of the Royal Geographical Society .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are previous to Franklin in our ability to go to Mars right now , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hadfield .
HadfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s speech to a packed auditorium about his experiences in space was set against a backdrop of breathtaking images from his latest book , You are Here :
Around the World in 92 Minutes .
The title of the book Ã¢â¬ â a collection of astonishing photographs taken by Hadfield from the ISS Ã¢â¬ â refers to the time it takes the space station to orbit Earth .
But , while praising the engineers who built the Orion spacecraft that was launched last week in NasaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first step towards a new series of manned space missions , Hadfield stressed the next big step should be to construct a permanent lunar base .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat is a great vehicle , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said of Orion .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut where we are going to go next is the moon .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where we are going to go because it just makes sense .
It is only three days away and we can invent so many things.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
HadfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s comments come just days after he denounced the privately funded Mars One mission in the online magazine Matter , claiming the ambitious project is technologically unprepared .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a great , I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know , self - defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he warned .

She started out as a singer and songwriter before wanting to get to grips with the workings of a studio and completed a masterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in music technology from NYU before setting out on a job hunt , seeking major studios in the New York area .
She briefly worked at Masterdisk , one of two acclaimed studios in the city at the time .
But her experience was disheartening .
Ã¢â¬ÅI learned exactly how I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to do things , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI learned great things but mostly how not to run a business.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At the time , in the late 90s , studios were largely male - dominated and unwelcoming .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere were definitely things and responses that were gender - based and inappropriate , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere were also artists that were completely sexist .
I remember a hip - hop session when somebody grabbed me while I was walking down the hall carrying tapes because he thought he could.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But with time , sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s seen the landscape change , with misogyny being stigmatised over time even if female engineers are still rare .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
you brought those things up back then you wouldÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been ostracised .
You had this sense of losing everything if you came out with it .
So you had to be strong and remove yourself from situations .
I think it still exists , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s less of an issue now .
Women are more empowered to speak out and feel more comfortable asserting their rights .
If it was today , I wouldÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve responded differently.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She quit Masterdisk as soon as she got an offer to go back to NYU , this time as a summer school teacher .
Soon after , she started her own studio in her one - bedroom apartment .
A year later , at the age of 26 , she moved into the building where The Lodge operates today .
Ã¢â¬ÅHer records are timeless yet contemporary , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Greg Kurstin , a Grammy - nominated producer who worked on SiaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album , 1000 Forms of Fear .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe holds a special place where she can do very artistic albums that donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t necessarily mean to be mainstream , commercial records .
But somehow her records can fit in with pop music
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s out today .
SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one of the few people who can really achieve that in the mastering world.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
LazarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work on HaimÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Day
Are Gone retained the classic 80s sound , while she gave the final nod to Sleigh BellsÃ¢â¬ â¢ excessively and purposefully loud Treats .
She takes pride in her ability to interpret musiciansÃ¢â¬ â¢ stories through her interactions with them .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t undo what people have done , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy goal is not to tell someone what they want but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s to draw out , through a dialogue ,
what they want.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Mastering builds on the creative process of putting an album together Ã¢â¬
â it can either enhance or diminish the listening experience .
Ã¢â¬ÅNo mastering engineer is going to turn a bad song into a great song , but they can take a bad recording and make it sound like a great recording , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you can align a great song and a great recording , now youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re
really talking.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The art lies in achieving the right balance .
Music production is cluttered with apps that claim to achieve that effect .
Algorithms can sort through the plethora of effects that are now at the disposal of a producer or an engineer to make a decision for a song .
But theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not a replacement for human instinct .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve edited records with analog and digital pieces to achieve different things with different elements ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to assume an algorithm can make those decisions Ã¢â¬ â
it canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅYou can be a mastering engineer and bring to it who you are , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says , before arguing that like a story , every album needs a beginning , middle and end .
Ã¢â¬ÅArtists donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t always know what that should be , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Lazar .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou can come in with the sequence but this is where it gets put in order.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

Ã¢â¬ÅPhotography traditionally has an aggressive and acquisitive language , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI learned early on to say Ã¢â¬ËletÃ¢â¬ â¢ s make a photo together , Ã¢â¬ â¢ so
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s people on both sides of the camera collaborating.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½

Ã¢â¬ÅHe tells the story of the personÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life by taking their portrait.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
However , back in his studio days , Zuckerman considered himself a gun for hire .
On set he would shoot only what he thought the studio wanted , and when it came time to shoot portraits , he would watch the movie and try to capture the essence of the character more than the actor .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe whole point of is to try to honour it , if itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s associated with a specific project , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI approach it like a film job with my still camera .
So I always kind of regarded it as an acting job .
So the actors really kind of appreciated that and are able to be more natural.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ One actor who didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t appreciate it was Faye Dunaway on the set of the 1993 thriller The Temp .
She consistently shooed him away during rehearsals , promising him a later take that never seemed to materialise .
Finally , one night between setups , he heard her calling his name from across a darkened soundstage and followed her voice .
Ã¢â¬ÅI find her draped on this camera dolly .
SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wearing this skirt and the legs
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says of the photo in which Dunaway looks absently at the floor , her skirt raised to mid - thigh , legs crossed , her feet in high heels .
In a chance encounter a few years later he reminded her of the hard time she gave him on the shoot .
She replied , Ã¢â¬ÅI know .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a real pain
the ass.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Denzel Washington was another prickly customer , with a list of demands including shooting during rehearsal only , not during takes , and to stay out of his sightline .
While it was rough going at first , Washington eventually came to appreciate ZuckermanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work and the two collaborated on six movies , including Training Day , for which the actor won an Oscar .

Actor Michael Massee shot Lee with a .44 Magnum that was mistakenly loaded with live ammunition .
Ã¢â¬ÅI noticed in the rehearsal
he fell one way , and through my lens I saw in the actual take that he fell another way , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Zuckerman recalls .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey yelled Ã¢â¬ËcutÃ¢â¬ â¢ 10 seconds later and Brandon didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get up .
And the medic who was there was immediately on him and examined him and said , Ã¢â¬ËHeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s got an abdominal wound .
Call 911.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Zuckerman stopped working in the film business in 2003 when he was diagnosed with a rare nervous condition known as adult polyglucosan body disease .
Only 50 people are known to suffer from the genetic ailment , which creates reduced sensation in the legs and loss of muscle control .

2015-02-20,"BBC 6 Music , home to presenters Lauren Laverne , ElbowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Guy Garvey and Jarvis Cocker , will pass a landmark anniversary in the next few days , although it is not one likely to prompt wild celebrations on air .
It will be five years since the BBC tried to axe the fledgling digital station and replace it with a spin - off version of Radio 2 .
The decision prompted a wave of unprecedented listener protest Ã¢â¬ â its Facebook campaign an early demonstration of the power of social media Ã¢â¬ â joined by star names such as David Bowie and Mark Ronson , and its own presenters .
After management was forced into a U - turn by the BBC Trust the fortunes of the station have blossomed .
Its audience has since tripled , and in the final quarter of 2014 hit 2 million listeners a week , overtaking its long established sister station , Radio 3 .
Now the target is 2.5 million listeners for the station , which the BBC said five years ago had Ã¢â¬Årelatively few unique listeners to BBC radioÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and whose audience of 30- to 50-year - olds were well served by commercial radio .
Jeff Smith , head of music for Radio 2 and 6 Music , said 90 % of its output today is not heard on any other UK station , with a mix of indie disco , edgier entries in rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue and championing of new artists such as US folk star Father John Misty .
If the station lacked focus in its early years when it promised an enervating mixture of archive and album tracks , it now pursues a different mantra , Ã¢â¬Åcelebrating the alternative spirit in popular music since the 1960sÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Paul Rodgers , head of programmes for 6 Music , said it was an Ã¢â¬Åimportant phrase defining what the station is aboutÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
but admitted it is a Ã¢â¬Åslippery oneÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m loathe to get into a musical definition of it .
Which bit of the Human League is the alternative spirit ?
You can see IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m struggling , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
For help he turned to the lineup for the 6 Music festival this weekend , which includes Mogwai , the Fall , British Sea Power and Bryan Ferry .
Ã¢â¬ÅBryan
Ferry might not seem to embody alternative spirit , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Rodgers .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut if you look back at his work and the ideas that informed it , they are , every bit.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Liz Kershaw was among the 6 Music DJs who addressed two huge protests outside the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Broadcasting House in central London after the closure plans were announced in 2010 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember thinking , Ã¢â¬ËNo , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not having that .
Over my dead bodyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ remembered Kershaw , who currently presents the Saturday lunchtime show .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had fought too long for a station like 6 Music , long before it opened in 2002 , for it to shut down eight years later .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs a listener
I felt completely unserved by BBC national music radio .
I was past my sell - by date as far as Radio 1 was concerned but I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t one foot in the grave enough for Radio 2 , as it was then .
I wanted to hear on the radio the sort of bands you saw at festivals and
live venues.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The protests outside Broadcasting House were a very BBC affair Ã¢â¬ â along with banners and placards , campaigners also turned up with homemade cupcakes .
Other 6 Music presenters also spoke out , including Adam Buxton and Tom Robinson .
Cerys Matthews , the former lead singer of Catatonia who joined the station in 2009 , recalled appearing on BBC1Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Breakfast programme to debate the closure with then BBC chief operating officer , Caroline Thomson .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember saying , yes thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a need for the BBC to lose weight but you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t cut your little finger off
, you get fit , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Matthews .
Ã¢â¬ÅThreatening to shut 6 Music was a ridiculous way to save money.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But even given the scale of support , Kershaw was taken aback when the decision was reversed four months later .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn my mind
it was rockÃ¢â¬
â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll versus the suits , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd the suits always had the last word.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Aside from being the best free marketing the station ever had , the threat of closure and its subsequent rescue gave its DJs a new - found confidence .
A few years previously its then controller Lesley Douglas had looked to expand its appeal with personalities such as Russell Brand and George Lamb .
BrandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s BBC radio career would end with Ã¢â¬ÅSachsgateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while Lamb proved a hugely divisive figure whose on - air encounter with Ray Davies was labelled by Paul Gambaccini the Ã¢â¬Åworst interview in the history of broadcastingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Steve Lamacq , whose teatime show is the stationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most popular with an average audience of just over 900,000 listeners a week , said : Ã¢â¬ÅThere was a certain pressure on the station to get as many listeners as possible to stave off these rumours that one day they might try to close us down .
Ã¢â¬ÅOnce we got past the threat of closure and the line - up settled down
, we took the pressure off ourselves and managed to do some really good radio.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The stationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s profile was boosted with big name hirings such as Iggy Pop and familiar BBC names such as Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie , who switched from Radio 2 to 6 Music in 2011 .
The pairÃ¢â¬ â¢ s weekday afternoon programme is the stationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s second most popular show ( ahead of Laverne , in third , and Shaun KeavenyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s breakfast show in fourth ) .
It helped , of course , that digital radio has slowly become mainstream .
When 6 Music was threatened with closure in 2010 , just over 20 % of all listening was on digital platforms with online listening in its infancy .
Today it is nearly 40 % , with the majority of in - home listening now digital .
Keaveny said : Ã¢â¬ÅBob Shennan [ controller of Radio 2 and 6 Music ] said recently we should aim for about 2.5 million listeners and I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see any reason why not .
But you have got to be careful .
The moment you go too far in grasping for extra listeners you are losing the very essence of what people want .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a fine line.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2015-04-02,"Ã¢â¬ÅThis is another dimension of David Bowie , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ intones the booming voiceover of the trailer to the musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1976 film
The Man
Who Fell to Earth , going on to describe him as Ã¢â¬Åone of the few true originals of our timeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and insisting Ã¢â¬Ånothing you have seen or heard about [ Bowie ] will prepare youÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Almost four decades after that film marked his movie debut , the singer , songwriter , multi - instrumentalist , producer , actor and artist has revealed yet another surprising new dimension , with the announcement on Thursday that he is working on a new stage musical version of the same sci - fi horror story .
Bowie will collaborate with the Irish playwright Enda Walsh for the musical , inspired by Walter TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s disturbing 1963 sci - fi novel The Man Who Fell to Earth , the New York Theater Workshop announced .
The production , to be entitled Lazarus , will feature new Bowie songs as well as new arrangements of some of the music used in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cult film and will centre on the figure of Thomas Newton , the alien who comes to earth from the planet Anthea to find a way of saving his own people .
Disappointingly for fans , however , the musician will not be reprising his role as Newton .
Having kept the project secret for so long , its key protagonists were reluctant to reveal much more on Thursday : BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spokesperson would confirm only that he was involved in the project , while Walsh , who won a Tony award for the stage version of Once , another musical adaption of a film , declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian .
Speaking to the New York Times , James Nicola , the artistic director of the New York Theater Workshop , said the project had secretly been in development for some years , though he was not sure whether calling it a Ã¢â¬ÅmusicalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ was the most appropriate term .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be a play with characters and songs
Ã¢â¬ â IÃ¢â¬
â¢ m calling it music theatre , but I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really know what itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be like , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI just have incredible trust in their creative vision.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He said that the original idea to work on a theatrical version of TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel had been BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , and that he had approached Ivo van Hove , an avant - garde director from Belgium whose Dutch - language production of Angels in America in the city last year used some of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music .
It was Van Hove , said Nicola , who had brought in Walsh and the Off Broadway theatre .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m really excited about it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThese are three very different sensibilities to be colliding.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Van
HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stripped back production of A View from a Bridge is currently in the West End after transferring from the Young Vic last year , where it received rapturous reviews .
This is the second time in just over two years that the 68-year - old Bowie has shocked his fans with the announcement of new work , after he released , abruptly and without the smallest hint of its existence , a new album , The Next Day , in January 2013 , years after many critics had assumed he had retired .
The new project is not BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first involvement with the New York stage .
In 1980 he spent three months playing the role of the Elephant Man on Broadway , for which he won rave reviews .
But the announcement that 35 years later he was return to the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theatre district had provoked similar astonishment , the Village VoiceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theatre critic Alexis Solokoski said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI saw the email this morning
and I was incredibly excited .
I had not heard any rumours of this , it took me completely by surprise , and I think
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fabulous , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she told the Guardian .
The involvement of Van Hove made the project particularly fascinating , she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you look at his work
it can be chilly , it can have an enormous emotional impact , but the style is very cool , and I think that makes him such an interesting fit for this property .
It could be a risk in some ways , but , gosh Ã¢â¬ â what an exciting prospect.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Broadway acclaim for the Talking Heads frontman David ByrneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical about Imelda Marcos , Here Lies Love , might have inspired or emboldened Bowie and his collaborators , she said , along with the success of Once , which was also staged by the New York Theater Workshop .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo they have shown they can take another film property with music and make it really alive for the stage.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
involvement in the musical would not in itself guarantee success , she said , as the closure in January of StingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Broadway musical The Last Ship , after a run of only three months , illustrated .
Other celebrity - led projects have been successful , such as Cindy LauperÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kinky Boots , which won a Tony , but a celebrity name alone was not enough , said Solokoski .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe story also has to be there .
The problem with the Sting musical was there were two or three stories it was trying to tell at the same time .
This is a story that already exists .
StingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s contribution I thought was terrific , the songs were great , but you need a story.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
It also helped , she said , that unlike the Sting project , Lazarus was being staged Off Broadway , where the production costs , and consequently the risk are considerably lower .
Performances of the production will begin in winter 2015 , the theatre said .

2015-04-06,"A musical version of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
1976 film
The Man
Who Fell to Earth canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t have been high on many peopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lists of likely projects for the increasingly reclusive star .
Yet last week the New York Theater Workshop announced it will be staging just such a production later this year , featuring new songs from Bowie .
Lazarus will be based on Walter TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
1963 novel Ã¢â¬ â the plot sees alien Thomas Jerome Newton land on Earth seeking to ship water back to his drought - stricken home planet where his family are dying , but he ultimately descends into an alcoholic haze , betrayed by those around him , thus suffering a two - fold alienation .
But as unlikely as it seems , this project honours some enduring themes in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work and looks set for creative success .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s involvement with the original film came about under strained circumstances .
Adrift in America on a sea of cocaine psychosis , his contribution to director Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film was an almost purely aesthetic one Ã¢â¬ â he looked like an alien so he played an alien .
His implausibly snow - white body , chiselled cheekbones , dyed flame - coloured hair and skinny suits in the film meant it was an entry of particular note in the annals of Bowie style , not least because it spilled over into the Thin White Duke character he would soon create .
A still from the film was used for the cover of 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Low , which was comprised mainly of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unused efforts for the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s soundtrack ( the track Subterraneans shows how beautifully this would have worked out ) .
The film marked a significant point for BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , but whether he made an important contribution cinematically is less clear .
As an actor , Bowie has long been ridiculed , and he certainly hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t always picked his projects well .
The aptly named Thomas Jerome Seabrook noted in his book on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mid- to late-70s period , his turn as Newton Ã¢â¬Åis almost universally regarded as David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest performance as an actorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , but this is faint praise since Ã¢â¬Åthis , perhaps , is because he barely had to act at allÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
This is made abundantly clear in Alan YentobÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1974 documentary for the BBC , Cracked Actor , filmed the year before work started on The Man Who Fell to Earth , and the inspiration for Roeg casting the rock star Ã¢â¬ â Thomas Newton and the David Bowie of the documentary are completely indistinguishable .
Ultimately , while Roeg made full use of the desolate beauty of both his leading man and the New Mexico location , the disjointed editing meant The Man Who Fell to Earth could be criticised for lacking narrative drive .
How exactly this stilted story of alienation and desperation might translate to a musical is unclear .
Lazarus is obviously not going to be a glitzy dry ice , hydraulics and painfully literal lyrics affair .
It will be staged at a venue associated with theatrical innovation and directed by Ivo van Hove , known for productions of Ingrid Bergman and Jean Cocteau .
Yet van Hove also has form with the mainstream musical , having directed Rent under the auspices of Dutch theatrical producer Joop van den Ende , himself responsible for productions of The Lion King and Sister Act .
The point of the best musicals is that they are able to do naffness with such unselfconscious confidence that they transcend their inherent absurdity and become genuinely affecting .
RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s treatment of TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel managed to have emotional clout as Newton loses both his alien family and his human love interest , Mary - Lou , with the highly charged themes of sexual intimacy and the loss of children continuing from RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous film , DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Look Now .
The emotional potential is there in the story for this musical adaptation to work and , as an actor , Bowie has shown an ability to make what looks ridiculous on paper work on an emotional level .
The man with a premium on cool has routinely made the absurd credible : from a Broadway Elephant Man without prosthetics but just a finely tuned physicality to express his bodyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brokenness , to the Ã¢â¬ÅmimeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ scene in the 1983 prisoner of war film Merry Christmas , Mr Lawrence , and the range of characters in the spoken - word interludes on his 1995 album 1 Outside ..
With Bowie having been in a state of semi - retirement for years , it must be asked why he has chosen to return to this story above other projects .
The novel follows a more apocalyptic vein than the film , with a nuclear war having largely destroyed NewtonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s home planet and Earth facing the same fate without alien intervention .
Apocalypticism and dystopia are themes that have long fascinated Bowie Ã¢â¬ â from the weirdly upbeat Hunky Dory out - take Bombers , to Five Years ( Ã¢â¬ÅNews guy wept and told us / Earth was really dyingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , the dome - dwelling survivors of a nuclear holocaust in Drive in Saturday , the Orwellian nightmare of Diamond Dogs , and his post-9/11 album Heathen , which opens ominously with the words Ã¢â¬ÅNothing remainsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Christ - like nature of Newton as persecuted saviour also continues a rich seam in his work ever since the Ã¢â¬Åleper messiahÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ziggy Stardust , and which is also found in the implied second coming of Starman and even in the characterisation of the Thin White Duke as a Nietzschean superman and kind of inverted , occult messiah .
It is these themes that might have drawn Bowie
to re - approach The Man
Who Fell to Earth from a more authorial perspective than was possible as an actor .
Co - writer of Lazarus , Irish playwright Enda Walsh , describes himself as a Ã¢â¬Åpractising misanthropeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , a description which could well be applied to Bowie and suits
TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bleak tale .
This may be a writing collaboration that will take this Ã¢â¬ÅmusicalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as far away from the chirpy connotations of that label as can be imagined ."
2015-04-10,"There was a stir in the art world a few years back when the great Ã¢â¬ÅlostÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ American painter Nat Tate was dramatically rediscovered .
Tate , the story goes , was a member of the New York scene of the 1950s , who ended up jumping to his death off the Staten Island ferry after visiting Europe and finding himself haunted by the genius of Braque and Picasso .
The Tate retrospective opened in London with a speech by David Bowie and a tribute from Gore Vidal , who knew everybody , so naturally knew Tate too .
Critics at the launch nodded sagely .
Tate was obscure Ã¢â¬

but perhaps it really was time for a re - evaluation of this strangely overlooked contemporary of Jackson Pollock and the mid - century greats who ... well ... didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t actually exist .
Tate , it soon emerged , was an amusing cut and paste hoax by the novelist William Boyd ,
in part inspired by his irritation with the hype over the Ã¢â¬ÅYoung British ArtistsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the times , many of whom were , as Boyd later noted , Ã¢â¬Ånot very goodÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
The reason for mentioning him here is simply that Tate sometimes pops into my head whenever the cultishly revered , relentlessly name - checked Argentinian football coach Marcelo Bielsa is mentioned in some unlikely passing context , as he was this week with the republishing of a leaked shortlist of candidates to replace Sam Allardyce at West Ham .
You can imagine the talk around the boardroom table on this one .
OK , so who have we got then ?
Respected club legend ?
Slaven Bilic .
Tick .
Premier League veteran ?
Rafa BenÃÂ­tez .
Got it .
Right , all weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re missing now is an eccentric idealist who values academic process above winning and who once wandered around for several days wearing a pair of shoes on which heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d drawn an outline of feet to illustrate some fine point of technique to his players .
Bielsa to West Ham :
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a compelling prospect .
But then heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a compelling kind of guy , a seductive and in many ways very funny giant of the modern game .
Certainly if Bielsa didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t exist it would probably be necessary to invent him , and there is no doubt his legend has been allowed to develop a slightly exaggerated , cartoonish edge : the manager as crackpot chess genius , nerd god , wandering the streets in his carpet slippers in search of some fleeting glimpse of the footballing absolute .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are 36 different forms of communicating through a pass , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Bielsa once said , and you can already feel yourself nodding .
Yes !
More !
So much so it is even possible to imagine , here in landlocked Premier League - land , Bielsa himself could turn out to be an elaborate hoax , an in - joke concocted by South American intellectuals at the expense of lonesome English tactical romantics everywhere .
Except , of course , unlike Nat Tate , Bielsa is real and currently working in France .
This week , as the West Ham link flickered in the background , a video emerged of him addressing his Marseille team after their 0 - 0 draw with Lyon last month .
It shows Bielsa giving a beautiful , slightly maniacal speech about collectivism and team endeavour that drew applause from his players and provides above all a reminder of his allure , the sense of someone oddly untouched and otherworldly , concerned solely with method and form .
And what methods they are .
At Athletic Bilbao Bielsa produced an array of impenetrable diagrams , cool green Rothko squares decorated with gloops of colour , angry squiggles , cartoon hieroglyphs illustrating how his player should always be in motion .
Ã¢â¬ÅRunning is understanding , running is everything , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he has said , and his teams do run , pushing forward always Ã¢â¬ â defence is simply the first stage of attack Ã¢â¬ â and resembling at times a kind of wired , luminous , footballing modern jazz .
In this sense Bielsa isnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t Jack Kerouac , the star turn , the headline act .
He is instead the Neal Cassady of modern football : the pure idealist , the guy who inspired the guys , and from whom so many managers have borrowed a little , from the more diffuse to to outright acolytes such as Pep Guardiola or Chile manager Jorge Sampaoli , who used to listen to Bielsa speeches on a walkman while he went out jogging .
So : West Ham then .
It probably wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t happen .
But wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t it be great ?
Firstly for that rare thing , a genuine clash of cultures : footballÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great professorial puritan at work in its most cheerfully philistine league .
Bielsa is a guaranteed provocation for those who like to see English football as an unmasker of artifice and pretension , and in which even Louis van Gaal Ã¢â¬ â who could , frankly , dine out for ever just on that transformative Ajax team of the mid-1990s Ã¢â¬ â was being fitted up earlier this season as another empty professor , another Josef Venglos , another Nat Tate .
In which case wait until they get a load of Bielsa , whose reputation as a modern great rests on intangible moments of tactical innovation , who doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t win trophies and whose teams have often enjoyed intoxicating peaks matched with sudden dips , in part because he appears at times to be asking his players to do something impossible , to sustain some personal vision of sublime unceasing movement .
Bielsa to West Ham remains an unlikely dream .
But take a step back and there is a case to be made here .
West HamÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
fans demand attacking , progressive football , which is pretty much all Bielsa is interested in .
The current owners seem to want a long - term plan and Bielsa is all about plans .
This is a club that has traditionally allowed its mangers to settle and which also isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t afraid of a certain academic intensity , from Malcolm Allison and the Cafe Cassettari set , with their tactical arguments over the squeeze ketchup bottle ; to Ron Greenwood Ã¢â¬ â in his own way a kind of homespun proto - Bielsa
, Ã¢â¬ â the tracksuit obsessive with his Hungarian fixation ,
his endless hours on the training pitch before eventually being dragged off in a daze still muttering about plans and formulae .
Above all it would simply be great fun and a deliciously counter - intuitive move for the league that doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think , the league that likes instead to bump along in a state of profitable stasis .
And which is perhaps missing a little intellectual content to go with the generalised excitement , a different kind of passion beyond the familiar operetta ."
2015-04-14,"The director of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s forthcoming musical stage show has revealed that Lazarus will include a number of new Ã¢â¬ÅclassicsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ about love and violence .
Set to premiere at the New York Theatre Workshop in December , Lazarus is based on The Man Who Fell to Earth and centres around Thomas Newton , a character played by Bowie in the 1976 screen adaptation directed by Nic Roeg .
Speaking to the BBC , director Ivo van Hove confirmed Bowie would not be appearing on stage in Lazarus , but shed some light on the type of musical content fans can expect .
As well as re - arrangements of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old songs ( Ã¢â¬ÅHe told me he is going to give his songs a new skinÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , Van Hove said some of the new songs Ã¢â¬Åsound as if you have heard them for ever Ã¢â¬ â like classicsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Describing the new Bowie music as Ã¢â¬Åreally great stuffÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he added that preparations for the show are Ã¢â¬Åfar advancedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .

He added : Ã¢â¬ÅHe will not be on stage

â
I donÃ¢â¬

Speaking to the New York Times , James Nicola , the artistic director of the New York Theater Workshop , said the project had been in the works for some years , but was not sure whether calling it a Ã¢â¬ÅmusicalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ was the most accurate term .

2015-04-18,"It was the creative hub of trend - setting Britain , a base for clubbers and a hangout for style gurus from David Bowie to Jean - Paul Gaultier .
Cuts was where everybody who was anybody in 1980s London came to get their hair done .
Now film - maker Sarah Lewis is close to completing a feature documentary on the salon that has been 19 years in the making Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ â seven years longer than the time it took Richard Linklater to make the Oscar - winning Boyhood .
She plans to raise the last ÃÂ£50,000 she needs through a crowdfunding campaign launched this month with Phundee.com , a new London - based company .
The clientele of Cuts , in a tiny basement stall in hip Kensington Market , reads like a WhoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Who of the entertainment world : from Bowie , Boy George and Goldie to actors Rupert Everett and Sean Penn , along with fashion designer Gaultier , Oscar - winning film - maker Steve McQueen and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen .
Goldie , one of the salonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s regulars , was given an Ã¢â¬ÅarmadilloÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , with stripey patterns shaved into cropped hair , and Fran Healy , lead singer of Scottish band Travis , came away with a Ã¢â¬ÅfinÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , a short haircut with a ridge down the middle .
They are among the styles which got the salon noticed by trend - setting magazines and emulated around the country .
Set against a backdrop of the political and social changes during the salonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lifetime , the documentary , Cuts , charts the comings and goings at the small but cutting - edge salon founded in the 1980s .
Lewis , whose own hairstyles from Cuts have included Ã¢â¬Ålots of really crazyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ looks , said : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a really low - key but world - famous little hairdresser .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not really just about the haircuts .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not flashy or overt .
You just become part of that community.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
What sets it apart , Lewis said , is its Ã¢â¬ÅcasualÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ atmosphere where people just hang out and everyone is treated the same , and where the walls are decorated with changing art exhibitions .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou meet the most extraordinary people sitting on the sofas .
It really brings people together , and people have great conversations ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
The salon was launched during the postÃ¢â¬âpunk , new romantic era by the late hairdresser - turned - artist James Lebon .
From Kensington Market , the business eventually moved to Frith Street in Soho .
Today , under the name We Are Cuts , it remains in nearby Dean Street .
Lewis said : Ã¢â¬ÅIn the 1980s the fashion magazines took their lead from the young people making statements through their DIY clothes and hairstyles .
The Face and ID were in their infancy , pushing multiculturalism and inclusiveness Ã¢â¬ â at odds with ThatcherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s declaration Ã¢â¬Ëthere is no such thing as societyÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
Cuts Ã¢â¬ â the first independent hairdressers in London Ã¢â¬
â was the antithesis of Vidal Sassoon and the place where the club kids went to get their hair done .
Punks , new romantics , rock bands , young stars and the general public all trusted James [ Lebon ] with creating a Ã¢â¬ËlookÃ¢â¬ â¢ to suit their personality.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ LewisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous productions include a Channel 4 documentary , Crowded House , which she also directed , and The Staring Girl , a 10-minute fiction film screened by international festivals .
It was partly the diversity of the salonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s characters that inspired her to film there .
She recalls a former customer from the East End who brought in his photograph albums , showing everyone images of Ã¢â¬Åthe people
heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been associated with in the gangster worldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Pete Dowland , one of the salonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s partners , said their hairdressers have always trained with high - profile companies such as Vidal Sassoon and Trevor Sorbie , but that at Cuts they have been more aligned to street fashion and loud music .
The documentary explores the salonÃ¢â¬ â¢
s influence partly through interviews with some of its famous patrons .
Boy George jokes that Cuts was Ã¢â¬Ålike a community centre for weirdosÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while Isaac Julien , the artist and film - maker nominated for the Turner prize in 2001 , calls it a Ã¢â¬Åpostmodern trendsetter in identity and styleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Goldie says it is Ã¢â¬Åmy home Ã¢â¬ Â¦ the stomping ground , a hive for bees like usÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2015-04-18,"A professional photographer for more than 20 years , and published in Q , Melody Maker and Rolling Stone , Pat Pope has worked with many of the biggest names in pop and rock music , including Oasis , David Bowie and Radiohead .
One act with whom he has worked several times are 90s indie titans Garbage .
Indeed , they admire PopeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work so much that recently , as they put together a forthcoming self - published book , their management asked his permission to use one of his pictures of them .
So far , so good Ã¢â¬ â Pope owns the copyright in the image , and revenue from reuse of old shots makes up a reasonable chunk of his income .
There was just one problem : the letter from their management said that they did not want to pay him for his photograph , although they were prepared to offer him a Ã¢â¬Åproper creditÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the first time that Pope had been asked to let people use his work without being paid .
Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ËFree requestsÃ¢â¬ â¢ have become more and more commonplace , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅBack in the day , it was more about working cheap with the promise of Ã¢â¬Ëbig moneyÃ¢â¬ â¢ when the band sold.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But this time , he felt that enough was enough , because Ã¢â¬ÅGarbage are a successful band with plenty of resources to pay for images .
I have many times been paid something by tiny bands or bands with no money .
Payment in these cases is often minimal and more symbolic .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf Garbage had personally come to me with a limited budget , chances are I would have agreed .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more about principle than cash grabbing .
Ã¢â¬ÅGarbage have been incredibly vocal in the past about how everybody should pay for music and how artistry should be respected , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he adds .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was too much hypocrisy on their part , and for content providers everywhere , whatever their profession , something had to be said.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He wrote an open letter to the band , which he posted on Facebook .
In it he declined their offer , saying : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m proud of my work
and I think it has a value .
If you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think it has any value , donÃ¢â¬
â¢
t use it .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m saying no to a budget that says you can take my work for free and make money out of it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Pope got a reply from the singer Shirley Manson on behalf of her band , saying : Ã¢â¬ÅWe regret that you interpreted our request so negatively Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Historically , artists have been known to help each other out in an effort to get their work seen and heard .
We are proud and grateful to be part of this artist community .
Over the years we have happily compensated many photographers , film - makers and other kinds of content providers for their work and will continue to do so in the future .
We believe completely in the concept of the artist being compensated fairly whenever possible.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Pope says : Ã¢â¬ÅThey could have just held their hands up and admitted they were wrong to ask , or get their management to ask .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not really their fault .
Everybody has devalued the photograph over the years .
It has become so common for people to see nothing wrong in using images and expecting to pay nothing .
I was just highlighting a point and making a stand.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The practice of being asked to work for nothing is prevalent in other creative professions too .
The Facebook group Stop Working
For Free has more than 14,000 members from a range of fields sharing stories of exploitation and seeking advice on how to deal with an increasingly difficult economic climate .
It isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a problem confined to the UK .
In Erik NelsonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 2008 documentary Dreams With Sharp Teeth , US writer Harlan Ellison rants entertainingly about being asked to appear on a Warner Bros DVD for free , saying : Ã¢â¬ÅThey always want the writer to work for nothing .
And the problem is there are so many goddamn writers who have no idea theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re supposed to be paid ...
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t take a piss without getting paid for it . .
I get so angry .
You get undercut by all the amateurs .
They make it tough for the professionals.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ EllisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s point resonates with John Toner , who looks after freelancersÃ¢â¬ â¢ interests for the National Union of Journalists .
He says : Ã¢â¬ÅIf publishers are prepared to accept unpaid contributions it means they are prepared to accept poor work .
Why would anyone make an effort to produce work of decent quality if the publisher places no value on it ?
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd because there are so many amateurs prepared to work for free , it means their work is squeezing out work of a professional standard.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When PopeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s open letter went viral he was subjected to online threats and abuse from a significant minority of disgruntled Garbage fans ( Ã¢â¬Åwatch your backÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ because Ã¢â¬Åwe will find youÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , although most people commenting on his post were broadly supportive .
A week later he felt obliged to try to draw a line under the affair by explaining his thinking .
He wrote that when asked to work for free : Ã¢â¬ÅYour two choices are to give them the permission , valuing your work at zero , or to refuse permission , in which case they will quietly remove you from the list of freelancers they work with
so you wonÃ¢â¬
â¢ t get any future work .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe next request you receive for some free content , write your own Open Letter .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s get this practice out in the open .
When the budget for your next project gets put in front of you , ask where the money is for the artists .
All the artists .
Ã¢â¬ÅUnlike Garbage , I think the work of artists , including my own work , has a value that is at least equal to everything else being done in a commercial project , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not prepared to reduce the value of it to zero by giving it away .
Ã¢â¬ÅStop
Working For Free .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my final word.Ã¢â¬

2015-04-20,"It was reviled by critics on release and baffled fans of both acts , but Lou Reed and MetallicaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collaborative album Lulu has at least one high - profile fan : David Bowie .
At Lou
ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s posthumous induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 19 April
, his widow Laurie Anderson told the audience at the ceremony about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s regard for the record .
Ã¢â¬ÅOne of [ ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ]
last projects was his album with Metallica , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd this was really challenging , and I have a hard time with it .
There are many struggles and so much radiance .
And after LouÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , David Bowie made a big point of saying to me , Ã¢â¬ËListen , this is LouÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest work .
This is his masterpiece .
Just wait , it will be like [ ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1973 album ] Berlin .
It will take everyone a while to catch up.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Anderson added :
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been reading the lyrics and it is so fierce .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s written by a man who understood fear and rage and venom and terror and revenge and love .
And it is raging.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Elsewhere at the ceremony , artists including the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , Beck and Nate Ruess performed Reed songs , and Patti Smith also delivered a speech honouring him , saying they had Ã¢â¬Åa complex friendship , sometimes antagonistic and sometimes sweetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
She also recalled spending time together on tour : Ã¢â¬ÅHe spoke compassionately about the struggles of those who fall between genders .
He spoke of pre - CBS Fender amplifiers and political corruption .
But most of all , he talked about poetry .
He recited the great poets Ã¢â¬ â Rupert Brooke , Hart Crane , Frank OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Hara .
He spoke of the poetsÃ¢â¬ â¢ loneliness and of the poetsÃ¢â¬ â¢ dedication to the highest muses .
When he fell into silence , I said , Ã¢â¬ËPlease , take care of yourself , so the world can have you as long as it can.Ã¢â¬ â¢
And Lou actually smiled.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
With chugging classic rock blended with ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poetry riffing on the plays of Frank Wedekind , Lulu sparked a surprisingly vitriolic response in critics on release in 2011 .
The Quietus wrote that Ã¢â¬Årarely has one record induced such feelings of anger and utter revulsionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while Pitchfork gave it a 1.0 score , saying : Ã¢â¬ÅAudacious to the extreme , but exhaustingly tedious as a result , its few interesting ideas are stretched out beyond the point of utility and pounded into submission.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Alexis Petridis meanwhile said Ã¢â¬Åthe collaboration doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t gelÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , but admitted it succeeds as Ã¢â¬Åa defiant , up - yours gestureÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Wire magazine , however , named it one of the 10 best albums of the year .
Writing in the Guardian following
ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , MetallicaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drummer Lars Ulrich said : Ã¢â¬ÅI played the record for my kids yesterday in the car , and it sounded as relevant and more intense than ever ; it sounded incredibly potent , very alive and impulsive ...
Twenty - five years from now , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to have millions of people claiming they owned the record or loved it when it came out , of course neither will be true .
I think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to age well
Ã¢â¬ â when I played it yesterday
it sounded fucking awesome .
In some ways itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s almost cooler
that people didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t embrace it , because it makes it more ours , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s our project , our record , and this was never made for the masses and the masses didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t take to it .
It makes it more precious for those who were involved.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2015-05-27,"When David Bowie wanted to summarise all he found dreary , drab and stifling , there was only one place he could turn .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt represented everything I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want in my life , everything I wanted to get away from , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told Q magazine in 1999 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the most derogatory thing I can say about something : Ã¢â¬ËGod , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so fucking Croydon.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Bowie , whose personality was shaped in the electrifying cultural climate of Bromley , is not alone .
Croydon has such a poor reputation that its name has become a neologism for the self - destruction of a town centre Ã¢â¬ â Croydonisation .
The townÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inhabitants can exhibit a lowliness bordering on self - loathing .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt could have been worse , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Bob Stanley , whose band Saint Etienne was formed in Croydon .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn
the Domesday Book it was called Crogdene .
Imagine if it was still called that.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Stanley is author of
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah , a history of the pop song , and is currently writing a book about Ã¢â¬Åthe magic of CroydonÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one of three former Croydonians who are challenging conceptions of their hometown with Croydon
Till I Die , a reading event that celebrates the music , literature and architecture of the suburbs .
It has been organised at Rough Trade East and CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Fairfield Halls by Andy Miller , whose memoir The Year of Reading Dangerously found him fondly recalling his formative years in CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s libraries , and wondering why the suburbs rarely featured in the books he read .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was never embarrassed to come from Croydon , until people told me I should be , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Miller .
Ã¢â¬ÅThen I thought , Ã¢â¬ËWhy the hell
should I be?Ã¢â¬ â¢
It feels like people are allowed to feel proud of where they come from , [ as long as thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ] anywhere other than a particular kind of metropolitan suburb .
Society needs a suburban joke and Croydon fits the bill.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Croydon may have often been seen as boring and narrow - minded , but it received additional disdain for its inhospitable appearance , which inspired John Grindrod , the eventÃ¢â¬ â¢ s third participant , to write Concretopia , an examination of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s postwar brutalist reconstruction .
In the 1960s , skyscrapers were banned from central London and Croydon stepped in , building 49 thunderous tower blocks .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was an ultra - capitalist version of what a town should be , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Grindrod , who grew up on the estate of New Addington .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was all about how many big companies they could attract .
The impulse was heroic , but not in an edifying way.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
This redevelopment was devastating .
It drove a flyover through the town and flattened entire streets .
Watching it happen was Jamie Reid , then studying with Malcolm McLaren at Croydon School of Art , where Reid developed the Situationist - inspired collages he later used with the Sex Pistols .
In 1972 , ReidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s publishing outfit , Suburban Press , pictured desolate Croydon with the headline , Ã¢â¬ÅLo !
A Monster Is BornÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The experience was encapsulated by the opening titles of Terry and June , a popular 1970s sitcom , which saw the suburban couple wandering around Croydon in a state of dislocated confusion .
Things worsened as Croydon lost out to the City and Canary Wharf as a business centre .
CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unfulfilled ambition became something else to mock .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen a council can redevelop a whole town like that , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to knock your confidence , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Stanley .
But others embraced Croydon .
Stanley always thought the town felt Ã¢â¬ÅoptimisticÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while Grindrod says : Ã¢â¬ÅIt was amazingly futuristic .
It was so dramatic to arrive in a town on an urban motorway surrounded by towers and huge shopping centres.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Culturally , Croydon has plenty to shout about .
The town played a formative role in punk , thanks to McLaren , Reid and The Damned , and would later spawn dubstep .
The film director David Lean was from Croydon , as was actor Peggy Ashcroft and singer - songwriter Kirsty MacColl .
Author Neil Gaiman went to school there , and his Croydon - set short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties ( about Ã¢â¬Åthe most dangerous place in the universeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) will soon be made into a film .
Ã¢â¬ÅSuburbs like Croydon are where so many interesting things , certainly in pop culture , take place , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Miller .
The dislocation and anger of punk and dubstep partly reflect CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s alienating landscape .
Judge Dredd co - creator Carlos Ezquerra lived in Croydon during the 1970s ; one wonders how much the city inspired the feuding tower blocks and deadly subways of Mega - City One .
Croydon also provided opportunities for cultural exploration .
Fairfield Halls , built in 1962 as a smaller version of Royal Festival Hall , brought bands like Kraftwerk , T - Rex and Pink Floyd to the suburbs , until the provincial circuit went into decline .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn the 70s , it hosted Sparks and Kraftwerk , and by the 90s it was Basil Brush ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Stanley .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou can trace the cultural decline of Croydon in the headline acts of Fairfield Halls.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
For Stanley , pop culture hinged around BeanoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , the biggest secondhand record shop in England until its closure in 2009 .
There , he pursued musical interests that led him to form Saint Etienne with Pete Wiggs .
The band were proud Croydonians , but they were almost alone in that .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen you think about musicians from Croydon , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to get past Captain Sensible , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Stanley .
Ã¢â¬ÅNobody else admits they came from here because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
so uncool.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Croydon came to be seen as a place where nothing happened , and little was done to challenge this perception .
In 2011 , the Conservative council slashed the arts budget , flogging ceramics from a local museum , closing the arthouse David Lean Cinema ( which they ran , and is only alive again thanks to a campaign by volunteers ) and scrapping a local music festival .
Croydon was then hit by the riots of August 2011 : shops burned and one man was killed .
Months later , the Allders department store closed , and the townÃ¢â¬ â¢ s major employer , NestlÃ Â© , moved to Crawley , leaving huge empty towers .
This was the townÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nadir .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo much is undeveloped , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Miller .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s urban deprivation in the suburbs.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Things are slowly changing .
As well as a new Labour council that has reinvested in the arts , there is a huge ÃÂ£5.25bn redevelopment plan .
Jo Negrini , the councilÃ¢â¬ â¢ s executive director of redevelopment , jokingly said Ã¢â¬Åthird time luckyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in reference to previous failed masterplans
Ã¢â¬ â but insisted that this time the regeneration is for real .
Around 30 blocks are being built or converted , as the council attempts to transform redundant offices into high - value residential properties and attract new firms : 170 start - ups are set to occupy one tower called Tech City .
And thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a new shopping centre from Westfield and Hammerson to replace the ageing Whitgift Centre .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a real indicator of the market , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Negrini .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople are saying if Westfield will invest , there must be something going on.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The eye - watering ÃÂ£5.25bn figure is the combined cost of private investment and public spending : some money is coming from the MayorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Regeneration Fund , some from the council itself , and some from corporations , including the ÃÂ£1.5bn that Westfield is pouring into the enormous shopping centre .
The council wants to partly cover its costs by getting devolved powers that would let it raise local taxes on new developments Ã¢â¬ â something that has yet to happen .
Joanna Rowelle is associate director of Arup , one of several firms involved in the redevelopment .
She likens Croydon to Stratford before the Olympics .
Ã¢â¬ÅLondon is growing , so we are looking for places that look like a good opportunity , and Croydon is well located for that ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on a trainline linking the tech clusters of Brighton and Farringdon , she notes , and will also likely benefit from the gentrification of London , which is forcing the middle classes back into the suburbs they thought they had escaped .
Local residents , like Sarah Wickens , are watching and waiting .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe snobbery really annoys me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true that the town really doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make the most of itself.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Wickens is one of several locals hoping to stimulate CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cultural scene : she co - organised Croydon Fun Palace , an alternative arts and science fair in October 2014 .
Other new cultural initiatives in Croydon include an arts space in Matthews Yard , featuring a gallery and theatre , and Rise Gallery , which has brought contemporary art to the bedraggled St GeorgeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Walk shopping centre .
Even New Addington , the troubled estate outside of Croydon , is getting some much - needed attention .
When Grindrod lived there , it was the sort of place the other Croydonians looked down on .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt felt like it was miles from anywhere , up on this hill , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou could take the 130 bus to Croydon and it took an hour .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
only later I realised it was in zone five.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Now , New Addington has benefited from the attention of Turner prize - nominated architecture collective Assemble .
Funded by the post - riot Outer London Fund , Assemble were appointed designers - in - residence and got to work in the market square : a concrete space they animated with a tea dance , parade , sessions and cake decorating that involved all spheres of the community .
They then made physical changes Ã¢â¬ â a stage , skateboard ramps , new positions for market traders Ã¢â¬ â which have been widely praised and achieved a nomination for the New London ArchitectureÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 2013 award for best public space .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a slow process , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Wickens .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are exciting things happening , but it just doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel like itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quite coming together after the cuts .
There are also questions about the role of developers , which will be huge in the next few years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In particular , she worries the demolition of the Whitgift Centre is the beginning of the end for CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
divisive but eye - catching concrete townscape Ã¢â¬ â which gives the town both its awkward reputation and its aura of uniqueness .
On this , Negrini is reassuring .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are some great examples of 60s architecture Ã¢â¬ â and thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s some crap stuff .
There are treasures we want to maintain , like Lunar House and Apollo House [ both by Centre Point architect Richard Seifert ] .
We donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t want to bulldoze everything like we did in the 60s
Ã¢â¬ â we want to embrace the legacy of this place .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve already done that with the conservation area of the old town , but the 60s stuff is just important.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The council is also organising a music festival and refurbishing Fairfield Halls .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere is a real issue of public perception of Croydon , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are very keen on changing those perceptions , and culture has a big impact on regeneration.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Turning Croydon into a place that David Bowie can talk about without sniggering will be difficult .
Stanley hopes that , whatever happens , CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s strange spirit will survive .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a typical suburb , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also like nowhere else I know
Ã¢â¬
â Terry and June and Jamie Reid at the same time ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that mix thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so fascinating.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But not fascinating enough for him to live there .
Despite their affection for the town , neither Stanley , Grindrod or Miller are residents , though Miller insists he remains one in spirit .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m like the Sean Connery of Croydon Ã¢â¬
â I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t live there any more , but I am fiercely proud of it .
What I want to tell people at Rough Trade East is : do you know what Croydon is ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where you came from before you went to events like this .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where most people live.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Croydon
Till I Die is at Rough Trade East , London , on 28 May and at Fairfield Halls , Croydon , on 11 June"
2015-06-01,"Bradley Cooper has followed in the footsteps of John Hurt , David Bowie and Mark Hamill by taking on the lead role in The Elephant Man Ã¢â¬ â but unlike Hurt , he has done so without prosthetics .
Nevertheless , when he played Joseph Merrick on Broadway , Cooper was deemed Ã¢â¬Åalmost unrecognisableÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alexis Soloski , who praised his Ã¢â¬Åbravura performanceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in Bernard PomeranceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s play .
So what did critics make of the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s West End transfer ?
Michael Billington , the Guardian :
Eschewing medical realism , Cooper simply evokes the malformations of Joseph MerrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s body .
Even his gait , with left knee permanently crooked , suggests a man whose trunk can not sustain the weight of an outsize head .
Cooper , a fine actor , also makes you believe in the romantic sensibility that existed inside MerrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s distorted frame Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Much as I admire CooperÃ¢â¬ â¢ s performance , I still find PomeranceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s play Ã¢â¬ â as I did on its Hampstead theatre premiere in London in 1977 Ã¢â¬ â thin and tendentious .
Dominic Maxwell , the Times
: There is really only one reason for seeing this imported Broadway smash hit , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a good one : Bradley Cooper .
If youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve only seen him as the smoothly confident star of films such as The Hangover and Silver Linings Playbook , get ready to see a stage actor of boldness and imagination .
He is physically extreme yet adroitly witty too as Joseph Merrick , the famously disfigured real - life Victorian at the centre of Bernard PomeranceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1977 play .
Paul Taylor , the Independent :
The best scenes are those with Patricia ClarksonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
warm , witty Mrs Kendal , a celebrated actress who is amused and knowing about her way with illusion .
Having been roped in to meet him because sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be able to mask her revulsion at Merrick , she practises different gracious intonations of Ã¢â¬ÅI am very pleased to make your acquaintanceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , only to be thrown into unguarded sincerity by the intelligence and impishness of his conversation .
Ben Lawrence , the Telegraph :
Cynics will question the gym - toned , handsome CooperÃ¢â¬ â¢ s motives for doing this .
( Ã¢â¬ÅLook at me playing ugly .
I have no vanity!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ )
But this is not a superficial performance : its strengths lie in its subtleties .
As he is saved from a lifetime on the Victorian freakshow circuit by Dr Frederick Treves , Cooper slowly , carefully , unpeels MerrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
personality Ã¢â¬ â the man behind the deformity .
Michael Coveney , WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on Stage :
Cooper avoids every trap of Ã¢â¬ÅdisabilityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ acting by suffusing this outer appearance with soul and passion .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a wonderful , and very moving , display .
But not the only one in Scott EllisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stark and severe production , very much in tune with the Brechtian aesthetic in PomeranceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s writing and structure .
Quentin Letts , the Daily Mail : Simply by dint of his art
, good - looking Mr Cooper persuades us that he is this pitiable , and soon engagingly likeable grotesque Ã¢â¬ Â¦ I had not heard of Bradley Cooper and , having arrived at the theatre with my head full of other work , did not consult the programme until heading home .
By then I was thinking this young actor might well go places .
The programme told me that he is a three - times Oscar nominee !"
2015-06-03,"Before he was the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most famous drag queen , RuPaul Charles was a punk in a downtown Atlanta band called Wee Wee Pole .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an internet - famous prom picture of him in 1983 , when he was 23 and dressed
as if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just stepped off the set of the David Bowie movie Labyrinth .
He was there as the date of his bandmateÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sister , but , he tells me , he dressed like that even when he was at the same school .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was always RuPaul .
Always .
Even as a kid , I would dress up in my sistersÃ¢â¬ â¢ clothes , in cowboy outfits , in sailor outfits .
I loved putting on different costumes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ RuPaulÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
laugh is so long and so loud that you hear it from two rooms away .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember something about Michelle Obama and the press said she was throwing shade at someone !
Which is a direct correlation to our show !
Hahahaaaa , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he hoots .
( For the uninitiated , the term Ã¢â¬ÅshadeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ is a form of slapdown that comes from Latino and black gay culture . )
Ã¢â¬ÅOur showÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ is
RuPaulÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Drag Race , a cult reality series now seven seasons in , which pits drag queens against each other as they bid to become AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s next drag superstar .
It makes circuit stars of its girls and has originated multiple catchphrases , from Ã¢â¬ÅGentlemen , start your engines , and may the best woman win!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ to the kindly kiss - off Ã¢â¬ÅSashay
awayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It ruthlessly mocks the reality format while still managing to be one of the most sensitive shows on TV .
And now , after a late - night , soon - abandoned slot on E4 years ago , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s coming back to Britain ;
truTV , in fact .
On Mondays and Tuesdays .
If I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know this from the huge billboard behind RuPaulÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
chair in this fancy London hotel suite
, IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d know it from the number of times he says Ã¢â¬ÅtruTVÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ or Ã¢â¬Åon Mondays and TuesdaysÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ during our chat .
RuPaul has been doing this sort of thing for a long time .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s slick , professional , and he flogs his wares with the gleaming white smile of a 1950s used car salesman .
In the mid-80s , RuPaul moved from Atlanta to New York and answered what he calls , hammily Ã¢â¬Åthe universal stage direction that said : do it in dragÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Putting on a dress made him a superstar .
He danced in the B-52sÃ¢â¬ â¢ Love Shack video in 1989 , and before long he had his own chatshow on VH1 , was getting papped with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love , had a bona fide pop hit with Supermodel ( You Better Work ) and became the first male face of MAC cosmetics .
Yet at 54 , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s still something of the punk - rock club kid in him , the rebel who dressed like Ã¢â¬Åthe boy who fell to EarthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ throughout high school .
For all his cheery polish and the plugs for the show , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s something irresistibly naughty about RuPaul Ã¢â¬ â and steely , too .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe only time you will ever see me in drag is when I am Ã¢â¬ â
what ?
Getting paid .
It is my job , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told Oprah in 2013 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI started out with a genre [ of drag ] called genderfuck , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , today in a pristine turquoise suit and Ronnie Corbett glasses , emphasising the word like a patient teacher .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s punk rock and irreverent , and I learned all those things from Monty Python.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He has cited the British comedy greats as an influence , but since weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re in London , I suspect thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a little Anglo - American diplomacy at play , too .
Drag Race itself is both hugely entertaining as a reality show , and a hugely successful satire of one .
For all its wit and bounce , however , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also a seam of vulnerability running through it .
Most of the girls taking part have had difficult lives .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard , for instance , as season fourÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
Latrice Royale showed , to be an obese drag queen from Compton who has spent time in prison .
Trinity K Bonet came out as HIV positive during season six .
And during a sit - down with Ã¢â¬ÅMama RuÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , season
sevenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kennedy Davenport discussed the recent death of her father and being a carer for her disabled sister .
Ã¢â¬ÅTheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not just some pretty girl from a small town who goes on a modelling show to say : Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m the prettiest one , Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ RuPaul explains .
Ã¢â¬ÅMost of them have been thrown out by their families .
Their parents donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t approve .
Society doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t approve.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It puts the heartstring - tweaking Ã¢â¬ÅjourneysÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of other reality shows to shame .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
you become a shapeshifter , when you choose to live a life so contrary to what society tells you to do , you become a walking testament to the other side .
Yes , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a competition reality show , but because weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re doing it in drag , other levels of consciousness seep
in.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Outside of stag - night Ã¢â¬ÅbanterÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ or cheap sitcom laughs , drag is largely a cult concern , but its mainstream impact has been felt more keenly in recent times , from Kim Kardashian pushing drag - style contouring makeup , to the concept of Ã¢â¬Åthrowing shadeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ being adopted in everyday conversation .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut , listen .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s always been that way , and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re used to it .
Mainstream culture has always co - opted gay culture or subcultures ; our vernacular , our fashion , our language .
But guess what ?
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got way more where that came from .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re still 10 years ahead of the curve.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
RuPaul emphatically denies the suggestion that drag has crossed over .
Ã¢â¬ÅDrag will never be mainstream , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says ,
Ã¢â¬Åbecause it breaks the fourth wall and it mocks our culture and identity : how much you have , where youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re from , your economic background .
Drag mocks all of that .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the antithesis of mainstream.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In May , RuPaul hosted a DragCon event in Los Angeles , which attracted over 13,000 people , and indicates that , while drag may not be mainstream , it is certainly becoming commercially viable .
Does it still belong to the outsiders ?
Ã¢â¬ÅAbsolutely .
People will never break their belief system because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s too scary to look beyond what they were taught .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why in the Wizard of Oz
she [ Dorothy ] says : Ã¢â¬ËWhy didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
you tell me all I had to do was click my heels three times?Ã¢â¬ â¢
Because you wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe me .
You had to go out there and own what it means to be a badass bitch .
I could tell ya how to do it , but you wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe me.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Oh , go on , I plead .
Ã¢â¬ÅHahahaaaaa , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he trills .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou know , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a rebirth .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the story of the hero with a thousand faces , and Superman and Jesus Christ and Buddha and Krishna .
I always say this persona is my Superman to this Clark Kent .
And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true for everyone , really .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a hero lurking Ã¢â¬ â thank you , Mariah Carey Ã¢â¬
â in everyone.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He says that his mother , Ernestine , who died in 1993 , first gave him the confidence to be an outsider while he was still at school in San Diego , where he was born ( he moved to Atlanta with his older sister when he was 15 ) .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe was very punk rock , she questioned authority .
In one of my songs , Sissy That Walk , I say : Ã¢â¬ËMama said , unless theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re paying your bills , you pay them bitches no mind.Ã¢â¬ â¢ That was , in a nutshell , her philosophy about everything , and that was the philosophy that informed my life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Did he feel brave ?
Ã¢â¬ÅDo
you know what ?
It felt like a survival mechanism .
I felt like I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do the other thing .
I remember being 14 and at that crossroads and thinking :
I can either check out , or be a Stepford wife , so to speak .
And I decided to for ever be me .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to walk through this thing on my own terms .
Which is a lonely road , for most people , until I found my tribe.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Even the brightest , bravest queens have dark days .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I was 14 , I thought one way of dealing with this is to commit suicide ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , Ã¢â¬Åbecause
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t be the way society wants me to be .
I know a lot of kids feel that way .
Thankfully I had the support of my family and I had music , and I was well - read , and
I knew my tribe was out there .
But it was something I thought about.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At the end of every episode of Drag Race , he signs off with : Ã¢â¬ÅIf you
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t love yourself , how in the hell you gon na love someone else?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Clearly it comes from the heart .
Between his 90s Supermodel heyday and the emergence of Drag Race , RuPaul all but disappeared from public life .
It was a conscious choice , he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅDuring the Bush era , I retreated .
I stepped away from the canvas for several years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
IsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t it more important than ever to be visible in challenging times ?
Ã¢â¬ÅWell , it was clear to me that I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fight .
I would do interviews and I would have to defend my life .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d read the piece and it would have this tone of like , snarky unbelievability .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢
d see an interview and it would say , Ã¢â¬Ëhe , er , she , er , ahhÃ¢â¬ â¢ , every single time .
Like , what ?
Then I got it : they canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t go over to this thing because then their whole belief system would crumble .
So they have to mock it .
You know what ?
I got better things to do.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Last year , RuPaul found himself under fire from an even less likely enemy .
A number of people from the transgender community objected to the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s use of the phrase , Ã¢â¬ËYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got she - mailÃ¢â¬ â¢ following a challenge called Female or She - male ?
There were complaints to its US network , Logo , which dropped the line for the new season .
Ã¢â¬ÅI would not have changed it , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s their choice , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says now .
Ã¢â¬ÅOur intention was always coming from a place of love .
On paper , you can not read intention , so it was actually hurtful .
First of all , drag is dangerous .
We are making fun of everything .
But when someone doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get the joke or feels offended by it , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a lose - lose situation , because you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t explain a joke .
It isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t funny if you explain it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Is anything off - limits when it comes to comedy ?
Ã¢â¬ÅNot with me .
It has saved my life .
Some of the trauma from my childhood and my sisters and some of the stuff going on in my family , we just fuckinÃ¢â¬ â¢ laughed.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
This is what he learned from his punk - rock Ã¢â¬ÅtribeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in Atlanta Ã¢â¬ â to laugh in the face of Ã¢â¬Åhow horrible the situation was on EarthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He grows serious .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you can not laugh at it , you got ta buck up and get strong .
Cos I think everything is a fucking laugh riot.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
And right there , you get a glimpse of the 14-year - old who decided not to check out , but to own what it means to be the most badass bitch of all .

My Fire Few bands divide critical opinion like the Doors .
For some , they dine at the top table of the critically revered , their company typified by Julie BurchillÃ¢â¬ â¢ s line that Roxy Music , at their very best , were Ã¢â¬Åbetter than David Bowie , than the Supremes , than the Doors , than the Sex Pistols , than anyone I imagine I will ever hearÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
However , especially in more recent years , the Doors have been subject of much reappraisal and opprobrium .
Much reputational damage was probably done by Oliver StoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s abysmal 1991 biopic , with Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison as a drunken caricature .
After defining the art of the rock frontman every bit as influentially as Mick Jagger , Morrison has been subsequently blamed for every leering wannabe in leather trousers .
However , love or loathe him , Morrison brought theatrical excitement to 1960s rock and the Doors albums continue to sell in significant quantities .
Artists from Echo and the Bunnymen to the Stranglers to Skrillex and Chase and Status have taken something from their organ - heavy sound , while MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fusion of rock and poetry inspired Patti Smith , who paid tribute to the singer on stage in Manchester as recently as last week .
Light
My Fire Ã¢â¬ â the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
signature song
Ã¢â¬ â still best represents their adventurous creativity .
In the absence of a bass player , Ray Manzarek used a Vox Continental organ as a lead instrument while his left hand played bass sounds on a Fender Rhodes piano bass Ã¢â¬ â a similar set - up to that of Sky SaxonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s punkier Seeds , but the Doors took it somewhere more dreamlike and transcendental .
Morrison sang about classic themes of sex and death , but ManzarekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s playing equally captured the fairground aspect of Los Angeles .
Penned by guitarist Robby Krieger , the single version of Light
My Fire has undoubtedly been slightly dulled by radio ubiquity .
However , the much longer version from their classic eponymous 1967 debut Ã¢â¬ â the first of six albums inside just four years Ã¢â¬ â still sounds glorious , not least the thrilling moment where KriegerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s beautifully economical guitar solo crashes back into ManzarekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s waterfalling signature melody .
The three - minute edit gave them an international number one and a standard that has been covered by everyone from Shirley Bassey to Will Young .

The Crystal Ship
The Doors story begins on Venice Beach , Los Angeles in 1965 , where Manzarek encounters fellow UCLA film student Morrison , who tells him heÃ¢â¬
â¢ s been writing song lyrics with the idea of forming a band , and sings him a few lines of what would later become Moonlight Drive , on 1967Ã¢â¬ â¢ s No 1 album Strange Days .
Lines such as Ã¢â¬ÅLetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s swim to the moon , uh , uh , letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s climb through the tide , celebrate the eveninÃ¢â¬ â¢ that the city sleeps to hideÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ so impressed Manzarek that they quickly assembled a band to accompany MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poetry .
Perhaps not all MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s words read so well on the page , but at his best he was brilliant at channelling literary heroes Ã¢â¬ â such as Arthur Rimbaud , William Blake and Aldous Huxley , whose book The Doors of Perception provided the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s name Ã¢â¬ â into crisp , fully realised pop tunes .
Another from the first LP , The Crystal Ship has been variously interpreted as a farewell to a love affair ( specifically , with early sweetheart Mary Werbelow ) , a goodbye to the dying and a trip to an afterlife dimension ( also the theme of debut single Break on Through ) .
The glacial boat itself supposedly represents the band and/or stardom , after which he will return to his soulmate .
Either way , where Light My Fire was a straightforward sex song , this feels otherworldly and sentimental , with a killer opener : Ã¢â¬ÅBefore you slip into unconsciousness , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d like to have another kiss.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In 1967 , or any other year , nobody began songs like that .
3
The Unknown Soldier
After Light
My FireÃ¢â¬ â¢ s success , the last thing the DoorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ career demanded was an unusual anti - war song .
However , where Morrison would routinely address environmental or sociopolitical concerns , his lyrics here reflect the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s horror at the way the Vietnam war was being presented in the US media .
Meanwhile , this 1968 single dispenses with conventions of pop songwriting to include a gunshot , tolling bells , a military marching cadence and MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hopeful invitation : Ã¢â¬ÅWait until the war is over and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re both a little older.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It reached No 39 with a bullet Ã¢â¬ â or rather , without , as the gunshot was edited from the version supplied to radio and most stations refused to play it Ã¢â¬
â but theyÃ¢â¬ â¢
d delivered one of their eeriest , most affecting songs .
4 Love Me
Two Times
For all their sometimes sprawling theatre , the Doors knew how to pen a perfect pop song .
Another song written by Krieger Ã¢â¬ â clocking in at a radio - friendly 3 minutes 17 seconds
Ã¢â¬ â this single from 1967Ã¢â¬ â¢
s
Strange Days turns blues elements into a mightily catchy tune .
The lyrics are again possibly influenced by Vietnam , apparently referring to a soldier who makes love to his girlfriend for the final time before shipping out .
However , Manzarek conceded that the song could variously be Ã¢â¬ÅRobbyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great blues / rock classic about lust and lossÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ or Ã¢â¬Åabout multiple orgasmsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Such blurred lines meant the Doors again fell foul of some radio authorities , so listeners in New Haven were denied one of ManzarekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
most glorious moments
Ã¢â¬ â a freewheeling harpsichord solo .
5 Five to One
By mid-1968 , Strange Days had given the Doors their first chart - topping album and they were outselling the Grateful Dead fivefold , yet were undoubtedly also part of the emerging counterculture .
As a student at Florida State University in the early 1960s , Morrison had become particularly engaged with the philosophies of protest and the psychology of crowds , and brought these elements together in his performances of one of the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most powerfully political and controversial songs , initially recorded on third album Waiting for the Sun .
The title supposedly refers to the ratio in the US between young and old , perhaps with a nod to Sun
TzuÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
The Art of War , Ã¢â¬ÅIf our forces are 10 to the enemyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one , to surround him ; if five to one , to attack himÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The lyrics Ã¢â¬ â
Ã¢â¬ÅThe old get old but the young get stronger , may take a week
but it may take longer .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got the guns , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got the numbersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â recognise
youthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dormant power and reflects MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s belief ( as per many of the Summer of Love generation ) that music could change the world .
Perhaps his subsequent realisation that American youth was inherently more conservative than it let on led Ã¢â¬ â along with copious quantities of wine and beer Ã¢â¬ â to the songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s infamous performance in Miami in 1969 .
With the stage swarmed by policemen , the star interrupts the groove to rail at the audience : Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all a bunch of fucking idiots , letting people push you around Ã¢â¬ Â¦ YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all a bunch of fucking slavesÃ¢â¬ Â¦
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ etc .
Morrison was subsequently arrested and put on trial for drunkenness , indecency and profanity .
The Miami Five to One remains officially unreleased ( you can hear it here ) but this swinging take from Absolutely Live
captures the tuneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s tumultuous live power .
6 Touch Me WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve now heard the Doors as a psychedelic rock band , protest vehicle and pop group , but each album progressed their sound and 1969Ã¢â¬ â¢ s flawed but brave the Soft Parade saw them experimenting with orchestral pop - rock .
The albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
big single is another Krieger composition , which takes a riff from the Four SeasonsÃ¢â¬ â¢ CÃ¢â¬ â¢ mon Marianne and blasts into a symphonic arrangement with a blazing saxophone solo courtesy of the great American session player Curtis Amy .
In StoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s awful film , Morrison is portrayed changing the lyrics to make the song about oral sex , but surely lyrics such as : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m gon na love you/ Till the stars fall from the sky for you and IÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , suggest that it is a song about the physical union of devotional love .
7
I Will Never Be Untrue
And maybe , deep down , Morrison was a lover , not a fighter .
His latter - day reputation as a boorish drunk is not well served by the rich seam of tenderness , romance and sentimentality that runs through his bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s canon .
This long - lost live obscurity from the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood finds Morrison in characteristic mischievous mood Ã¢â¬ â promising a lover that he will Ã¢â¬Ånever stay out drinking no later than two Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Two thirtyÃ¢â¬
Â¦ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â before it gradually turns into a more tender song about yearning for a soulmate .
Like the equally ill - fated Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin , Morrison was among the 60s generation for whom BlakeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åthe road to excess leads to the palace of wisdomÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ provided a doctrine , but all were young people unprepared for the cost , and his later lyrics contain several references to loneliness and melancholy .
Here , we can now hear the effects of hard living in MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocal , but this simple , slow blues Ã¢â¬ â which surfaced on 1999Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Essential Rarities Ã¢â¬ â is surely one of their most human and lovely .
8
The Wasp ( Texas Radio and the Big Beat )
John PeelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite Doors song typifies the blend of poetry and music which so entranced Patti Smith .
The lyrics were written some years previously and Morrison initially performed them as poetry before Manzarek and drummer John Densmore conjured up this crackling funk beat for 1971Ã¢â¬ â¢ s L.A. Woman .
Effectively a eulogy to MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inspiration by music , the vivid language and imagery describes the impact of hearing DJs such as Wolfman Jack in his youth as they blasted out of Texas and Virginia , mesmerising the youngster and the Ã¢â¬Åfriends I have gathered together on this thin raft Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
/ Out here we is stoned Ã¢â¬ â immaculate.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
9 L.A. Woman
By 1971 , bloated and bearded , troubled by post - Miami litigation and something of a bete noire after various onstage incidents , Morrison looked like a man grown old before his time .
Which makes it all the more remarkable that he managed to rouse himself for what may be his best set of performances .
L.A. Woman , the DoorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ final album with him , finds the band returning to the blues but with a new , urban raw edge .
The title track pays homage to their City of Angels .
For Manzarek Ã¢â¬ â who didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t exactly shy from making from grand pronouncements Ã¢â¬ â the song was about Ã¢â¬Ådriving madly down the LA freeway .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a beatnik on the road , like Kerouac and Neal Cassady , barreling down the freeway as fast as you can goÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Densmore , meanwhile , finds the depiction of city as a woman a Ã¢â¬Åbrilliant metaphor , Ã¢â¬ËCops in cars , never saw a woman so aloneÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ â great stuff .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s metaphoric , the physicality of the town and thinking of her and how we need to take care of her , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my hometownÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Ã¢â¬ÅMr .
Mojo
risingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in the lyrics is often believed to refer to MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s penis : in fact itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an anagram of Jim Morrison and a name for a voodoo charm widely used in the blues .
Whatever one makes of the lyrics , beginning with an automobile noise and building to a driving pace , the song certainly captures the unique atmosphere of a city mythologised by everyone from Frank Sinatra to the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
10
The End
The DoorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ most controversial song was famously used in Francis Ford CoppolaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film Apocalypse Now , to soundtrack the bloody killing of Colonel Kurtz .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ducked the chronological order to include it as the last song of the 10 because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to imagine it anywhere else
Ã¢â¬ â the Doors themselves generally relied on it to close their shows .
The song centres around an Oedipal fantasy , in which the protagonist murders his father and has sex with his mother , the recording of which in near - darkness led producer Paul Rothchild to later describe as the singularly most exciting moment in his studio career .
It was long believed that MorrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dip into Greek mythology Ã¢â¬ â via FreudÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Oedipus complex Ã¢â¬ â was the Lizard KingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s way of addressing a troubled childhood under a military father .
However , Densmore recalls the singer explaining to him that Ã¢â¬Åkill the father , fuck the motherÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ section was essentially about getting rid of the Ã¢â¬Åalien conceptsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ which society installs in us as human beings .
Morrison himself once suggested that the song had a different meaning for him each time he sang it , from the death of childhood innocence to the final curtain .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s strange that people fear death , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he considered , towards what indeed was the end .
Ã¢â¬ÅLife hurts a lot more than death .
At the point of death , the pain is over.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
There are several officially released live versions of The End , each of them very different .
At New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Felt Forum in 1970 , a year before his death , Morrison begins it with a blood - curdling cry of Ã¢â¬ÅBring out your dead!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ , as used by corpse collectors during the Great Plague .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve plumped for this 17-minute 1968 Hollywood Bowl version because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s such a brilliant emotional rollercoaster .
With Morrison reputedly high on acid and again singing in near - darkness , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s humour as the singer spots a grasshopper on the stage , another intriguing diversion as he refers to a fatal accident , some genuinely spooky moments as he foresees his death ( wanting to die in an open field , where he can be devoured by worms and snakes ) and the musical prowess that made them such a formidable live act .
Morrison never got his wish Ã¢â¬ â instead meeting his demise in a Paris bathtub , aged just 27 .
The Doors are possibly popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ultimate Marmite band , but no one can accuse them of not striving to push the envelope ."

2015-07-10,"What happened to the musical revolution ?
From the 1950s to the 90s , popular music was prone to great watershed moments .
The process was not neatly linear ; change was usually dramatic and often retrospectively pinned to a particular moment :
the Beatles appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964 ; David Bowie announcing the belated start of the 70s when he performed Ã¢â¬ÅStarmanÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ on Top of the Pops in July 1972 ; even as late as the summer of 2001 , the arrival of the high - conceptual blues - rock duo the White Stripes in London , as they stylishly set about killing the grindingly awful genre known as Ã¢â¬Ånu - metalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The 21st century is very different .
When anybody can log in to Spotify and put Quicksilver Messenger Service next to the Clash next to the Beastie Boys next to Pharrell Williams , how can one retain any feeling of forward motion ?
When YouTube means we now consume musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s visual aspects in isolation rather than as part of a simultaneous audience of millions , can a single musical event or occasion ever take on huge historical meaning ?
On 25 July 1965 , Bob Dylan Ã¢â¬ â then 24 Ã¢â¬ â appeared at the Newport folk festival in Rhode Island , backed by the multi - instrumentalist Al Kooper , and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band , from Chicago .
He played only three songs with the group , before returning solo on stage to play two more on a borrowed acoustic guitar .
In response to the electric section , some in the audience cheered , while others booed Ã¢â¬ â though they may have been protesting against DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
short set or the shortcomings of the sound as much as from a feeling of betrayal .
That said , a strong conviction that Dylan was doing something unforgivable was in the air : the folklorist Alan Lomax later said that Dylan and his Ã¢â¬Åvery bad , very loud , electronic r - r bandÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ had Ã¢â¬Åmore or less killed the festivalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Whatever the reality , the accepted account of what had happened was soon established : Dylan and his band facing a wall of boos and catcalls , and carrying on regardless .
Some versions had it that the veteran folk musician and activist Pete Seeger reacted to DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s set by trying to cut through cables with an axe .
No matter that Dylan had recently released half an albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s worth of Ã¢â¬ÅelectricÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ music on Bringing It All Back Home , nor that a fully powered band had backed him on a 1962 single titled Ã¢â¬ÅMixed - Up ConfusionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ : Newport became the moment he Ã¢â¬Åwent electricÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and scandalised the earnest devotees of the American folk revival so greatly that many never recovered .
In not much longer than 10 minutes , as Elijah Wald puts it , Dylan triggered Ã¢â¬Åthe end of the folk revival as a mass movement and the birth of rock as the mature artistic voice of a generationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But Wald has a habit of exploring the complications and tensions that underlie received stories : witness Escaping the Delta , his fascinating exploration of the legend of Robert Johnson .
Dylan Goes Electric !
both explains the huge array of subplots that fed into the Newport moment and undermines any idea that the story is clear - cut .
It is a great work of scholarship , brimming with insight Ã¢â¬ â among the best music books I have ever read .
Its spine is the contrast between Dylan and Seeger , the Newport festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s de facto king , who had begun blazing a trail for the folk revival and its inbuilt radical politics in the early 40s .
Seeger and his followers , Wald writes , Ã¢â¬Åbelieved they were working for the good of humanity Ã¢â¬ Â¦
but they were intensely aware of the forces marshalled against them :
the capitalist system and the moneyed interests that upheld itÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Seeger Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Åa difficult man to know and sometimes a hard man to likeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â endured years of anti - communist blacklisting , and was sentenced to 10 years in prison after refusing to testify before the House Un - American Activities Committee .
He was acquitted a year later , but it all heightened the quasi - religious sense that folk music was the preserve of saints .
Obviously , things were more complicated than that .
From the late 50s , the folk revival regularly gave rise to tensions and splits .
It was partly built on the idea of glorying in the work of
rural , genuinely Ã¢â¬ÅfolkÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ musicians who could be taken from their shotgun shacks and introduced to a mass audience .
But it also gave prominence to acts who seemed happy to smother the music in sentimentality and kitsch Ã¢â¬ â most notably , the Kingston Trio , the California band whose huge - selling version of the standard Ã¢â¬ÅTom DooleyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( 1958 ) made folk big business .
By the early 60s , it was all going the way of The X Factor , as Wald recounts : Ã¢â¬ÅMercury Records staged a nine - day spring break hootenanny at Daytona Beach in April 1963 that drew more than 36 collegiate folk - singing groups to compete for a recording contract.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In 1962 , Dylan had seemed to answer the call for a more authentic sound Ã¢â¬ â even if , as the son of an electrical goods salesman from Minnesota , he was arguably anything
but .
Again , it was complicated .
Long before he plugged in a Fender Stratocaster , Dylan had already ended up on the wrong side of folk devoteesÃ¢â¬ â¢ prejudices : in response to his first album , some traditionalists deemed him Ã¢â¬Åforced , pretentious and ineptÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and when The FreewheelinÃ¢â¬ â¢ Bob Dylan announced a shift away from traditional material and his arrival as a songwriter , a folk periodical from his home state complained that he had become Ã¢â¬Åmelodramatic and maudlin Ã¢â¬ Â¦ his melodies bear more relation now to popular music than folk
musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
When he moved into rock , the mother of all backlashes was inevitable .
Wald points out that among the songs on the US charts when Dylan began to think about going electric were Chuck BerryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Ã¢â¬ÅNadineÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Tommy TuckerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Ã¢â¬ÅHi - Heel SneakersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
: play these two superlative records next to , say , DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅFrom a Buick 6Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ( 1965 ) , and you get a real flavour of what he had in mind .
Lyrically , he had already begun the shift from unadorned , often topical songs into a more impressionistic , hallucinatory style ; musically , he aimed at something much more nimble than the folk revivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lumbering piety .
He had performed at Newport in 1963 and Ã¢â¬ â¢ 64 , and by the time of his third appearance , the sense that he was trying to escape the left - leaning milieu was overwhelming .
So much of his songwriting from this time is about the need to challenge the Ã¢â¬ÅprotestyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( his word ) stereotype Ã¢â¬ â from acoustic pieces such as Ã¢â¬ÅIt AinÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Me BabeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅMy Back PagesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to electric songs such as Ã¢â¬ÅBallad of a Thin ManÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅLike a Rolling StoneÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the celebration of abandonment and solitude with which he repeatedly taunted the outraged elements of his audience .
Something , then , was always going to give .

2015-07-14,"David Bowie Is , the celebrated V&amp;A exhibition , finally arrives in Australia this week , after an extensive two - year global tour thatÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
crisscrossed Europe and North America .
Although its subject wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be touching down for the event at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne ( rumour has it he visited the original London show in disguise in 2013 ) , BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s relationship with Australia will inevitably loom large .
The singer first visited Australasian shores at the end of 1978 , playing to packed outdoor stadiums in Adelaide , Melbourne and Sydney .
Five years later , he emerged from a three - year hiatus to shoot two landmark music videos for MTV with director David Mallet :
the politically charged LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and the suitably risque China Girl .
In 1983 , Bowie purchased an apartment in the Kincoppal apartment building in Elizabeth Bay , Sydney , which he did not sell until 1992 .
The nearby Sebel Hotel played host to the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s entourage ( and the many rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll parties that ensued ) .
But BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s curiosity about Australia dates back to when he was still the young , wide - eyed David Jones in drab 1950s London .
As a 12-year - old , he stumbled across a Stravinsky record whose sleeve featured an artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s striking impression of Uluru .
When he did finally make it to Australia some 20 years later , sufficient time was worked into his touring schedule so that he could explore the mysteries of the outback with ease .
Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet , a lifelong fan who became a chart rival to his hero in 1983 , believes the attraction of Australia for Bowie made perfect sense .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s always been very good at Ã¢â¬ËclaimingÃ¢â¬ â¢ place , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Kemp .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe did it with Berlin , validating it as a city [ but ] no one had claimed Australia as part of pop culture .
Suddenly , in LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , he appeared as if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just walked through the outback and found a bottle of peroxide along the way .
He looked extraordinarily healthy .
He also looked otherworldly , like an alien whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d fallen from another planet.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
That otherworldliness somehow permitted Bowie to make the one and only overtly political statement of his career with the video for LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , which was shot on the same trip as China Girl , both in Sydney and in the remote New South Wales outback town of Carinda .
The LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance video shone a light on the plight of Indigenous Australians , with dramatic imagery referencing domestic slavery , the stolen generations and the British nuclear testing of the 1950s .
Two first - year dancing students , Terry Roberts and Joelene King , were cast to play the young Aboriginal couple attempting to assimilate into western capitalist society , only to reject it outright .
Ã¢â¬ÅA direct statement on integrationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ was how Bowie summed up the videoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s startling imagery to the ABC .
Rolling Stone journalist ( later , MTV host )
Kurt Loder was on set for the 35 mm , $ 500,000 shoot in Carinda and recalls the star being in an unusually reflective mood .
The musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s outback adventures in 1978 had evidently left a mark on his psyche .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn the north , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unbelievable intolerance , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Bowie said to Loder of the disparity between black and white Australia .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Aborigines canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t even buy their drinks in the same bars Ã¢â¬ â they have to go round the back and get them through whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s called a Ã¢â¬Ëdog hatchÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
And then theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re forbidden from drinking them on the same side of the street as the bar.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
While some bristled at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s observations Ã¢â¬ â he went on to compare the divide to South African apartheid
Ã¢â¬ â
the wider public seemed to be more interested simply in having the star on Australian soil .
Larissa Behrendt , author , lawyer and documentarian , recalls seeing the LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance clip for the first time and being floored by its content .
Ã¢â¬ÅI grew up in an area of Sydney that was very monocultural , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe were the only Aboriginal kids at the school Ã¢â¬ â and there was huge invisibility around Indigenous people .
Whenever anything came up about Aboriginal people , it was always negative.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She expands : Ã¢â¬ÅThere was a real ignorance about Indigenous issues back then , a stigma about being Aboriginal .
So to see a video that celebrated being Indigenous , that had a beautiful young girl as the star and a handsome young Aboriginal boy as the hero , was something IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never seen before .
It was a hugely important .
And he did it without being preachy Ã¢â¬ â or with any agenda.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie was energised by the burgeoning music video format and the platform it provided .
Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran , another star whose rapid rise to fame coincided with this MTV era of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , was a fanboy like Kemp , who confesses to Ã¢â¬Ådrawing Bowie on every one of my exercise booksÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ at school .
The musician and music television were destined for a perfect marriage , he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅMusic videos were hugely important to us as a band
Ã¢â¬ â MTV was new and they had all this airtime to fill .
But with Bowie , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re talking about somebody whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s probably had the best ongoing image of any artist
ever Ã¢â¬
Â¦ HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s got all the raw materials
Ã¢â¬ â great face , great eyes , he looks great in a suit.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cultural contribution to AustraliaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s coming of age extends far beyond his music videos .
As in Europe and the US , he gave misfits Ã¢â¬ â those who fell outside the mainstream Ã¢â¬ â a voice .
He was a figure who appeared to understand , who spoke to those who felt different , who somehow seemed to articulate their issues .
Joelene King , the female star of LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , says today , more than 30 years after its bold , provocative statement , that the video continues to educate new generations about AustraliaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rich cultural heritage .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt lets the world know that Australia has a black history , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat this history is alive and well .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re still
here.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅHe challenges people , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says director Julien Temple who was to follow Mallet as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s go -
to collaborator during the boom years of music TV in the 1980s .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe provokes them into thinking about themselves and how they fit into the world around them in a very interesting way .
And heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s still doing it , today.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
David Bowie Is is at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image , Melbourne , from 16 July to 1 November .
Koorie Heritage Trust will convene speakers in the fields of Indigenous art and culture to discuss the context and impact of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work in LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance :
In Between the Message and Medium on 5 September LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance :
Bowie Down Under screens at the Melbourne international film festival on 9 and 15 August"
2015-07-23,"Two days before the weekend papers revealed bizarre images of our royal family delivering fascist salutes on a lawn all but wreathed in the golden glow of a crumbling empire , BBC4 broadcast its regular nostalgia trip for my generation .
The August 1980 edition of Top of the Pops , shown last Thursday , was graced with the Skids , Elton John , Gary Numan and , to me , the godlike vision of David Bowie at No 1 , singing Ashes to Ashes .
But as the programme played out its final sequence , the usual panning shots of the audience produced a scene that even now has the capacity to shock .
Standing on a podium was a young man , vaguely Ã¢â¬Ånew waveÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in dress , repeatedly raising his arm in an unmistakable Ã¢â¬Åsieg heilÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Post - Jimmy Savile et al
, the beleaguered BBC has had its work cut out editing versions of TOTPs which are broadcastable .
As David Shariatmadari pointed out , another 1980 episode of the programme in which Roger Daltrey muttered Ã¢â¬Åmind your backsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ before a performance by the Village People , was edited Ã¢â¬ â a sharp reminder of the passing of time , fashion and acceptability .
How did this young manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reflexive gesture , delivered with an almost equally audible snigger , get past them ?
Perhaps the fact that it did is an indicator of popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s queasy relationship with politics and responsibility .
Only four years before , in 1976 , David Bowie himself was accused of using a similar salute when he arrived at Victoria Station in London .
In what now looks like a set - up ( a lesser god might have sued ) , Bowie was quoted as being supposedly in favour of a rightwing dictatorship .
The Thin White Duke Ã¢â¬ â whom I saw on stage on his apocalyptic Station to Station tour at Wembley that year Ã¢â¬ â did indeed seem to invoke the uneasy glamour of totalitarianism .
Was that just another persona for the shape - shifter ?
Neither then , nor now , have BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s personal politics had anything to do with those of the extreme right .
But the way was open for Joy Division , formed that same year by confirmed Bowie fans , to use the name of a concentration camp brothel .
Meanwhile , Malcolm McLaren , manager of the Sex Pistols , and his partner , Vivienne Westwood , designed bondage shirts screenprinted with swastikas , worn by Johnny Rotten .
And in the infamous Bill Grundy Show TV interview with the Pistols in November 1976 , one of their Bromley Contingent followers in attendance wears a very obvious swastika armband .
What naivety or stupidity was on display here ?
Which of us does not shudder at their earlier selves ?
Perhaps even the Queen is doing so now .
I wonder particularly because I wore one of those Westwood bondage shirts .
Yet I was an active member of the Anti - Nazi League , and when we marched to Victoria Park in east London for the Rock Against Racism festival in 1978 , we were showered with bricks by sieg - heiling skinheads from warehouse windows .
I was politically aware
Ã¢â¬ â ironically , punk had made me so .
I knew the power of such symbols .
I knew what they meant for their victims , among whom I would have been numbered .
So did the Jewish Malcolm McLaren ( although his fellow manager , and Jew , Bernie Rose , manager of the Clash , argued violently with him on the issue ) ; and so did the situationist radical Tony Wilson , whose Factory Records was home to Joy Division .
As the front page ( ab)use of the eight - year - old Queen raising her arm in that fated , freighted gesture proves , the fascination with fascism remains , as does its stain .
That our idols may be complicit only speaks to a strange disconnection in our culture .
Having written an admiring , although not uncritical biography of Noel Coward ( a close friend of the QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mother ) , I was still taken aback last year to discover evidence that he had performed at a British fascists carnival ball at the Hammersmith Palais in 1925 .
When later interviewed about the madness of his mid-70s period , Bowie said his work then was about the sadness he felt in the world .
Earlier this year , walking round Berlin , I wondered at the creative power that produced BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s famous Berlin trilogy , IsherwoodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novels and BrechtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plays .
But I also saw the armed guards on the synagogues and on the Holocaust memorial .
Art can provoke , through transgression .
It is not responsible .
It does not commemorate .
That duty lies with the rest of us ."
2015-08-14,"When the colossal Library of Birmingham opened its doors less than two years ago , I quietly wondered what was the point in replacing one infamous library building with another , not least when it cost ÃÂ£188 m to do so .
The mucky concrete ziggurat it replaced Ã¢â¬ â which Prince Charles said he thought looked like a building where books were Ã¢â¬Åincinerated , not keptÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â just needed a good clean , as far as I was concerned .
Me and the old Central Library had history :
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where I borrowed my first David Bowie album and my life was changed for the sum of 60p .
Nonetheless , I quickly fell for its successor Ã¢â¬ â content mattering more than style Ã¢â¬ â and spent much of last year working there , riding the bank of escalators that spears through the libraryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s core to one of the light , open study areas .
In the past six months , though , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s felt as though the whole enterprise has been falling to bits , which is why it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t surprise me in the slightest that BirminghamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s libraries are now asking their users to donate spare books while its book - buying fund is Ã¢â¬ÅpausedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It began earlier this year with signs warning that its opening hours would be cut in half .
More than 100 staff lost their jobs and requests were made for extra volunteers .
On my last visit , a new sign announced that a charitable trust had been formed to safeguard the libraryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s future , along with entreaties to hire its various nooks for business meetings .
The last six months , in particular , have seen the library engaged in an exercise of cultural immiseration .
The beanbags in the childrenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s library have gone limp ; broken doors into the quiet study areas havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been fixed , and neither has the scenic glass lift to the top floor garden and Shakespeare memorial room .
The result is a showcase which still looks snazzy on the outside , yet is already scraggy within .
When the library opened there was a sense of renewal and consolidation of purpose : Birmingham knew what libraries were for , and was spending nearly ÃÂ£200 m to prove it .
Unlike the central libraries of Manchester , Liverpool and Glasgow , all of which have been refurbished beautifully in the past few years , Birmingham city council felt theirs needed replacing in its entirety for the second time in 40 years .
( This says rather a lot about Birmingham : it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel like a city unless itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s knocking something down . )
The question is whether the council ought to have shelved the building once the recession started ( and certainly once the Tories got anywhere near power ) , or whether it needed to push ahead for the obvious press , prestige and tourist numbers it would attract .
Was it an act of defiance , 1980s local government - style , or a direct challenge to a Tory government that enjoys talking up the benefits of revitalised cities without being willing to stump up the cash for the services that make them tolerable ?
The case of the Library of Birmingham , perhaps aptly given its many - tiered structure , tells more than one story .
First , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about the mistake of putting the box before the contents : libraries , first and foremost , have to be about the free availability of quality , up - to - date reading material .
Is it really the case that the council couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t foresee difficulties in running and replacement costs given the post-2008 climate ?
Second , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about regional councils overstretching themselves to provide services and Ã¢â¬ÅexperiencesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to compete with an inflated , marketeerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s - eye view of what an urban lifestyle should look and feel like .
But thirdly , and most importantly , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a sign of how far the current government is willing to take its mission to denude the state and replace its role with charity and individuals chipping in where possible .
One student interviewed by the Guardian on the libraryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opening in 2013 called it a Ã¢â¬Åstatement of intentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , showing that Birmingham was a city that cared about learning and the advancement of its people .
That is exactly how IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve experienced the building since it opened .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a place where Brummies go to better themselves as individuals , and to advance the cause of being better Brummies together .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why I love it , and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why I hate
whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s happening to it ."
2015-08-18,"From Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane to the Thin White Duke , a professor in London is living his life as David Bowie for a year to gain a better understanding of the pop iconÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mind and work .
Will Brooker , who teaches film and cultural studies at Kingston University , is spending a few months at a time experiencing specific moments of the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s five - decade career Ã¢â¬ â from adopting BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eating habits and poring over the literature he read , to visiting the same places as the English singer - songwriter .
Brooker Ã¢â¬ â who has transitioned away from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1974 Philadelphia soul period , and from wearing thick blue eye shadow with shock of orange hair Ã¢â¬ â has already been to Brixton , Bromley and Beckenham , and plans to go to Berlin next month .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe idea is to inhabit BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s head space at points in his life and career to understand his work from an original angle , while retaining a critical and objective perspective at the same time Ã¢â¬ â a kind of split persona perhaps , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Brooker said .
The academic , who has been commissioned to write a monograph about the singer called Forever Stardust , said his starting point as Bowie was the late 1960s .
A bright yellow suit , marking BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1983 comeback tour , black waistcoats and large collared white shirts have also been lined up in the academicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wardrobe .
Ã¢â¬ÅThese things are quite hard to source
and I had to go to a tailor
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said , adding that most of his secondhand Bowie - like outfits were pulled together from online marketplaces .
Brooker is also preparing for the 80s bleached perm , which he said Bowie himself described as a scrambled egg sitting on his head .
He plans to watch the same films Bowie would have done , and claims he has submitted himself to sleep deprivation and , some weekends , eaten only red peppers and drunk only milk .
The project also involves listening only to songs Bowie would have heard .
He has read works by William Burroughs , the postmodernist writer of the Beat generation ; Aleister Crowley , the English occultist ; Michael Moorcock , the science fiction author , and ideas about the death of God and existentialism by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re reading some strange science fiction and books about magic you can kind of get into BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s head and see itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sometimes quite a strange place .
A dangerous place , a place you wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to live too long.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅThe levels of cocaine Bowie was consuming is not just illegal for a professor like myself , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s much too expensive Ã¢â¬ â as well as unhealthy , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Brooker said .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo at the weekend I had a six - pack of energy drinks to try and simulate the experience of illegal substances , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told the Guardian .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt made me very jumpy.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Brooker added : Ã¢â¬ÅThe thought that kept returning to me was : how did Bowie survive the 70s ?
He really made himself very ill .
So itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wonderful that we had him through the 70s.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Although a few makeup artists have helped Brooker with some of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more elaborate looks , the culture professor said he did most of it himself , with Ã¢â¬Åquite a collection of makeupÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and that the pigment of the strong 70s makeup is still in place when he wakes up in the morning .
For replicating BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Thin White Duke era , Brooker lit black candles in his room and painted expressionist pictures while listening to German music .
Ã¢â¬ÅI just wanted to have that immersion , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅNo one could be Bowie again , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m thinking no one would want to go through everything he went through , not really .
But I want to get some taste of it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He added :
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fortunate that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going through his career chronologically .
Because I think by Ã¢â¬ â¢ 83 he was pretty clean .
I think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll get a tan , get fit , get my hair changed again , get my teeth whitened.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
During his teenage years when Brooker first came across Bowie , he repeatedly listened to a cassette of the LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance album on his Walkman .
He said he felt an affinity with Bowie , who had achieved a Ã¢â¬Åbalance between success and strangeness , between a necessary commercial pragmatism and a core of personal authenticityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
His undergraduate students have not seen Brooker teach since he began his project , and he said he could assure them he would not be lecturing while in fully Ziggy regalia .
Brooker said he was not sure how Bowie would feel about his latest project : Ã¢â¬ÅI hope he would be interested in and amused by my research .
I do feel , though , that everything he says and does in public is performance , so if he did hear about it , we would be unlikely to know what he genuinely thought.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½

2015-09-11,"Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi would like David Bowie and Keith Richards to guest star on the BBC1 show .
Bowie is no stranger to extraterrestrial activity , having played an alien in The Man
Who Fell to Earth and topped the charts with Space Oddity , while Richards has trod the boards in the Pirates of the Caribbean series of films alongside Johnny Depp .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie , he would be a very good one ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Capaldi told the audience at a screening for the first two episodes of series nine in Cardiff , adding that he would like to see Ã¢â¬ÅKeith
Richards Ã¢â¬ â stumbling around the Tardis , knocking out a few chords.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Capaldi , who plays the Doctor , is a big fan of the pair .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe punk explosion started when I was about 18
so I love new wave music and rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Doctor Who has played host to many high - profile guest stars over the years Ã¢â¬ â including Simon Pegg , Carey Mulligan , and John Hurt .
This series will see guest actors including Maisie Williams and Michelle Gomez .
No word , though , on whether BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inclusion could take inspiration from the Flight of the Conchords spoof , Bowie in Space .
The trailer for the new series includes a clip of Capaldi , playing the electric guitar , which the actor said he was Ã¢â¬ÅdelightedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to find it in the script .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d sort of half mentioned it in joking , but I was really delighted that these guys went for it as an idea , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was a great day when I went to pick the DoctorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guitar .
We went to Denmark street and went into various vintage guitar shops , looking for Doctor WhoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guitar .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd I first I thought it should be like a Stratocaster or a Telecaster , one of those old classic guitars , but they all started to look like I was having a mid - life crisis.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He also revealed he sought advice from previous Doctors when he took on the part .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s extraordinary because your life does change in some ways quite dramatically
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI spoke to both David [ Tennant ] and Matt [ Smith ] before , and they both said , Ã¢â¬ËWell you will just become much more visible.Ã¢â¬ â¢ I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite take on board what that meant .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt means when you go down to the supermarket or the shops or whatever , people shout out at you from cars , and people say hello and come up to you .
And at first it was quite scary , because you feel very exposed.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But he has adapted to the public attention because it comes with goodwill :
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat you get is affection .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢
d have to be very stony - hearted to not be charmed by how kindly people look upon the Doctor.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2015-09-11,"Former Sun editor Dominic Mohan has been hired as chief executive of The Outside Organisation , the publicists with clients including David Bowie and , until recently , Richard Desmond .
Mohan , who has been working as a consultant for News Corporation , has been been given a particular focus on widening the range of clients that The Outside Organisation recruits .
Mohan left the Sun in 2013 to work for parent company News Corp.
He worked for almost 20 years at the media company in roles including showbusiness editor of the Sun and deputy editor before taking on the job of editor in 2009 .
He was replaced as editor of the Sun by David Dinsmore , who in turn has been replaced by Tony Gallagher , the former editor - in - chief of the Telegraph .
He will work alongside Alan Edwards , the founder of Outside , who becomes chairman of the agency .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m delighted to be working with an inspirational figure like Alan and his excellent team , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Mohan said .
Ã¢â¬ÅOutside has a superb reputation and I aim to help build on its successes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve known and worked with Dominic for about 20 years and always thought heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d make a great PR , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Edwards said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe clearly knows a story when he sees one and that skill is vital in our industry .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s driven and connected and he will be an enormously important addition to the company.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Outside has advised a string of celebrity clients over the years , including The Who , David and Victoria Beckham , and Bon Jovi .
Edwards had been a long - time rep for Richard DesmondÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Express Newspapers , publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express , until earlier this year ."
2015-09-22,"David Bowie has written and recorded a new song for television .
His track will feature on the opening credits of The Last Panthers , a new co - prodcution from Sky and Canal+ , which will be shown later this year on Sky Atlantic in the UK .
The track will be BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first original contribution to a TV show since he recorded the theme to the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Buddha of Suburbia in 1993 , which reached No 35 when released as a single .
He also released an EP of songs written to accompany his appearance in the BBC adaptation of Bertolt BrechtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Baal in 1982 .
Johan Renck , who directed the series , said : Ã¢â¬ÅI was looking for one of the icons of my youth to write the music for the title sequence , but was presented with a god .
His first response was precise , engaged and curious .
The piece of music he laid before us embodied every aspect of our characters and the series itself Ã¢â¬ â dark , brooding , beautiful and sentimental ( in the best possible incarnation of this word ) .
All along , the man inspired and intrigued me and as the process passed , I was overwhelmed with his generosity .
I still canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fathom what actually happened.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2015-09-22,"David Bowie has written the title track for Sky AtlanticÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new John Hurt and Samantha Morton drama The Last Panthers Ã¢â¬ â his first original music for a film or TV show for 20 years .
Bowie , who released his first studio album for a decade ,
The Next Day , two years ago , recorded a new song for the diamond heist drama after a Ã¢â¬Åmeeting of mindsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with the series director , Johan Renck .
Renck said : Ã¢â¬ÅI was looking for one of the icons of my youth to write the music for the title sequence , but was presented with a God.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Renck , who has directed series including Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead as well as music videos by Madonna , Beyonce , Lana Del Ray and New Order , added : Ã¢â¬ÅHis first response was precise , engaged and curious .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe piece of music he laid before us embodied every aspect of our characters and the series itself Ã¢â¬ â dark , brooding , beautiful and sentimental ( in the best possible incarnation of this word ) .

I still canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fathom what actually happened.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
A six - part drama ,
The Last Panthers is a co - production between Sky and French broadcaster Canal+ and will air in November .
It opens with a daring diamond heist before delving into the Ã¢â¬Ådark heart of Europe where a shadowy alliance of gangsters and Ã¢â¬ËbankstersÃ¢â¬ â¢ now rule , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Sky .
Zai Bennett , director of Sky Atlantic , said : Ã¢â¬ÅTo have David Bowie , one of the greatest music legends of today , write music that features in The Last Panthers is hugely exciting .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an incredibly ambitious and multi - layered drama and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re looking forward to offering it to our customers across Europe.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Also starring double Cesar - winning French actor Tahar Rahim , who starred in A Prophet , and Goran Bogdan from Crotia , the Sky Atlantic drama is produced by the French production company behind The Returned , Haut et Court TV , and the UK producer of Channel 4Ã¢â¬
â¢ s
This Is England , Warp Films .
It was filmed in London , Marseilles , Belgrade and Montenegro .
Following the lead of another Sky Atlantic drama Fortitude , which aired across Europe earlier this year , it will be broadcast across Europe on SkyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s network in the UK , Ireland , Italy , Germany and Austria ."
2015-09-22,"David Bowie has taken time out from his day job composing songs for musicals about Spongebob Squarepants and written a TV theme .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a first for the pop chameleon Ã¢â¬ â he recorded the music for The Buddha of Suburbia in 1993 , whereas the Neighbours tune is believed to have been loosely inspired by a jam session that came out of his and Iggy PopÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cocaine - fuelled Berlin period .
But his new music for The Last Panthers , a new co - production from Sky and Canal+ , will be his first original contribution to a TV show in more than 20 years .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s far from the only pop star to have written a TV theme Ã¢â¬ â
so how will it compare to these works of art ?
Dexys Midnight Runners Ã¢â¬ â
Because of You
( Theme from Brush Strokes )
How to you follow up the most brilliant yet commercially - challenging album of your career ?
One that contains romantic spoken word reminiscence , rants about the state of Radio 1 and declarations of Irish pride ?
Most people would probably agree that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not by writing a song for a British sitcom about an amorous painter and decorator .
And they might have been right : this fiddle - adorned ballad was the last thing the band put out for more than a quarter of a century .
Ozzy Osbourne Ã¢â¬
â Dog , the Bounty Hunter
( Dog , the Bounty Hunter )
You donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t get to be called the prince of darkness without singing the odd TV theme , and so Ozzy stepped up to sing Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m the dog , the big bad dogÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ over some sludgy metal riffs .
The whole thing lasts 37 seconds , which is about as long as a heavy metal song about a bounty hunter should last .
Regina Spektor Ã¢â¬ â YouÃ¢â¬ â¢
ve Got Time
( Orange Is the New Black )
The hit show about female prison life wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even finished when Regina Spektor was asked to write the theme song .
As she was writing , the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
creator Jenji Kohan kept sending her rough , unfinished episodes in order to inspire her .
Ã¢â¬ÅI got to really experience the world of the show and got to see what the characters were really like and it kind of helped me finish the song ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Spektor told Rolling Stone .
Which probably wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the experience Ozzy Osbourne went through for Dog , the Bounty Hunter .
Waylon Jennings
Ã¢â¬ â
Good OlÃ¢â¬
â¢ Boys ( The Dukes of Hazzard )
Jennings prided himself on being an outlaw country singer , making his music the perfect fit for a show that featured characters so goddamn rebellious that they used to get in their car through the windows .
Johnny Cash shooting a man in Reno for the sole reason of watching him die had nothing on these guys .
Primus Ã¢â¬ â South Park theme ( South Park )
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to imagine the cartoonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theme song is the work of an actual functioning band ,
given that it sounds like a malfunctioning bluegrass group and ends with a fart noise .
But it is indeed the work of experimental San Franciscan rockers Primus , a band so quirky that critic Robert Christgau once declared them the Ã¢â¬Åstrangest top 10 band ever , and good for themÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Dr John Ã¢â¬ â Curious George theme ( Curious George )
Dr John is a psychedelic blues pianist influenced known for his melding of Louisiana blues and zydeco with rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll .
Curious George is a cartoon monkey known chiefly for his curiosity .
What would make more sense than to combine the two ?
Ã¢â¬ÅYou never can know whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s around the bend / Big adventure or brand new friend?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ goes the opening line , picking up on the overriding theme of GeorgeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s curiosity like only a Louisiana pianist schooled in zydeco could ."
2015-09-29,"Surely you heard the news from outer space yesterday : scientists have confirmed the existence of water , flowing water , on Mars .
This is phenomenal news , of course , for David Bowie and the rest of us interested in the search for extra terrestrial life .
Because we know that water is a necessary condition for life , as we understand it , to flourish .
Such a discovery sets our imaginations spinning while raising a raft of related questions : will this make it easier for us to send humans like Matt Damon to go live on Mars ?
Can we somehow siphon MarsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s water to help solve the horrible drought in California so we can grow more delicious almonds ?
Or even just : where does the Red PlanetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s water , evidenced by hydrated salt detected in the dark streaks known as Ã¢â¬Årecurring slope linaeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ visible on the surface , come from ?
Whatever youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re asking , if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not imagining a subterranean ocean teeming with bizarre forms of life like the sea of monsters that the Beatles sail through in The Yellow Submarine , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re clearly not assessing all your options .
Of even more immediate concern to my mind ( and , one would imagine , to David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ) is the possibility that whatever might be floating around up there in that Martian water might have , eons ago , evaporated up off Mars , travelled across the Milky Way in tiny space water droplets the size of dust particles or something , entered EarthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s atmosphere and landed in our oceans , where theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been sustained by the water we have here .
Maybe thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where those indestructible tardigrades came from .
Or , maybe , octopuses .
This is a theory IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had for a little while now .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been reluctant to share it up to this point , for fear of being ridiculed , but now that we have established that thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s water on Mars , here is a prediction : 50 years from now , it will be accepted scientific knowledge that octopuses trace their evolutionary roots back to Mars .
Have you been following octopus news over the past few years ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been pretty mind - blowing .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re learning more and more about the feats of intelligence and sensitivity these eight - legged , three - hearted cephalopods have been known to perform .
They can recognize individual caretakers .
They decorate their homes with rocks and shiny objects ( a fact that was the impetus for the song OctopusÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Garden that human children are so fond of singing .
They open jars , carry coconuts shells like umbrellas , play with Legos and film movies on stolen video cameras .
They have a seemingly magical ability to change their color and shape and texture and patterning to match that of their surroundings or other creatures in their environment .
It happens instantaneously .
Years ago , snorkeling in Costa Rica , I watched one swimming over a bed of various types of coral , changing color and pattern as it went .
It was like it was wearing Harry PotterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cloak of invisibility .
I thought I might be dreaming .
As Orion magazineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Sy Montgomery reported in his classic 2011 essay Ã¢â¬ÅDeep IntellectÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , scientists have discovered gene sequences in the epidermis of cephalopods usually found only in the light - sensing retina of the eye .
Basically , the thinking goes , they can see with their skin .
Also , apparently , octopuses have psychic powers .
Five years ago , during the World Cup , an octopus named Paul that lived in an aquarium in Oberhausen , Germany , correctly predicted the outcome of all seven of the German teamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s matches .
He became a world - famous celebrity , dying shortly thereafter like James Dean .
In Ã¢â¬ÅDeep IntellectÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Montgomery quotes Peter Godfrey - Smith , a diver and professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York , who says , Ã¢â¬ÅMeeting an octopus is like meeting an intelligent alienÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
So I wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be surprised if octopuses up and disappear from our planet after we determine that they came here from Mars .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll probably leave us a note that says Ã¢â¬Åso long and thanks for all the fishÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ like the dolphins did in the HitchhikerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Guide to the Galaxy .
( ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be thanks for all the shellfish , mostly , in the octopusesÃ¢â¬ â¢ case . )
And then theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll somehow beam themselves right back up to Mars , where theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll continue to live , in water ."

a few days before Apollo 11 landed on the moon and a year after the release of the film 2001 ( rendering the songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title both a homage to Kubrick and a nifty copyright side - step ) .
Three years on , the crew of Apollo 13 narrowly escaped the MajorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deep - space drift fate , while two years ago , Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield offered the ultimate zero - gravity karaoke tribute by performing the song on the International Space Station .
Given this weight of role - model expectation , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s little wonder that the Major was later outed as a junkie in Ashes To Ashes .

her chutzpah when faced with more - than - trifling adversity ( detonating stomachs , disembowelled androids , wandering felines , oh , and the murderous designs of slithering , slavering , biomechanical killing machines ) has led to her being anointed the fifth - coolest hero in pop culture by Entertainment Weekly .
3 | Dave Bowman in 2001 :
A Space Odyssey
Among the really big questions this film continues to throw up ( could walking upside down really slowly in Velcro - soled shoes really have seemed the height of futuristic vision , even in 1969 ?
is that really Leonard Rossiter playing a Russian in a grey suit ?
Why didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
they just turn HAL off and turn him on again ? ) ,
the biggest , of course , is : just what kind of space - drug must Dr David Bowman have taken in order to disappear down the kaleidoscopic worm - hole , spend an eternity in a neoclassical bedroom , and be reborn as a star - child with the secrets of the universe at his fingertips ?
And could Voyager or whoever bring a little of it back , just for strictly controlled laboratory research purposes of course ? 4 | Nikolai CherukinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cosmonauts poster

Clambering into some rusty old crock fashioned from aluminium , twine and cavity wall insulation and blasting off into deep space , of course .
CharukinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poster , which can be seen in the Science MuseumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s current Cosmonauts : Birth of the Space Age exhibition , shows a pair of adorable socialist - realist moptops carrying a stylised Vostok launcher above the legend : Ã¢â¬ÅHappy New Year , Kids!Ã¢â¬

A year later he was dead , and Rauschenberg , the primary collagist of the US , reassembled the silkscreen heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been working on to create an elegiac image of Kennedy surrounded by , among other things , an astronaut floating serenely from a parachute , perhaps standing in , as the critic Andrew Graham - Dixon argued , for Ã¢â¬Åan angel attending at the LordÃ¢â¬ â¢ s

So itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only fitting that Buzz became the longest - serving toy in space in 2008 after six months on the International Space Station where he presided at dinner with its denizens and was seen gazing soulfully through a window into that very same infinite .
All of which presumably helped him over the existential crisis he suffered in the original Toy Story , when he found out that not only was he was a toy , but heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been made in Taiwan .

2015-10-05,"There is , John Whittingdale says , something uniquely brilliant about BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creative industries , which he summed up to the Conservative party conference by quoting a line from the Sunday Times : Ã¢â¬ÅThere are no French Rolling Stones , no German Beatles ; there is no Italian Bond , no Spanish Rowling , no Dutch David Bowie.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Nobody does it better , in other words .
Whittingdale hailed the way British culture Ã¢â¬ â in film , television and music Ã¢â¬ â is consumed around the world , but forgot one crucial point .
That if it were not for the US , none of this would be true .
The Beatles and the Stones were products of America : of American music brought back to these shores , where it found a receptive audience in young people who had the advantage over most of those in other countries in that they spoke English and knew what those American musicians were singing about .
They were products of America in that they became superstars in America , and once youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re an American superstar , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a global superstar .
The same is true of television and film : our products are watched around the world because the rest of the world is attuned to watching programmes or films dubbed into a native language , something the Anglophone nations reject .
Instead , we subtitle and shift Ã¢â¬Åforeign filmsÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ off to arthouse cinemas and
Ã¢â¬Åforeign TVÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ on to the outer reaches of the our TV listings .
We know other nations make fantastic art ; we just prefer to compartmentalise it , rather than welcome it into the mass market .
WhittingdaleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s is a peculiarly reductive view of art , in which there have to be winners and losers , and winning is decided purely by commercial success .
No one expects him to be championing the latest release on Static Caravan , or hailing a short film he saw at his local arts centre
Ã¢â¬ â heÃ¢â¬
â¢ s running the Department for Culture , Media and Sport , not an outsider art blog Ã¢â¬
â
but it would be nice if he acknowledged that there is more to art than turning a profit .
But thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s something more telling than WhittingdaleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s belief that money is what counts in art , which is his blithe dismissal of the work of others .
The French donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do pop music ?
Tell that to Daft Punk , the most influential group in pop over the past 15 years , creating the style that dominates the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s charts , EDM .
They donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t produce dangerous iconoclasts , who kick against the establishment ?
Shame no one told Serge Gainsbourg .

â
oh , and Kraftwerk , probably the second most important group in pop history , after the Beatles .
And in terms of their impact on music made today , ahead of the Beatles .
You donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t hear many groups trying to recreate Beatles For Sale any more ; you hear lots who want to sound like The Man - Machine .
There have been incredible amounts of dazzling , innovative pop music from elsewhere in the world Ã¢â¬ â the highlife of west Africa , the cumbia of Latin America , the tropicÃÂ¡lia of Brazil , the fabulous French pop boom of the 60s ( and if Whittingdale wants to hear a French Rolling Stones , he should give Jacques Dutronc a listen ) , and British pop has been well versed in taking from them .
Nowadays , the cutting edge of pop isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t to be found in Soho or Salford , but in SÃÂ£o Paulo , Lagos or Johannesburg .
The sonic architects of todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pop donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t look to Britain for guidance , but for sales .
And given WhittingdaleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s concern with making money , that is something he would do well to be aware of ."
2015-10-06,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theme song for the forthcoming TV show The Last Panthers has been unveiled .
Sky Atlantic have posted the opening credits to the show , featuring BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s track Blackstar , to YouTube , and though viewers receive less than a minute of music , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s enough to get a taste .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
first TV theme in more than 20 years , since he provided the music for the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s adaptation of Hanif KureishiÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
The Buddha of Suburbia , doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t opt for a banging piece of populism .
Instead , over an atmospheric backing , Bowie intones , in the style of a priest chanting in church : Ã¢â¬ÅOn the day of execution /
Only women kneel and smile.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t follow that by breaking into a version of Agadoo .
The music sheds light on what the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director , Johan Renck , had to say about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s contribution : Ã¢â¬ÅI was looking for one of the icons of my youth to write the music for the title sequence , but was presented with a god .
His first response was precise , engaged and curious .
The piece of music he laid before us embodied every aspect of our characters and the series itself : dark , brooding , beautiful and sentimental ( in the best possible incarnation of this word ) .
All along , the man inspired and intrigued me and as the process passed , I was overwhelmed with his generosity .
I still canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fathom what actually happened.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Have a listen and let us know what you think ."
2015-10-13,"In news thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll end all Glastonbury headline rumours for good , David Bowie has said he is never touring again .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been over 10 years since the artist took to the stage , but according to his ( presumably former ) booking agent , the pioneering pop artist has retired from touring officially .
John Giddings , who spoke at the International Festival Forum in London last weekend , said that Bowie was quick to quash future prospects of a tour .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid
[ Bowie ] is one of the best artists IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever worked with .
But every time I see him now , before I even speak to him , he goes , Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not touringÃ¢â¬ â¢ and I say , Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not asking , Ã¢â¬ â¢
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Giddings said according to Music Week .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe has decided to retire and , like Phil Collins , you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t demand these people go out there again and again and
again.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
last tour was 2004Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
A Reality Tour , which culminated with a show at the Isle of Wight Festival .
In spite of his live retirement , Bowie is still very much creating new material .
The artist recently wrote the theme song for the forthcoming TV show The Last Panthers , entitled Blackstar , while his Off Broadway musical Lazarus opens in December , and will feature new songs ."
2015-10-26,"David Bowie clearly likes to keep busy on his birthday .
On 8 January 2013 , the day he turned 66 , the singer released a surprise single and announced the existence of a new album , The Next Day .
Now he has announced that when he turns 69 he will release his latest album , Blackstar .
A single of the same name precedes it on 20 November .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
terse website statement brushes aside Ã¢â¬Åinaccurate reporting on the sound and content of the albumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
so itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s unclear whether Blackstar will , as one report has suggested , combine jazz , electronica , Krautrock and Gregorian chants , or qualify as his Ã¢â¬Åoddest work yetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The only taster so far is the eerie , Scott Walker - esque snippet of the single that functions as the title theme for Sky AtlanticÃ¢â¬ â¢ s forthcoming drama The Last Panthers , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first soundtrack work since the 1990s .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
current modus operandi , low - key and enigmatic , is the latest twist in a career full of them .
Few musicians have pursued pop stardom as doggedly as Bowie .
David Jones from Bromley had already reinvented himself several times over before striking gold in 1972 with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
Informed by a deep understanding of fashion , cinema , visual art and advertising as well as music , he continued to shapeshift thereafter , from glam - rocker to icy soul man to brooding Berliner to 1980s stadium - filler and beyond , before seeming to retire due to ill - health in 2006 .
His vast influence extends to such recent chameleonic performers as Lady Gaga and St Vincent but since his unexpected return the singer seems to have exhausted his own interest in fame .
Bowie gave no interviews to promote The Next Day and has declined to book any live shows despite the staggering sums that must be on the table .
He could headline any festival and sell out arenas for nights on end , but his former booking agent John Giddings recently told Music Week that the star would never tour again and there is no evidence to the contrary .
Instead , Bowie has popped up in unexpected places .
In 2013 he sang backing vocals on Arcade FireÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Reflektor and accepted the Brit award for best British male solo artist in 2014 via a speech read by Kate Moss , causing a minor online fuss by asking Scots to vote no in the independence referendum .
This year he has been working with playwright Enda Walsh on the musical stage show Lazarus , which premieres in New York next month .
It is inspired by Walter TevisÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
novel
The Man
Who Fell to Earth , Bowie having previously starred in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1976 screen adaptation .
By way of contrast , he is also said to be contributing to a stage musical based on the aquatic cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants .
Much though fans would love to see Bowie on stage again , the artist is exploring his creativity in less obvious ways .
Instead of performing old songs , he is writing new music in a range of formats .
Anyone who admires him for the unpredictability and forward momentum of his classic work
canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t really complain about that decision ."
2015-10-26,"A spokesperson for David Bowie has confirmed that his new album will be released in January 2016 .
Entitled Blackstar , the album will also feature a single of the same name .
A statement from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s publicist states that contrary to Ã¢â¬Åinaccurate reporting on the sound and content of the albumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , by sources this weekend , which claimed that Ã¢â¬ÅBlackstar may be the oddest work yetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ from the pioneer , only the following can be confirmed : the single will be released on 20 November , and it will not be part of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
theatre piece Lazarus , and that the album will be released on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s birthday , 8 January 2016 .
No further details can be confirmed at this stage .
And , if you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t wait until January
, Bowie has written the title track for Sky AtlanticÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
new John Hurt and Samantha Morton drama
The Last Panthers Ã¢â¬ â his first original music for a film or TV show for 20 years ."
2015-11-03,"A range of items that belonged to Margaret Thatcher are to be sold at auction after the Victoria and Albert ( V&amp;A ) museum turned down an offer to exhibit her clothes .
Dresses , jewellery and handbags which became synonymous with the late prime minsterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s public persona are to be sold off in the auction by ChristieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s next month .
The V&amp;A , which has one of the largest fashion collections in the world and has enjoyed particular success in recent years with exhibitions such as the one featuring clothing worn by David Bowie , confirmed on Monday that it had been offered items from ThatcherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wardrobe .
It said in a statement : Ã¢â¬ÅThe V&amp;A politely declined the offer of Baroness ThatcherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clothes , feeling that these records of
BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political history were best suited to another collection which would focus on their intrinsic social historical value .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe museum is responsible for chronicling fashionable dress and its collecting policy tends to focus on acquiring examples of outstanding aesthetic or technical quality.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Margaret Thatcher : her fashion legacy Ã¢â¬ â in pictures
ChristieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s confirmed that it would be providing further details on Tuesday morning in the UK .
The auction house has been the conduit in the past for sales of Thatcher - related items .
A number of her suits and dresses which went to auction in 2012 were bought by an anonymous bidder in South Korea .
The outfits sold on that occasion were those worn by her at the beginning of her career Ã¢â¬ â when , in the words of a ChristieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s expert , she acquired her Ã¢â¬Ëmilk snatcherÃ¢â¬ â¢ tag .
Other items associated with Thatcher include twin - sets and pearls .
Watchers of television news clips in the run - up to BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s referendum on EU membership are likely to become familiar with her sweater made up of the flags of the nine Common Market countries , accompanying her call then for Ã¢â¬Åa big
Yes vote for EuropeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2015-11-06,"When he was a child growing up in the 1980s , Duncan Jones would often stay up through the night , drawing maps on graph paper of places heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d only ever visited inside a computer screen .
His father , David Bowie viewed his sonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s arcane video game obsession with suspicion .
Ã¢â¬ÅLike any parent he would say
, Ã¢â¬ËWhy wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t you just get out of the house and play outside?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Jones recalls .
Zowie , as he was known at the time , spent much of his early life on tour with his father .
A peripatetic child , even one cushioned by the comforts of a rock star lifestyle , has to find home somewhere .
For Jones , it was the video game worlds into which he disappeared each day .
Ã¢â¬ÅGames have always presented an opportunity to escape , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut they are also an opportunity to go somewhere that you come to know well.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
So when , in 2013 , Legendary Pictures approached Jones with the offer to direct Warcraft :
The Beginning , a film based on World of Warcraft , one of the highest - grossing ( and , until recently , most popular ) online video games , it was a straightforward decision .
Ã¢â¬ÅHere was a unique opportunity to take a game that I knew well and loved and try to craft something that would invite an audience to see what all the fuss was about .
I wanted to give people a sense of why so many people play and care about the game.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Launched in 2004 , the title popularised the so - called massively multiplayer online role - playing game , where players quest together across the internet , fighting monsters and , in many cases , forging enduring friendships with other players that spill into the world on the other side of the screen .
JonesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film will focus on two sides of a sprawling interspecies conflict , inspired by the game , and the story of Garona Halforcen , played by Paula Patton , a woman whose loyalties are split between the two sides .
A licensed blockbuster with a multitude of anxious stakeholders who hope that it will grow into a trilogy franchise is an entirely new proposition for the 44-year - old director of indie award - winner Moon and time - shanking thriller Source Code .
Jones is undeterred by the challenge , and by the low regard in which most video game movie adaptations are held .
Ã¢â¬ÅI love games and I feel theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been sold short shrift in films so far , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
my generationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opportunity to right that wrong.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Jones points out that in recent years comic book movies have enjoyed a Ã¢â¬ÅrenaissanceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of commercial and critical success .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere is no reason why video game - based movies shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be able to do the same thing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Jones has some personal experience of video game design .
In 1999 , David Bowie contributed to the story and soundtrack of sci - fi adventure The Nomad Soul , and made two cameo appearances .
Bowie asked his son for feedback .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was an interesting game , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Jones , Ã¢â¬Åbut , you know ,
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s always a little awkward when youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re playing a video game and then a giant version of your dad comes along.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
After graduating from film school in his 20s , Jones struggled to establish himself as a film director and spent 18 months at a London - based game studio where he worked as an assistant designer for Demis Hassabis , the artificial intelligence maven who now works on GoogleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clandestine brain project .
It was during that time he became a regular visitor to Azeroth , World of WarcraftÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fictional universe .
It is a decade since the film of the game was originally announced , with Sam Raimi as director .
World of Warcraft was close to its most populous ; in 2008 it accounted for 62 % of the global subscription - based video game market .
12 million players paid a monthly subscription to reside in Azeroth ( more than live in Greece , Portugal or Belgium . )
There has , however , been something of an exodus in recent years as players have moved on to new pastures such as Guild Wars 2 and League of Legends .
Last week World of WarcraftÃ¢â¬ â¢ s publisher , Blizzard , announced that only 5.5 million remain in the game today ( a population that is still comparable to Finland ) .
Jones , who replaced Raimi as the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director in 2012 , is not worried about the drop - off in the gameÃ¢â¬ â¢ s audience .
Nor is he concerned that the fantasy quest that underpins its narrative is one with which every Tolkien fan is wearily familiar .
Rather than telling a straightforward tale of good versus evil , Jones has instead opted to find heroes on each side of the conflict .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe protagonists on each side are noble and empathetic , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey have reasons for doing what theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re doing that we understand .
Both the humans and the orcs present rich cultures in their own right , with people you care about and people who are obnoxious.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Stylistically , the film also distinguishes itself from , say , Lord of the RingsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s New Zealand mountain ranges , or Game of ThronesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Northern Ireland vistas , with a far smaller world .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn the game you travel from one area to another fairly quickly , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Jones .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou move from fields of wheat to lush forests and the shift is immediate .
We wanted to get across the idea that space is limited.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Before Warcraft comes out , Jones is trying to squeeze in a pet project called Mute , an indie science fiction movie about a speechless bartender searching for his missing partner in a cyberpunk city .
This may be JonesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last opportunity to do such work for a while
Ã¢â¬ â if Warcraft : The Beginning is successful , two more will follow .
Jones shows no regret at the prospect of being creatively tied up for the foreseeable future .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou could make a film out of just about anything so long as there is a clear vision about the story .
Be it a video game , comic book or cheque book , the question always is : what story do you have to tell?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Warcraft : The Beginning will be released next summer"
2015-11-10,"Danny Boyle has spoken of his grief after he was forced to shelve a long - planned David Bowie musical after the singer refused to let the director use his music .
Boyle has spent years working on a film focusing on the Ã¢â¬ÅThin White DukeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and the script had been written by Frank Cottrell Boyce , who worked with Boyle on the opening ceremony for the London Olympics .
However , speaking to the Radio Times , the Oscar - winning director confirmed that the pair had been forced to pull the plug because Bowie refused to give them permission to include his songs .
Boyle , who directed Slumdog Millionaire , said that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
refusal to be associated with the project had left him Ã¢â¬Åin griefÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and that while he was Ã¢â¬Åvery keen to direct a musicalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the project was not a musical in the traditional sense .
He told the magazine that he had taken on his most recent film , Steve Jobs Ã¢â¬ â a biopic of the late Apple chief executive Ã¢â¬ â to Ã¢â¬Åfill the space in my heart left by the abandoned Bowie scriptÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In another recent interview in October , Boyle said of the Bowie film : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a wonderful script , by Frank Cottrell Boyce .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a sort of musical , but we couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get the music rights ...
So , we had to put it away for the moment.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Boyle
said he did not want to do what projects such as Velvet Goldmine , a 1998 Todd Haynes film based around a glam rock musician , did .
Bowie did not approve of the film , which has since become a cult classic , and its many similarities with his life story .
He refused to let his music be used and threatened to sue , resulting in substantial rewrites to create more distance between the character and the real man .
While the future of the project hangs on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s approval , Boyle told the Happy Sad Confused podcast that he hoped he would one day be able to revive it .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢
d love to do this film , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not really a musical , but it is , so weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll see.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
This is not the first time Boyle has attempted to involve Bowie in his work .
The film - maker failed to get the star to appear in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics , while BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s seminal album Low inspired BoyleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 2013 thriller Trance .
Boyle also told the Radio Times that Kate Winslet , who plays JobsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s right - hand woman Joanna Hoffman , would be a great behind the camera as well as in front of it .
Ã¢â¬ÅSheÃ¢â¬
â¢ s an amazing person to have on set , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Boyle .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe talks to the crew about everything .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know why she doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make films.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In an interview in June this year , Winslet said her experience working with Boyle on Steve Jobs had made her consider directing for the first time .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅI did become aware of just how much experience IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had , particularly as a film actor and how much knowledge I have about the behind - the - camera stuff as well .
Also , I was married to a director for a long time , too , and I certainly learned things from Sam [ Mendes ] , so weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll see.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2015-11-13,"Retail Christmas ads herald the festive season almost as soon as Halloween is over .
This yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s promotion for John Lewis was eagerly anticipated and produced a variety of responses but also a whole host of spoofs .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve watched far too many men in the moon and have picked the best three for your delectation .
Top of the list is the Star Wars spoof featured Darth Vader , but there are also laughs with a Father Jack parody from Father Ted and a more thought provoking version from Goldie Lookin Chain .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ironic , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the second week running
we have featured Alanis Morrisette .
Last week she was dressed as a chicken , and this week she updates the lyrics to her 1995 hit Ironic and sings the new version with James Corden .
It has been 40 years since Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody and to mark that Ã¢â¬ â and pay tribute to the vocal talents of Freddie Mercury Ã¢â¬ â we are featuring a sound recording of him and David Bowie singing Under Pressure .
Bowie met Queen in 1981 in a Swiss recording studio to do the vocals for a song called Cool Cat .
He got bored and suggested writing a new song from scratch .
According to Mark Blake , author of a biography of Freddie Mercury , they began a 24 hours marathon of drinking and composing and came up with Under Pressure Ã¢â¬ â
the sound is amazing when you consider this was recorded before the days of auto - tune .
Meanwhile Drake ( Jay Pharoah ) has defended his hotline bling dance moves , pointing out that dads ( Beck Bennett ) , teachers ( Taran Killam ) , tax guys ( Donald Trump ) and Ed Grimley ( Martin Short ) all dance like him .
Those of you with a head for heights will love the clip of an illegal climb of the Eiffel Tower .

2015-11-19,"Information about David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s forthcoming album Blackstar has thus far proved elusive .
When one newspaper printed a selection of rumours about its content , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s official Facebook page protested at Ã¢â¬Åinnaccurate reporting about the sound and content of the albumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Now , however , details seem to be leaking out .
Producer Tony Visconti has been quoted suggesting that Blackstar takes a more avant - garde route than his 2013 comeback
The Next Day :
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Next Day started out trying to do something new but something old kept creeping in .
Not this album.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a comment that could give you pause for thought .
On the one hand , a recurrent criticism levelled at The Next Day was that , for all the weird videos that accompanied it , the music on it essentially amounted to superior but straightforward rock , not unlike the albums heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been making before heart problems prompted his withdrawal from music in 2004 .
On the other , Sue ( in a Season of Crime ) , the substantially stranger , jazz - influenced track Bowie released last year felt like hard work , in the same way that some of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1990s attempts to recapture the headstrong , pioneering spirit of his best 70s albums were frequently hard work .
You wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t describe them as bad records at all , but you could hear the effort and strain involved , which made for a marked contrast with Low or Scary Monsters , where BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s melding of pop and the avant - garde had sounded entirely unforced , as if it was second nature to him , regardless of the pains staken in their making .
On first listen , BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 10-minute long title track , premiered tonight on Sky Atlantic Ã¢â¬ â where an edited version has been being used as the title music for its series
The Last Panthers Ã¢â¬ â feels substantially less strained .
The influence of latterday Scott Walker still appears to be making itself felt in the lyrics
Ã¢â¬
â theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re elliptical , filled with images of fear and death ( Ã¢â¬Åtake your passport and shoes and sedativesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and clearly just waiting to be unpicked by the more dedicated Bowiephile Ã¢â¬ â but the music drifts episodically : from an ambient opening to vocals floating mournfully over a jerkily propulsive drum pattern and synthesisers squelching in vaguely acid houseish style to a sax solo to a beautiful , slow middle section with both a lovely melody and electronically - treated backing vocals .
For all ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s claims that Ã¢â¬Ånothing was done recalling the pastÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , you can just faintly detect the ghost of the massed varispeeded vocals with which Bowie decorated the similarly eerie After All and The Bewlay Brothers on The Man Who Sold The World and Hunky Dory respectively .
Along the way , there are tempo shifts , breakdowns into near - silence and flutes .
It looks a bit everything - but - the - kitchen - sink on paper , but in reality it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel cluttered at all : furthermore , it carries the listener along with it as it conjures up an atmosphere of mounting dread .
The jazz influence evident on Sue is still there , as are some of the musicians from the Maria Schneider Orchestra , but whereas Sue felt rather like Bowie writing around their improvisations , here the balance seems flipped : the occasional blurts of atonal sax and the clattering drums sound like theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re working in service to the song itself , not the other way round .
As a taster for the forthcoming album , it works perfectly : itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to leave it without wondering what else
Bowie might have come up with ."
2015-11-20,"Is 10 minutes too long for a music video ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a good question , because David Bowie has just put out a chunky promo for his new track Blackstar , which the time counter tells us is nine mins and 59 seconds long .
Bowie has got form in this area : not least the epic 20-minuter for JazzinÃ¢â¬ â¢ for Blue Jean , featuring BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s terrible mockney accent ( as ever with Bowie , well ahead of its time ) .
Alexis Petridis has already had his say about how Blackstar stacks up musically , but how about visually , as cinema ?
This Blackstar mini - epic , visually at least , belongs in the surreal , dream - logic era of the music video that Bowie himself mastered in the early 80s with Ashes to Ashes .
Music videos have moved on Ã¢â¬ â through the Spike Jonze , Hype Williams and Chris Cunningham eras Ã¢â¬ â but
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s have basically stayed the same , even if the budgets have gone up .
Blackstar begins with its own bit of ancestor worship , with a spaceman Ã¢â¬ â possibly strung out in heavens high Ã¢â¬ â lolling around on some rocks on a set alarmingly reminiscent of the asteroid - blasting blockbuster Armageddon ; quite what the Anne Hathaway lookalike with an Angelina Ballerina mouse tail is doing there is anyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guess .
Bowie himself , with head bandaged and eyes replaced by buttons ( think Neil GaimanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Coraline ) is a fantastically creepy image .
And he isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t trying to disguise his age Ã¢â¬
â the angled lighting
only accentuates his stately facial lines .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also fair to say that Johan Renck , the Swedish TV director who persuaded Bowie to write the theme song to his crime series The Last Panthers , is orchestrating a mix of cinematic techniques .
There are rather nice refractions , lens flare and focus jumps .
It is what you might call performative , or plastic : the Pina Bausch - esque dancers , the wax dripping candle , the ritual display of the Damien Hirst - y skull , the Soviet - Maoist shot of Bowie holding up a Blackstar book .
( IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m less keen on the deliberately fake - looking , set - built backdrops that litter the video : a tired tactic of artist - film - makers getting all excited about the Ã¢â¬ÅartificialityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of film . )
By the time the scarecrows writhing on crucifixes show up , about two - thirds of the way through , you can tell the well of imagery is beginning to run dry :
thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only so much surrealism you can throw at a wall before coherence starts to disintegrate .
But as is often the case with arty - farty promos , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the music chugging away in the background that holds things together , pasting over the sense and meaning gaps that , in other circumstances , would look furiously self - indulgent .
Interestingly , Renck suggested that it was a particular physical tic that interested Bowie Ã¢â¬ â the repetitive motion of background characters in Popeye cartoons Ã¢â¬
â and that perhaps led to the contempo - dance sequences .
( Bowie has been here before : the distinctive style of the New Killer Star promo was obviously inspired by those funny lenticular images . )
But essentially , this is a straightforward example of a surreal dream - logic film that tries to sustain itself a bit too long .
In the past , Bowie has gone for rather more cutting - edge promos Ã¢â¬ â such as the Tilda Swinton - starring The Stars
( Are Out Tonight ) or Where Are We Now ?
Ã¢â¬ â but
theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never been entirely satisfactory , perhaps because Bowie seems to ignore top - notch film directors in favour of artist - multimedia types .
You sort of wish he would go the whole hog and commission something like Daft PunkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Da Funk or Ã¢â¬
â one of my personal favourites
Ã¢â¬ â
The Chemical BrothersÃ¢â¬ â¢ Star Guitar .
Perhaps Ã¢â¬ â gulp
Ã¢â¬ â
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s time to get young Duncan Jones involved .
It could be the way forward ."
2015-11-24,"Music producer Tony Visconti has shared some insights into the new David Bowie album , Blackstar .
Describing the way in which Bowie wanted to deviate from his usual style , Visconti says the pair were Ã¢â¬Ålistening to a lot of Kendrick LamarÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , ahead of the recording process , while his drummer reveals how one lyric was written about Isis .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe wound up with nothing like that , but we loved the fact Kendrick was so open - minded and he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do a straight - up hip - hop record .
He threw everything on there , and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s exactly what we wanted to do .
The goal , in many , many ways , was to avoid rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti told Rolling Stone .
Also confirmed is
LCD Soundsystem founder James MurphyÃ¢â¬
â¢ s involvement on the album .
He played percussion on two tracks , though his role on the record was originally going to be more prominent .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt one point
we were talking about three producers for the album : David , James and myself , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Visconti .
Ã¢â¬Å[Murphy ] was there for a brief time , but he had his own projects to go off
to.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The piece details the way in which Bowie headhunted some of the musicians on his record Ã¢â¬ â attending a jazz night in New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s West Village , and as a result hiring a quartet led by saxophonist Donny McCaslin , who first appeared on his 2014 track , Sue .
The report says that one track uses words featured in A Clockwork Orange , while McCaslin says that Bowie told him a lyric on the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title track Ã¢â¬ â which regularly refers to a Ã¢â¬Åsolitary candleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â was Ã¢â¬Åabout IsisÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Guiliana and Visconti , however , both said they did not know what the songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backstory was .
Although later described as Ã¢â¬ÅinaccurateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s team in a statement in October , one early review of Blackstar suggested that the record combines jazz , electronica , Krautrock and Gregorian chants , and sounds like his Ã¢â¬Åoddest work yetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It is to be released on 8 January ."
2015-11-27,"BjÃÂ¶rk , David Bowie and a host of musicians , actors , artists , novelists and leading figures in the creative industries have called on negotiators at next weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s climate summit in Paris to reach a deal that staves off dangerous global warming .
The letter to the French foreign minister and the UN climate chief in charge of the talks is signed by a selection of A - listers from the British cultural scene , including actors Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson , musicians Damon Albarn and Guy Garvey , and writers Ian McEwan and Philip Pullman .
The heads of national institutions such as the Royal Opera House , the Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre , along with the chiefs of Bafta and UK Music , are among more than 300 people who have signed the letter asking governments to ensure the Paris deal is Ã¢â¬ÅambitiousÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬Åinspiring.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Nearly 150 world leaders including Barack Obama , Xi Jinping and David Cameron will arrive in Paris on Monday for the UN climate summit , billed as one of the largest diplomatic conferences ever organised .
More than 170 countries have submitted plans to curb carbon emissions in advance of the COP21 conference , which is designed to produce a binding deal on emissions beyond 2020 and financing for poorer countries to deal with climate change .
The creative industryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s letter to Laurent Fabius , the French foreign minister who will be president of the talks , reads : Ã¢â¬ÅWe are deeply concerned that our global economic and industrial systems are accelerating rates of extinction , desertification and soil depletion , degrading ecosystems , acidifying and littering our rivers and oceans , and resulting in a relentless rise in greenhouse gas emissions driving irreversible climate change .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn short , we are overwhelming the planetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life support systems.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The signatories say that Paris offers an Ã¢â¬Åhistoric opportunityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and any agreement reached must be binding and keep future temperature rises below 2C , considered the threshold after which dangerous global warming takes hold .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe will come together and intensify our efforts , but we need you to give us confidence in a sustainable future , to share our ambition , and recognize our capacity to strengthen your leadership , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ they write .
Alison Tickell , who coordinated the letter and runs JulieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bicycle , a charity advising the arts on sustainability , admitted that some interventions on global warming by the creative industry in the past had been crass but the sector could play a key role in tackling climate change .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe success of COP21 is not just politics , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also about civil society .
Climate change is not just about politics , economics or science , but about culture .
The arts can move us in a way that science just canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Artists and cultural figures also had much greater Ã¢â¬ÅreachÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with the public , she added .
Kevin Price , chief operating officer at Bafta , said that the TV and film industries were cutting their own carbon emissions and what he called the Ã¢â¬Åreal sense of wasteÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , from the way A - listers are treated to the amount of energy consumed for lighting .
But he said that perhaps the biggest role it could play was in the shows and films it produced :
Ã¢â¬ÅThe potential for our industry to play a role in emissions reduction is profound.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
British business groups warned on Thursday that the UK was risking its leadership at Paris with its actions at home , such as George Osborne breaking a manifesto promise this week by cancelling a ÃÂ£1bn carbon and capture storage competition .
Ã¢â¬ÅUnexpected decisions like this and a slackening off on domestic energy efficiency policy do not fill one with confidence that the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s increasingly ambitious climate change targets are entirely backed up with the will and means to succeed , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Claire Jakobsson , head of climate and environment policy at EEF , the manufacturersÃ¢â¬ â¢ organisation .
Separately , 39 French companies including EDF , Total and Orange pledged yesterday to spend Ã¢âÂ¬45bn over the next five years on renewable energy and other low carbon technologies ."
2015-11-28,"The British musician and producer Brian Eno meets Yanis Varoufakis , former finance minister for GreeceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Syriza government , at EnoÃ¢â¬
â¢ s recording studio in west London .
Both are stylish , shaven - headed men famous for their radical ideas .
Eno , 67 , started out playing synth and wearing leopardskin shirts in the 1970s with Roxy Music and went on to produce , among others , David Bowie and Talking Heads .
Varoufakis , 54 , who turns up in his trademark leather jacket , describes himself as a libertarian Marxist and has taught economics in the UK , Australia , the US and his native Greece .
He and Eno are friends , and recently attended a U2 concert together .
Both are phenomenally well - read men , keen theorists who regard themselves primarily as activists .
Brian Eno How did you get here ?
Yanis Varoufakis I walked from Waterloo to Marble Arch , then got the tube .
I enjoy walking .
BE
I do a walk every morning in Hyde Park .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a friend whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s got two huge dogs
Ã¢â¬
â English mastiffs , great big things .
They cost so much to keep .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know why people keep dogs .
YV
They are a very good substitute for kids .
BE
But heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s got children as well .
So why does he want two enormous dogs ?
One of these dogs has cost my friend ÃÂ£12,000 in vetsÃ¢â¬ â¢ bills .
They are twins , hard to tell apart , except the one who keeps getting ill is now a little thinner than the other one .
YV
There are fantastic stray dogs in Greece .
BE
I saw a funny thing in Crimea 18 years ago .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a town on two levels , a mountaintop and a ground bit .
There was a lift that carried you to the top .
There are stray dogs that live on top of the mountain , and they get in the line with all the people to step into the little lifts to carry you down .
You get in your lift , and a little dog will jump in with you .
They go all the way to the bottom , where they raid the dustbins round the restaurants , then they line up again and go back up .
YV You should see the stray dogs in Athens .
They are fantastic at crossing the road .
They look at the light at the pedestrian crossing and wait .
Of course , it is a Darwinian process .
Those that have not learned this are not alive .
BE
I guess
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the same with the dogs on the hill .
The ones who survive are the ones whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve learned to use the liftÃ¢â¬ Â¦ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m on deadline today for my new album .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll play you a bit of the brass section .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very different from anything else IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll play it loud .
[ They sit together for photos . ]
YV Two bald heads collide .
BE
This is showbiz .
YV YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re used to that .
BE
No , economists are much more showbiz than pop stars now .
You know Prospect magazine ?
Every year they have 50 leading figures , and last year 17 of them were economists .
You were one of them .
I was in there once , but artists arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t important any more .
YV
When there is an earthquake seismologists become important .
Now we have an economic crisis , economists are important .
During the 1930s we had to wait for the upturn before artists became significant .
When the going is really tough , art is stifled .
BE
Yes .
Have you seen that lovely book called When Art Worked ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about art in the Depression and the New Deal ; how the American government decided to do something that no government would dream of doing now , which is to employ a lot of artists .
That was such an interesting idea .
It really got things moving in America , and showed people themselves .
YV
During the worst part of the crash , progressive politics and art die .
BE
Yes .
If there arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t any alternatives , there is no reason for having art .
Art is a way of thinking about other possibilities .
Do you want to hear this so you can just get a feeling ?
[ Eno plays a loud and brassy five - minute segment . ]
YV That is very good .
I hope itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s used in a movie .
BE
I suspect it will get used in movies .
This record just has two long pieces on it .
They are both about 25 minutes .
YV Progressive rock !
Like the 1970s .
BE
It wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fit on an LP Ã¢â¬ â
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the only trouble .
The more bass you have , the less you can get on vinyl .
We have to think of vinyl nowadays because everybody is buying vinyl again .
YV IsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
that great ?
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know why I like it , but I do .
Our son , who had never heard vinyl , discovered my old record collection , and now he will only listen to vinyl .
He says it is a more chromatic sound .
I suspect he just likes the whole experience more .
Taking it out of a sleeve , cleaning it , reading the sleeve notes .
He wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t particularly interested in the Greek stuff ; what caught his attention was Led ZeppelinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album covers .
And he was impressed by Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ummagumma cover .
BE
The sleeves were so much more interesting .
And I love cover notes .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m just going to put the kettle on .
[ There follows a conversation that segues from the unpredictability of the market ( something Varoufakis is studying ) to the unpredictability of human drummers ( something Eno is studying ) , taking in the Kondratiev wave cycle and Hegelian regression , and somehow arriving at the replacement of human workers by robots . ]
YV Apple has a factory in the US that employs almost no workers , and the factory itself was built by robots , so the question is , whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to buy the Apple machines ?
The robots wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
Now , how this will pan out is impossible to know .
Maybe the crisis is going to be so ruthless that machinery will become so expensive that human labour will get a temporary reprieve .
That reprieve leads to an increase in wages , which leads to an increase in demand , and so the machines come back again .
At the moment , in the US , a human welder costs $ 25 per hour , including benefits and pensions and stuff , and a mechanical welder about $ 18 per hour .
But if the level of unemployment reaches the level we have , say , in Greece , the price of a human welder might go to $ 15 .
So suddenly the human becomes competitive again .
BE
There is another possibility : basic income .
That is , you give people a certain amount of money , whether they work or not .
So you avoid the crushing poverty of people who have no money and you also stimulate the economy , because when people have money , they buy things .
We always think money should go in at the top and it will trickle down and people will get employed and so on .
But what they tried in Brazil was giving people in favellas about $ 1,000 for sending their children to school .
The result is that people spend that money , and spend it locally , so local shopkeepers benefit , too .
YV Services are going to require a lot fewer people as a result of artificial intelligence , so the call centres and paralegal professions will be replaced by robots who can do the job better .
Turing said if we can communicate with a machine and we canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tell itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a machine , then we can assume that machine is intelligent .
Now the Turing test has been passed , that will destroy hundreds of millions of jobs .
But will the ones created , making this artificial intelligence , be enough to replace the ones lost ?
So far with capitalism , every labour - saving technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed .
The car destroyed jobs for horsemen and stage coach people , but then auto workers and those building the motorways and petrol stations brought more jobs than they destroyed .
For the first time , we are running the risk that technology will destroy a lot more jobs than it creates .
Now , philosophically , whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wrong with machines doing our work for us ?
BE
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re happy to accept that they do a lot already .
YV
But the question is ownership .
With capitalism you have a minority owning the machinery Ã¢â¬ â the means of production , as Marx used to say .
If we continue with this and ownership of the machinery gets even more unequal , then that will create huge problems for capitalism because the demand wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be there .
There wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be enough people earning to buy the stuff that the machines can produce .
The way I try to express my own fear of , and hope for , the future is that we have our choice , which is between Star Trek and The Matrix .
Star Trek is this : weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all sitting around having philosophical conversations like in the ancient Agora in Athens and the slaves are not human .
There are holes in the walls on the Starship Enterprise ; you ask for something and it comes up .
Fantastic .
So then you can explore the universe and talk to Klingons .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one choice
Ã¢â¬ â the utopia .
The dystopia is The Matrix , where the machines are being fed by our own energy .
We are plugged into a false consciousness that the machines have been created to keep us happy .
We think we are leading a perfectly normal life , but all along we are the slaves of the machines .
So these are the two extremes .
And the choice whether we go to Star Trek or The Matrix is ours .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a political choice .
BE Even at the moment there are people , particularly on the west coast of America , who would say we are living in Star Trek , and there are others , like Evgeny Morozov , who would say we are living in The Matrix .
So these utopias and dystopias arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t in the future Ã¢â¬ â
we are actually in one or the other now .
YV I think Evegeny is right .
We are closer to the Matrix than Star Trek .
BE
I think we are as well .
YV
If there are human slaves behind the machine , then it is not Star Trek .
BE
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that thing whereby if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re getting something for free , it probably means you are the product .
People say the internet is wonderful Ã¢â¬ â itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all free .
Actually , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not : youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re the thing thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s being bought and sold .
[ They talk about the politics of video games and why Darwinism canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be applied to the free market . ]
YV
How did your progressive politics blend into the possessive individualism that seemed central to the mindset of the rock scene in the 1970s ?
BE
Well , when I was young I thought of myself as an anarchist ; gradually that position moved to something you might call minarchism Ã¢â¬ â minimum constraint .
I got fascinated by a piece of music by the English composer Cornelius Cardew .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a piece that anybody can do ; you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to be a trained musician .
In fact , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s usually done by a roomful of people Ã¢â¬ â
itÃ¢â¬
â¢ s just voices , and it always sounds pretty much the same .
I thought , Ã¢â¬ÅHow can something have form and be identifiable with so few constraints?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In fact , this is still what preoccupies me .
It was the opposite of what a lot of people were doing in the early 70s , because that was the first period of pomp Ã¢â¬ â suddenly
16-track and 24-track recorders became available , so you could have lots of different instruments playing .
Everything kept inflating , and I was always thinking , Ã¢â¬ÅWhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
the least we can do?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Although [ Roxy Music was ] a six - piece band , quite big , we were concerned not to become pompous and fill every track .
YV
The rock opera ?
BE
Yes , the rock opera , which is arguably what I have just done !
YV
Yes , that sounded very much like an epic rock opera with byzantine elements .
BE Nice to know you can still change direction late in your career !
One of the things that made Roxy interesting was that nobody really agreed with anybody else .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a group of mates who all came from the same background ; it was a group of people who enjoyed the fact that they werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like each other , and had different skills and interests .
I came from a musical background , for instance , quite different from Bryan [ Ferry ] .
Bryan came out of soul ; I came out of experimental music .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t remember a single political conversation we had .
That might have been because we knew it would be catastrophic .
YV Where you were raised ?
In Ipswich ?
BE Just outside it .
You were at the University of East Anglia ?
YV First I was in Colchester , then in Norwich .
I sandwiched Ipswich .
I used to pass through .
BE Best thing to do with Ipswich
, really Ã¢â¬ â pass through .
When I was at art school I used to go out on the streets and sell this anarchist magazine , Freedom .
It was a very good magazine : all text , not a single picture in the whole thing .
It was really tough , rigorous arguments
Ã¢â¬ â some of the best political writing IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve read .
And people were trying to grapple with this fundamental problem : how much freedom is productive and what size groups does it work inÃ¢â¬ Â¦
[ Pause . ]
WeÃ¢â¬
â¢ ve just talked about politics ; what about our kids , wives ?
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got three daughters .
YV I have three children , too : one is biologically mine , and two are from my wifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous marriage .
BE
So my daughter , who is about to become a junior doctor , was at a demonstration yesterday because , as you know , they are cutting the pay of junior doctors , and you know the health minister is called Jeremy Hunt ?
She said there was somebody with a placard saying , Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not a gynaecologist
but I know a Hunt when I see one.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
YV Hahaha Ã¢â¬ â
thatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s excellent .
BE
I was saying to my friend this morning , as we were out walking the dogs , Ã¢â¬ÅIsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t it funny that we have created a system which gives the biggest rewards to the greediest people and the worst rewards to the most generous , the people who work in hospitals?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
YV WasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that always the case ?
We had a glimmer of hope after the war that things could change , but they only changed because of the Soviet scare and the rise of the left .
The moment the left imploded due to its own failures Ã¢â¬ â our own failures , I should say , as a leftist Ã¢â¬ â there was no reason any more .
BE WouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t it be nice if somebody wrote a short essay saying , Ã¢â¬ÅWhat did communism do for us?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I remember Octavio Paz said that communism might have been the wrong answer , but it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the wrong question .
Because we decided the answer was wrong , we thought we didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t need to ask the question about inequality any more .
YV
Yes , I think the dialectic between capitalism and communism is fascinating .
Are you an optimist ?
BE
I am because I think what you believe is what you make happen .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a fundamental aspect of oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life philosophy .
You either believe you stand outside life and watch it , or else you believe youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re engaged and the set of beliefs you take to it forms part of the future .
If you take a set of beliefs that is pessimistic and paranoid and defensive Ã¢â¬ â maybe the set of political beliefs North America now has ,
for example Ã¢â¬ â
then you end up with a different future .
We are constantly writing our future ourselves .
It sounds as if IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m talking about faith , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not Ã¢â¬ â because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m an atheist .
YV I would call myself an atheist too , but I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to be associated with the evangelical atheists who are disrespectful towards theists .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m completely respectful towards people who have faith .
Richard Dawkins is religious in his anti - religion .
BE
Yes , he has become that .
If you love gospel music Ã¢â¬ â as I do Ã¢â¬ â you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t not see the value of a certain type of religious experience .
The fundamental thing that is happening in religion is that people are surrendering .
YV We surrender , too Ã¢â¬ â to optimism .
I have no empirical data that makes me optimistic about the world or human nature .
If I was a pure empiricist all the evidence is that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a very nasty lot , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not allowing that to come in the way of my faith , which is in humanity .
So IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m completely optimistic through my heart , and I do not allow my brain to rule over my heart .
BE
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an act of faith that creates its reality .
YV We have faith ; we just donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have faith in a divinity .
BE
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interesting to see everybodyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reactions to Paris .
It is not completely kitsch and sentimental that when something like this happens everybody else says , Ã¢â¬ÅWe donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t agree with this : this isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
us.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
People donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t ignore it .
It will be worrying when people start ignoring it , and just carry on with life as normal .
And I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think it has created the simplistic characterisations of anti - Islamism .
YV No ,
but it does add impetus to closing down borders and re - erecting barriers , and that worries me .
But you were saying optimism is almost like religion
Ã¢â¬ â
it is a faith .
So you can look at what happened in Paris and empirically deduce that the world is going to be a very bleak place , or you can choose to be optimistic about it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an activist optimism .
These people are prepared to sacrifice their lives in order to close minds and close borders and erect barriers ; the great question for us on the receiving end is , Ã¢â¬ÅAre we prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to keep the borders open , and to open minds instead of closing them down?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ BE
I read an interesting book by [ the anthropologist ]
Scott Atran called Talking To The Enemy .
He spoke to a lot of jihadis , and tried to decide what their moral compass was .
And he said they almost all agree the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely immoral .
So they are not amoral , which is interesting .
One of the people Atran quoted said , Ã¢â¬ÅBut they were just innocent people!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢
s interesting that he would have that mindset that they were innocent , but the ones they killed were not .
YV Look , I hate to do this , but I try to get into their heads .
If you look at the bare facts of the last two months it is tit - for - tat .
That is how they see it .
So the Russian air force bomb Syria ; they bomb a Russian plane off Sharm el - Sheikh .
The French air force bombs Syria ; they do what they do in Paris .
The Hezbollah people join Assad against them ; they bomb Beirut .
For them , this is what war is about .
And we have to learn to see this , because if we think that a stray US air force bomb killing 150 people in Syria is acceptable collateral damage but we go crazy about Paris , then our moral compass is problematic .

Ã¢â¬Â¢ Introduction by Simon Hattenstone .
This conversation has been edited for length ."
2015-12-08,"Not many off - Broadway musicals sell out in minutes , but then not many of them feature new David Bowie songs , and combine the talents of playwright Enda Walsh , director Ivo van Hove and actor Michael C Hall .
Lazarus , which opened at New York Theatre Workshop on Monday 7 December , is a sequel to The Man
Who Fell to Earth , Nic RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1976 film ( based on a Walter Tevis novel ) , in which Bowie played an alien seeking water for his planet .
Hall takes the role of the starman in this world premiere , which was co - written by Bowie .
HereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what the critics made of it .
Alexis Soloski , the Guardian
It will be many years before we see a jukebox musical as unapologetically weird as Lazarus , an almost incomprehensible and oddly intriguing new play
[ Ã¢â¬ Â¦ ]
At moments apposite or otherwise , the band strike up a Bowie song , familiar , obscure or brand new .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a synthpop version of The Man Who Sold the World , an anguished take on Changes , a prettily stripped down Heroes .
These are inarguably marvellous songs , but few of them are integrated into the script , which can give the play the feeling of a downbeat and occasionally alarming karaoke party .
David Rooney , the Hollywood Reporter
The extremely loose narrative jumps off from TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ book and RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film in expanded directions .
To the extent that the hallucinatory series of scenes can be boiled down ( or that I understood them ) , the story centers on Thomas Jerome Newton ( Hall ) , a humanoid alien who came to Earth from his drought - stricken planet many years earlier .
After amassing a fortune in business while attempting to build a rocket ship to take him home , he was experimented on by the government and now lives in depressed isolation on a diet of gin , Twinkies and jarring bursts of blaring television , unable to leave or to die .
Ben Brantley , the New York Times Ice - cold bolts of ecstasy shoot like novas through the glamorous muddle and murk of Lazarus , the great - sounding , great - looking and mind - numbing new musical built around songs by David Bowie .
These transfixing moments occur when Mr Bowie feels most palpably present Ã¢â¬ â that is , when one of the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s carefully stylized performers delivers a distinctly Bowie number in a distinctly Bowie style .
Kory Grow , Rolling Stone People splash through milk .
Others pop dozens of balloons .
Strange women sniff othersÃ¢â¬ â¢ lingerie ( frequently ) .
Impromptu kabuki actors invade the stage .
And through it all , Newton Ã¢â¬ â played by golden - throated Michael C Hall , who is best known for his roles on Dexter and Six Feet Under but whose theatrical credits include big roles in Hedwig and the Angry Inch , Cabaret and Chicago Ã¢â¬ â mostly remains stoic , lonely , yearning .
At its core , Lazarus is a two - hour meditation on grief and lost hope ( with no intermission ) , but it takes so many wild , fantastical , eye - popping turns that it never drags .
Jeremy Gerard , Deadline Having now seen Lazarus and read the script and revisited The Man Who Fell to Earth , I can confidently report that David Bowie has landed on East Fourth Street with a work of blistering nihilism , no small sum of inscrutable foolishness and a fistful of the most brilliant contemporary rock you will hear anywhere .
I can also say with some certainty that director Ivo van Hove Ã¢â¬ â the Belgian - born director who seems to be falling to EarthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theaters everywhere at once these days
Ã¢â¬ â has a rich imagination ideal for this wild ride .
David Cote , Time Out New York
If I got any of [ the plot ] wrong , complain to the creators , who donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make Lazarus easy to follow .
That the piece unfolds in dream logic , or as a fever dream , is fairly obvious in the first 10 minutes , so best to let it wash over you without worrying about sequence or connections .
Such detachment is easy to achieve Ã¢â¬ â even thrilling Ã¢â¬ â when Milioti warbles Changes with such seething , repressed intensity , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like hearing that glorious anthem for the first time ."
2015-12-08,"It will be many years before we see a jukebox musical as unapologetically weird as Lazarus , an almost incomprehensible and oddly intriguing new play with songs by David Bowie , directed by Ivo van Hove .
The script , by Bowie and Enda Walsh , is based on the The Man Who Fell to Earth , a science fiction by novel Walter Tevis that was later filmed by Nicolas Roeg and starred Bowie as the titular alien Ã¢â¬ â a starman seeking water for his drought - ridden planet or attempting to insinuate his fellow extraterrestrials into US society , depending on which version you prefer .
In both he fails and remains stranded on earth .
Few of these finer points matter in Lazarus , which finds Newton , now played by Michael C Hall ( who can sound remarkably like Bowie when he wishes ) , wearing taupe pyjamas and dulling the pain of his exile with gin and Twinkies .
Elly ( Cristin Milioti ) , newly hired as his assistant , describes him to her husband as Ã¢â¬Åsorta sad Ã¢â¬ â sorta unknowable in the way that you imagine reclusive rich eccentric men to beÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Newton portrays himself more starkly .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a dying man who canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t die , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
The first few scenes , which play out on a beige stage , designed by van HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld , with a band sequestered behind plexiglass in the back , are straightforward enough .
They occur in observable reality and in NewtonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own tortured psyche .
But soon an angelic girl ( Sophia Anne Caruso ) arrives , followed by a sinister figure called Valentine ( Michael Esper ) , after which good luck to anyone who can follow the plot or alternate realities in which it may or may not take place .
Characters who seem important are offed or sidelined , themes rear and then disappear .
For a long portion in the middle , the script abandons Newton almost entirely and , hey , is that Alan Cumming on video ?
( It is . )
At moments apposite or otherwise , the band strike up a Bowie song , familiar , obscure or brand new .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a synthpop version of The Man Who Sold the World , an anguished take on Changes , a prettily stripped down Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
These are inarguably marvellous songs , but few of them are integrated into the script , which can give the play the feeling of a downbeat and occasionally alarming karaoke party .
Songs that would seem to be relevant , such as Starman or RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Suicide , are ignored in favour of All the Young Dudes and This Is Not America .
This should be a terrible show .
It seems unlikely that it is what its collaborators imagined , and what they have created makes perilously little sense .
But those collaborators are so extravagantly talented and the performers undertake whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s asked of them Ã¢â¬ â writhing lasciviously against a refrigerator , slipping and sliding in a pool of milk , popping dozens of black balloons Ã¢â¬ â with such dedication and verve that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nearly impossible not to be persuaded and baffled and at least a little thrilled ."
2015-12-10,"The first in a series of David Bowie box sets passes over his fascinating false starts of the 60s and begins with his eponymous second album , later retitled Space Oddity .
The rest of Five Years consists of everything Bowie released during the trailblazing Mick Ronson era .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wonderful : from the proto - glam The Man
Who Sold the World to the underrated covers album PinUps , via the classic Hunky Dory , the breakthrough Ziggy Stardust and Ã¢â¬ÅZiggy goes to AmericaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Aladdin Sane .
There are also two enthralling live albums that bookend the Ziggy period : Live Santa Monica 72 , long considered a must - have Bowie bootleg ; and Ziggy Stardust :
The Motion Picture Soundtrack , in which Bowie tells a shocked Hammersmith Odeon ( not least a dumbfounded Spiders from Mars ) itÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
Ã¢â¬Åthe last show weÃ¢â¬ â¢
ll ever doÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In the absence of a comprehensive collection of unreleased Bowie material like DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bootleg Series or the BeatlesÃ¢â¬ â¢ Anthologies , we have two discs of quasi - rarities , including Holy Holy , a flop single from 1971 that has never been released since ."
2015-12-18,"Next month , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 25th album arrives in a manner not unlike that of his 2013 comeback , The Next Day .
Like Where Are We Now ? , the single that announced BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s re - entry into the recording world , Blackstar is released on his birthday , 8 January .
As with The Next Day , a degree of secrecy has surrounded the project Ã¢â¬ â in October , a British newspaper story professing to reveal details about the album was tetchily dismissed as Ã¢â¬Åinaccurate reportingÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Facebook page Ã¢â¬
â and
Bowie himself seems happy to remain at a considerable remove from his own album release .
The promotional interviews have once more been handled by his longstanding producer , Tony Visconti , sleeve designer Jonathan Barnbrook and one of the supporting musicians , Donny McCaslin , the New York - based saxophonist who appeared on the 2014 single Sue
( Or in a Season of Crime ) and whose electro - acoustic quartet Ã¢â¬ â best known for covering tracks by electronica artists Boards of Canada and Aphex Twin Ã¢â¬
â makes up the core of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Blackstar backing band .
This time , Bowie doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even appear on his own album sleeve Ã¢â¬ â a career first .
You can see why Bowie might want to replicate the release of The Next Day .
The sudden , unheralded appearance of
Where Are They Now ?
might well have been the single most innovative thing about the album , and certainly proved the most influential : everyone from BeyoncÃ Â© to U2 subsequently attempted to mimic it , with varying degrees of success .
Equally , you can understand why thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s noticeably less secrecy about this album than its predecessor : Bowie himself hinted at its appearance in two statements last year , while its making has been the subject of lengthy cover stories in two UK rock magazines .
Both features emphasise the projectÃ¢â¬ â¢ s leftfield nature ( as , in fact , did that story dismissed for its inaccurate reporting ) : the message that Blackstar is made of different and far more experimental stuff to its predecessor is clearly one that Bowie is keen to get across , albeit from a distance .
To that end , the album has been trailed by its three least commercial tracks , which in addition make up the bulk of its first half .
Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) offered pained vocals and skronking jazz over a rhythm based on an obscure late-1990s drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass track that may well have piqued BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interest because it was by Plastic Soul , the name he gave to the sound of 1975Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Young Americans .
The version on Blackstar is noticeably less heavy - going than the single , its performance more streamlined and guitar heavy .
Its B - side , Ã¢â¬ â¢
Tis A Pity She Was a Whore , has also undergone a substantial revamp , although in the opposite direction the rerecording features the pummelling , hugely impressive sound of McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quartet playing at full pelt .
The episodic , 10-minute title track , meanwhile , is alternately gorgeous , disturbing and utterly confounding Ã¢â¬ â although one interpretation of its meaning has been suggested by McCaslin , who claimed it was inspired by the rise of Isis , though BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spokesperson has denied that interpretation .
Nevertheless , it would certainly fit the Arabic drones that open the track , the talk of executions in the lyrics and the trackÃ¢â¬ â¢
s intermittent sense of dread :
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility that the blackstar of the lyrics is Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , Ã¢â¬Åtreading on sacred groundÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by announcing a worldwide caliphate .
Whatever the song is about , the fact that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clustered together with Sue and Ã¢â¬ â¢ Tis Pity
She Was a Whore at the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s beginning Ã¢â¬ â broken up by the more conventional , emotive Lazarus Ã¢â¬ â sends out the same message to the listener as the one imparted in interviews by Visconti .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is fresh .
This came from a different space , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he has said .
Ã¢â¬Å[On The Next Day
] definitely we did reference older things when we werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sure Ã¢â¬ Â¦
The Next Day started out trying to do something new , but something old kept creeping in .
Not this album .
David on purpose used Donny so that wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t happen.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The rest of Blackstar isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t as challenging as that Ã¢â¬ â the ballad Dollar Days is just limpidly beautiful Ã¢â¬ â but on first listen , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s certainly far less immersed in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s past than The Next Day , which from its cover to its lyrics kept alluding to the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s history , as if part of his preparation for re - emergence involved reminding himself of the artist he had once been .
Nevertheless , ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s assertion that nothing on Blackstar recalls BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite right .
The lyrics that appear over the robotic rhythm track of Girl Loves Me are packed with Nadsat , the slang Anthony Burgess invented in 1962 for A Clockwork Orange , an abiding obsession of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in the Ziggy Stardust era
( Visconti has also suggested theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re inspired by Polari , the slang language used in gay subcultures with which Bowie peppered his interviews in the early 1970s ) .
More obviously , the introduction to I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Give Everything Away offers a direct musical lift from A New Career in a New Town , the instrumental that closed the first side of 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Low with a burst of breezy optimism and forward motion at odds with the gloom and paranoia elsewhere on that album .
Whether itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s there to link Blackstar with the experimentation of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s lauded Berlin Trilogy or to suggest that Bowie sees himself pressing on into the unknown is an intriguing question , one which the title and lyrics suggest isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to get a straight answer any time soon .
Ã¢â¬ÅSaying no but meaning yes , that is all I ever meant , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the message that I sent , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he sings , sounding rather proud of how unknowable heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s become , at the end of an album that counts as unexpected left turn , executed with enviable aplomb , that only deepens the mystery further .
This article was amended on 18 December 2015 to include David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spokespersonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s denial that Blackstar was inspired by the rise of Isis ."
2016-01-07,"As he reaches his 69th birthday , David Bowie finds himself in a rarefied position , even by the standards of the rock aristocracy .
He does not give interviews , make himself available to promote new releases , or explain himself in any way .
He does not tour the world playing his hits .
In fact , he doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do anything that rock stars are supposed to do .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s behaviour that theoretically means a one - way ticket to oblivion , with no one but diehard fans for company .
But since his re - emergence from a decade - long sabbatical with 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Next Day , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s proved a quite astonishing recipe for success .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s scant public pronouncements are treated as hugely significant .
His releases are pored over in a way they havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been since the days when his army of devotees would turn up at Victoria station to greet him off the boat train , a state of affairs abetted by the fact that , since his return , Bowie has reverted to writing the kind of elusive , elliptical lyrics that were once his stock in trade .
Dense with mysterious references , the words on The Next Day and its follow - up alike have far more in common with the impenetrable mass of signifiers that made up Station to StationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title track than , say , the Dad - misses - you - write - soon message to his adult son of 2002Ã¢â¬ â¢
s
Everyone Says Hi .
His 25th studio album concludes with I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Give Everything Away , which seems to offer those attempting to unravel his lyrics a wry Ã¢â¬Åbest of luck with thatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( Ã¢â¬ÅSaying no but meaning yes , this is all I ever meant , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the message that I sentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) while loudly trumpeting his own carefully maintained mystique .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t give everything , I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t give everything away , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sings , over and over .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a beautiful , elegant song borne on clouds of synthesiser and decorated with a scrawly guitar solo , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to avoid the suspicion that its lyrical admonishments arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to make much difference : the bits of Blackstar that emerged in advance of the album have already been thoroughly examined for meaning .
The most compelling interpretation Ã¢â¬ â bolstered by a remark made by Donny McCaslin , the New York jazz musician whose electro - acoustic trio forms the core of the backing band on Blackstar Ã¢â¬
â is that the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opening title track is BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s response to the rise of Isis .
It seemed plausible : Bowie has always been fascinated both by messianic dictators Ã¢â¬ â not least the relationship of their power to that of celebrity Ã¢â¬ â and by the idea that the world is facing a future so terrifying that the thought of it , as he once put it , makes your brain hurt a lot .
The theory was subsequently denied by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spokesperson , which seems a shame : thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a pleasing circularity to the idea of a muse that burst into life amid what the writer Francis Wheen called the Ã¢â¬Åcollective nervous breakdownÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the 1970s , apparently sparking up again amid the collective nervous breakdown of the present day .
But aside from Abu Bakr al - BaghdadiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s supposed elevation to the pantheon of Bowie bogeymen Ã¢â¬ â thence to swap tips on global domination with Big Brother , President Joe and his murderous Saviour Machine , and the cannibalistic Hungry Men off BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s debut album Ã¢â¬ â and the reappearance of Thomas Newton , antihero of The Man
Who Fell to Earth , amid the alternately gorgeous and unsettling drift of Lazarus ,
Blackstar frequently sounds like a slate - cleaning break with the past .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue is peppered with jazz - influenced moments Ã¢â¬ â from his 1965 attempt to mimic Georgie Fame , Take My Tip , to Mike GarsonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s improvised piano playing on the title track of Aladdin Sane , to his duet with Art Ensemble of Chicago founder Lester Bowie on the Black Tie White Noise track Looking for Lester .
But BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s enthusiastic embrace of the genre feels as if it has less in common with his previous jazz dabblings than it does his headlong plunge into contemporary soul on Young Americans : designed as a decisive , wilful shift away from the past .
Just as it seems highly unlikely that anyone who heard Diamond Dogs in 1974 could have predicted that , within a year , its author would be starring on AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s premier black music show , Soul Train , so it seems fairly safe to say that no one who enjoyed the relatively straightforward rock music of The Next Day thought its follow - up would sound like this .
More striking still is the synergy between Bowie and the musicians on Blackstar .
You can hear it in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s whoop as McCaslin solos amid the sonic commotion of Ã¢â¬ â¢ Tis Pity
She Was a Whore .
He sounds delighted at the racket theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re creating , and understandably so .
Simultaneously wilfully synthetic and squirmingly alive , it has the same thrilling sense of exploratory , barely contained chaos found on Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ or Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , or in the tumultuous , wildly distorted version of the Spiders from Mars that rampaged through Panic in Detroit and Cracked Actor .
Better still , it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
actually sound anything like those records .
And you can hear it by comparing the album version of Sue ( or in the Season of Crime ) with the single released in 2014 .
The earlier version felt like a statement rather than a song ; a series of ideas ( drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass - inspired rhythm , Maria SchneiderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s high - minded , uncommercial big - band jazz , a fragmentary lyric ) thrown together to let the world know that Bowie wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t done with being avant - garde yet .
It did that job pretty well , but never became a satisfying whole .
On Blackstar , however , everything coalesces .
The rhythm is sample - based and punchier , the agitated bass riff distorted and driving , the seasick brass and woodwind arrangement is replaced by sprays of echoing feedback , electronic noise and sax .
It sounds like a band , rather than Bowie grafting himself on to someone elseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical vision .
Over the years , rock has frequently reduced experimental jazz to a kind of dilettantish signifier : few things say Ã¢â¬ÅI consider myself to be a very important artist unleashing a challenging musical statement , I demand you take me
seriouslyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ quite like a burst of skronking free brass dropped in the middle of a track .
But Blackstar never feels like that .
Nor does it feel like itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s trying too hard , an accusation that could have been leveled at the drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass puttering of 1997Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Earthling .
Blackstar lacks the kind of killer pop single
Bowie would once invariably come up with amid even his most experimental works Ã¢â¬ â a Sound and Vision , a Heroes , a Golden Years Ã¢â¬ â but only Girl Loves Me feels like a slog : lots of Clockwork Orange Nadsat and a smattering of Polari in the incomprehensible lyrics , thuddingly propulsive drums , no tune .
Instead , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re struck by the sense of Bowie at his most commanding , twisting a genre to suit his own ends .
Dollar Days might be the most straightforwardly beautiful thing here , a lambent ballad that doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound jazz influenced at all .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lent a curious , slippery uncertainty at odds with the bullish lyrical pronouncements ( Ã¢â¬ÅIf I never see the English evergreens IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m running to , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nothing to meÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) by Mark GuilianaÃ¢â¬ â¢
s drumming , the emphasis never quite landing where rock - trained ears might expect it to .
The overall effect is ambiguous and spellbinding , adjectives that apply virtually throughout Blackstar .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a rich , deep and strange album that feels like Bowie moving restlessly forward , his eyes fixed ahead : the position in which heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s always made his greatest music .

2016-01-07,"At the risk of doing his earnest artistry a disservice : Hooray !
Button - Eyed Bandage Boy Bowie is back !
In his new video for Lazarus Ã¢â¬ â a track which shares its name with his recent off - Broadway musical Ã¢â¬ â the musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s disconcerting new guise returns , his eyes blinded by bandages and buttons .
Unlike Blackstar Ã¢â¬ â a sprawling 10-minute mini - epic which presented the musician in full , surreal , dream logic stride Ã¢â¬ â this new video has a relatively more simplistic storyline , with Bowie trapped amid a fraught , feverish nightmare .
Shrouded in darkness , his frail figure steps out of a closet and is faced with cold hospital - like confines .
Imagine Narnia via Nosferatu and the Exorcist , a video made even more cinematically claustrophobic by the frameÃ¢â¬ â¢ s tight , concentrated dimension .
Johan Renck , who directed both videos , had the following to say about their collaboration : One could only dream about collaborating with a mind like that ; let alone twice .
Intuitive , playful , mysterious and profound ...
I have no desire to do any more videos knowing the process never ever gets as formidable and fulfilling as this was .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve basically touched the sun .
Take a look at the video and let us know what you think of it ."
2016-01-07,"ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s easy to remember the moment that changed me .
It was listening to Hunky Dory for the first time , shortly after 6 pm on Wednesday 27 March 1996 .
Until then , my life had been somewhat disparate and rootless .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know who on earth I was , and it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t good .
After listening to Bowie , my life was still somewhat disparate and rootless
and I still didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know who on earth I was , and it was great .
I immediately became a pretty scarily obsessive Bowie fan and , 20 years later , I still am .
But thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not the most interesting change for me .
The real change was the realisation that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OK to be something of a mess .
My life hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been especially difficult , but its elements had been wildly diverse .
My family life was undoubtedly privileged , and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d go on lovely holidays , and my Highgate - dwelling grandpa would take me for tea at the Athenaeum and to West End shows ; but I spent my formative years living on a deprived council estate in Swindon , where vandalism and violence were never far away , where glue - sniffers stalked the streets , where my primary school classmates indulged in solvent abuse and sex .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really Ã¢â¬ÅfromÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ anywhere , either Ã¢â¬ â I was born in Peterborough but left when I was two .
Moving to an impoverished former mining area in north Derbyshire when I was 11 magnified my sense of isolation and alienation .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t especially unhappy as adolescents go , but I had no idea
what or who I was .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t one of those self - assured Ã¢â¬Åwhat - you - see - is - what - you - getÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ types who seem so prevalent growing up , so I thought there must be something wrong with me .
But IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been aware for years of the power of music , which had sustained me through many difficult nights and weeks , and had often raided a collection of tapes belonging to my brother , eight years my senior .
I was also dimly aware of David Bowie : as a child growing up in the 1980s , I had obviously seen Labyrinth .
So I randomly grabbed a Bowie album called Hunky Dory , put it in my tape player , donned my headphones and changed my life .
Here was music that celebrated uncertainty , rootlessness , inner chaos , difference , otherness , doubt , impermanence .
And it did so with beauty , style and charisma .
I was hooked by the first line : Ã¢â¬ÅStill donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know what I was waiting
forÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
By the time I got to Ã¢â¬ÅDonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe in yourself , donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t deceive with beliefÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , I was essentially a different person .
I just got what the whole thing was about : youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a hundred things at once ?
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great !
Life neednÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be either / or - it can be both / and .
In the space of a few minutes , I learned that being mercurial and fluid and unexpected didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t mean you were gauche or vague or pallid
Ã¢â¬ â
they meant you were like David Bowie , which I immediately understood was the best thing you could possibly be .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OK , he seemed to say .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OK .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re fine .
David Bowie has a new album out on Friday .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s still doing what he does , 20 years after I discovered him and 50 years after he started doing it .
While I feel no pressing need to be an evangelist for my actual religion , I could well imagine myself standing on street corners and proclaiming the good news of David Bowie .
As society fragments , as jobs - for - life disappear , as our communities become more diverse , as more of the world is available to us instantly , his is surely the way we should follow .
Yes , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll get things terribly wrong , but that wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be the end of us .
Mistakes ?
Make Ã¢â¬ â¢ em ( providing the only person you hurt is you ) .
Life is bigger than most of us will ever know ; David Bowie is all those words made flesh .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d love to say that my life since 27 March 1996 has been a series of creative , artistic and physical risks .
It really hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
Indeed , there are some things I havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t done as a result of that fateful listen that I otherwise might have : I might have striven for a particular identity with which to label myself , I might have tried to hide some parts of who I am or exaggerate others .
I might still be espousing the bizarrely reactionary beliefs I had previously held ( which wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be pretty ) .
But there are many things that I have done that I otherwise might not have : met a whole load of great people ( including my first girlfriend ) ; left a steady job to pursue what I believed was a sort of spiritual vocation ; formed , left and reformed an electro - punk - cabaret band ( EP out this year , folks ) ; met David Bowie ( which was brief and terrifying Ã¢â¬ â

2016-01-08,"There was much snarky amusement a few years back when plans were unveiled to transform Croydon , south LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s grey , unloved sub - suburban satellite town , into Ã¢â¬Åthe new BarcelonaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Under a new municipal scheme a region described by David Bowie as Ã¢â¬Åeverything I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want in my life , everything I wanted to get away
fromÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ would be transported from a deep - concrete nightmare of tower blocks and strangulating traffic into an uplifting place crammed with boulevards , glass towers , Ã¢â¬Åsky gardensÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and actual nice bits .
In fairness Barcelona is still probably just about shading it for now .
But something is happening in Croydon .
For a start itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s producing professional footballers , and lots of them .
Twenty years ago Harry Pearson wrote a brilliant book called The Far Corner , a love letter to football in the north - east , which was still very much the Ã¢â¬Åhot - bedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the domestic game .
England had just reached the World Cup semi - finals with four north - east players in the team .
Bob Paisley and Brian Clough had won more European Cups than Germany .
The idea of a frothingly ambitious manager willingly moving from Newcastle to Crystal Palace really wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have made much sense at all .
How times change .
Anyone attempting a similar anatomy of English footballÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most productive centre a few years from now may find themselves looking south .
In fact it might be worth starting with a 10 mile square of suburban south - east London bordered by the Barcelona of the A23 at its south - western edge , with Orpington , Woolwich and Lambeth the other three corners .
Because right now this seems to be where itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at .
On Saturday Crystal Palace , a club at the estuary between the rich waters of Croydon and south - east London , will play Southampton in the FA Cup .
It is a meeting of arguably the two most locally centred squads in the Premier League , a fixture that could see as many as four players on each team either born , raised or schooled within a few miles of their current club .
If the success of SouthamptonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s academy has been well rehearsed the emergence of south London as the breadbasket of the Premier League is less celebrated .
This is hardly one of the traditional football heartlands .
In the past century south of the Thames has burped up the odd England player of note , from Vivian Woodward of Kennington to Rio Ferdinand of Peckham .
But the industrial north , Merseyside , Essex and the East End have been the real production powerhouses .
Until now .
Currently 14 % of English footballers in the Premier League are from that 10 mile golden square of south London .
The borough of Croydon alone Ã¢â¬ â home to 0.6 % of the population Ã¢â¬ â has produced 5 % of all active English Premier League players , among them Wilfried Zaha , Victor Moses and Lewis Grabban from Palace and more disparately Jamal Blackman of Chelsea and Jason Puncheon and Kieran Gibbs via the original Wimbledon .
It is a rich seam that stretches up from the West Croydon basin , through the Surrey canal to the docks at Rotherhithe and then east along the river .
With benefits for all too .
LiverpoolÃ¢â¬ â¢ s transfer committee may have been a clearing house for the lost and confused in recent years .
But in Nathaniel Clyne , Joe Gomez and Jordon Ibe ( Brixton , Greenwich , Bermondsey )
they have hauled in probably the best of young London .
With more to come too .
Even now should the London - Croydon nexus declare national independence a current XI of Blackman , Clyne , Gomez , Chris Smalling , Ryan Bertrand , Puncheon , Ruben Loftus - Cheek , Ben Watson , Ibe , Moses and Zaha could probably make it to the next Euros .
All hail the concrete Catalonia !
There are some simple explanations for this .
Suburban south London is a large , prosperous catchment area these days .
A school with a little sport left in it , a supportive parent with a car and money for subs : this is the most common route now into an academy - led system that increasingly throws up players from distant suburban areas .
Plus , when it comes to south - east London it is inevitable that race will come in too , if only because pretty much every one of the golden squareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s young Premier League players is black or mixed race , part of LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s familiar story of immigrants , children of immigrants , children of children of immigrants .
Whether you celebrate the idea of a cultural melting pot or choose to live in an imaginary 1920s of your own devising , this is surely a sign of something going right somewhere .
I played as a kid in the south London leagues and it must be said it was a pretty racist and disorderly place at times .
Read Ian WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first autobiography and there are enough incidental details about how hard it was getting on back then in south London , how brutal footballÃ¢â¬ â¢ s environment could be .
Things have changed .
Football may have its problems , but it does have more progressive , inclusive , productive structures .
Just look at some of the kids itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s churning out now .
Ibe , Gomez and Clyne : these are some pretty mature , admirable , well - formed young men .
Treat them right and Liverpool have a sound south London core there for the next decade or so .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re welcome !
Plus of course power and wealth in English football is increasingly clustered in the south .
LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s riches and huge population , the clumping together in one short urban radius of talent , scouts , travel links , overseas investors , hope , opportunity : this all feeds and nourishes itself .
Manchester and Liverpool have prospered for the same reasons as London : overseas money and a resonant name .
But the great , clanking corrugated theatres of English football over the last century Ã¢â¬ â Elland Road , Hillsborough , the City Ground Ã¢â¬ â are now strictly localised points of interest .
Meanwhile London continues to whirl and churn , a great chomping set of jaws flecking everybody around it with a rich spittle of crumbs and leftovers .
West Ham are currently freewheeling into a brand new stadium built with ÃÂ£600 m of public money .
Tottenham , like Arsenal , can borrow and build , in part because London will always provide .
QPR , Charlton and Fulham seem to have found the wrong kind of egotistical billionaire but never mind .
When youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a Londoner salvation is only ever an ambitious sovereign wealth fund away .
For Palace , burning through the current TV money but more or less assured of a more profitable future , an imminent US - led redevelopment may bring something else , perhaps a more remote , more corporate club .
But not before south LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s golden square , the Barcelona of the Brighton Road , has had its day ."
2016-01-11,"Until the last , David Bowie , who has died of cancer , was still capable of springing surprises .
His latest album , Blackstar , appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 January , and showed that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging , disturbing music had not deserted him .
Throughout the 1970s , Bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion .
Having been a late-60s mime and cabaret entertainer , he evolved into a singer - songwriter , and a pioneer of glam - rock , then veered into what he called Ã¢â¬Åplastic soulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , before moving to Berlin to create innovative electronic music .
In subsequent decades his influence became less pervasive , but he remained creatively restless and constantly innovative across a variety of media .
His capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history .
Blackstar was proof that this curiosity had not diminished in his later career .
Bowie was born David Robert Jones in Brixton , south London .
His mother , Peggy , had met his father , John , after he was demobilised from second world war service in the Royal Fusiliers .
John subsequently worked for the BarnardoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s childrenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s charity .
They married in September 1947 , eight months after DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s birth , when JohnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s divorce from his first wife , Hilda , became absolute .
In 1953 the family moved to Bromley , Kent , where David attended Burnt Ash junior school and showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder .
Later , after he passed his 11-plus exam , he turned down a place at a grammar school and went to Bromley technical high school and studied art , music and design .
His half - brother , Terry Burns , nearly a decade older than David , introduced him to jazz musicians , such as John Coltrane and Miles Davis , and in 1961 DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
mother bought him a plastic saxophone , introducing him to an instrument that would become a recurring ingredient in his music .
After a 1962 schoolyard punch - up , the pupil in DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s left eye remained permanently dilated , having the serendipitous effect of lending him a vaguely unearthly appearance ( the thrower of the punch , George Underwood , remained a close friend and later designed BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album artwork ) .
At 15 , David formed his first band , the Kon - rads , a primitive rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll combo that contained a fluctuating number of members , including Underwood .
He quickly became disillusioned with his bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lack of ambition and quit to form a new outfit , the blues - influenced King Bees .
They released a single called Liza Jane , but when it disappeared without trace , David jumped ship again and joined the Manish Boys .
Named after a Muddy Waters track , they too were blues - orientated .
Their single I Pity
the Fool proved no more chart - friendly than Liza Jane had done , after which the restless Davy Jones was on the move once more .
His next port of call was the Lower Third , an R&amp;B band from Margate , Kent .
The group thought they were auditioning for a singer and equal member , but once they had hired David , they were taken aback when he issued a press statement saying : Ã¢â¬ÅThis is to inform you of the existence of Davie [ sic ] Jones and the Lower Third.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Moreover , David , abetted by his new manager Ralph Horton , a former tour manager for the Moody Blues , decreed that the band should be decked out in fashionable mod attire , in emulation of the Who .
Fellow members of the Lower Third could not help noticing DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s flamboyant , even effeminate performing style .
They released a Jones - penned single , the aptly named YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve Got a Habit of Leaving , but despite receiving a handful of radio plays , it failed to chart .
It was clear that DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo , and Horton provoked a split with the Lower Third by announcing that there was not enough money to pay their fees .
David now adopted the name Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees , and put together a new group via an advertisement in Melody Maker , specifying that he wanted musicians Ã¢â¬Åto accompany a singerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The new band was named the Buzz .
He dropped Horton after a botched music publishing deal , and in his place hired Ken Pitt , a far more substantial figure who had had success with Mel TormÃ Â© and Manfred Mann .
Pitt secured an album deal for Bowie with DeccaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Deram label , which resulted in an LP entitled simply David Bowie , released in June 1967 .
It was preceded by the novelty single The Laughing Gnome , a flop at the time but a top 10 hit when reissued in 1973 .
Bowie later said of his debut album :
Ã¢â¬ÅI didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know if I was Max Miller or Elvis Presley.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But within its disjointed mix of styles , it found Bowie reflecting on issues such as childhood , sexual ambiguity and the nature of stardom .
By the time the album was released , Bowie had already got rid of the Buzz , again citing lack of money .
For a time he studied theatre and mime with the dancer Lindsay Kemp , and in 1969 he started a folk club at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham , Kent .
This developed into the Beckenham Arts Lab , and a variety of future stars , including Peter Frampton , Steve Harley , Rick Wakeman and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s future producer Tony Visconti , performed there .
In July 1969
Bowie released Space Oddity , the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough .
Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing , it was a top five UK hit .
The accompanying album was originally called Man of Words / Man of Music , but was later reissued as Space Oddity .
The following year was a momentous one for Bowie .
His brother Terry was committed to a psychiatric institution ( and would kill himself in 1985 ) , and his father died .
In March , Bowie married Angela Barnett , an art student .
He dumped Pitt and recruited the driven and aggressive Tony DeFries , prompting Pitt to sue successfully for compensation .
Artistically , Bowie was powering ahead .
The Man Who Sold the World was released in the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year under BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new deal with RCA Victor , and with its daring songwriting and broody , hard - rock sound , it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts .
The title track remains one of his most atmospheric compositions , and songs such as All the Madmen and The Width of a Circle were formidably inventive and accomplished .
The albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
themes included immortality , insanity , murder and mysticism , evidence that Bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s usual boundaries .
The Man Who Sold the World was significant in other ways too .
Its producer , Visconti , became a long - term ally , and in the guitarist Mick Ronson and the drummer Woody Woodmansey , Bowie had found the core of what would become the Spiders from Mars .
The UK cover pictured Bowie lounging in a long dress and bearing a striking resemblance to Lauren Bacall , playing on the theme of sexual ambiguity that he would exploit so successfully .
He followed it with Hunky Dory ( 1972 ) , a mix of wordy , elaborate songwriting ( The Bewlay Brothers or Quicksand ) , crunchy rockers ( Queen Bitch ) and infectious pop songs ( Kooks ) .
It was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success , but that all changed with The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars later that year .
This time , Bowie emerged as a fully fledged science - fiction character Ã¢â¬ â an intergalactic glam - rock star visiting a doomed planet Earth Ã¢â¬ â and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom .
The hit single Starman brought instant success for the album , while BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ravishing stage costumes and sexually provocative performances ( following his carefully timed claim in a Melody Maker interview that he was gay ) triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since Beatlemania .
Seeing Bowie perform as Ziggy on Top of the Pops was a life - changing experience for a generation of pop listeners in glum 70s Britain .
Everything Bowie touched turned to gold , such as his song All the Young Dudes which provided a career - reviving hit for Mott the Hoople , or Lou
ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album Transformer , which he co - produced with Ronson .
He scored his first UK
No 1 album with Aladdin Sane ( 1973 ) , which generated the hit singles The Jean Genie and Drive - in Saturday .
But Bowie was already planning fresh career moves , and in July 1973 he shocked his audience at the Hammersmith Odeon by announcing the retirement of Ziggy Stardust .
He made Pin Ups , a transitional album of cover versions , before embarking on the sinister concept album Diamond Dogs , intended as a musical version of George OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1984 .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s commercial instincts remained in fine working order , however , and the album brought further hit singles with the title track and Rebel Rebel .
He took his new music to the US in 1974 with the elaborately theatrical Diamond Dogs tour , which was filmed by the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alan Yentob for the documentary Cracked Actor .
However , professional pressures and an escalating cocaine habit were making Bowie paranoid and physically emaciated .
His increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable Young Americans ( 1975 ) , which gave him a US chart - topper with Fame ( featuring John Lennon as a guest vocalist ) and earned him a slot on the American TV show Soul Train .
This was BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so - called Ã¢â¬Åplastic soulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ album , which he described as Ã¢â¬Åthe squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak , written and sung by a white limeyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But once again , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s frantic creativity was accompanied by crises in his business life .
He fired Defries , which spurred long and tortuous litigation and cost Bowie millions , then hired his lawyer , Michael Lippman , as his manager .
A year later he went through the sacking - and - lawsuit process all over again with Lippman .
Yet he was still breaking new musical ground .
Station to Station ( 1976 ) , a euphoric dose of what might be called synthetic art - funk , introduced a new persona , the Thin White Duke , which Bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as Thomas Jerome Newton , the melancholy space traveller , in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film The Man Who Fell to Earth .
But BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own connection to terra firma was looking increasingly shaky .
He told Rolling Stone magazine about his admiration for fascism , and provoked outrage when his wave to the crowd while arriving in an open - topped Mercedes at Victoria station in London was interpreted as Nazi salute .
He found some breathing space by buying a home in Switzerland , where he rediscovered his interest in art and drawing , but by the end of 1976 he had taken up residence in Berlin , where he was accompanied by Iggy Pop Ã¢â¬ â with whom he was working on IggyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album , The Idiot Ã¢â¬ â and Brian Eno , who would be the catalyst for another of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical leaps forward .
The upshot was the so - called Ã¢â¬ÅtriptychÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of Low , Heroes ( both 1977 ) and Lodger ( 1979 ) , where Bowie mixed Krautrock influences with Eno - driven synthesizer mood - music , with at least some pop accessibility for good measure ( such as LowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Sound and Vision or LodgerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Boys Keep Swinging ) .
Lodger , though recorded in Montreux and New York , used the same personnel as the previous two , with Eno once again acting as creative ringmaster .
Meanwhile , Bowie found time to film another leading movie role , appearing as Count Paul von Przygodski in Just a Gigolo ( 1978 ) .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the coupleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hedonistic , promiscuous lifestyle , and they would divorce in 1980 .
This was a year of further creative triumph , bringing a fine album , Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) and its spin - off chart - topping single , Ashes to Ashes , followed by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s well - received stint as John Merrick in The Elephant Man on the Broadway stage .
To make the accompanying video for Ashes to Ashes , he went to the Blitz club in London and recruited several leading lights from the New Romantic movement , a collection of bands including Visage and Spandau Ballet , who owed much of their inspiration to Bowie .
With hindsight , Ashes to Ashes can be seen as the point where BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cutting edge began to lose its sharpness , and he was never again quite the cultural pathfinder he had been in his heyday .
This process expressed itself in the way he restlessly bounced between collaborators .
He bagged a No 1 single with his 1981 partnership with Queen , Under Pressure , while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media .
He appeared in the German movie Christiane F ( 1981 ) and wrote music for the soundtrack , and his lead role in the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s production of Bertolt BrechtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Baal ( 1982 ) was accompanied by his five - track EP of songs from the play .
He registered another chart hit with Cat People ( Putting Out Fire ) from Paul SchraderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s movie Cat People ( 1982 ) .
Bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in The Hunger ( alongside Catherine Deneuve ) and the second world war drama Merry Christmas , Mr Lawrence , both released in 1983 .
Musically , this was the year in which he marshalled his forces for an all - out commercial onslaught with the album LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance and follow - up concerts .
With co - production from ChicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Nile Rodgers
, LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance moulded Bowie into a crowd - friendly global rock star , with the album and its singles
LetÃ¢â¬
â¢ s Dance , China Girl and Modern Love all becoming huge international hits .
This was the heyday of MTV , and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s knack for eye - catching videos fuelled this commercial splurge , while the six - month Serious Moonlight tour drew massive crowds .
It was to be the most commercially successful period of his career .
Tonight ( 1984 ) could not repeat the trick , though it delivered the hit Blue Jean , whose short accompanying film JazzinÃ¢â¬ â¢ for Blue Jean earned Bowie a Grammy .
But his profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 Live Aid famine relief concert at Wembley stadium , where he was one of the standout performers .
In addition , he teamed up with Mick Jagger to record the fundraising single Dancing in the Street , which sped to No 1 .
Bowie then returned to the multimedia trail with an appearance in Julien TempleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shambolic film Absolute Beginners ( 1986 ) , from which he salvaged some personal kudos by supplying the winsome title song .
He also wrote five songs for Jim HensonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fantasy film Labyrinth , as well as taking the role of Jareth the Goblin King .
In 1987 , a solo album ,
Never Let Me Down , performed reasonably well commercially , but poor reviews were endorsed by Bowie himself ( he described it as Ã¢â¬Åan awful albumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
The follow - up Glass Spider tour was castigated for its soulless over - production .
After playing Pontius Pilate in Martin ScorseseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film The Last Temptation of Christ ( 1988 ) , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s next move was the heavy - rock band Tin Machine , with which he sought to appear as a band member rather than as a solo star .
Their album Tin Machine ( 1989 ) and tour earned a mixture of modest acclaim and howls of outrage .
However , by the time they released a second album , Bowie had abandoned the pretence of being Ã¢â¬Åone of the boysÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by undertaking 1990Ã¢â¬ â¢ s greatest hits tour Sound + Vision , unashamedly designed to promote the reissue of his back catalogue .
Tin Machine dissolved in 1992 .
A few days after his appearance at the Freddie Mercury tribute concert at Wembley stadium in April 1992 , Bowie married the Somalian model
Iman , whom he had met 18 months earlier , and the couple bought a home in New York .
This new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration .
For the album Black Tie White Noise ( 1993 ) , he reunited with Rodgers and sprinkled elements of soul , electronica and hiphop into the mix .
It topped the UK album chart and yielded a top 10 single , Jump They Say .
However , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quest for new sounds to plunder began to evince an air of desperation .
Outside ( 1995 ) found him reunited with Eno and was another commercial success , despite its laborious concept and clumsy adoption of grungy , industrial sounds , while Earthling ( 1997 ) borrowed elements of the drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass style practised by such UK artists as Goldie and Asian Dub Foundation .
One of the album tracks was IÃ¢â¬ â¢
m Afraid of Americans , originally written for the movie Showgirls but remade under the auspices of Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails .
Released as a single , it sat on the US Billboard Hot 100 for four months .
Bowie was demonstrating unexpected forms of creativity in other areas .
In 1997 he made history of a sort by launching his Bowie bonds , whereby he netted $ 55 m upfront by surrendering his royalties over the bondsÃ¢â¬ â¢ 10-year term .
In 2000 , he delved into online banking with BowieBanc , giving customers an international banking service as well as cheques and debit cards with his picture on them .
New media and technology influenced his recordings too .
His 1999 album HoursÃ¢â¬ Â¦ was based around music he had written for a computer game called Omikron , in which Bowie and Iman appeared as characters .
Some listeners detected a return to the Hunky Dory days in the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reflective , self - analytical musings , though the songs could not match those former glories .
As an adopted New Yorker , Bowie was the opening act at the Concert for New York City in October 2001 , where he joined Paul McCartney , Jon Bon Jovi , Billy Joel , the Who and Elton John in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks .
Bowie sang Paul SimonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s song America and his own Heroes .
He played himself in Ben StillerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fashion industry spoof Zoolander ( 2001 ) .
The following year , he was artistic director of the Meltdown festival on the South Bank in London , opening the event by performing the first concert of his own Heathen tour , in support of his album of the same name .
The work reunited Bowie with Visconti for the first time since Scary Monsters , and sold 2 m copies worldwide .
It was nominated for the annual Mercury prize .
A re - energised Bowie was back in the studio with Visconti the following year for Reality , another successful outing welcomed for its energy and musical freshness .
However , in the midst of his Reality tour in 2004 , Bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing at the Hurricane festival in Germany and underwent an emergency angioplasty procedure in Hamburg to clear a blocked artery .
He took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities .
He made a handful of guest appearances , including a couple of live shows with the Canadian band Arcade Fire , then in 2006 announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording .
Despite this , shortly afterwards he appeared with Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s David Gilmour at the Royal Albert Hall , singing the Floyd classics Arnold Layne and Comfortably Numb .
In February that year he was given a Grammy lifetime achievement award , having been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 .
In The Prestige ( 2006 ) , Christopher NolanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film about two battling magicians , Bowie featured as the inventor Nikola Tesla .
Nolan said he cast Bowie because he wanted somebody Ã¢â¬Åextraordinarily charismaticÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In 2007 Bowie was curator of the eclectic High Line festival in New York , and included among his choices Arcade Fire , Laurie Anderson and the comedian Ricky Gervais .
In 2008 he contributed vocals to a couple of tracks on
Scarlett JohanssonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album of Tom Waits cover versions , Anywhere I Lay My Head .
In 2010 , a live double CD , A Reality Tour , was released on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own ISO Records .
Recorded in Dublin in 2003 , it was a survey of most of the key moments in his musical career .
Reviewers were enthusiastic , but could not help noticing the valedictory feel of the album .
Ã¢â¬ÅNobody really knows if Bowie is hanging up the spacesuit for good , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Rolling Stone .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut if so , this is one hell of an exit.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But there was more to come .
In 2011 he released the album Toy , which dated back to 2001 and comprised tracks from Heathen and their B sides plus versions of older material .
Of far greater significance was The Next Day ( 2013 ) , his first album of new material in a decade .
Produced by Visconti , it was preceded by the single Where Are We Now ? , which gave him his first UK top 10 hit since 1993 .
The album topped charts in Britain and around the world , reaching No 2 in the US .
In 2014 Bowie was given the Brit Award for Best British Male , making him the oldest recipient in the awardsÃ¢â¬ â¢ history .
He is survived by Iman , their daughter , Lexi , his stepdaughter , Zulekha , and his son , Duncan ( formerly known as Zowie , then Joe ) , from his first marriage .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ David Bowie ( David Robert Jones ) , singer , songwriter and actor , born 8 January 1947 ; died 10 January 2016 Ã¢â¬Â¢ This article was amended on 13 January 2016 .
An earlier version said that David Bowie failed his 11-plus exam .
This has been corrected to say that he passed this exam , and was offered a place at both a grammar school and a technical school ."
2016-01-11,"I first met David Bowie at school : not literally , but it was the early 70s and the coolest kids were Ziggy obsessives , almost clones .
They really went for it , getting the bog - brush haircut and everything .
At that point he had absolutely rabid fans .
Walking down the street youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d see boys with their hair dyed , which was very unusual then .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d get so excited about any new releases .
You couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t ignore it .
That was just the start of course ; from then on Bowie seemed a more or less constant presence through our formative years .
He mirrored , or maybe anticipated , every twist and turn of pop culture .
He sucked up the zeitgeist and gave it to us kids to feast on .
He was a megastar , but his power came from the fact he was the champion of the outcast in the bedroom .
The loner , the misfit .
Although I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t afford to buy records then , I absorbed him through TV and radio .
The performance of Starman on Top of the Pops , with Bowie rubbing up against Mick Ronson dressed in a spangly catsuit Ã¢â¬ â that was really bringing gender subversion into the mainstream .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s difficult for people to appreciate now just how different the 70s were .
Less than three decades had passed since the second world war , and all the sobriety and conformity that represented .
Things were still terribly old fashioned , the social texture was very straight .
To be this weird boy , one who experimented with androgynous , even feminine clothes and apocalyptic lyrics
Ã¢â¬ â it was pioneering .
At exactly the same time I was experimenting , and it felt like Bowie was giving me and a whole generation of kids permission to explore the dressing - up box .
The sheer danger of it was what made it extraordinary .
I would call it social bungee jumping .
Terrifying but thrilling .
Bowie made a great woman Ã¢â¬ â later on , I remember seeing him in the video for Boys Keep Swinging .
He looked amazing with long red hair , lipstick and high cheekbones .
As a young proto - transvestite I felt very jealous .
All I wanted to do at that point was look like a pretty girl and of course Bowie managed it effortlessly .
His appeal for me went far beyond cross - dressing though .
There was always something frightening about the mood he created .
He was a very funny man , with a great sense of humour .
But it was imbued with a darkness , an edge that distinguished him from other purveyors of glam rock .
When people are growing up theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re generally looking for something in the culture that reflects their subconscious yearnings .
Bowie certainly did that for my generation .
In fact , he probably did it for two or three .
As I got older , Bowie changed but still seemed relevant .
I was at art college when his Berlin records were around Ã¢â¬
â Lodger came out while I was doing my foundation course .
It was all very moody , arty and avant garde .
That allowed us to look on him as one of our own .
He seemed to approach his pop career the way we were looking at our artistic development .
He took it very seriously , was very disciplined , and managed to make credible work .
The techniques he used were recognisable to us Ã¢â¬ â the cut - up method for lyrics , the theatricality of his performances , the use of mime .
He clearly had the musical talent Ã¢â¬ â the ability to write brilliant melodies Ã¢â¬ â
but he approached everything with an artistic sensibility , and that was his genius .
His persona was like a piece of performance art .
What he was doing was pop , but it was high culture too .
I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t help thinking that applies to the news of his death , as well .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s been very private over the last few years , very careful about what of him made it out into the world .
The two most recent albums have been meticulously planned and crafted and released on his own terms .
Today the news came as a complete shock .
But it also seemed to fit with so many of his other cultural interventions : unleashed upon us in a single , incandescent moment ."

2016-01-11,"As one of the first artists to realise that music , fashion and theatre could be brought together on stage or on TV to create something uniquely potent , David Bowie made several legendary appearances on the small screen performing his songs .
While the most famous comes from the British TV show
Top of the Pops Ã¢â¬ â when he casually put his arm around his guitarist Mick Ronson in a homoerotic display that caused jaws to hit the floor the length of Britain , Bowie did plenty to shock and awe Americans too .
Here are some of the most famous .
Soul Train , performing Fame and Golden Years , 1975 With nicotine hair , a snow - white tan and cheekbones as hollow as the stardom heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s singing about
, Bowie looks profoundly weird shimmying on a podium in the middle of the music show
Soul TrainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s famous dancers .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s safe to say , less than sober .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s miming , but it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t matter .
The song sounds savagely vital , and Bowie is coolness personified .
Bing CrosbyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Merrie Old Christmas , performing Little Drummer Boy / Peace on Earth , 1977
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to imagine a greater creative gear - change from being coked up on Soul Train to performing carols with Bing Crosby on his Christmas special , but change was the modus operandi of
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
entire career , and his chops as an old - fashioned crooner were an integral part of his persona .
Despite the cosy surroundings , Bowie still looks and sounds otherworldly , and the blend of his voice and BingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s is beautiful .
Saturday Night Live , performing The Man Who Sold the World , TVC15 and Boys Keep Swinging , 1979
Bowie had cleaned up and moved to Berlin but returned to New York to perform on SNL .
Always alert to stirrings in pop
cultureÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
avant garde , he brought with him Joey Arias and Klaus Nomi , both leading lights of downtown New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s performance art scene .
During TVC15 the pair drag around a toy poodle while Bowie wears a skirt ; Boys Keep Swinging is performed with Bowie in a giant marionette costume .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spectacular and subversive .
The Tonight Show , performing Life on Mars ? and Ashes to Ashes , 1980
Promoting his appearance on Broadway in The Elephant Man , together with his new album Scary Monsters , an almost natural - looking Bowie in a red bomber jacket and blue pegged trousers nevertheless brings the house down with a stratospheric version of Life on Mars ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a measure of his confidence that he immediately launches into what was then new material
Ã¢â¬ â Ashes to Ashes , which revisited Major Tom and returned him to the top of the charts , in the UK at least .
The Concert for New York City , performing America , 2001 A month after 9/11 , Bowie opened the concert at Madison Square Garden organised by Paul McCartney in response to the attacks with a version of Simon and GarfunkelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s America .
Played on a small keyboard , but sung with operatic passion , its chorus Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve all come to look for AmericaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ is an incredibly moving expression of his relationship with the nation , his adopted home ."
2016-01-11,"One thing that struck reviewers who were grappling with Blackstar , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album , was how tricky it was to interpret lyrically .
Kitty Empire , writing in the Observer , described it as elliptical , while the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alexis Petridis wrote that the album Ã¢â¬Åseems to offer those attempting to unravel his lyrics a wry Ã¢â¬Ëbest of luck with thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ .
What the critics didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know , however , was that the man behind it had been diagnosed with cancer 18 months ago , and that he knew his life was coming to an end .
If this had been common knowledge , they would all no doubt have looked at Blackstar in a different light .
Was David Bowie saying goodbye on it ?
And does it seem obvious now that he has died ?
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Everything Away , the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final track , is perhaps the most potent song
to re - examine . Ã¢â¬ÅI know something is very wrong , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he begins , then sings : Ã¢â¬ÅThe blackout hearts , the flowered news / With skull designs upon my shoes.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The sense that Bowie has an unhappy secret he desperately wishes he could share is reaffirmed in the chorus :
Ã¢â¬ÅI
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t give everything away.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
On Dollar Days , Bowie could be singing about an afterlife , or some kind of spiritual connection to his homeland : Ã¢â¬ÅIf IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll never see the English evergreens
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m running to ,
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nothing to
me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The songs Tis a Pity
She Was a Whore and Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) may be based around a 17th - century John Ford play , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interesting to think about why this appealed to Bowie .
The latter song contains lines such as Ã¢â¬ÅThe clinic called , the x - rayÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
fine
, I brought you home ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ as well as references to tombstones and death .
Before the album was released there was much talk about how the title track was inspired by the Islamic State Ã¢â¬
â a fair enough assessment given the references to Ã¢â¬ÅexecutionsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and the fact that Donny McCaslin , the jazz musician who helped shape BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sound , had hinted as much in an interview .
But this also has allusions to saviour myths and what we leave behind when weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re gone .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not a pop star , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ sings
Bowie at one point .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a blackstar.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It seems to set out his desire to be regarded as something beyond just a flash - in - the - pan fad , as Martin Amis wrong - headedly suggested Bowie was in a 1973 New Statesman piece .
The albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
cover art , a solitary black star , was the first Bowie release that did not feature his image , and it seems to complete this symbolic journey from one world to another .
And then thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lazarus , BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s second and most recent single .
Revisiting it , in the wake of the sad news , it seems to be another explicit farewell song :
Ã¢â¬ÅLook up here , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he begins , Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heaven.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
What a staggering first line for someone who knew their time was coming to an end to write : to know that he would soon be singing it to his fans from beyond the grave .
The last line Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅOh , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be free / Just like that bluebird / Oh , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be free / AinÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that just like meÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â also seems explicit , viewing death in a positive light , as a release from his illness .
( This reminded me of Charles BukowskiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poem Bluebird , which also used the bird as a symbol for captivity and release . )
The song is , of course , named after Lazarus of Bethany , whom Jesus brings back from the dead in the Gospel of John .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s easy to see why Bowie would be fascinated by the idea of cheating mortality .
On Dollar Days , he could even be referencing it when he sings : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying to push their backs against the grain /
And fool them all again and again.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It is something BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s fans seemed to have also considered .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been an outpouring of shock and surprise at his death , not because , at 69 , he was relatively young , but because people seemed to ascribe higher powers to him .
As if this pop genius would have somehow twigged a way of escaping death .
As if we would somehow still be hearing Bowie albums , beamed in via holographic afterlife , in 3016 .
If that was one trick even he couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t pull off , then we can be sure of something : as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence stretches far and wide , seeping into the work of those whose lives he touched , we will get to see him reborn countless times over the coming decades ."
2016-01-11,"My David Bowie is not dead .
Nor ever can be .
What he gave to me is for ever mine because he formed me .
I have absolute clarity about that , I need no lamentations from politicians or TV presenters with their dim memories of his Ã¢â¬ÅhitsÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
I need no ranking of whether he was up there with Dylan or Lennon because I just know that is a dumb question .
I simply know .
He was my lodestar : in the years when I was trying to become myself , he showed me the endless possibilities .
He extended out into the new spaces , metaphorically and physically .
That man could move .
Those possibilities never end though of course he knew they would .
He has gone Ã¢â¬Åjust like that
bluebirdÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as he soars and sings on his latest single Lazarus .
Well he knew things we didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , as he had all his life .
He departs with Blackstar which I found terrifying without knowing why .
What can I do now but listen and weep ?
Or find your own Bowie .
You will have it somewhere .
That first play of Ziggy .
That time you put food colouring in your hair .
The night when lust became utterly confused with a different kind of longing .
A longing to be in one of the worlds he told us about .
It is still with me .
Taking Station to Station around to a mateÃ¢â¬ â¢ s flat .
He had to hear it .
We treated these albums as religious artefacts .
We worked hard studying the sleeve notes .
We wanted to know some of what Bowie knew .
He was our university .
He was the one who could open up the world .
From a small town and what my teachers called Ã¢â¬Åa broken homeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie would guide us .
We could give up trying to be normal now that we entrusted ourselves to him .
He sang of space and drugs and floating above the world .
He could be so tender ( Letter to Hermione ) and then swagger like a brute .
He was tapped right into something mystical that we recognised but could not grasp as we were too busy preening and dancing and wanting .
But all the time he was passing on secret knowledge .
I would learn about Burroughs , Kemp , Crowley , Berlin , Sakamoto , Roeg and so many others through him .
I would have my first proper boyfriend because of him
Ã¢â¬ â
working - class lads started wearing eyeliner and nail varnish because he did , which made them vaguely interesting .
This was a time when tabloid headlines screamed Ã¢â¬Ågender benderÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ though I had never even heard the word gender before .
My mum and grandad ruined Top of the Pops by staging shouting matches when he appeared Ã¢â¬ÅIs it a man or a woman?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
How could they be so stupid ?
How did they not get it ?
I have not changed my mind since then about that actually .
Because we knew what he was .
There was never a doubt .
He deconstructed fame before anyone had ever really come to grips with the concept .
He was thinking , not only dancing .
Pulling us through the genres on a diet of cocaine and milk .
He looked like an alien .
But the funk man , the funk , it was so real .
When I sat next to him in some dark basement of a club in the early 80s in New York he did seem human .
I pretended not to know who he was because I was just overwhelmed that he was an actual person .
I did the same thing years later at a party .
There he was , immaculate in the flesh , all I ever dreamed
but still he belonged to my imagination .
I did not want an actual conversation with him because I have always been having one .
In human blokeish form he was charming but my love was pure .
Only last week I was obsessively playing Hunky Dory because someone on the internet annoyed me by ranking the tracks in order of greatness .
And they got it wrong .
This incensed me because I care .
I never grew out of Bowie .
He was never past .
Always present .
And Blackstar ?
This most sublime of English artists hankering for the Ã¢â¬ÅevergreensÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ even at the end .
Still dislocated .
Still embodied in the music .
Ã¢â¬ÅLay me place and bake me pie
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m starving for me gravy Leave my shoes , and door unlocked I might just slip away.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He has slipped away .
That door .
He unlocked it .
For me , for you .
For us .
He gave us everything .
He gave us ideas , ideas above our station .
All THE ideas and a specific one .
Of life .
The stellar idea that we can create ourselves whoever we are .
He let us be more than we ever knew possible .
There is nothing greater .
Nothing ."
2016-01-11,"When David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album , Blackstar , was released on 8 January , a great deal of energy was expended trying to unpick the lyrics .
As on its predecessor , 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s The Next Day , or any number of classic Bowie albums from Hunky Dory to Station to Station , they were frequently dense and allusive : much attention was focused on the title track , which one of BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backing musicians , saxophonist Donny McCaslin , claimed was about the rise of Isis , a suggestion BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spokesperson subsequently denied .
Now , with the knowledge that Bowie was terminally ill during its making , the most striking thing about the album is how elegiac it frequently sounds .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I never see the English evergreens
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m running to ,
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nothing to me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sang on Dollar Days .
Ã¢â¬ÅSaying no , but meaning yes , this is all I ever meant , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the message that I sent , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ran the closing
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Everything Away .
Most arresting of all is Lazarus : Ã¢â¬ÅLook at me , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heaven .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got scars that canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be seen , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got drama
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be stolen ; everybody knows me now.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Most people assumed that Lazarus was written from the viewpoint of Thomas Newton , the alien Bowie portrayed in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Man
Who Fell to Earth : it was the title track of an off - Broadway musical based on the 1976 film .
Now it feels suspiciously like Bowie writing his own epitaph , asserting his own fame , vast artistic importance and inimitability Ã¢â¬ â for decades , other artists tried to copy David Bowie , but none of them were really anything like him Ã¢â¬ â while wryly pointing out that , after nearly 50 years in the spotlight , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d somehow managed to retain a sense of mystery .
Dozens of books have been written about him , some of them hugely illuminating , but something unknowable lurked at the centre .
Almost from the start , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career raised questions to which a definitive answer seemed elusive .
If he was , as he loudly claimed in 1971 , gay , then what was the deal with the very visible wife and the son
heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just written a touching little song about ?
If he was , as he dramatically announced from the stage of the Hammersmith Odeon in July 1973 , retiring Ã¢â¬ â either from music , or from live performance , or from the character of Ziggy Stardust Ã¢â¬ â then what was he doing back onstage in London three months later , belting out The Jean Genie in full Ziggy drag ?
How does anyone in the state
Bowie was , by all accounts , in by 1975 Ã¢â¬ â ravaged by cocaine to the point where he seemed to have genuinely gone insane ; paranoid and hallucinating Ã¢â¬ â make an album like Station to Station :
not a messily compelling document of a mind unravelling , like the solo albums of his great idol Syd Barrett , but a work of precision and focus and exquisitely controlled power thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s arguably his best ?
In a world of cameraphones and social media , how could anyone as famous as Bowie disappear from public view as completely as he seemed to between 2008 and 2013 : moreover , how could anyone as famous as Bowie record a comeback album in the middle of Manhattan without anyone noticing or leaking details to the media ?
How does anyone stage - manage their own death as dramatically as Bowie appears to have done : releasing their most acclaimed album in decades , filled with strange , enigmatic songs whose meaning suddenly became apparent when their author dies two days later ?
It was a dramatic end to a career that began inauspiciously .
Bowie spent the 60s trying to fit in with prevalent trends , something to which he was uniquely ill - suited : he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make for a terribly convincing blues - influenced rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roller , or hippy troubadour , or MOR singer - songwriter , just as two decades later , he wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make for a terribly convincing mainstream stadium - rock star , trapped in what he subsequently called Ã¢â¬Åthe netherworld of commercial acceptanceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Tellingly , the first truly great song he wrote focused on the outsider : recorded at the height of Swinging London , 1966Ã¢â¬ â¢ s The London Boys offered up the eraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gloomy flipside , a monochrome drama of poverty , amphetamine psychosis , grimy bedsits and cafes .
Even when he finally had a hit , with 1969Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Space Oddity , his success seemed far from assured .
For all the songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eerie brilliance , the public clearly thought of it as a novelty record , capitalising on the moon landings : they declined to buy its follow - up , The Prettiest Star , or the accompanying eponymous album .
All along , however , Bowie was picking up ideas he would subsequently pull into focus .
His then - manager Ken Pitt introduced him to the Velvet Underground , whose distortion , avant - garde inclinations and transgressive subject matter would reverberate throughout BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career : you can hear echoes of their tumultuous sound in everything from the feedback - laden glam rock of 1973Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Aladdin Sane to the wilfully synthetic racket he conjured up on 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Heroes to the sonic commotion of BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ â¢
Tis a Pity
She Was a Whore .
He tried to incorporate what heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d learned studying mime under Lindsay Kemp into his stage act , which kicked off a fruitful obsession with drawing ideas from other areas of the arts Ã¢â¬ â films , theatre , literature , fashion Ã¢â¬ â into rock music .
As the 70s dawned , he found the perfect musical foil in guitarist Mick Ronson and his songwriting got better and better Ã¢â¬ â 1971Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Hunky Dory was as rich and brilliant a collection of songs as he ever wrote Ã¢â¬ â but almost no one noticed .
The closest Hunky Dory came to commercial success was when
Oh !
You
Pretty Things made No 12 , courtesy of a jaunty , prim cover version by Peter Noone Ã¢â¬ â toothsome former frontman of the 60s least - threatening superstars ,
HermanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Hermits Ã¢â¬ â which was clearly some distance from the seismic rupture Bowie had predicted on the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opening track Changes :
Ã¢â¬ÅLook out , you rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollers!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
How he made them notice was via one of the most audacious gambles in rock history .
Infatuated with the Velvet UndergroundÃ¢â¬ â¢ s world of drag queens and sneering , bitchy putdowns , Bowie seemed to realise that , for all the generation - gap - rendering shocks that British rock music had delivered over the preceding decade , it had never really dared touch on the subject of homosexuality .
Beyond the thanks - but - no - thanks saga of the KinksÃ¢â¬ â¢ Lola , there were only glancing references , so oblique as to be the stuff of rumour rather than fact :
See My Friend , also by the Kinks , the BeatlesÃ¢â¬ â¢ YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve Got to Hide Your Love Away , DonovanÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
To Try for the Sun .
Tellingly , the journalist to whom he came out as bisexual , Michael Watts , didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seem to have been terribly convinced :
Ã¢â¬ÅMmmmmm , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he responded doubtfully , despite the fact that Bowie had already posed on the cover of 1970Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Man Who Sold the World wearing Ã¢â¬Åa manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dressÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and larded the lyrics of The Width of a Circle and Queen Bitch with intimations of homosexual encounters .
It didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t matter .
The interview drew enough attention that the launch of his next album and its accompanying character , Ziggy Stardust Ã¢â¬ â the latter debuted a fortnight later in the unpromising environs of the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth Ã¢â¬ â felt like an event .
The momentum was electrified further by his appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1972 , arguably the most celebrated three minutes of music television ever broadcast in the UK .
Listen to a bootleg of Bowie performing live in Aylesbury the preceding year and he sounds nervous and uncertain ; on Top of the Pops , he seemed imperious .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a touch of Lord Kitchener about the moment Bowie pointed down the camera as he sang the line
: Ã¢â¬ÅI had to phone someone
so I picked on you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He looks like a man recruiting an army of teenage misfits .
No matter how weird and alien you felt , you couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be as weird and alien as Bowie and his bandmates looked : Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not alone , give me your hands , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re wonderful , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sang on the accompanying album .
It helped that Ziggy Stardust was the right record for the moment .
The standard line is that glam rock represented a diversion from the misery of early-70s life , a glittery space - age dreamworld in which you could hide from rising unemployment , industrial unrest and terrorism .
But The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is riven with dread and horror , mired in what the journalist Francis Wheen later called Ã¢â¬Åthe collective nervous breakdownÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the 1970s .
Even at its most escapist , it underlined what you might be escaping from : Ã¢â¬ÅTony went to fight in Belfast , Rudi stayed at home to starve , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ opened the rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll fantasy of Star .
As time wore on and Bowie became an ever - more influential and commanding figure Ã¢â¬ â capable of reactivating otherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s careers at a stroke Ã¢â¬ â his music got more dense and apocalyptic .
By the time of 1974Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Diamond Dogs , it sounded so decadent and diseased and sensational that it was hard to work out where Bowie could possibly go next .
As it turned out , he was just getting started on a series of musical shifts so brilliantly executed
they seemed to drag the rest of pop music along in their wake .
If his early 70s albums informed punk Ã¢â¬ â a genre heavily staffed by kids whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been galvanised by his 1972 Top of the Pops appearance Ã¢â¬
â
then the Ã¢â¬Åplastic soulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and electronic experiments of his late 70s albums presaged a vast quantity of what happened after punk .
Quite aside from his willingness to reinvent himself so dramatically , it seems a miracle his fans kept up Ã¢â¬ â
Ã¢â¬Åit might as well have been a completely different artistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , said one fan who witnessed both the glammy , theatrical early dates and the funk - inspired later shows of the 1974 tour that finally made him a star in America Ã¢â¬ â what was remarkable was how thoroughly Bowie could impose himself on different genres , how he could take other peopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ideas and twist them until they seemed entirely his own .
1975Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Young Americans was recorded at Sigma Sound , home of the luscious string - laden soul released on Philadelphia International , but it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound like a Philly soul record .
Recorded with Brian Eno , 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Low and Heroes were clearly in thrall to the music of German experimentalists Kraftwerk and Neu ! , but they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound much like Kraftwerk or Neu!.
They sounded like David Bowie , even though they sounded nothing like David Bowie had recorded before .
There was a lovely circularity about the release of 1980Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) and its accompanying No 1 single , Ashes to Ashes , at the height of the New Romantic movement heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d almost singlehandedly inspired : public confirmation that Bowie was the most important and influential artist since the Beatles .
But the 80s were to prove a more problematic decade than that suggested .
His career in the 70s had been scarred by bad business deals : once he was out of a contract with Tony DeFries that entitled his former manager to 16 % of his earnings until 1982 , Bowie seemed determined to make money .
He succeeded Ã¢â¬ â
1983Ã¢â¬
â¢ s Serious Moonlight tour sold 2.6 m tickets Ã¢â¬ â
but , as he later admitted , his artistry suffered .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance Ã¢â¬ â released in 1983 , and his biggest hit album with 7 m sales Ã¢â¬ â had its moments .
The following yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Tonight , however , did not .
By the decadeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s end , Bowie seemed aware that something had gone awry .
He tried to kickstart his muse : by forming a heavy rock band , Tin Machine ; by announcing that he would no longer play old material in concert ; by reconnecting with collaborators whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d spurred him on in the past , including Brian Eno and Mick Ronson ; by dabbling in the voguish dance genre of drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass .
He occasionally made brilliant records Ã¢â¬ â not least 1995Ã¢â¬ â¢ s impenetrable but rewarding Outside Ã¢â¬ â but nothing matched what heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d achieved in the 70s .
Indeed , by the mid-90s , his real innovations seemed to be happening away from the recording studio : he released a download - only single in 1996 , nine years before iTunes .
He made himself available to fans on the messageboard of his website , foreshadowing the 360-degree connectivity that artists are expected to indulge in in the age of Twitter and Facebook , and which he himself shunned completely in the years before his death .
By the early noughties , he seemed to be settling into the life of a heritage rock star : making well - received albums that knowingly referenced his past , playing classic albums in their entirety , seeming to tacitly acknowledge both the extent of his influence and that his greatest achievements were behind him .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a pragmatic approach
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s served everyone from Paul McCartney to Iggy Pop well , but it sat uneasily with Bowie .
His music had never wallowed in nostalgia .
It had been iconoclastic and antagonistic towards the past ( Ã¢â¬Åmy brotherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at home with his Beatles and his Stones Ã¢â¬ Â¦
what a dragÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d written on 1972Ã¢â¬ â¢ s All the Young Dudes )
: it was about the present , or better still , the future .
Although his withdrawal into semi - retirement after 2003Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Reality was precipitated by emergency surgery on a blocked artery , it made a strange kind of sense .
Most observers assumed it was permanent .
Instead , he suddenly reappeared in 2013 with
Where Are We Now ? .
The song just appeared on the internet on his 66th birthday , without advance promotion or fanfare , its author declining to give interviews : in its own way , as audacious a move as the interview he gave the Melody Maker in 1972 .
The subsequent album , The Next Day , wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a million miles removed from the albums heÃ¢â¬
â¢ d been making before his sabbatical Ã¢â¬ â solid songwriting , lots of references to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s past , but its follow - up was something else entirely .
On release , Blackstar sounded remarkably like the kind of confident , decisive break with his past
Bowie kept turning out at the height of his powers : the thrillingly exploratory jazz - influenced sound had as little to do with the music on The Next Day as the soul of Young Americans had with the glam albums that preceded it .
It sounded like a new beginning , but it was the exact opposite : it was a farewell , a puzzle , filled with clues no one picked up on , that would suddenly be solved by his death .
David Bowie went out the way he spent most of his career : unknowable , one step ahead of everyone else .
Alexis PetridisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pick of Bowie ThereÃ¢â¬
â¢ s no point in trying to make a definitive 20-song Bowie playlist .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s over half a century of wildly diverse work there
: it isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to be neatly summed up in 20 songs without glaring omissions , with whole areas of what he did left untouched .
So this is an unashamedly personal selection , in chronological order ."
2016-01-11,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music is expected to take over the UK charts this week , following the news of his death from cancer .
His album Blackstar was already on course for the No 1 slot .
Early sales indicators suggest Bowie will score a number of new chart entries , with fans eager to pay tribute to the singer .
According to Martin Talbot , chief executive of the Official Charts Company : Ã¢â¬ÅToday is an awful day for all lovers of music .
But we are expecting a huge surge for a wide range of Bowie albums in this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s official albums chart .
Bowie made so many great albums , constantly reinventing himself , that everyone has their own favourites and fans are clearly reminding themselves of his massive contribution to popular music by buying these great , iconic works.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At the time of publication , Blackstar had combined sales of 43,000 , with Elvis PresleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
If I Can Dream 25,000 sales behind in second place .
AdeleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 25 was at No 3 , with Justin BieberÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Purpose and James BayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Chaos and the Calm making up the top five .
Providing Blackstar holds firm , it will be the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 10th album to top the UK charts .
The final placings will be announced on 15 January at 5.45pm ."
2016-01-11,"A radio presenter accidentally announced the death of David Cameron in a news report about the death of singer David Bowie .
Fiona Winchester , a newsreader across Global Radio - owned stations Heart , Smooth , LBC and Capital , was reading the news for Heart FM on Monday morning when she made the gaffe .
A tongue - tied Winchester said Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Cameron has diedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ before quickly correcting herself and replacing the prime ministerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s name with Bowie , who has died of cancer aged 69 .
The prime minister tweeted about the BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death describing it as a Ã¢â¬Åhuge lossÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He also posted a tribute on Facebook saying that Bowie provided Ã¢â¬Åthe soundtrack of our livesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ growing up .
Ã¢â¬ÅFrom the first time I heard Space Oddity to the pride of welcoming British athletes at the London Olympics to one of his masterpieces Heroes
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was someone who truly deserves to be described as a genius.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The Official Charts Company said that its mid - week chart update showed that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar album had taken the number one slot and is Ã¢â¬Åalmost certain to become his tenth chart - topping album this weekÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
Early sales figures show that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s music is likely to make multiple entries in this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s charts as fans pay tribute to the singer .
Ã¢â¬ÅToday is an awful day for all lovers of music , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Martin Talbot , chief executive of the Official Charts Company .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are expecting a huge surge for a wide range of Bowie albums in this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Official Albums Chart .
Bowie made so many great albums , constantly reinventing himself , that everyone has their own favourites and fans are clearly reminding themselves of his massive contribution to popular music by buying these great , iconic works.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"The one item that the Victoria and Albert Museum could not use in its blockbuster exhibition on David Bowie , who has died at the age of 69 , was a Bakelite Grafton saxophone given to him by his father when he was only 13 .
The show is currently at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands , which was due to be closed on Monday , but opened its doors to allow fans to see the exhibition and sign a book of condolence .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe see a lot of people crying in our museum today , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said a spokeswoman .
V&amp;A curator Geoffrey Marsh revealed that Bowie declined the request to lend the saxophone , possibly because it was quite fragile but also because it meant so much to him .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was very poignant .
Apart from that , he lent everything we asked of him , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Marsh of the exhibition , David Bowie Is , which has become the most successful ever staged by the London museum .
More than 1.3 million people have visited the show , which opened at the V&amp;A in 2013 before going on tour to Toronto , SÃÂ£o Paulo , Berlin , Chicago , Paris and Melbourne .
Last month the exhibition opened in the Dutch city of Groningen .
The tour will continue , the V&amp;A said , although it is currently only confirmed to travel to Japan in 2017 .
Marsh said he heard the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death and thought it was a hoax .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is a huge loss Ã¢â¬ Â¦ just for humanity , actually , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he added .
Bowie offered curators full access to his vast , immaculately kept archives but declined to talk to them Ã¢â¬ â
the show had to be the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own take on his life .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was very generous and , in a curious way , quite self - effacing , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Marsh .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think he was genuinely interested in what someone else might make of it all.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The exhibition includes more than 300 objects including album covers , videos , drawings , handwritten song lyrics and costumes , such as the Ziggy Stardust jumpsuit that Bowie wore in 1972 , when he performed Starman on Top of the Pops .
After the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s success in London , where 311,956 people visited , the V&amp;A was inundated with requests from other museums .
Ã¢â¬ÅEverywhere the exhibition has gone it has been phenomenally successful , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Marsh .
Ã¢â¬ÅEvery new generation finds him of interest
and I think that will continue .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are very few performers who engender that kind of love .
There are lots of bands that people really like and admire , but the intimacy people feel with Bowie is something very , very rare .
And the fact he kept doing it for 50 years is extraordinary.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
David Bowie Is continues at the Groninger Museum , Netherlands , until 13 March"
2016-01-11,"Broadcasters have torn up their planned schedules to mark the death of David Bowie .
BBC1 and Channel 4 will air tributes on Monday evening to one of the most influential rock and pop stars in the history of music , while BBC2 will repeat its intimate Bowie documentary called Five Years tonight .
Radio 2 has cleared its evening schedule to air content dedicated to the performer between 6 pm and 10 pm .
BBC4 is also in discussions about whether to air any programming on Monday evening related to the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , although it has decided not to clear its schedules , as some had expected .

BBC Radio 2 has also made changes to its scheduling , with the second half of Simon MayoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drivetime slot
Ã¢â¬ â which airs between 5 pm and 7 pm

2016-01-11,"David Bowie , the iconic rock star whose career spanned more than half a century and whose influence transcended music , fashion and sexuality , has died aged 69 .
The singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death was confirmed in a Facebook post on his official page : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18-month battle with cancer .
While many of you will share in this loss , we ask that you respect the familyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s privacy during their time of grief.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Writing on Twitter , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son , the film director Duncan Jones , 44 , said : Ã¢â¬ÅVery sorry and sad to say itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The news came as a shock to some , who were initially sceptical , but BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s publicist , Steve Martin , told the Reuters news agency : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a hoax.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 25 albums produced a string of hits including Changes , Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes .
He was known for experimenting across diverse musical genres , and for his alter egos Ziggy Stardust , Aladdin Sane and the Thin White Duke .
He also had a notable acting career .
His latest album , Blackstar , was released last week to coincide with his 69th birthday , and had received widespread critical acclaim .
Blackstar was the first Bowie release not to feature a picture of him on the cover : instead , a stylised black star heralded a darker work .
On re - examination , there is much in Blackstar to suggest Bowie was saying goodbye , particularly in Lazarus , and the video for the title track , which opens with the image of a dead spaceman .
Tributes were paid on social media .
In a heartfelt Facebook post , Tony Visconti , who produced a series of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s albums , including Young Americans and his seminal Berlin trilogy , Low , Heroes and Lodger , wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅHe always did what he wanted to do .
And he wanted to do it his way
and he wanted to do it the best way .
His death was no different from his life Ã¢â¬ â a work of art .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe made Blackstar for us , his parting gift .
I knew for a year this was the way it would be .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , however , prepared for it .
He was an extraordinary man , full of love and life .
He will always be with us .
For now , it is appropriate to cry.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
An hour after the news broke , fans began to gather near his apartment on Lafayette Street in the Soho district of New York .
The first , Kate Corman , left a candle and flowers .
Ã¢â¬ÅFirst Lou Reed , now David Bowie .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so sad .
Unbelievable .
New York is really over now ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At Puckfair , a bar across the street from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment andfrequented by the singer , the barman played a string of his hits Ã¢â¬ â Jean Genie , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Heroes .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to put into words what he gave us in his songs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said late - night drinker Bill Marlborough .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel it
, I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t explain.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Flowers and tributes were also laid at a mural on a wall in Brixton , south London , where the singer was born , and a candle was placed outside a property in Stansfield Road , thought to be his childhood home .
Bowie had been absent from public view for a decade .
After a heart attack while touring in 2004 there were only a few low - key live appearances Ã¢â¬ â his last at a charity show in New York in 2006 when he performed alongside Alicia Keys Ã¢â¬
â and an acting role in the film The Prestige the same year .
He was said to sit quietly in his apartment , or at the house in upstate New York near Woodstock , which he purchased with the supermodel Iman , whom he married in 1992 and with whom he had a daughter , Alexandria , 15 .
Paul Trynka , his biographer , told the Press Association the decade between his 23rd album Reality in 2003 and The Next Day in 2013 gave Bowie time to be Ã¢â¬Åa family
manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe walked Lexi [ his daughter ] to school every day Ã¢â¬ â something he had missed with Duncan [ his son ] which was something he deeply regrettedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ricky Gervais , the comedian and actor who convinced the famously private Bowie to star as himself in an episode of the 2006 sitcom Extras , wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅI just lost a hero .
RIP David BowieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The rock guitarist Joel Madden , quoting Changes , wrote simply : Ã¢â¬ÅTurn and face the strangeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The rapper Kanye West said : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Mick Jagger said : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid was always an inspiration to me and a true original .
He was wonderfully shameless in his work .
We had so many good times together ...
He was my friend .
I will never forget him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton , south London , to mother Margaret Ã¢â¬ÅPeggyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , a waitress , and charity worker Haywood Ã¢â¬ÅJohnÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Jones .
His older brotherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record collection introduced him to rock music at an early age .
The family moved to south - east London and he graduated from Bromley technical high school at 16 , when he was busy forming a number of bands and leading a group .
He called himself Davy Jones , later changing his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees .
The name was reportedly inspired by a knife developed by the 19th century American pioneer Jim Bowie .
He released three singles as a solo artist for Pye Records , and a debut album David Bowie , but did not achieve huge success and retreated to a Buddhist monastery in Scotland in 1967 .
After returning to London he started the arts troupe Feathers in 1968 , then helped organise the Free Festival , a day - long free music event in Beckenham , southeast London , in 1969 .
That same year he released Space Oddity , which went on to be his first UK
No 1 .
The release the following year of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders
From Mars made him an international star , and he conquered the US with his theatrical stage show .
He produced albums for Lou Reed and Iggy Pop , as well as writing All the Young Dudes , which he gave to Mott
The Hoople who had a massive hit with it .
In the late 1970s he produced a three - album collaboration with Brian Eno , known as the Berlin trilogy .
Bowie combined his rock career with appearances in films .
His acting career took off with his performance in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Man
Who Fell to Earth , followed by roles in films such as Labyrinth , The Last Temptation of Christ and Absolute Beginners .
More recently , he appeared as himself in the film Zoolander .
Bowie officially retired Ziggy Stardust in 1973 , making the announcement during a London gig .
But the hits kept coming , with albums including Aladdin Sane , Diamond Dogs and Pin Ups .
He changed direction with the soul - inspired Young Americans .
His first US
No 1 was a collaboration with John Lennon on Fame , which topped the charts in 1975 .
He continued to sell millions of albums and pack out stadiums with the rise of the New Romantic scene in 1980s Britain .
He embraced pop , finding chart success with songs such as LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Queen collaboration Under Pressure .
Friend and collaborator Iggy Pop described him on social media as Ã¢â¬Åthe light of my lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while singer Madonna tweeted : Ã¢â¬ÅTalented .
Unique .
Genius .
Game ChangerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Rolling Stones hailed his as Ã¢â¬Åan extraordinary artist and a true originalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The rock group Queen , with whom he collaborated on Under Pressure , tweeted a link to the video of the song , with the words : Ã¢â¬ÅThis is our last dance ....
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Prime minister David Cameron , speaking on an engagement in north London , said : Ã¢â¬ÅMusically , creatively , artistically David Bowie was a geniusÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie once said that he was bisexual , although he later suggested that his sexual interactions with men should be seen in the context of his wider cultural experimentation .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was always a closet heterosexual , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1993 .
In 1970 he married Angie Bowie , and the couple had a son named Zowie Bowie , now known as Duncan Jones .
They split in 1980 .
He settled in New York one year after marrying Iman .
Bowie continued to record and tour until 2003 , when he released Reality , his 23rd album , which many assumed to be his last .
Ã¢â¬ÅI am not a natural performer , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie said in a rare interview in 2002 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t enjoy performing terribly much .
Never have .
I can do it and , if my mindÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on the situation , do it quite well .
But , five or six shows in ,
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying to get off the road and go back to the studio.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In the same interview , he said : Ã¢â¬ÅMy entire career , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve only really worked with the same subject matter .
The trousers may change , but the actual words and subjects IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve always chosen to write with are things to do with isolation , abandonment , fear and anxiety , all of the high points of oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"Rock legend David Bowie has died , 18 months after being diagnosed with cancer .
His son Duncan Jones first confirmed the news , and shortly after , Facebook , Twitter and Instagram feeds were overwhelmed with tributes to the pop pioneer .
Longtime producer Tony Visconti described his shock on hearing of the death of Ã¢â¬Åan extraordinary manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He always did what he wanted to do .
And he wanted to do it his way
and he wanted to do it the best way .
His death was no different from his life Ã¢â¬ â a work of art .
He made Blackstar for us , his parting gift .
I knew for a year this was the way it would be .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , however , prepared for it .
He was an extraordinary man , full of love and life .
He will always be with us .
For now , it is appropriate to cry .
Another key Bowie collaborator was Brian Eno , who said in a statement via the BBC : DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death came as a complete surprise , as did nearly everything else about him .
I feel a huge gap now .
We knew each other for over 40 years , in a friendship that was always tinged by echoes of Pete and Dud .
Over the last few years - with him living in New York and me in London - our connection was by email .
We signed off with invented names : some of his were mr showbiz , milton keynes , rhoda borrocks and the duke of ear .
About a year ago we started talking about Outside - the last album we worked on together .
We both liked that album a lot and felt that it had fallen through the cracks .
We talked about revisiting it , taking it somewhere new .
I was looking forward to that .
I received an email from him seven days ago .
It was as funny as always , and as surreal , looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did .
It ended with this sentence : Ã¢â¬ËThank you for our good times , brian .
they will never rotÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
And it was signed Ã¢â¬ËDawnÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
I realise now he was saying goodbye .
David Cameron , British prime minister and leader of the Conservative party , expressed his sadness with two tributes to the late musician .
On Facebook Cameron described him as Ã¢â¬Åsomeone who truly deserves to be described as a geniusÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He also shared the following message on Twitter :
Many figures from the world of pop and rock have reacted Ã¢â¬ â with the likes of Madonna , Gene Simmons , Yoko Ono , The Rolling Stones , Florence Welch , Kanye West and the Pixies celebrating BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence on their work .
In a longer post on Facebook , Madonna detailed the seismic impact that seeing Bowie as the Thin White Duke had on her as an artist : IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m devastated .
David Bowie changed the course of my life forever .
I never felt like I fit in growing up in Michigan .
Like an oddball or a freak .
I went to see him in concert at Cobo Arena in Detroit .
It was the first concert IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d ever been too .
I snuck out of the house with my girlfriend wearing a cape .
We got caught after and I was grounded for the summer .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care .
I already had many of his records and was so inspired by the way he played with gender confusion .
Was both masculine and feminine .
Funny and serious .
Clever and wise .
His lyrics were witty ironic and mysterious .
At the time he was the Thin White Duke and he had mime artists on stage with him and very specific choreography
And I saw how he created a persona and used different art forms within the arena of rock and Roll to create entertainment .
I found him so inspiring and innovative .
Unique and provocative .
A real Genius .
his music was always inspiring but seeing him live set me off on a journey that for me I hope will never end .
His photographs are hanging all over my house today .
He was so chic and beautiful and elegant .
So ahead of his time .
Thank you David Bowie .
I owe you a lot .
The world will miss you .
Love M Elsewhere , many musicians kept their praise short , sweet and sombre : Paul McCartney writes that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åstar will shine foreverÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ : Very sad news to wake up to on this raining morning .
David was a great star and I treasure the moments we had together .
His music played a very strong part in British musical history and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m proud to think of the huge influence he has had on people all around the world .
Ã¢â¬ÅI send my deepest sympathies to his family and will always remember the great laughs we had through the years .
His star will shine in the sky forever .
Jarvis Cocker of Pulp spoke to BBC 6Music , praising BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s outsider influence : He was like an umbrella for people who felt a bit different .
Bowie was like a like a lighthouse that guided those people and made them feel it was alright to be different , to try things out and dye your hair and wear strange clothes .
I think people feel it very personally because he was very important in how people grew up .
I do think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quite amazing that he put this record out and managed to keep it secret that he was ill .
People should watch that Ã¢â¬ËBlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ video and listen to that song .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s saying goodbye to everybody , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s controlling it .
We can all talk about David Bowie .
I think the best thing to do on this day would be to listen to him , and to watch films of him and just see what a fantastic artist he was and how many different guises he had , and the incredible amount of work that he did .
Obviously itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a sad day that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s died , but the fact that he managed to stay in control of that image and make another artistic statement when he was obviously ill and knew that he was dying
, I think thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s incredible and it makes me feel quite happy that he stayed creative right to the end of his life .
I think that can only be inspirational .
According to Visconti , Bowie listened to Ã¢â¬Åa lotÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of Kendrick Lamar while working on Blackstar .
In his tribute published today , the rapper said it was an Ã¢â¬ÅhonorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
New OrderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bernard Sumner also sent his respects to the star : Very shocked and saddened to watch the news this morning and hear about the death of David Bowie .
I always looked up at him and thought yeah - heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the real deal , indisputably good , a figurehead for a whole host of musicians
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve lost someone unique who canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be replaced .
Actor Whoopi Goldberg paid her condolences to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family , and posted an image of herself with the artist at an MTV rock and comedy special .
Elsewhere , the actor Joseph Gordon - Levitt quoted Eight Line Poem from Hunky Dory , while Mark Ruffalo described Bowie as Ã¢â¬Åfather of all us freaksÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
British author Neil Gaiman and his wife , the musician Amanda Palmer , each took to Twitter to share their reactions to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton described the artist as Ã¢â¬Åone of the greatestÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Tributes even came in from space .
British astronaut Tim Peake , currently orbiting Earth in the International Space Station , tweeted a message of condolence .
The German Foreign Office have thanked Bowie for his role in bringing down the Berlin Wall , posting live footage of Heroes , a track written during his Berlin period , which describes two lovers separated by the Wall : Ã¢â¬ÅI can remember / Standing , by the wall / And the guns , shot above our heads /
And we kissed , as though nothing could fall /
And the shame , was on the other side.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ GlastonburyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Emily Eavis added her condolences . ...
As did Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi , the president of the Pontifical Council for Culture , who tweeted lyrics from the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1969 single Space Oddity ."
2016-01-11,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest album , released last week to coincide with his 69th birthday , has been described as his Ã¢â¬Åparting giftÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as collaborators and friends paid tribute to the iconic star after the unexpected announcement of his death .
Friends and collaborators recalled BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final interactions with them amid a re - examination of Blackstar , his final work .
It includes a new single , Lazarus , whose video opens with the image of a dead spaceman and which begins : Ã¢â¬ÅLook up here , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heaven.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In a Facebook post , Tony Visconti , who produced a series of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s albums , revealed the significance to Bowie of Blackstar , his 25th and final studio album , released to critical acclaim .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe always did what he wanted to do , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote Visconti , who was a producer on Blackstar as well as Young Americans and his seminal Berlin trilogy : Low , Heroes and Lodger .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd he wanted to do it his way
and he wanted to do it the best way .
His death was no different from his life Ã¢â¬ â a work of art.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Blackstar was the first Bowie release not to feature a picture of him on the cover : instead , a stylised black star heralded a darker work .
Visconti added : Ã¢â¬ÅHe made Blackstar for us , his parting gift .
I knew for a year this was the way it would be .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , however , prepared for it .
He was an extraordinary man , full of love and life .
He will always be with us .
For now , it is appropriate to cry.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie had kept news of his cancer diagnosis from all but a few close associates .
His desire for privacy Ã¢â¬ â and for his message to speak through his work Ã¢â¬ â was achieved by a small inner circle including his manager , Coco Schwab ; archivist Jimmy King ; BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wife , Iman , and daughter , Lexi ; and Visconti .
It was broadly known that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s onstage heart attack in 2004 had left him frail .
But a sudden death was not foreseen , whatever the portents that can now be seen Blackstar .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe considered [ privacy ] the greatest luxury , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said one friend familiar with the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thinking , who did not wish to be named .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was paramount to him in the way he lived his life over the last few years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The death of Bowie , who had a profound influence on music , fashion and sexuality in a career spanning more than half a century , was confirmed on in a Facebook post on his official page early on Monday .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18-month battle with cancer .
While many of you will share in this loss , we ask that you respect the familyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s privacy during their time of grief.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Writing on Twitter , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son , the film director Duncan Jones , 44 , said : Ã¢â¬ÅVery sorry and sad to say itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Some were initially sceptical , but BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s publicist , Steve Martin , told Reuters : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a hoax.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove , who worked with Bowie on his last stage musical Lazarus in New York , said the singer had been suffering from liver cancer .
Hove , who attended the premiere of Lazarus with Bowie in December , told Dutch NPO radio : Ã¢â¬ÅI have lived for a long time with the knowledge this was coming .
I was with him on stage at the premiere of Lazarus a few weeks ago .
I knew when he got into the car that it might be the last time .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe had told me in confidence and I never broke that confidence .
He told me about a year and three months ago , soon after he found out himself .
Liver cancer.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He said Bowie refused to postpone Lazarus .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe absolutely did not want to
and I knew why .
It reminded me of Dennis Potter , who kept on writing scenarios and scripts right up to his deathbed , in a fight against death and it was the same with [ Bowie ] too .
He put up an incredible fight .
He really didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to die.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He added : Ã¢â¬ÅIt was incredibly painful to watch .
He came to the rehearsals and walk - throughs as often as possible .
And stayed , and I saw how much effort it was taking .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt the premiere he seemed to be glowing with health , but afterwards he had to sit down right away .
We chatted for 15 minutes .
It has been very intense , working together but also keeping the secret.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A long - time Bowie collaborator , the producer Brian Eno , told of how his death had come as a Ã¢â¬Åcomplete surprise , as did nearly everything else about himÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and revealed that he had received an email from him seven days ago .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was as funny as always , and as surreal , looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did .
It ended with this sentence : Ã¢â¬ËThank you for our good times , brian .
they will never rotÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
And it was signed Ã¢â¬ËDawnÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
Ã¢â¬ÅI realise
now he was saying goodbye.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Eno , who knew Bowie for 40 years , said that they had started talking a year ago about revisiting Outside , the last album they worked on together , and Ã¢â¬Åtaking it somewhere
newÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 25 albums produced a string of hits including Changes , Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes .
He was known for experimenting across diverse musical genres , and for his alter egos Ã¢â¬ â Ziggy Stardust , Aladdin Sane and the Thin White Duke .
He also had a notable acting career .
Those joining in tributes included Mick Jagger , who collaborated with Bowie on the 1985 single Dancing in the Street , and said Bowie was always an inspiration to him and Ã¢â¬Åa true originalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was wonderfully shameless in his work ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Jagger said on Twitter , where he described him as a friend he would never forget .
Another British rock legend , Pete Townshend of The Who , paid tribute on the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s website .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor those who were his fans he was a charismatic and exotic creature and still gloriously beautiful even as he approached 70 .
But face to face he was funny , clever , well - read , excited by the arts , and really good company .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe have also lost a wonderful clown whose combined sense of mischief and creativity delightedly touched our hearts .
David Bowie was my Salvador Dali.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Describing him as a visionary artist , Bruce Springsteen said that Bowie had been an early supporter .
Ã¢â¬ÅOver here on E Street , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re feeling the great loss of David Bowie ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Springsteen told followers on Twitter .
Ã¢â¬ÅAlways changing and ahead of the curve , he was an artist whose excellence you aspired to.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
An hour after the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death broke on Monday , fans began to gather near his apartment on Lafayette Street in the Soho district of New York .
The first , Kate Corman , left a candle and flowers .
Ã¢â¬ÅFirst Lou Reed , now David Bowie .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so sad .
Unbelievable .
New York is really over now ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At Puckfair , a bar across the street from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment and frequented by the singer
, the barman played a string of his hits Ã¢â¬ â Jean Genie , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Heroes .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to put into words what he gave us in his songs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said customer Bill Marlborough .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel it
, I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t explain.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Flowers and tributes were also laid at a mural on a wall in Brixton , south London , where the singer was born , and a candle was placed outside a property in Stansfield Road , thought to be his childhood home .
Bowie had been absent from public view for a decade .
After a heart attack while touring in 2004 there were only a few low - key live appearances Ã¢â¬ â his last at a charity show in New York in 2006 when he performed alongside Alicia Keys Ã¢â¬
â and an acting role in the film The Prestige the same year .
He was said to sit quietly in his apartment , or at the house in upstate New York near Woodstock , which he bought with the supermodel Iman , whom he married in 1992 and with whom he had a daughter , Alexandria , 15 .
Paul Trynka , his biographer , told the Press Association the decade between his 23rd album , Reality , in 2003 and The Next Day in 2013 gave Bowie time to be Ã¢â¬Åa family
manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe walked Lexi [ his daughter ] to school every day Ã¢â¬ â something he had missed with Duncan [ his son ] , which was something he deeply regretted.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ricky Gervais , the comedian and actor who convinced the famously private Bowie to star as himself in an episode of the 2006 sitcom Extras , wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅI just lost a hero .
RIP David Bowie.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The rock guitarist Joel Madden , quoting Changes , wrote simply : Ã¢â¬ÅTurn and face the strange.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The rapper Kanye West said : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie was one of my most important inspirations , so fearless , so creative , he gave us magic for a lifetime.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis recalled the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first appearance at the Somerset festival in 1971 .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe had lovely , long , flowing hair , a right hippie - looking lad .
Fantastically beautiful he looked , actually , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Eavis told the BBC .
Ã¢â¬ÅNobody knew who he was , he played at four in the morning at sunrise , a song weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never heard before.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton , south London , to mother Margaret Ã¢â¬ÅPeggyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , a waitnress , and charity worker Haywood Ã¢â¬ÅJohnÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Jones .
His older brotherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record collection introduced him to rock music at an early age .
The family moved to south - east London and he graduated from Bromley technical high school at 16 , when he was busy forming a number of bands and leading a group .
He called himself Davy Jones , later changing his name to David Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees .
The name was reportedly inspired by a knife developed by the 19th - century American pioneer Jim Bowie .
He released three singles as a solo artist for Pye Records , and a debut album David Bowie , but did not achieve huge success and retreated to a Buddhist monastery in Scotland in 1967 .
After returning to London he started the arts troupe Feathers in 1968 , then helped organise the Free festival , a day - long free music event in Beckenham , south - east London , in 1969 .
That same year he released Space Oddity , which went on to be his first UK
No 1 .
The release the following year of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders
From Mars made him an international star , and he conquered the US with his theatrical stage show .
He produced albums for Lou Reed and Iggy Pop , as well as writing All the Young Dudes , which he gave to Mott the Hoople who had a massive hit with it .
In the late 1970s he produced a three - album collaboration with Brian Eno , known as the Berlin trilogy .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s acting career took off with his performance in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Man
Who Fell to Earth , followed by roles in Labyrinth , The Last Temptation of Christ and Absolute Beginners .
More recently , he appeared as himself in the film Zoolander .
Bowie officially retired Ziggy Stardust in 1973 , making the announcement during a London gig .
But the hits kept coming , with albums including Aladdin Sane , Diamond Dogs and Pin Ups .
He changed direction with the soul - inspired Young Americans .
His first US
No 1 was a collaboration with John Lennon on Fame , which topped the charts in 1975 .
He continued to sell millions of albums and pack out stadiums with the rise of the New Romantic scene in 1980s Britain .
He embraced pop , finding chart success with songs such as LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Under Pressure , a collaboration with Queen .
Iggy Pop described him on social media as Ã¢â¬Åthe light of my lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while singer Madonna tweeted : Ã¢â¬ÅTalented .
Unique .
Genius .
Game Changer.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Rolling Stones hailed him as Ã¢â¬Åan extraordinary artist and a true originalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Queen tweeted a link to the Under Pressure , with the words : Ã¢â¬ÅThis is our last dance ...
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The British prime minister , David Cameron , speaking in north London , said : Ã¢â¬ÅMusically , creatively , artistically David Bowie was a genius.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie once said that he was bisexual but he later suggested that his sexual interactions with men should be seen in the context of his wider cultural experimentation .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was always a closet heterosexual , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1993 .
In 1970 he married Angie Bowie , and the couple had a son named Zowie Bowie , now known as Duncan Jones .
They split in 1980 .
He settled in New York one year after marrying Iman .
Bowie continued to record and tour until 2003 , when he released Reality , his 23rd album , which many assumed to be his last .
Ã¢â¬ÅI am not a natural performer , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie said in a rare interview in 2002 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t enjoy performing terribly much .
Never have .
I can do it and , if my mindÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on the situation , do it quite well .
But , five or six shows in ,
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying to get off the road and go back to the studio.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In the same interview , he said : Ã¢â¬ÅMy entire career , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve only really worked with the same subject matter .
The trousers may change , but the actual words and subjects IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve always chosen to write with are things to do with isolation , abandonment , fear and anxiety , all of the high points of oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

2016-01-11,"In 2012 , I visited the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s costume preservation department to see the preparations for the museumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record - breaking David Bowie retrospective the following year .
A curator carefully unwrapped the tissue paper around one garment and laid it out for me to see .
It was an item as familiar to me as the school uniform I wore for my first five years of secondary school , and indeed , a picture of Bowie wearing it has been on my bedroom wall for most of that time : a knitted jumpsuit in a bright zig - zag pattern , with one leg cut off at the upper thigh and one arm cut away to reveal bare shoulder .
It was , of course , a stage outfit he wore during his Ziggy Stardust /
Aladdin Sane tours , and the biggest surprise about it for me , close up , was that it was knitted , with quite thick wool in the most richly patterned parts .
I remarked that it must have been ridiculously hot to wear during a frenetic live show , and the curators laughed and said that sweat damage was one of the main problems they were working on with the stage clothes .
( The original jumpsuit , for instance , had long since rotted away , and the one shown at the V&amp;A had actually been recreated by its designer , Kansai Yamamoto , for an exhibition in New York a few years earlier . )
Later , I got to talk to Yamamoto on the phone
and he told me about the first time he saw Bowie wear his clothes on stage , in a 1973 show at the Radio City Music Hall in New York .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a time difference of 13 hours between Tokyo and New York , but a good friend of mine phoned me in Japan many times through the night , saying , Ã¢â¬ËThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s this very interesting person called David Bowie here in New York .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to see him .
Fly over immediately!Ã¢â¬ â¢
If somebody calls you again and again at 3 am , it must really be pretty interesting .
So I cancelled all other plans for that week , and got on a plane to see his show .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never seen a performance like it .
When the show started , he came down from the ceiling , wearing clothes I had designed .
Then there was a movement that often occurs in kabuki , which is called hikinuki , where somebody is wearing one costume and it is stripped off , immediately revealing what is underneath .
So he was wearing all black and then all of a sudden that disappeared , and he was wearing full colour .
It was very dramatic , and the audience all rose to their feet , so there was a standing ovation right at the beginning .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy clothes were normally made for professional models
Ã¢â¬ â
this was the first time they had been used for an artist or singer .
It felt like the beginning of a new age.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The two men became friends , and later that year met up in Tokyo to collaborate on more stage outfits , including the knitted jumpsuit .
Yamamoto helped Bowie gain a deeper understanding of the Japanese culture that so fascinated him , taking him to dinner with the revered kabuki actor BandÃ ï¿½ TamasaburÃ ï¿½ , for instance .
Through Bowie , Yamamoto says he learned to present his designs more theatrically , and start a second career as a producer .
Ã¢â¬ÅThroughout this time , we were always bouncing off each other , inspiring each other.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The jumpsuit , meanwhile , has echoed through fashion ever since , from the 80s designs of Bodymap to the knitted leggings every teenage girl was sporting last winter .
There are stories like this from almost every year of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long career .
He was the first , the original and the best pop chameleon , ringing the ch - ch - changes for every new release or tour , playing with costume , masks and alter egos in a way that always felt organic and interesting .
He stole ideas from everywhere and was a great collaborator , pushing almost everyone he worked with to do their best work , but Bowie was always unmistakably Bowie , adding his own distinctive sense of style into the mix .
He and his glam - rock contemporary Marc Bolan probably did more than anyone to introduce androgyny into the mainstream , as well as the idea that sexuality could be far more fluid and flexible than we had been taught .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was living in Paris when I first experienced BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , and the influence was instant and permanent , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Jean Paul Gaultier wrote on Out magazineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s website .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was in a dress for the sleeve of The Man Who Sold the World Ã¢â¬ â there was a sense of ambiguity and originality that was incredible at the time ...
I remember going to gay bars in London that Bowie was known to frequent and it gave many of us courage not to hide , to have confidence in ourselves.Ã¢â¬ â¢
In 1975 Bowie veered off into new territory , exploring his love of Philly soul with the Young Americans album , and introducing a look that has echoed through both gay clubs and soul weekenders ever since : the extravagant quiff or dyed wedge cut , teamed with a tailored shirt and baggy trousers .
A year later , with Station to Station , he created his last great character , the Thin White Duke , whose louche , suited look has influenced menswear ever since .
In 1980 he adopted a New Romantic pierrot guise for Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , an album explicitly reclaiming ground that had been occupied by club kids who had grown up under his influence .
After that he lost his way a little , but it barely mattered : he had changed popular culture indelibly .
There was no internet when I was in my teens .
For us , a new Bowie album was not just a collection of songs , it was a doorway to new images , books , art , cultural references and sounds .
We pored over his interviews and influences , and made them our own .
Although I never did get the chiselled cheekbones I so longed for , through Bowie I learned about Linsday Kemp and Aleister Crowley , about Iggy Pop and Nietzsche , about Kraftwerk and kabuki , and all kinds of other things besides .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not alone in this , of course .
Which is why Bowie has been so influential across our culture , and nowhere more so than fashion .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
1980 track Fashion has provided the soundtrack for more catwalk shows than I could ever hope to list here , and of course Bowie made a cameo appearance Ã¢â¬ â judging a walk - off between two competing male models Ã¢â¬ â in Ben StillerÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
brilliant 2001 fashion spoof Zoolander .
In 2014 , he even appeared in a fashion ad himself , crooning seductively to the model Arizona Muse for Louis Vuitton .
( Ã¢â¬ÅHe was so lovely , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Muse told me afterwards .
Ã¢â¬ÅVery charming , and easy to talk to , with a really nice , calm energy.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ )
Lady Gaga makes explicit reference to Bowie in both her Applause and Just Dance videos , while Kate Moss Ã¢â¬ â that most reliable barometer of all that is best in British style Ã¢â¬ â has dressed as Bowie twice : for British Vogue in 2003 , and for French Vogue in 2011 .
In 2014 , she did it again , picking up a Brit award on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s behalf dressed in one of YamamotoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s actual Ziggy Stardust costumes .
But this is mere surface , and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence is deep in the DNA of contemporary fashion .
To celebrate his 69th birthday Ã¢â¬ â sadly only four days ago
Ã¢â¬ â several fashion websites pointed to his influence on recent catwalk shows , for both menÃ¢â¬ â¢ s and womenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collections .
GivenchyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spring 2010 ready - to - wear show , for instance , featured a striped blazer that is a clear homage to a Freddie Burretti one sported by Bowie in 1973 ; a year later , LanvinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s autumn 2011 show saw models dressed in wide - brimmed fedoras like Bowie in The Man
Who Fell to Earth .
BalmainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collection had an Aladdin Sane jumpsuit , while Walter Van Beirendonck had a blazer adorned with a clever Aladdin Sane diagonal flash across the lapels , and Dries Van Noten and Alber ElbazÃ¢â¬ â¢ s autumn menswear shows both heavily referenced the Thin White Duke .
In 2012 Emilio Pucci had jewel - bright suits with more than a hint of Bowie about them , while Alexander McQueen had wide trousers straight from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Hunky Dory period .
Jean Paul Gaultier , who used Diamond Dogs to open his first show for Pierre Cardin in 1975 , has returned to this fertile creative ground again and again , paying homage to Kansai YamamotoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s colourful prints in spring 2011 , and revisiting the one - legged jumpsuit in 2013 , both times lovingly acknowledging the reference by sending out his models in flaming red mullets .
Hedi Slimane Ã¢â¬ â another huge fan who claimed , in 2010
, Ã¢â¬ÅI was literally born with a David Bowie album in my handÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â last referenced the Thin White Duke in his spring 14 collection for Saint Laurent .
A year later , Raf Simons made a nod to YamamotoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s jumpsuits in his spring 2015 couture collection for Dior , while Jun Takahashi recreated the cover of Heroes for his Undercover Fall 15 menswear lookbook .
Most of all , what Bowie did was give generations of teens who didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel like they fitted in permission to be different , and some ideas to start playing with while they found identities of their own .
Creativity always finds an expression , and it would be absurd to suggest that without him , we wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have Boy George or Lady Gaga , Gaultier or Slimane .
But had Bowie not existed , it would all look , sound and feel slightly different .
Speaking at the launch party for the V&amp;A exhibition , Tilda Swinton admitted it was the image , not the music , that first drew her into BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s world .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I was 12 Ã¢â¬
Â¦
I carried a copy of Aladdin Sane around with me
Ã¢â¬ â
a full two years before I had the wherewithal to play it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe image of that gingery , bony , pinky - whitey person on the cover with the liquid mercury collar bone was Ã¢â¬ â for one particular young moonage daydreamer Ã¢â¬ â the image of planetary kin , of a close imaginary cousin and companion of choice .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬
â¢ m not saying that if you hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t pitched up I would have worn a pie - crust collar and pearls like some of those I went to school with .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not saying that if you hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t weighed in , [ the London DJ and club icon ]
Princess Julia would have been less inventive with the pink blusher .
Simply that you provided the sideways like us with such rare and out - there company , such fellowship ; you pulled us in and left your arm dangling over our necks , and kept us warm.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"In the summer of 1998 , a strange press release made its way out to technology and music publications throughout the world .
David Bowie , the legendary musician and cultural provocateur , would be launching his own internet service provider , offering subscription - based dial up access to the emerging online world .
At a time when plenty of major corporations were still struggling to even comprehend the significance and impact of the web , Bowie was there staking his claim .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I was 19 again , IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d bypass music and go right to the internet , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said at the time .
He understood that a revolution was coming .
Bowie had always appreciated the interplay between pop music and technology , but the explosion of web usage in the mid-1990s offered entirely new communication possibilities .
In 1996 , Bowie became the first major artist to distribute a new song Ã¢â¬ â
Telling Lies Ã¢â¬ â as an online - only release , selling over 300,000 downloads .
By then , like many other music artists , he had his own website and was exploring interactive CD - ROM technology Ã¢â¬ â notably through the 1994 release of Jump , a PC CD that let users create their own video for the track Jump , They Say as well as watch interviews with Bowie and music videos from the Black Tie White Noise album .
In 1997 he arranged an ambitious live Ã¢â¬ËcybercastÃ¢â¬ â¢ of his Earthling concert in Boston Ã¢â¬ â although the limits of internet access at the time meant that capacity was quickly reached , and most viewers received only stuttering images and error messages .
But his true ambitions were more profound .
Throughout 1997 and 1998 he worked with the web and interactive entertainment pioneers Robert Goodale and Ron Roy to explore the deeper possibilities of the internet as a means of reaching fans and distributing music .
The result , on 1 September 1998 , was the launch of BowieNet , initially in North America , but later worldwide Ã¢â¬ â an ISP offering Ã¢â¬ÅuncensoredÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ access to the internet attached to a dedicated David Bowie website .
Subscribers could browse a vast archive of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s photographs , videos and interviews , as well as a blog , career chronology and news feed .
The artist also promised further exclusive tracks and webcasts , including footage from the Earthling tour .
Most enticingly for many fans , users also got their own BowieNet email address
Ã¢â¬ â a strange , exciting new way to declare their affinity with the artist .
More importantly though , Bowie conceived of this service as a visual , interactive community for music fans .
Through his Ultrastar company he negotiated deals to give users access to music services like the Rolling Stone Network , which livestreamed concerts , and Music Boulevard , one of the first companies to offer paid - for downloadable music tracks .
The ISP provided every user with 5 MB of web space , encouraging them to create and share their own websites ; there were also forums and live chat sections where Bowie himself conducted live web chats .
This was in effect a music - centric social network , several years before the emergence of sector leaders like Friendster and Myspace .
The site was also technologically ambitious .
At a time when most homepages were simple constructs of text and still images on a default grey background , BowieNet used emerging plug ins like Flash and RealAudio to provide animating graphics and downloadable music clips .
Newcomers were told theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d need at least a 28k , but preferably 56k modem connection Ã¢â¬ â this was demanding at a time when the commercial WWW infrastructure was still in its infancy .
Parts of the front page of BowieNet remain available on the Internet Archive .
For Bowie , this ISP wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just a new means of marketing his material to the masses , it was the realisation of something heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d always understood about music : that the fan response completes the art .
During a Newsnight interview in December 1999 , Bowie found himself evangelising the impact of the internet to a mostly disbelieving Jeremy Paxman .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe actual context and the state of content is going to be so different to anything we can envisage at the moment Ã¢â¬ â the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to crush our ideas of what mediums are all about .
Ã¢â¬ÅArtists like Duchamp were so prescient here
Ã¢â¬ â the idea that the piece of work is not finished until the audience comes to it and adds their own interpretation , and what the piece of art is about is the grey space in the middle .
That grey space in the middle is what the 21st century is going to be all about.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He was envisioning something we all take for granted now Ã¢â¬ â that link between popstar , Twitter , Instagram , fanbase and culture ; that frisson between the artist as an aloof creator and the artist as an active participant in their own community .
He also understood the internet as an arts venue Ã¢â¬ â if not the arts venue Ã¢â¬ â of the coming era .
In October 1999 , BowieNet hosted a virtual premier of the The Saatchi CollectionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s groundbreaking exhibition , Sensation :
Young British Artists , before its arrival at the Brooklyn Museum .
In the same year , he experimented with cross - platform advertising , adding a CD - ROM component to a re - issue of the LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance album , promoting the BowieNet service Ã¢â¬ â common practice now , but rare back then .
The experimentation continued through the late 1990s and 2000s .
In 1999 he worked with French game developer Quantic Dream on the ambitious adventure Omikron :
The Nomad Soul , contributing music to the soundtrack as well as making an appearance in the game itself .
In January 2000 he co - launched his own branded online bank , BowieBanc , which put his image on a credit card and , naturally , offered customers a free subscription to BowieNet .
It was a controversial move at the time , and shortlived , but it was a hint at the way music artists would soon be controlling and marketing their images in a variety of seemingly unrelated sectors
Ã¢â¬ â
it spoke of the entrapreneural spirit that would come to define pop stardom in the digital era .
BowieNet was over as an ISP by 2006 , the technology had moved on Ã¢â¬ â as had Bowie himself .
But he retained an understanding of the web as a platform of subversion .
On 8 January 2013 , Bowie put a video for his new single
Where Are They Now on his website , without any fanfare .
The song , heralding his first new album in a decade , was immediately available on iTunes in 119 countries .
It was a stealthy act of digital anti - promotion that would prove massively successful , relying on news sites and social media to spread the word .
The word duly spread .
Bowie was an expert manipulator of media Ã¢â¬ â be it music , art or video .
It was inevitable that he would spot the potential of the internet , not just as a mass marketing technology but as a new way to make , share and expand upon his work .
Later , the digital era would make heroes of businessmen like Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs , but Bowie was early in understanding that this brave new world would distort the traditional barriers between art , celebrity and commerce .
He knew that the agenda - setters of the 21st century would be a different breed .
BowieNet will not be considered among his greatest achievements in the coming weeks , but it was symptomatic of his restless , inquisitive genius and his instinct for image as a form of communication .
He always saw the revolution coming ."
2016-01-11,"I remember the first time I ever heard David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music because I was naked !
Big time !
It was in the most romantic , amazing , hippy situation you can think of Ã¢â¬
â
I was playing in a club in Miami Beach and they used to have a nude beach there , so
this girl who was the night clubÃ¢â¬ â¢ s photographer said : Ã¢â¬ÅLetÃ¢â¬ â¢
s spend the night on the beach naked and listen to David Bowie!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I had no idea who he was
but we listened to Ziggy Stardust
and it was just incredible .
When I got to meet him that was incredible too , although we were fully clothed that time !
I walked into a nightclub and he was sat there alone drinking orange juice .
I walked up and said : Ã¢â¬ÅHey , you live in the same building as Luther Vandross and all my buddies ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
and we started talking , firstly about Young Americans and that soon segued into a chat about our mutual love for jazz .
I knew this guy was not kidding around Ã¢â¬ â not faking it at all .
All the people he talked about were composers and musicians I idolised , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m talking the entire gamut from the most avant garde underground artists to stuff that I might even have once considered a bit corny , like Stan Getz .
Within a week of that conversation he called my house and we were off and running on LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance .
Before we wrote a single piece of music for that album , we did a research project where we played lots of records and talked about what the album wanted to say , how it should sound as a whole .
Then one day David said : Ã¢â¬ÅNile , this is what I want my album to sound like , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
and he showed me a picture of Little Richard in a red suit getting into a red Cadillac convertible .
How do you translate that ? !
But in actual fact I knew exactly what he meant , and that was the point I realised that David Bowie was the Picasso of rockÃ¢â¬
â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll .
He got uncomfortable with me calling him that
but I did it anyway .
Because I realised he saw the world in an abstract way , as well as in the way we all see it .
And what that picture meant was not that he wanted a retro record , or something based on Little RichardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , but that he wanted something that would always look modern .
He showed me the future and the past and it was evergreen .
The highly designed Cadillac and the red monochromatic suit Ã¢â¬ â that picture was taken in the 1960s but it would still look modern to someone in the year 3000 !
At the start of the project David had said to me : Ã¢â¬ÅNile , I want you to do what you do best Ã¢â¬ â make hits.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I was a little offended by that , although I got over it .
I was also a little perplexed , because the songs didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound like hits to me !
I remember he played me China Girl
and I thought it sounded like a B - side !
But then I thought about my songs and how they all start with the hook , because in the black world we donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have many stations or chances to get a hit , you have to feed people dessert before the main course .
So I said Ã¢â¬ â
letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s put the hooks at the beginning .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s have the first words out of your mouth to be Ã¢â¬ÅLetÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
dance!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He fought it for a little while
and then he understood why .
Years later , at an awards ceremony , he was presenting me a prize
and he said : Ã¢â¬ÅLadies and gentlemen , I am honoured to give this to Nile Rodgers , the only man on earth who could get me to start a song with the chorus!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But my favourite story of those entire sessions was when we were rearranging the songs .
At one point I turned around and said : Ã¢â¬ÅHey David , did I make this song too funky?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He looked at me and said :
Ã¢â¬ÅNo darling , is there such a thing?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ I love that , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the best answer he could have given , and I use it every time I can .
Because of course , there is no such thing Ã¢â¬ â if you make something too funky then youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve achieved nirvana !
Not everything we worked on together was like LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance .
David Bowie was always changing and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what was interesting about him .
He once told me that he felt like he had a responsibility even to himself to change : Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do what people want me to do , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI do what I want to do
I want to do .
Not to offend them , but because thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how I hear it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He was just incredibly artistic , always inspiring the people around him to do something interesting .
His mindset would be : DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do the logical thing , try the illogical thing and see if that works .
And so we would do that .
And you know what ?
Most of the time it worked .
ChicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Nile Rodgers co - produced BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1983 album LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance .
It included the title track , the fourth of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s five number ones and the singles Modern Love and China Girl .
They later reunited on 1993Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Black Tie White Noise ."

2016-01-11,"An hour after the news broke , at 3.30am , Kate Corman stopped by David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment on Lafayette Street in Soho , leaving a candle , flowers and a note Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅThank
you David .
May the Gods bless us
allÃ¢â¬

Ã¢â¬ â the first offerings for a makeshift memorial to a rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll chameleon .
Ã¢â¬ÅFirst Lou Reed , now David Bowie , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Corman said .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so sad .
Unbelievable .
New York is really over now.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At Puck Fair , a bar over the road from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment that the singer frequented , barman Dave Farragher blasted a string of hits Ã¢â¬ â Jean Genie , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Heroes .
Couples drunkenly swayed in their grief .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to put into words what he gave us in his songs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said late - night drinker Bill Marlborough .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel it

ï¿½
The news came late at night for most but too early for the morning rush of news crews that would eventually arrive at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment , which was not perhaps as well - known as the Dakota was for John Lennon or CBGB was for Joey Ramone .
In fact , while Bowie had chosen New York as his home , his absence from daily life meant he was only peripherally considered a New Yorker .
With neat tributes gradually collecting on the doorstep , even BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s doorman said he had had little inkling of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s declining condition .
In fact , the front door was one Bowie rarely used , preferring to slip in and out of his home using a side entrance .
As dawn broke , 52-year - old British visitor Mark Sands said he Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ was devastated to learn of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was a role model for people everywhere but we definitely felt like we owned him .

As the day wore on , the tributes Ã¢â¬ â and the styles of those who offered them Ã¢â¬ â grew more elaborate .
Tash Kouri , a 28-year - old fan , came to the memorial in silver shoes and with glitter around her eyes to lay a photo of Bowie in a yellow suit at the memorial .
Ã¢â¬ÅI wanted to be in drag today , to cry on the 4 train , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅJust last night I was on a road trip with my friends , listening to Rock Ã¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Suicide and telling them how much strength it gave me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said of the Ziggy Stardust track .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was definitely my patron saint.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Parisian fashion designer Ariane Leondaridas , 30 , said she had seen Bowie in the neighborhood two or three times , sometimes in a nearby restaurant , Bottega Falai .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt his height , he had incredible looks and wild style , but when I saw him he always looked understated and chic .
He just looked like an older Englishman dressed smartly with a plaid [ checked ] scarf .
He was hiding in plain sight.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Greg Petan , an artist who lives in the Soho area , came to leave a copy of 1974Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
David Live among flowers and candles at the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s home .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in the title
, I guess , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said regarding why he chose the record .
Ã¢â¬ÅGratefully , through the medium of recorded music people can live forever.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At Bottega Falai , the cafe that Bowie frequented , owner Danilo Durante said the singer was a regular customer until two months ago , when he abruptly stopped coming in .
He said the singer typically ordered the strawberry sfogliatelle and prosciutto di Parma sandwich .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had no sense he was sick .
But you could tell he liked to be low profile , maybe because his job was to be the opposite.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Like manyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ people
, Durante wondered if BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recently released album Blackstar was a final message .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was thinking everything was OK
but I guess he knew it was his farewell.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"David Bowie sought modesty in death , an acquaintance of the singer said on Monday , and thought it honourable after a lifetime in the spotlight to slip away and to become invisible .
That in effect is what Bowie achieved , protected by a small inner circle including his manager , Coco Schwab ; archivist Jimmy King ; BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wife , Iman , and daughter , Lexi ; and producer Tony Visconti .
In a Facebook post on Monday , Visconti wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅI knew for a year this was the way it would be .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , however , prepared for it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
As shock at news of the 69-year - oldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death reverberated , that circle was tightening .
In New York , where Bowie had not been seen for several months as he sought treatment for cancer Ã¢â¬ â of a type not publicly specified Ã¢â¬ â in London , the doorman at his Soho apartment building said staff had had no inkling the singer was sick .
It was broadly known , though , that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s onstage heart attack in 2004 had left him frail .
There had been two strokes .
Rumours of cancer circulated .
But a sudden death was not foreseen , whatever the portents one can now see in Blackstar , the album he released just three days ago .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe considered [ privacy ] the greatest luxury , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said one friend familiar with the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thinking , on Monday .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was paramount to him in the way he lived his life over the last few years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
As much as he understood technology and used it to his advantage , Bowie considered the world of information and accessibility something to avoid .
Nearly three years ago , seemingly from nowhere , he released the album
The Next Day .
To the public , his death also came suddenly .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was his way of appearing to disappear , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said the friend , who did not want to be named .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wanted to manage his absence .
He wanted his family protected from the press .
He wanted to slip away , almost like a phantom , so that it would not Ã¢â¬ â at least in the run - up Ã¢â¬ â become a reality show.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In many ways , Bowie seemed to follow his old friend Lou Reed , who similarly circled the wagons around his declining health , before his death in 2013 .
Tom Sarig , ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s manager , said some close to Bowie Ã¢â¬ â including photographer Mick Rock and ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s widow , Laurie Anderson Ã¢â¬
â did not know
Bowie was so sick .
The relationship between Bowie and Reed was instructive , Sarig said : Ã¢â¬ÅLou was conspicuous in [ New York ] city , he was a fixture , but David blended in .
He was , in many ways , a ghost here.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Sarig came to understand BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s relationship to New York through Reed , whose biggest hit album , Transformer , was co - produced by Bowie .
Ã¢â¬ÅNew York was an inspiration to David and he had a good amount to do with LouÃ¢â¬ â¢ s solo success , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Sarig said .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid was drawn to the grittiness , the vÃ Â© ritÃ Â© and inconspicuousness of the city .
He understood it and he helped Lou realise Transformer with arrangements that made it sound like the city.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the 80s , when Reed was in effect broke , Bowie helped him sort out his affairs .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen [ in 2011 ]
Lou put out his [ widely panned ] album with Metallica , Lulu , David was incredibly supportive , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Sarig said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey remained fast friends to the end.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
There are other theories as to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retreat from the spotlight , too .
It came after almost two decades , from 1983 to 2003 , in which few had much good to say about his musical output .
The experience , some say , soured him to exposure .
A resistance toward leading a public life remained with him to the end .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe had to take himself outside , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the friend said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want a circus .
He thought it honourable to become invisible.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"In terms of drama and characterisation David Bowie put his genius into his music , not his movie work , although his film career was as imaginative , daring and eclectic as everything else about him .
Space Oddity is , in its way , a perfectly formed sci - fi mini - masterpiece of the 60s , charting in tiny , brilliant narrative leaps Major TomÃ¢â¬ â¢ s excitement at blast - off , his ascent to celebrity status , his Ã¢â¬Åspace
birthÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ outside the capsule , the disaster of the mission , and his epiphanic acceptance of love , mortality and manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s insignificance in the vastness of space .
A film might take 120 minutes to tell the same story Ã¢â¬ â less well .
Pop singers from Sinatra to Elvis to Madonna have dabbled in the movies , with varying results , but David Bowie always convinced his public that every role he accepted was an artistic decision and an artistic experiment , governed by his own idealism .
His orchidaceous strangeness made Bowie perfect casting for Nic RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1976 movie The Man
Who Fell To Earth Ã¢â¬
â
his film debut , in fact Ã¢â¬ â based on the Walter Tevis novel , about the extraterrestrial creature who comes to Earth looking for water and natural resources for his own stricken planet .
Bowie himself , the exotic exquisite , was to all intents and purposes an extraterrestrial himself ; and unlike all the other heroes of 70s glam , it seemed as if his eerie beauty would not come off with the make - up .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s style and his line readings were not those of a trained actor , and he continued to be mocked , affectionately and otherwise , for a certain space - oddity in his performance .
But watched again , what is striking in The Man
Who Fell to Earth is BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s utter calmness , self - possession and poise .
This is not stunt casting : it is event casting .
Bowie endows the movie with his own extraordinary charisma and prestige , as if appearing in an installation or art happening .
In 1978 , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interest in Berlin led him to accept a role in David HemmingsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Just a Gigolo , playing an army officer after world war one who becomes a gigolo in Berlin in a notorious establishment run by Marlene Dietrich , in her final screen role .
In some ways , Dietrich was quite as much Ã¢â¬Åevent
castingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as Bowie himself ( their dialogue scenes were cut together without them being in the same studio ) and the brittle , contrived decadence of the whole affair was loathed by the critics , who decided the novelty of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s screen acting had expired .
Just a Gigolo has some cult interest now .
But BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s movie career took a leap forward in 1983 , with Nagisa ÃâshimaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Japanese PoW drama Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence , in which his performance appreciably loosened up , although he still looked every inch the aesthete .
Bowie played the rebellious officer who subverts and unsettles the campÃ¢â¬ â¢ s authorities with his own extraordinary sort of sacrificial homoeroticism , at one stage interrupting a punishment to kiss the commander on both cheeks ,
who in astonishment and ambiguous fury topples backwards in a dead faint .
Perhaps only Bowie could have carried this scene off .
He is entertainingly paired with the easy naturalism of Tom Conti , playing his brother officer Lawrence , and there is an interesting , subsidiary chemistry between them .
In 1986 , Bowie made a sensational impression in the fantasy extravaganza Labyrinth , as one of the few humans Ã¢â¬ â alongside Jennifer Connelly Ã¢â¬ â in a cast of Jim Henson creations .
The role is perfect for his aptitude for fantasy and a certain kind of magical surrealism .
For Martin Scorsese , he was a subdued and disappointingly conventional Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ ( 1988 ) and this is the one performance which I think is a misfire , perhaps more than the obvious flop of Just a Gigolo .
He is assured and perfectly decent , but outclassed by Willem DafoeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Christ , and is not allowed to bring any of his own specialness to the part .
From there , Bowie contributed performances to dozens of films , but my favourite is his work on Christopher NolanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Prestige , a tale of warring stage magicians .
Bowie plays the maverick scientific genius Nikola Tesla , a pioneer in the field of electricity , who is suspected of creating occult magic .
It is a performance of real strangeness , alienation , wit and unreadable charm .
Bowie does really look someone on the borderline of genius and craziness , a fish out of water who is somehow able breathe through his gills .
It was fitting late - period cameo for this fascinating , endlessly charismatic screen performer ."
2016-01-11,"From Brixton , where he was born , to Beckenham , where he came of age ; from Berlin , which generated three of his 25 remarkable albums , to New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Soho , his home for the past two decades , fans of David Bowie are mourning the death of one of rockÃ¢â¬
â¢ s most incandescent stars .
In south London , where David Robert Jones spent the first four years of his life in the late 1940s , hundreds came to lay flowers in front of a large Aladdin Sane mural around the corner from the Brixton street where he once lived .
Moving messages nestled among the sea of blooms .
Ã¢â¬ÅRIP David Ã¢â¬ â
a Starman gone to heaven , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said one .
Another read :
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid , thank you for everything .
You inspired me and made me who I am .
Farewell , and see you in the next life.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
As Bowie transcended musical genres , his fans transcended generations .
Rosie Lowry , a fashion photography student , came and laid flowers in full Ziggy Stardust regalia and make - up .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was just a huge influence on me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said the 21-year - old .
Ã¢â¬ÅWithout him
, I wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have had that strength to be who I wanted to be .
His music makes you feel like heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s talking directly to you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Lowry , whose father was Ã¢â¬Åa massive fanÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , said she Ã¢â¬ÅcouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t believe he was gone .
I owe so much to him ,
heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s helped me through so much .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to even think about coming down here today .
I just got out of bed , and got the face paint on.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Jane Maloney , 44 , brought flowers and showed off a Ziggy Stardust
tattoo on her back .
She , too , had grown up listening to Bowie .
Ã¢â¬ÅI feel like IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve lost a member of my family , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve followed him since I was a kid , seen him live five times .
The world is so much emptier without him here .
He was an independent spirit and a unique human Ã¢â¬ â thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s never been another person like him.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Alison Baker , 44 , was another who came to grieve .
Ã¢â¬ÅI grew up in Perth , in Australia Ã¢â¬ â
suburban beachside Ã¢â¬ â and it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the done thing to be different
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo when Bowie came into my life as a teenager , that just changed everything.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Baker said Bowie was Ã¢â¬Åthe one people followed .
He never followed anyone , and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just extraordinary .
He was completely original.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Blackstar was clearly his farewell , she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor him to have looked death in the eye and then create that Ã¢â¬ â what an artistic way to go .
He skidded into that grave ,
didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t he?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Many said Bowie had exercised a profound , sometimes life - changing influence on them .
Roy Brophy , 57 , left flowers with a note attached that read : Ã¢â¬ÅOh you pretty thing , donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t you know
youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re driving
our mamas and papas insane.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The singer had influenced him tremendously , Brophy said : as a young gay man , seeing Bowie on Top of the Pops had been Ã¢â¬Åjust brilliant , life - changing for me .
His willingness to be himself , break down barriersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And Bowie had changed Ã¢â¬Åevery decadeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Brophy added : Ã¢â¬Å[He was ] a complete chameleon .
And he always had style and grace , even in his death .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one in a million.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie moved to south - east London with his parents when he was four , graduating from Bromley technical high school at 16 , having already formed several bands .
In Beckenham , the first floral tributes were laid early outside what was once the Three Tuns pub .
Here , before the release of Space Oddity in 1969 , Bowie would play most Sunday nights , hosting an open mike evening that became the self - styled Beckenham Arts Lab .
Lin Davis , 62 , who came to lay flowers at the former pub , recalled being a 15-year - old that summer .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe would come to the Arts Lab every Sunday night ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t famous at all then , and often it would be David Bowie taking the money on the door .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll always remember Ã¢â¬ â he once stood on my foot and I never wanted to wash the shoe .
He had the most gorgeous golden curls at that time , like an Adonis , and we all fancied him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hard to believe now , she said , but Ã¢â¬Åin 1969 there was such a buzz in BeckenhamÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The singer , said Davis Ã¢â¬ â who went to see the Bowie show at the Victoria and Albert Museum six times Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Åis in my bloodÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In Berlin , where Bowie spent three particularly productive and innovative years in the late 1970s , the tone was set by the German foreign ministry , which tweeted : Ã¢â¬ÅGood - bye , David Bowie .
You are now among # Heroes .
Thank you for helping to bring down the # wall.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Dozens gathered outside Hauptstrasse 155 , in the district of SchÃÂ¶neberg , where the singer shared a flat with Iggy Pop from 1976 to 1979 .
A selection of his hits roared out into the grey afternoon as Berliners laid flowers , candles and tributes thanking Major Tom or the Thin White Duke for decades of music .
Many were visibly upset , wiping away tears as the last bars of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Berlin anthem Heroes faded away into the intro of Space Oddity .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m here for Bowie .
He was a symbol of West Berlin , the island surrounded by the Wall ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said IT consultant Thomas Hank , 54 .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wanted to get back to his roots here , he was in love with 1920s Berlin .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been listening to his music for 40 years .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just so sad.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Briton Shaun Kemp , 39 , from Doncaster , said he had moved to Berlin two years ago Ã¢â¬Åpartly because of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Berlin period .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just perfect music .
I think the city got him away from the weird period he was going through in Los Angeles .
The music he made here just influenced everybody.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Christoph Storkmann , 50 , said Bowie was his Ã¢â¬Åmusical backboneÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , adding : Ã¢â¬ÅHe even died in style Ã¢â¬ â made a last record , celebrated his birthday , then went off to space .
He wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be replaced .
There are the pyramids in Egypt and then thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Bowie in the music business.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Two doors down , Guido Hoffmann , 53 , a member of the German David Bowie fan club , was among crowds of people paying homage in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former local , the Neues Ufer cafe - bar .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe used to have his breakfast of coffee and cigarettes here almost every day , before cycling to the Hansa studio .
Then heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d come in for a drink in the evening , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hoffmann , surrounded by pictures of Bowie in his many different guises .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was a massive shock this morning , I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to believe it at first .
Only this Saturday we were celebrating his birthday , and now heÃ¢â¬
â¢ s gone .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only just sinking in.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Nearly 6,400 miles away across the Atlantic , the first offerings of what would become a substantial improvised memorial were laid outside the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment at 258 Lafayette Street in New York within an hour of the news breaking .
The messages were simple and heartfelt : Ã¢â¬ÅThank you David .
May the Gods bless us all , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said one .
Another read : Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅLove to a hero.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Kate Corman , who left a candle and a flower , said the news was Ã¢â¬ÅunbelievableÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅFirst Lou Reed , now David Bowie Ã¢â¬
â New York is really over now.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Mark Sands , visiting from the UK , said he and his friends Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ grew up with Bowie .
He did it all ; totally out there , transitioning from character to character , stuff
no one else was doing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Across the road at Puck Fair , a bar where the singer was a regular , the barman was playing a string of Bowie hits : Jean Genie , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , Heroes .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to put into words what he gave us in his songs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said punter Bill Marlborough .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel it
, I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t explain.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The crowds in New York , where Bowie moved in 1993 after marrying the model
Iman , would have been lucky to see him when he was alive ; the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s later years were determinedly low - key and , absent from public life for a decade , he mostly came and went through the service entrance at the back of the building .
But Danilo Durante , proprietor of the nearby Bottega Falai restaurant , said Bowie had been partial to his strawberry sfogliatelle pastries and Parma ham sandwich .
The last time he was in , two months ago , he had seemed okay , Durante said .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had no sense he was sick .
But you could tell he liked to be low - profile .
Maybe because his job was to be the opposite , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he suggested .
Like manyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Durante wondered if BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album , Blackstar , released only last week , was a final message : Ã¢â¬ÅI guess he knew it was his farewell.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But few fans , it seems , ever really suspected Bowie would do anything quite so mundane as dying .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe were concerned about his health , but we thought heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d go on for ever , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Michelle Lynn , who first saw Bowie in 1975 , on his Station to Station tour .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was an all - round great artist , always ahead of his time.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"Ã¢â¬ÅBy the time I got to New York
/ I was living like a king ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ sings
David Bowie on Lazarus , his final single and also the title of the theatre work he co - wrote , which opened just last month .
Though the creative team behind him were Europeans Ã¢â¬
â Bowie , Irish playwright Enda Walsh and the Belgian director Ivo van Hove
Ã¢â¬
â
it now seems significant that Bowie chose to stage his last live work in New York , just a 10-minute walk from his Lafayette Street apartment , and for the lead role to be taken by an American , Michael C Hall .
A musical containing many of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
best - loved songs
, Lazarus continues the story of The Man Who Fell to Earth , and Hall takes the role Bowie embodied in the film Ã¢â¬ â Thomas Newton , an alien marooned on Earth , going mad on a diet of TV and booze .
Bowie could be , at times , almost exaggeratedly English in his fey , Anthony Newley - influenced aspects , yet he was steeped in American culture , from the films of Stanley Kubrick to the music of Aretha Franklin .
The most famous scene in Cracked Actor , the BBC documentary made about Bowie by Alan Yentob in 1974 , shows the singer being driven through the desert near LA in a black limousine .
Ã¢â¬ÅSince youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been in America , you seem to have picked up a lot of the idioms and themes of American music and American culture , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ observes Yentob .
Bowie , who looks thin , wired and , in his black fedora , incredibly glamorous , is drinking from a carton of milk and listening to Aretha FranklinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ( You Make Me Feel Like )
A Natural Woman on the car radio .
Bowie says : Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a fly floating around in my milk .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s a foreign body in it and
heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s getting a lot of milk , and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s kind of how I felt Ã¢â¬ â a foreign body and I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t help but soak it up.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Although Bowie goes on to say that he hated America when he first visited , soon enough the country Ã¢â¬Åfilled a vast expanse of my imagination Ã¢â¬ Â¦ The imagination can dry up in England Ã¢â¬
â
it just supplied a need in me , America ; it became a myth land for me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In fact , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous material indicated that America had been a mythical land for the suburban Bromley boy from a far earlier age .
Take , for instance ,
Did You Ever Have a Dream , one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s many unsuccessful attempts to break through in the late 60s Ã¢â¬ â a cheerful mod - ish pop song that advises : Ã¢â¬ÅYou can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
As with so many members of his generation , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sensibility was changed forever by American rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll , which , after failed experiments in folk , mod and psychedelia , he revisited in the character of Ziggy Stardust .
Ziggy was a 50s rocker seen through the prism of the 70s , an American seen through the eyes of an Englishman .
Alien and androgynous , Ziggy was partly based on Vince Taylor , the Middlesex boy who moved to LA and returned as a leather - clad rock star , before falling prey to madness and drugs .
As we know from his songs about them on Hunky Dory , Bowie had other formative American influences : Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol .
DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical transformations and insatiable artistic restlessness set an example Bowie would follow , while WarholÃ¢â¬ â¢ s multimedia explorations of American culture , from the underground to the mass media , also prefigured BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s merging of high and low culture into something futuristic and sexy .
Queen Bitch on the same album is also a homage to the Velvet Underground , to whose music Bowie was introduced by his then manager .
The Velvet UndergroundÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sinisterly thrilling , entirely unapologetic musical portraits of New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gay , drug - taking demimonde
must have seemed overwhelming to a British suburban kid in the late 60s .
However much London may have been swinging , it contained nothing quite like that .
Bowie first travelled to New York in 1970 , and though he saw the Velvet Underground perform , it was with Doug Yule fronting them rather than Lou Reed
( Bowie spoke to Yule for an hour thinking that he was Reed ) .
Bowie would , of course , go on to galvanise Lou ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s post - Velvet Underground career by producing his album Transformer .
DetroitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Iggy Pop , too , would have his life changed by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence .
After meeting Iggy at MaxÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kansas City in New York in 1971 , the following year Bowie produced The StoogesÃ¢â¬ â¢ album Raw Power .
It is hard to imagine punk rock on either side of the Atlantic without the influence of those two records Ã¢â¬ â especially the second .
Yet as well as being a cultural and intellectual frontier , America was also scary .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1973 album Aladdin Sane , recorded between the two North American stints of the Ziggy Stardust tour , was conceived as Ã¢â¬ÅZiggy goes to AmericaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the rock demigod encountering a place equal to his glamour and madness , from the riots of Panic in Detroit to the Hollywood decadence of Cracked Actor , and the sexual alienation of Drive
- In Saturday , the title alone a play on the drive - in movie theatres which even now seem so glamorously foreign to Brits .
This ambivalence towards America never seemed to leave Bowie , even after heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d moved here and married a Somali - American wife , Iman ; as late as 1997 he released a single called IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m Afraid of Americans including disdainful lyrics like : Ã¢â¬ÅJohnny combs his hair /
And Johnny wants pussy in carsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
This ambivalence was returned by America itself .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
first US tour saw him play as Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
Despite the fact that the band were fizzing with a savage energy
Ã¢â¬ â just listen to the sensational 1972 bootleg Live from Santa Monica Ã¢â¬
â
Bowie struggled to connect in AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heartlands beyond New York .
In San Francisco , Bowie said that the audiences didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want him because they had Sylvester , the pioneering genderqueer singer who supported him ; elsewhere , Bowie almost certainly seemed too English , too queer , not authentic enough ; someone playing with rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll rather than really meaning it .
Nevertheless , Bowie persevered , moving to New York even while songs as imperishable as Rebel Rebel were missing the US top 40 ( though scoring at home in the UK ) , and in 1974 embarking on his Diamond Dogs tour , a massively theatrical undertaking that traversed America without going to Europe at all .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the Diamond Dogs tour captured by Cracked Actor .
Years ahead of its time , it saw each song presented theatrically , the musicians concealed in the wings ( although Bowie said that they kept creeping on to the stage , literally unable to resist the spotlight ) and with Bowie performing on a cherry - picker and on a giant hand , both of which kept breaking down .
Yet after the tour got to New York , with two triumphant nights at Madison Square Garden , Bowie junked the expensive set ( in todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s money it would have cost about $ 1 m a night to stage ) and the tour resumed as a slick soul revue ,
Bowie dressed in suits instead of the outre costumes of glam .
He had , of course , started recording the album that would be Young Americans .
Recorded mainly at Sigma Sound in Philadelphia , the crucible of Thom Bell and Gamble and HuffÃ¢â¬ â¢ s exuberant but edgy
Philly soul sound , it marked the start of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s working relationship with the guitarist Carlos Alomar and also introduced the world to Luther Vandross , who sang backing vocals and created the vocal arrangements .
An audacious stylistic leap , the title track depicts a couple in a turbulent , post - Nixon USA riven by corruption and racial tension , yearning for authentic emotion in a country of fear and confusion : or , as Bowie unforgettably puts it , Ã¢â¬ÅAinÃ¢â¬ â¢ t there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Yet despite its lyrical cynicism and musical complexity , this song resonated with the wider American public , and was BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first real hit , getting to No 28 , while the follow - up , Fame , co - written with John Lennon , another British hero residing in New York , pushed Bowie into the stratosphere
Ã¢â¬
â
it got to No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1975 .
The sight of America clutching Bowie to its bosom is a strange and fabulous one , summed up by a picture of Elizabeth Taylor feeding him a cigarette Ã¢â¬ â the perfect mixture of Hollywood glamour and English pop perversity .
Like the long line of British pop stars from Dusty Springfield to Adele , who have attempted their own version of American soul , Bowie was unabashedly embraced by the African American soul establishment , though Aretha Franklin signalled some ambivalence at that yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Grammys when she said , accepting an award from a coked - up and tuxedoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d Bowie , Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m so happy I could kiss David Bowie.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
That year Bowie performed on Soul Train , looking pencil - thin and impeccably cool , miming to Fame and Golden Years , another US top 10 hit .
However , behind the nihilistic , numb facade of his new character , the Thin White Duke , Bowie was in trouble .
In March 1975 he moved to Los Angeles , and over the course of the following year would be increasingly gripped by cocaine addiction , though in this state he managed to produce one of his very best albums , the glittering , malevolent Station to Station Ã¢â¬ â despite being so out of it he claims not to remember recording it .
An interview with Cameron Crowe done over the course of that year for Rolling Stone gives a flavour of the time ,
Bowie living an itinerant lifestyle around spooky , decadent LA , culminating in a megalomaniacal rant : Ã¢â¬ÅI believe that rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll is dangerous .
It could well bring about a very evil feeling in the West .
I do want to rule the world.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie was also getting unhealthily interested in the occult ; in her memoir , his then wife Angie Bowie describes how he was convinced that the indoor pool in their house in Doheny Drive was possessed by the devil , which led to the pair of them attempting an exorcism .
The water bubbled as if it was boiling , and afterwards the bottom of the pool was stained with a shape Angie describes as Ã¢â¬Åa beast of the underworld ; it reminded me of those twisted , tormented gargoyles screaming silently from the spires of medieval cathedrals.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no wonder that Bowie made his escape Ã¢â¬ â to Berlin , where he made the famous trilogy of albums which are the lodestone of his creativity .
He still kept a foothold in America , however .
In 1979 , he performed Boys Keep Swinging on Saturday Night Live with two of the heroes of New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s avant garde music and theatre scenes , Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias , bringing them to the attention of mainstream America and showing that he still had an eye on the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s underground .
By this stage , of course , New York was the centre of the music world , with disco , punk rock and hip - hop all blossoming as the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s infrastructure collapsed .
It was no surprise that Bowie returned to the city Ã¢â¬ â
he played The Elephant Man on Broadway in 1980 Ã¢â¬ â but few would have predicted the musical direction he would choose .
The catalyst was a chance meeting in 1982 with Chic guitarist and frontman Nile Rodgers in an after - hours club in New York called the Continental .
In just 17 days , the pair recorded the album LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , an irresistible melange of funk and pop that became BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most popular album ever , but saw him abdicate from his decade - long position on rock musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cutting edge .
Since then , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s records have been less specifically associated with a place , not least because they became more sporadic .
As the 90s saw him become more artistically hungry again , Bowie drew from American alternative culture , paying homage to the Pixies and striking up a fruitful artistic collaboration with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also worth remembering NirvanaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spectral cover of The Man Who Sold the World , immortalised on their Unplugged Live in New York performance recorded five months before Kurt CobainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , which indicated exactly how much alternative American music owed to Bowie .
Then , in 2003 , the records stopped and Bowie devoted himself to life in New York with Iman to bring up his daughter Alexandria , occasionally spotted in the streets of SoHo .
When he suddenly came back three years ago , with The Next Day Ã¢â¬ â recorded , like his final album Blackstar , in New York Ã¢â¬
â
it marked the beginning of an engagement with a new generation of American musicians .
The Steve Reich - indebted mix James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem did for Love is Lost leaves us full of regret about the creative possibilities which might have been still to come .
Bowie is dead , but Lazarus continues to play , a tiny indication of the indelible impact he had on American culture , and on the world .
From grunge to disco , from soul to avant garde cabaret , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to think of a musical genre he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t influence , and of few American musicans and music fans who wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t profoundly miss him ."
2016-01-11,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ex - wife Angie has decided to continue with her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother after being told about the death of her ex - husband .
Channel 5 said Angie had been informed by her representatives off - camera of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death from cancer at the age of 69 .
Contestants on the show have no access to telephones or any contact with the outside world .
A spokesperson added : Ã¢â¬ÅThe decision to remain in the house is entirely her choice , and she has been given the option to leave at any time if she changes her mind .
Appropriate support will be available to Angie at any time if needed.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ The American former model went into the Big Brother house last Tuesday .
In an episode of the reality show she described her acrimonious split from Bowie ; she said she had not seen him in 40 years .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅI go to great lengths to avoid him ...
It was terrible when we broke up , it was awful.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The 66-year - old met Bowie when she was 19 .
They married at Bromley register office in 1970 .
She appeared as herself in the 1973 Ziggy Stardust film , and was the inspiration behind BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hit songs The Prettiest Star , Golden Years and Cracked Actor .
They had one child , Duncan Jones , but the pair divorced in Switzerland in 1980 , with Bowie given custody of their son .
In an interview with the Guardian in 2010 , Angie said she had also not spoken to Duncan in five years .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅI think reconciliation is unlikely .
He is nearly 40 , and if he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t bother to find me till now itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bit late .
There is nothing to say.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-11,"How strange it was that the final day of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s twice - yearly celebration of menÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fashion , London Collections Men , fell on the morning that we learned of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
MondayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hot ticket , the Burberry show , was full of flamboyant dressers who idolised the musician , such as fashion editors who danced to Ziggy Stardust at the Blitz Club as teenagers and stylists whose first experiments with crimson hair dye and silver nail varnish were inspired by him .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a single person in this room , or single LCM designer , who hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been touched by him in some way ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said GQ editor Dylan Jones before the show , as Oh !
You
Pretty Things played in the background .
Many in the crowd hugged and consoled each other , united in the belief that they had lost one of their own .
Bowie adopted so many looks over the years Ã¢â¬ â psychedelic sci - fi , androgynous dandyism , razor - sharp tailoring Ã¢â¬ â that it would be impossible to view a menÃ¢â¬ â¢ s catwalk show without seeing a glimpse of him .
At the Burberry show his influence was literal : models wore glitter on their faces in tribute , while some had his name written across the palm of their hands .
The rest of BurberryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s autumn / winter 2016 collection centred on one item Ã¢â¬ â
the zip - up tracksuit top Ã¢â¬ â a piece that has been recently elevated to high fashion status across menÃ¢â¬ â¢ s and womenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fashion courtesy of Chloe , Gucci , Prada , and the hotly tipped Russian designer Gosha Rubchinskiy .
Here the tracksuit was zipped up under the brandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s famous honey - coloured macintosh and layered beneath longline double - breasted military coats .
There were further terracewear touches in black trainers with red piping , loose jeans cut awkwardly at the ankle and khaki bomber , parka and puffa jackets .
The palette was either restrained and 1970s - influenced Ã¢â¬ â forest green , mustard , black and tobacco Ã¢â¬ â or red and black with shining buttons and golden frogging , giving a changing of the guard feeling to the show , appropriately enough for a brand that trades on its Britishness .
The final looks included two fully sequinned tracksuit tops in tomato red and azure blue that sparkled like Christmas baubles under the spotlights .
A couple of looks centred on the cream , red and black Burberry check worn in the noughties by celebrities who , to put it delicately , Burberry would not have sought as brand ambassadors .
The pattern appeared as a scarf over a camel - coloured cable knit sweater in one look , with a more delicate version used for an overcoat in another .
Speaking backstage in a scrum of journalists and celebrities Ã¢â¬ â Brooklyn Beckham , Mark Ronson and Steve McQueen , to name a few , issued bear hugs and compliments Ã¢â¬ â BurberryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s CEO and creative director , Christopher Bailey , said the collection was a Ã¢â¬Åmixture of different worldsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and that he had looked to vintage Burberry pieces , from the 1930s onwards , for inspiration .
Tellingly , BurberryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recent collections have usually taken high brow references as their starting point Ã¢â¬ â David Hockney , the Bloomsbury group , Lucien Freud Ã¢â¬ â in further efforts to distance the brand from the associations of its much - counterfeited check .
The fact that MondayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s show offered no such esoteric references suggested that the Burberry brand has developed to such an extent that embracing this part of its past is now possible .
Burberry will announce its Christmas trading figures later this week , with analysts predicting disappointing results owing to unusually warm weather and the economic slowdown in China .
Creatively , however , MondayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s show suggested the company is on solid ground Ã¢â¬ â and is confident enough to reclaim its camel - checked past rather than gloss over it ."
2016-01-12,"Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only for ever Ã¢â¬ Â¦ not long at all , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ sang Jareth , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s silver - tongued villain , in the title song of 1986Ã¢â¬ â¢ s beloved puppet - filled adventure , Labyrinth .
Like St Vincent , and so many other 80s children , my introduction to Bowie arrived via the screen rather than the family turntable , in the form of Jim HensonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film Ã¢â¬ â so beloved that , 30 years on , adults hold outdoor cinema events and fancy dress balls to relive its magic .
I missed the pleasure of seeing Labyrinth on the big screen ( trips to the nearest Odeon , in Hammersmith , were a treat for special occasions only ) .
Instead , I saw a programme about the making of the film one hot , feverish day , off school and bundled up in blankets , nestled between my parents on the sofa .
The puppets , the sets and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s magnificent crystal ball trick captivated us ; a few years later , they bought me a VHS copy of the film for my birthday .
I treasured it , watched it relentlessly , memorising every line of the script , every note of the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢
s timeless , electrifying score .
I hadnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t heard BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hits at that point .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care that , in his other life , he was this big , important rock star Ã¢â¬ â
a fact impressed on me by the adults .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t need that context to know why I lusted after him with a fierce , pre - teen intensity .
I was infatuated with Jareth , the goblin king , for the same reasons his adult , vinyl - collecting fans were : his charisma , his queerness , his voice .
But there was something deeper at work in the film .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just the strange , thrilling paradox of fear and desire I felt watching this villain as he courted Jennifer ConnellyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Sarah , the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cosplay - loving protagonist .
It was the rare parity at work between the leads .
As the feminist film writer Sophie Mayer points out , Sarah lasts as a hero for us after we grew up because she was such an unusually progressive character for 80s cinema .
Her name may mean Ã¢â¬ÅprincessÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in Hebrew , but she Ã¢â¬Åbursts the bubble of the princess fantasy in the scene at the heart of LabyrinthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅEqually adept at using her lipstick as a cunning tool or fighting off goblin soldiers , Sarah was adept and affective , neither hyper - feminine nor forced into a masculinised version of heroism .
She was selfish , bitter , headstrong , clever , and above all , wanted things to be fair .
Not a princess but a proto - Notorious RBG [ Ruth Bader Ginsburg ]
justice.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ How to play the foil to such a gutsy , stereotype - busting lead ?
It wouldÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been easy for Bowie to have stolen the spotlight from ConnellyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s young , unknown lead , to use cachet and ego to press his way to the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s centre .
Instead , he plays his part in tandem with Connelly , as a perfect counterweight .
Jareth works around SarahÃ¢â¬ â¢ s power , feeling out weak spots : her need for escape and adventure ; her lack of maternality , her girlhood , music - box daydreams of princess finery and chivalrous romance .
He manipulates her , tricks her , woos her .
But , ultimately , he loses .
And he does it all with the gravity of someone battling a worthy opponent Ã¢â¬ â an equal .
To dim the force of his power as a co - star would have been patronising to Connelly .
Instead , Bowie levels everything he has at her , trusting her to meet the challenge and survive Ã¢â¬ â which she does , with career - making brilliance .
How radical , then , to see a teenage girl not just slaying a lead fantasy role with her badassery , but battling a bona fide rock legend who takes her seriously , as both love interest and foe .
Critics and viewers enjoyed poking fun at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mullet - and - codpiece get - up , but I watch Labyrinth and I see a man who relished the complexities of womenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s power , who understood # masculinitysofragile and the joy to be had in queering gender roles .
I see a grown man who was used to being worshipped but was fearless enough to play the loser in this lambent , young feminist epic ."
2016-01-12,"Santa Monica Civic Auditorium , 20 October 1972 Broadcast live by a local radio station
, this show became a must - have bootleg for years after , capturing Ziggy - era Bowie in his prime .
From the moment Mick RonsonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guitar rips into the intro to Hang On to Yourself
it was clear that Bowie and the Spiders from Mars were intent on showing Americans what all the fuss was about .
The set included nods to Jacques Brel ( My Death ) and the Velvet Underground ( Waiting for the Man ) as well as songs from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pre - Ziggy albums such as Life on Mars ?
, which proved so popular on tour that it was released as a single the following year .
Montreal Forum , 14 June 1974 Canadians were the first to experience what at the time was the most ambitious rock show ever staged when the Diamond Dogs tour debuted .
A vast set inspired by German expressionism depicted the dystopian Ã¢â¬ÅHunger CityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ that was the backdrop to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s take on George OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1984 .
With the band relegated to the shadows , each song was presented as a mini - drama with dancers choreographed by Toni Basil , with Bowie , rail - thin and shorn of his Aladdin Sane locks , at times hovering over the audience in a cherry - picker or enclosed in a Ã¢â¬Åglass asylumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The wildly imaginative and financially ruinous set was abandoned , along with much of the band , halfway through the tour after a break for recording what would become the Young Americans album .
Instead audiences were treated to a stripped - down , funked - up soul revue reflective of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest change of direction .
Neither version of the tour was ever seen outside North America .
Nassau Coliseum , Uniondale , New York , 23 March 1976 When Bowie re - emerged after moving to LA and filming The Man Who Fell to Earth , it was as the Thin White Duke , an icy , Mittel European persona reflecting BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cocaine - fuelled dark side .
The staging was monochrome and stark : Bowie dressed in white shirt with black trousers and waistcoat standing in front of a dazzling wall of vertical white striplights .
The Long Island audience had been warmed up with a projection of DalÃÂ­ and BuÃÂ±uelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Un Chien Andalou , eye - slitting sequence and all .
The band , again built around the rhythm section of Carlos Alomar ( guitar ) , Dennis Davis ( drums ) and George Murray ( bass ) , hit an overpowering groove , cranking out , among other highlights , this searing version of Stay .
Madison Square Garden , New York , 9 January 1997
Bowie chose to celebrate his 50th birthday with a concert in the heart of his adopted home town .
The show came packed with special guests , including Frank Black , Dave Grohl and Billy Corgan , largely chosen , it seemed Ã¢â¬ â with the exception of Lou Reed Ã¢â¬ â to stress BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s relevance to a younger generation ( he was mixing the drum - and - bass - influenced Earthling at the time ) .
The pick of the sidekicks was probably Robert Smith of the Cure , who duetted on Quicksand , a song more than a quarter - century old but sounding as fresh and perplexing as ever .
Bowie , sporting an Alexander McQueen coat and a mephistophelean goatee , wore his half - century of less than healthy living lightly .
Roseland Ballroom , New York City , 19 July 2000
Bowie broke new ground by playing a special show for fans who were members of BowieNet , his pioneering online community .
With shoulder - length blond hair recalling the original cover of The Man Who Sold the World , he delivered a crowd - pleasing , hits - heavy set Ã¢â¬ â opening with a shimmering Wild Is the Wind Ã¢â¬ â that prefigured his acclaimed appearance at Glastonbury that summer .
And in the encore Bowie delved back into his prehistory to perform I Dig Everything and The London Boys for the first time since his mid-60s mod phase .
His now regular bass player Gail Ann Dorsey took the Freddie Mercury part on Under Pressure , and
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance was transformed , emerging out of a dreamy , extended introduction .
One fan , who said his first Bowie concert had been in 1976 , was unequivocal :
Ã¢â¬ÅBest
Bowie show ever.Ã¢â¬

This article was amended on 16 January 2016 to correct the location of the Nassau Coliseum ."
2016-01-12,"Hundreds of people gathered in Brixton , south London , on Monday night to start an impromptu party in the area where David Bowie was born , lighting candles and singing his greatest hits .
Standing under a mural of the singer as brass and guitar players blasted out his best - loved tracks to surrounding crowds , Chris Hall and his niece Tallula Barrett represented two of a range of generations who were impacted by the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life and work .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve basically come to celebrate the life of a great man whose early work I remember very well ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
explained Hall , as others nearby passed around drinks at a gathering that was showing little sign of ending after night fell .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe used to play LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance on the way to school every single day , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ added Barrett . Ã¢â¬ÅHe was everything to me .
The way he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to conform to anyone elseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ideas and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
what drove me to become an artist and an actor
too.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The dominant generation appeared to be that of twentysomethings .
Too young to remember BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 80s period , let alone his earlier glam rock persona , the words of his timeless songs still came naturally to them as they sang along and danced .
Helping along was the arrival of a a large set of speakers strapped to the top of a car .
Hundreds converged on it , while other smaller groups sang along to guitar accompaniments at other locations , including at the Ritzy Cinema , which had Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie : Our Brixton Boy .
RIPÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ written in the lettering above its entrance .
Dotted on faces around the crowds from virtually every viewpoint were versions of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s iconic thunderbolt makeup from his Ziggy period .
Its wearers included 20-year - old Courtney Hopkins , from Birmingham , who laughed : Ã¢â¬ÅI finished work at 10 and I came straight afterwords , so I am actually also in my work uniformÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅMy mum got me into him really , to the point where I stole her vinyl copy of LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance .
I like what he stood for and that he has made people of any gender or whatever feel normal.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Inge Laursen , a self - described child of the 1970s , said : Ã¢â¬ÅHe has liberated all of us , hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t he ?
Ã¢â¬ÅI
saw it on the news that people were going to gather here and thought that I really wanted to come and celebrate his life .
Unfortunately a lot of the party seems to be over , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve hung and orchid and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been trying to light candles.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-12,"Few did more to capture David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fast - moving path through influences and styles than Mick Rock , AKA the man who shot the 70s .
The Cambridge - educated photographer , whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d cut his photographic teeth with Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett , shot tens of thousands of frames of Bowie .
Best known Ã¢â¬ â and numbering around 5,000 Ã¢â¬
â are those from the Ziggy Stardust era , when the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ability to transform and inhabit different roles was at its most extreme .
Rock says BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s real talent was in a kind of synthesis .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen asked why he was so successful at different styles , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d say , Ã¢â¬ËBecause I was always the second.Ã¢â¬ â¢
The Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham says the same thing Ã¢â¬ â itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s always the second person who makes all the money , not the originator .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid was a kind of synthesiser , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Rock .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe never really copied anybody
but he was brilliant at drawing on different elements of other people .
It was like he was very absorbent and very quick to pick up on things .
In the early days of Ziggy , people would call it drag rock .
It was never actually drag , though he was super feminised in some ways .
It was a space thing but also kabuki theatre where all the female and male parts are switched .
Lindsay Kemp turned him on to costume and makeup .
Then he went to Tokyo and got all this makeup and costumes from Kansai Yamamoto.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He adds : Ã¢â¬ÅThe thing with David was he could make things happen and he was very good at stimulating other peopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creativity , including my own .
Look what he did for Mott the Hoople and Iggy Pop Ã¢â¬ â though at the time Raw Power was regarded as a complete loser .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influences were so disparate and he was drawn to whatever was stimulating him at the time .
I heard an incredible version he did of Bruce SpringsteenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Hard to Be a Saint
In the City that was a lot more interesting than BruceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s version .
It was only in the 80s that he was a bit at sea .
But then we were all at sea then .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ d say that LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance period was his least creative period .
He took the money and ran .
He didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t hold it in high esteem.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
After Bowie cleaned up in the late 70s , Rock , who also directed BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first videos in the days before videos really existed , lost touch with him until a heart bypass in 1996 .
Reed and Bowie were the first to send flowers and signed RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pictures for sale .
As the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s demise sinks in , Rock feels that only one other set of artists came close to Bowie , Pop and Reed in terms of durability of the music of the early 70s glam scene .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was the Holy Trinity Ã¢â¬ â David , Iggy and Lou Ã¢â¬ â and Roxy Music .
He held them in high esteem.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But Bowie always wanted to keep moving .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was overwhelmed by the Ziggy thing .
I remember the night before the last Hammersmith Odeon show he said ,
Ã¢â¬ËTomorrowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s it.Ã¢â¬ â¢
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sure if he meant he was never going to perform again
or he was never going to do Ziggy again .
He felt trapped by it .
By the time he went to Germany with Iggy Pop
it was all about smack [ heroin ] .
Him and Iggy and smack .
He was a big fan of Kraftwerk and heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d got interested in computers so he had Brian Eno come over and do his treatments.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But despite these successful collaborations over the years , Rock recalls , Bowie could end up feeling stifled .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor a time , he avoided playing his old material .
There was the Black Tie , White Noise stuff and supporting Nine Inch Nails .
He wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t getting any pats on the back .
I remember him coming back from playing Glastonbury in 2000 .
He said , Ã¢â¬ËThey love me again .
I played all the old stuff.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅHe was infinitely curious .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ d been to art school like a lot of the British rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollers but heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d left school at 15 .
I found early on his range of references were broader than the people IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d known at Cambridge .
His brain worked across the spectrum and he was constantly referring me to very obscure things .
He kept morphing and wriggling around .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople call him a chameleon and of course he was .
He was a synthesizer .
But he also acknowledged his sources of inspiration .
Look at the elements he was dealing with and look how brave he was
Ã¢â¬ â
he was producing to the end when he obviously knew what was going on inside of him .
He said it without saying it in Blackstar [ his final album ] and the play Lazarus [ currently being performed in New York ] .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t expect it to happen three days after his birthday , but he knew it was coming.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

2016-01-12,"I think it was called Sunshine Records , a small shop near Woodford tube station at the bottom of my road .
I was 11 , perhaps already 12 , and pop music was beginning to take over my life .
My first purchases were hit and miss , mostly miss ; a couple of forgettable New Wave singles and a Britfunk song that I played on an ancient dansette record player that had belonged to my mum ( the kind with a heavy lid and a speaker hidden behind a fabric cover at the front ) .
I owned one album , by Ultravox , a band I liked for their bombast and portentousness .
They sounded epic , an escape from the mundanity of my daily life , the racist bullies at school , the nameless sexual yearning that already threatened to overwhelm me .
I had enough money
( ÃÂ£1.99 ?
ÃÂ£2.99 ? )
to buy another album , but only an old one .
New releases cost more .
So instead of whatever chart act I coveted ( likely Adam and the Ants )
I found myself flicking through the reissue bin .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d never heard of any of the artists .
All I had to go on was the covers .
For a kid with a science fiction habit , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was an instantly intriguing title .
Something about the colourised cover photo seemed askew ; out of time .
The singer was called David Bowie , a boyÃ¢â¬ â¢
s name , but no boy would dress in shiny purple boots and a turquoise jumpsuit , open to the waist .
Carrying a guitar , he or she was posed outside a grim - looking Victorian building on a city street .
It was night , and the scene looked threatening , yet this creature , bathed in yellow lamplight , seemed swaggering and confident , one foot up on a low wall .
If some skinheads came along , you had the feeling that s / he would frighten them away just by playing music .
On the back cover , beside the track list , the same figure was in a phonebox , staring insolently into the camera .
I found that image frankly disturbing .
The mop of blonde hair , the lithe body , the hairless chest exposed by the unzipped jumpsuit , one nipple just visible Ã¢â¬ â
these were the kind of triggers that had begun to populate my sexual daydreams .
But , below the waist , the jumpsuitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Aztec - style circuit - board pattern was creased by an inescapably masculine bulge .
I liked girls .
Boys who liked boys were bad .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t attracted to this figure , was I ?
I found the picture upsetting , slightly repellent .
It was a message from a more complicated world .
I had an impulse to put it away , to look for something safer .
But the song titles contained thrilling science fiction words like Ã¢â¬ÅmoonÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅstarÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and in white letters at the bottom , beneath the names of various people whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d worked on the record , was a sort of challenge : Ã¢â¬ÅTo be played at maximum volume.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I went to the counter and handed over my money .
Nothing was ever the same again .
So thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my Bowie story .
It still feels private , a highly personal moment of aesthetic shock that determined much of what happened to me afterwards .
Even before IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d heard the extraordinary , otherworldly voice , or spent hours failing to unpick the elliptical lyrics , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
visual image breached my defenses and began to issue challenges .
Yet , as an adult , I know that this experience doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just belong to me .
In fact , it is almost laughably common .
Friends Ã¢â¬ â writers , artists , musicians , and others whose strangeness or wildness is expressed in non - artistic ways Ã¢â¬ â have frequently recounted stories that have the same shape , are animated by the same feeling that Bowie reached inside them and began to offer directions towards a fiercer and brighter world .
So when I say that I used to be able to make myself cry by mouthing the words to Heroes with my eyes screwed up tight , or that I find it almost impossible not to conduct an imaginary cinema orchestra when I hear the words Ã¢â¬Åsailors fighting on the dancefloorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and the sound of descending violins , I know IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m recounting something mundane , that the depth of my emotion is shared by millions of others around the world , each with their connections to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work as profound and personal as mine .
For those of us whose identity ( sexual , racial , national or otherwise ) is involuntarily ambiguous , who have to make the best of our inauthenticity , David Bowie has been a kind of secular saint .
As I began to understand that the alien figure in the phonebox was only one in a series of mutations that would continue until yesterday , with the terrible news of his death , it dawned on me that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s slipperiness was a riposte to the kind of hostile questions that dog the inauthentic , that dogged me as a teenager , that still , come to think of it , dog me today .
Questions meant to fix and crush .
What are you ?
Where are you from ?
Bowie taught me that when they demanded your identity papers , you didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to comply .
Or if you wanted , you could invent your own papers , tell whatever damn story you pleased .
His bravery and breadth will not be seen again in the world .
Nor his exalted sensibility or his beauty or his voice .
We will miss him ."
2016-01-12,"We first met in 1966 , probably late summer , when David came to see me perform in a little show called Clowns .
He was much taken by it and came to see me afterwards .
It was love at first sight .
He asked if he could study with me .
A couple of days later , he began doing classes at the Dance Centre in Covent Garden , where I was teaching .
David was a huge hit with the ladies , especially during the improvisations Ã¢â¬ â improvising sailors drowning at sea , animals hunting their prey .
Those ladies would have devoured him like the Maenads devouring Dionysus .
He seemed quite pleased about it all and came back for another class .
In improvisations , I tell people to listen to the music , to abandon themselves and become totally transported to other places , therefore becoming other characters .
David was always very good at that .
God knows , he was a chameleon .
I taught him to express and communicate through his body .
I taught him to dance .
I taught him the importance of the look Ã¢â¬ â makeup , costume , general stagecraft , performance technique .
I gave him books to read and pictures to look at .
We talked about kabuki , avant - gardists , the world of the music hall , which we were both attracted to .
David did wonderful impressions of Stan Laurel .
He was very funny .
We talked about Jean Genet , as I was creating a play based on GenetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Notre Dame des Fleurs .
It became Flowers , the show that made me not rich but famous .
We talked about him playing the protagonist .
When I met him , he had become disillusioned and was working in an office .
He may have been considering chucking in music altogether .
His voice was haunting and it evoked other favourite singers of mine , notably Jacques Brel .
He had that same kind of sentiment and storytelling ability .
He was an A student .
He fell in love with the bohemianism of my world .
Together , we began to create a show , Pierrot in Turquoise , for which he wrote the songs .
It opened at Oxford Playhouse in 1967 .
It was staged in Whitehaven , at the Mercury theatre in London and then it went on tour Ã¢â¬ â to Palmers Green .
This was the first time that he wore costume and makeup .
He played Cloud , a balladeer who commented through his songs on the action of the play , rather in the style of Brecht and Weill .
He also played other characters when needed .
We did a television version of the show called The Looking Glass Murders .
I cringe when I see it now
Ã¢â¬
â
it was so naive .
David was very easy to direct Ã¢â¬ â
he was grateful for every direction , not only in Pierrot but years later in the Ziggy Stardust stage show at the Rainbow theatre .
Rehearsals at the Rainbow were a great pleasure : we had an audience of Lou Reed and Iggy Pop ; friends would pop by with their bottles of whisky .
DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
wife Angela had visited me in Edinburgh , where I was performing Flowers .
She had the Ziggy Stardust LP .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid would like you to direct and assemble the show Ã¢â¬ â and of course to perform .
Maybe you could play Starman and Queen Bitch?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Which I did !
I was very inspired by the record and could see the show clearly .
I mimed the whole thing out to David and , a few weeks later , it opened .
The set was inspired by 1920s constructivism .
We assembled a set with various platforms , which David would very energetically clamber over Ã¢â¬ â sometimes doing costume changes up the ladder from one platform to another .
My company were all in the show , perched on different levels wearing masks .
It was very high up
Ã¢â¬
â I was terrified as I have a fear of heights .
David emerged looking marvellous , out of a lot of dry ice , and the audience went crazy .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never performed in or directed a show in such a vast venue .
And so I was credited with marrying the theatre to rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll .
There were other projects that didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t happen .
David thought of doing a musical version of Charles KingsleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book The Water Babies .
I asked if I could play Mrs Doasyouwouldbedoneby .
One Christmas , I asked him to play Puss in Boots in Musselburgh .
His agent came back and said that ÃÂ£10 a week wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really enough Ã¢â¬ â could I get it up to ÃÂ£15 ?
Management said no , we couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
What Musselburgh missed !"
2016-01-12,"Ã¢â¬ÅA complete surprise , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Brian Eno .
Ã¢â¬ÅShocked , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Peter Gabriel .
After more than 40 years of friendship and , in the case of Eno , regular email exchanges , the news of
David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death Sunday appeared staggering and unexpected to his friends .
The rest of us were surprised and shocked too .
Bowie had managed to hide his terminal cancer from almost everyone , even flashing a joyous smile for the release of his new album .
Bowie may have been a profoundly unique musician , but his secrecy regarding his terminal condition is increasingly common .
Death , particularly for those in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s generation , is becoming something to control Ã¢â¬
â an event to arrange and manage .
The effect can be heartbreaking for friends and fans who had no chance to say goodbye .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also a way for the dying to avoid what they may consider the indignities of disease and the exhaustion of attention .
As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age and encounter infirmity and terminal disease , they will continue to demand greater control , refusing to follow doctors into painful treatments and life - extending measures .
A good death to this demographic group does not come to the oldest , but to those who have lived well up to the very end .
The death of David Bowie was well choreographed , a produced roll - out of images and information .
Blackstar , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest and last album , released on his 69th birthday , flew to the top of UK and US charts a few days before his death .
Publicity photos , possibly taken then , show him standing , chic as ever , in a dark suit and jaunty hat , a metal roll - up door behind him , his head thrown back in an exuberant laugh .
It was the laugh of vitality until , two days later , it was a laugh of defiance .
Baby boomers , those like Bowie between the ages of 51 and 70 , who were born just after the second World War , have been a restless , relentless generation .
Their protests in the 1960s and 70s were no more enthusiastic than their embrace of financial security in the 1980s .
Boomers have reformed and reinforced every caprice of their age , so itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no wonder that now , as they confront aging and the ends of their lives , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re choosing quality of life over quantity .
That means making time for bucket list adventures , foregoing those heroic Ã¢â¬Ådo everythingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ treatments and
yes , planning every detail of their deaths .
In 2012 , Hollywood gasped when the death of Nora Ephron , screenwriter of Silkwood , When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle , was unexpectedly announced .
Ephron had told no one .
But she left clues in her final book , I Remember Nothing , that her days were numbered .
Hiding terminal diagnoses is a way for patients to control their deaths .
Ã¢â¬ÅBoomers have never been a stoic bunch , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ gerontologist Ken Dychtwald told Time magazine in 2013 .
Ã¢â¬ÅTheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not going to allow their last chapter in life to be an extended period of loss , fear , pain and suffering.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ BoomersÃ¢â¬ â¢ efforts to change the way Americans die are already being felt .
Not willing to linger for years in nursing homes , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re pressing for the legalization of aid in dying , the legal right to receive a lethal dose of medication from their doctor when they have six months or less to live .
The movement has garnered a groundswell of support in the past two decades , with four of the five states where it is legal passing their laws ( or in the case of Montana , deciding their court cases ) in the past six years .
More than a dozen other states have grassroots initiatives underway , with six actively considering legislation .
Efforts to better plan end - of - life
care decisions have garnered attention , too , in recent years , with a proliferation of resources for elders to organize their finances and their end - of - life decisions .
Hospice use and home deaths are increasing .
A number of bestselling books have recently brought planning options and elder care issues out into the open , including Atul GawandeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Being Mortal and Katy ButlerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Knocking on HeavenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Door , in which both chronicled the long and painful deaths of their fathers and addressed medicineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vagaries .
Bowie had every right to protect the privacy of his final days , and if the reports are true that his terminal liver cancer began in his lungs ( a common path for lung cancer ) , this was likely a second round .
He long knew then what was coming ; the five - year survival rate from liver cancer is about 16 % .
And it seems he wasted no time in orchestrating his final days .
Like everything else Bowie made acceptable for his fans Ã¢â¬ â fluid genders , flamboyant , outrageous clothes , dreams of equality and other worlds
Ã¢â¬ â this grand and surprising final exit may signal to the 76 million Baby Boomers now facing their own twilight that thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no harm in going out your own way ."
2016-01-12,"In my early 20s , there was a period when all I owned was about a dozen CDs and a crappy Discman .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d listen to The Man Who Sold The World album endlessly as I sat on off - peak trains jerking around the Sussex countryside to and from the asylum I worked in .
I loved the idea of Bowie as an artist , with his Burroughsian cut - up technique , creating these undecipherable , abstract songs , where we all projected our own meanings onto his jarring word choices and unexpected chord changes .
It occurred to me one day that the song After All , which had sounded like nonsense at first , was about mental illness , and I suppose possibly about his half - brother , who had been a schizophrenic .
It was odd to hear something from 1970 dealing with mental illness so compassionately , so beautifully , at a period when the only time it really came up in culture was when a detective in a movie was profiling a serial killer .
I think afterwards I always listened to his songs feeling that there was probably some explicit meaning intended if you could work it out .
And thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s kind of how I enjoyed Bowie , trying to work out what he was getting at .
Life on Mars for me became about American movie culture swamping our imaginations , Queen Bitch about a guy living a straight life wishing he had the courage to fuck ( or perhaps become ) a transvestite prostitute .
Once I went to Oslo on holiday and there was a huge crowd outside the hotel .
It turned out that Bowie was playing next door .
I bought a ticket after a halfhearted attempt to haggle with the most reasonable tout in the world ( Ã¢â¬ÅYou understand I have to charge a little extra
, this is in the nature of buying tickets and selling them on , yes?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
The crowd kept shouting out requests and he settled them with a very gentle and charming :
Ã¢â¬ÅDonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t worry , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to play all the hits , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to be here for absolutely ages.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Yesterday , my girlfriend woke me with Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie is deadÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
We have a game that started after Nelson Mandela died and I tweeted Ã¢â¬ÅNelson MandeadaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ; itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s basically to think of a dead pun involving the recently deceased celebrity .
Prone Rivers ; Robin Killshimself , that kind of thing .
I really didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have the heart , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to pun on Bowie anyway , when nobody is ever really quite sure how to pronounce it .
Ã¢â¬ÅAre you in mourning?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she laughed as she went to work .
Ã¢â¬ÅYeah ,
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in mourning , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I laughed back .
I stood , as a 43-year - old man , and cried in the shower ."
2016-01-12,"Ã¢â¬ÅIt is a sign of our times that a man with a painted face and carefully adjusted lipstick should inspire adoration from an audience of girls aged between 14 and 20 .
An ex - art student from Brixton whose dad worked for Dr BarnardoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s homes has turned himself into a bizarre self - constructed freak.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
That was Bernard Falk in a 1973 BBC Nationwide special , a reminder of the sneering hostility of the Britain in which David Bowie was incubated : hostile to female fans , to queerness in every sense of the word , to working - class kids who dared to defy narrow social expectations , and especially to aliens .
For many immigrant children growing up in south London suburbia Ã¢â¬ â me included Ã¢â¬ â David Bowie proved an unexpectedly powerful inspiration .
My seminal David Bowie moment was the cross - dressing weirdness of his 1979 Boys
Keep Swinging video : a conventionally good - looking white guy who chose to stand out , to attract hatred and ridicule .
All the stuff second - generation immigrant children were desperate to avoid .
He even appealed to some parents , who loathed the air of donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t - care promiscuity given off by most of the long - haired tight - trousered pop dudes on Top of the Pops .
My mum recognised an ambitious and hard - working young man who was going places .
She called the pre - teen me into the living room one night to watch him being interviewed : Ã¢â¬ÅWithout all that make - up heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so handsome , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she declared in obvious delight .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd SO intelligent.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I knew he was welcome in the Ahmed home ever after .
The official macho rock consensus of the past 20 years decreed that 80s
Bowie was an aberration to be ignored .
But for British - Asian girls of the Smash Hits generation raised on catchy singles and pretentious pop videos , Bowie never failed to provide delight : Rupa Huq , now Labour MP for Ealing where she grew up , remembers her British - Bangladeshi family sitting together in their front room watching Bowie in top hat and morning dress marry a Muslim bride in the 1985 Loving the Alien video .
WTF ?
One of us !
As we grew up we dug deeper , backwards into BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue .
But the key connection with suburban girls and boys from outsider backgrounds was that determination to escape , as I found when I made my Radio 4 documentary
I Dressed Ziggy Stardust .
Dana Gillespie , who went out with the pre - Bowie David Jones , recalled the shock of going into his house : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid looked like a stranger in his own home .
There was a sadness about the whole thing .
It was him wanting to get away from his roots that drove him .
He had that extra killer instinct which you need if you want to step up and out of where youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
While we came to admire BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s later dignified detachment from the madness of celebrity , it came only after the early years of attention - seeking graft : the awkward velvet - suited posing of the early Shadows - esque pop boy in The Konrads ; the Lyons Maid LUV ice - lolly ad in which he appears as a groovester ; the Carnaby Street magazine fashion shoot where heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in the background , because he would commute in to hang around and get noticed ; his appearance , aged just 17 , in a 1964 Tonight interview as founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long - Haired Men : Ã¢â¬ÅFor the past two years weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had comments like Ã¢â¬ËDarlingÃ¢â¬ â¢ and Ã¢â¬Ëcan I carry your handbag?Ã¢â¬ â¢ and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really got to stop now.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He even had a text book : In the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bowie exhibition was a copy of the Observer Book of Music that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d used to teach himself .
David Bowie had the hard - work ethic of the immigrant determined to better himself .
Every time I go to visit my dad in Bromley , I still marvel at the single - minded determination of the young David Jones to get the hell out and the unexpected suburban escape he offered others even while he stayed .
The Anglo - Indian photographer
Hy Money was struggling with her own identity in a rather racist London when she took her children to see him perform at the sitars - mime - and - puppetry happening that was the Arts Lab in Beckenham and experienced an epiphany
: Ã¢â¬ÅIt [ the Bowie home ] was so dark and red and mystic and it was exotic and there was this incense .
Up until then IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d come to this country and thought of myself as a child of the British Raj .
And so I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to think of myself as Asian .
I didnÃ¢â¬

She felt deeply moved by the experience .
Female fans such as the future journalist Shyama Perera were a regular presence on his doorstep at Haddon Hall and at the stage door .
She recalls her outraged mother calling her a Ã¢â¬ÅstreetwalkerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for her devotion to going out at night to spot him about town .
She remembers how Angie Bowie wrote beautiful letters to thank them for their drawings and gifts and how his PR woman , Cherry Vanilla , helped them all get into concerts .
So while every establishment figure from the prime minister to the archbishop of Canterbury is declaring their love today , I will be remembering David Bowie as the south London boy who encouraged us all to love the alien within ."
2016-01-12,"Sales of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album , Blackstar , have soared after the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , as a series of tribute shows and memorial events in his honour were announced .
Sales and downloads of Blackstar , released on the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 69th birthday two days before he died , have reached 43,000 in the UK in the 24 hours since the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death shook the world .
The critically acclaimed album , described by his long - term producer and friend Tony Visconti as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åparting
giftÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , has also topped the iTunes charts , and more than half of the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top 40 chart has been taken up by albums from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue .
Spotify has reported that global streams of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music were up by 2,822 % since Monday Ã¢â¬ â totalling more than 6.5 m listens
Ã¢â¬ â and Life on Mars , Heroes , LetÃ¢â¬

It was announced on Tuesday that a tribute would be paid to Bowie at the Brit awards in February , celebrating what the chairman , Max Lousada , described as the Ã¢â¬Åextraordinary life and work of one of our greatest iconsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Carnegie hall will also host a memorial concert on 31 March .
The show , announced hours before BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , was originally scheduled as a tribute with performances of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hit songs by Visconti , Cyndi Lauper , and The Roots among others .
But the event that organisers spent the last seven months planningwill now memorialise BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life and his influence on music .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis
yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s concert will certainly be remembered as a poignant celebration of his music by his friends , peers , and fans , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ a statement on the organisersÃ¢â¬ â¢ website said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe show is taking on many more emotions .
RIP David and may GodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s love be with you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie died age 69 after suffering from cancer for 18 months .
Notoriously private , Bowie kept his illness a secret until the end , only letting a small inner circle know of his diagnosis .
The musicians who worked with Bowie on jazz - inspired Blackstar have said they had no idea the musician was ill , and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family have chosen not to confirm what type of cancer he had , the circumstances around his death or where he died .
The family have also requested that those close to Bowie do not give interviews .
It is thought the Brixton - born singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s funeral will be held in New York , where he moved to in 1993 after marrying his second wife , Iman , and where they raised their daughter , Alexandria .
ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s supergroup , Holy Holy , which also features BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Spiders From Mars drummer Woody Woodmansey , will also perform two tribute shows to Bowie on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Toronto Opera House .
Ivo van Hove , director of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical Lazarus , was one of the few people Bowie had informed of his illness , in November 2014 , to explain why he would not be able to attend all rehearsals .
The singer had asked that van Hove keep the information to himself .
The director said Bowie had Ã¢â¬Åfought like a lionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ through his illness and had been determined to keep working to the end .
Speaking about Lazarus rehearsals , Van Hove told the New York Times that Bowie came Ã¢â¬Åwhenever he couldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He said : Ã¢â¬ÅSometimes he sent me an email
Ã¢â¬
â
Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had a bad dayÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ â but he was very close to the whole process.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The director said that on the productionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opening night last month , the last time the singer was seen in public , Bowie had seemed very frail , adding : Ã¢â¬ÅI felt it deeply , that this would be the last time I see him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-12,"Now that the great man has gone , if thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s anyone qualified to carry David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eclectic pop mantle into the future it is the New Zealand artist Lorde .
He once said her music was like Ã¢â¬Ålistening to tomorrowÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ; she is BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sister from another alien mother .
Lorde posted a moving tribute to Bowie on Facebook on Tuesday , saying she had never met a hero she liked until she met him .
She described Bowie as Ã¢â¬Åa piece of bright pleated silk we could stretch out or fold up small inside ourselves when we needed toÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
She was nearly 17 and performing at a party honouring the actor Tilda Swinton at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Museum of Modern Art .
After the show Bowie requested a meeting .
They held hands , chatted and stared into each otherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eyes .
A few months later she described the experience in an interview with Rookie .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is David BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s hand , what am I doing?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
she thought .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was insane .
A beautiful moment .
Ã¢â¬ÅI never tell anyone about that experience because it meant so much to me , and I feel like it would be dulled or something if I always talked about it in magazines or whatever .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my special thing.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In her tribute on Facebook , Lorde said Ã¢â¬Åsomething changedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in her that evening .
Meeting Bowie , Ã¢â¬Åan old rock and roll alien angel in a perfect grey suitÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , had heralded her into her next new life .
She suddenly felt calm , self - assured .
Ã¢â¬ÅI realised everything IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d ever done , or would do from then on , would be done like maybe he was watching .
I realised I was proud of my spiky strangeness because he had been proud of his .
And I know IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m never going to stop learning dances , brand new dances.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
LordeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s tribute to Davie Bowie in full When a hero dies , everyone wants a quote .
I woke up this morning with a tender head from tears and that big red cup of Japanese whiskey , gulped last night just after the news came .
People were already asking me what I thought .
It feels kind of garish to talk about oneself at a time like this , when the thing that has happened is so distinctly world - sized .
But everything IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve read or seen since the news has been deeply intrinsic in tone , almost selfish , like therapy .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s who he was to all of us .
He was a piece of bright pleated silk we could stretch out or fold up small inside ourselves when we needed to .
Mr Bowie , I guess right now we have to hang this thing up for a minute .
The night I met him
I played at an expensive Vogue benefit with a lot of fresh flowers , honouring Tilda .
I was not quite 17 , America was very new to me , and I was distinctly uneasy and distrustful toward everything happening in my life that was putting me in these flat - voiced , narrow - eyed , champagneish rooms .
I played my three songs , thrashing and twitching in platform boots .
Afterward , Anna clasped my hand and said Ã¢â¬ÅDavid wants to meet youÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and led me through people and round tables with candles and glasses and louder and louder talk , and he was there .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never met a hero of mine and liked it .
It just sucks , the pressure is too huge , you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t enjoy it .
David was different .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll never forget the caressing of our hands as we spoke , or the light in his eyes .
That night something changed in me
Ã¢â¬
â
I felt a calmness grow ,
a sureness .
I think in those brief moments , he heralded me into my next new life , an old rock and roll alien angel in a perfect grey suit .
I realised everything IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d ever done , or would do from then on , would be done like maybe he was watching .
I realised I was proud of my spiky strangeness because he had been proud of his .
And I know IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m never going to stop learning dances , brand new dances .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not going to change , how we feel about him .
For the rest of our lives , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll always be crashing in that same car .
Thank you , David Bowie ."
2016-01-12,"As the Australian music community absorbs the news of the death of David Bowie at the age of 69 yesterday , musicians and songwriters who came of age in the 70s and early 80s
Ã¢â¬ â when Bowie was arguably at his peak
Ã¢â¬ â have spoken of his profound influence on their work and their lives .
Melbourne soloist Jen Cloher expressed the commonly recurring theme of disbelief .
Ã¢â¬ÅI turned to Courtney
[ Barnett , CloherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s partner ] last night and said , Ã¢â¬ËYou
just never thought that David Bowie would die.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Which is ludicrous , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how it feels , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was like a god.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Cloher also spoke of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s indirect impact on her as a queer artist .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe 70s in so many ways were far more dangerous , far more edgy , far more open to a broad idea of gender than today .
It would have rubbed off .
You grow up around that , and it infiltrates in ways that you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t even think about at the time.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Robert Forster , co - founder of the Go - Betweens , has often written and spoken of his admiration for Bowie .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie was obviously the most important white musical figure of the 70s , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said , when we spoke last August .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe bestrode the decade like no one else .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie was beautiful , which was confrontational for a 14- , 15-year - old boy .
The most beautiful pop star of the early 70s was a man , which is an amazing thing by itself , and Bowie played it to the hilt.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Forster also spoke of the impact the artist had on Australian cities at the time .
Ã¢â¬ÅAll the Melbourne boys at the time Ã¢â¬ â Sean Kelly [ Models , Absent Friends , the Dukes ] , James Freud [ Models ] , Nick Cave Ã¢â¬ â loved Bowie .
The Brisbane boys loved Bowie too , but they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to be Bowie .
All the Melbourne boys loved Bowie and wanted to be Bowie .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a lot of photos of those boys in make - up , believe you me !
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how the different cities took to it .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was this beautiful flittering presence , and an amazing songwriter .
It was Rebel Rebel ; it was Golden Years ; it was Diamond Dogs .
I could name every track off Ziggy Stardust and Hunky Dory .
It was Sound and Vision ; it was Heroes , it was just an amazing run.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ A few years after coming across a copy of Space Oddity / Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud in the bargain rack of an Adelaide record store , Ash Wednesday formed Australian punk rock band JAB , in 1976 .
They relocated to Melbourne shortly after .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I met him , JABÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
vocalist Bohdan [ Kubiakowski ] was a tall , striking figure with short silver hair , and a pallid complexion complemented by black lipstick and nails , wearing platform shoes , playing acoustic guitar .
Johnny Crash and I were to accompany him with an assortment of synthesisers , drum machine and drums , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said , of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
early influence .
Ã¢â¬ÅJAB was to morph into Models .
I certainly feel that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songwriting opened a gate which inspired and verified many of our early songs.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Wednesday spoke of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s penchant for reinvention .
Ã¢â¬Å[He ] cleverly metamorphosed from album to album ,
always one or two steps ahead of the media , who struggled to categorise him as he gained momentum .
It was fun to watch , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅVisually stunning , larger than life , Bowie inspired the fashion and attitude of a number of generations to come.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Yet Bowie was also remembered as an open and friendly presence , a world removed from his alien persona .
Graham Ã¢â¬ÅBuzzÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Bidstrup , who supported Bowie on his first Australian tour in 1978 as a member of the Angels , recalled Bowie introducing himself backstage over a bowl of soup .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was one of the first times I had met someone really famous who was incredibly normal , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe put to shame a number of people I met who were nowhere near as talented.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Kim Salmon , of pioneering punk - blues group the Scientists Ã¢â¬ â and later Beasts of Bourbon and the Surrealists Ã¢â¬
â posted a personal note on his Facebook page that highlighted the intergenerational nature of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cultural legacy .
Ã¢â¬ÅA few months ago I took my 11-year - old daughter to the Bowie exhibition .
Today she said it
Ã¢â¬
â
I said it
Ã¢â¬
â
he gave people permission to be exactly who they were .
When I was a 14-year - old spaced - out science fiction kid he was my man .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen my drop - dead gorgeous friend was wondering about his sexuality , Bowie gave him permission to be what he was .
Lately my daughterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been far above the world , floating in her tin can , and it hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been easy .
Bowie was there to let her know itÃ¢â¬
â¢ s OK .
Thanks to his massive body of work , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s still
there.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ David Bridie , of Not Drowning , Waving and My Friend the Chocolate Cake , also pointed to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s astonishing output .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are very few artists you could say made at least eight classic albums : Hunky Dory , Lodger , Low , Aladdin Sane , Heroes , Scary Monsters , Ziggy Stardust and Station to Station , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅFine work , Mr Jones.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅRegardless of his image or his sense of how he projected himself , there was always the songs , and he wrote some of the best pop songs ever written , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Cloher said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe transcended our idea of what rock or pop music should be .
I guess the Beatles started fucking with those ideas , but I felt that Bowie took it to the next level .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe never lost melody , his sense of what a good pop song is .
Genius is thrown around far too often , but in the case of David Bowie , he really did possess that quality.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-12,"It was 1983 and I was at university when I first saw the film clip .
Here was a music superstar featuring my own people , putting Indigenous faces on a world stage .
The song was LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , the singer David Bowie .
While the clip , shot for the most part in the small western New South Wales town of Carinda , was described by its co - director David Mallett as Ã¢â¬Åintentionally anti - racistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the song itself wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t overtly political .
But it contained a message that resonated with us : when all is against you , what else can you do ?
Ã¢â¬ÅPut on your red shoes and dance the blues!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie loved Australia Ã¢â¬ â
he had enormous success here
Ã¢â¬ â
but he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t blind to this countryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dark history .
As he said at the time , Ã¢â¬ÅAs much as I love this country , it is probably one of the most racially intolerant in the world , well in line with South Africa.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie plucked two Aboriginal performers from obscurity Ã¢â¬ â Terry Roberts and Jolene King Ã¢â¬ â to feature them in his clip .
As King told Fairfax in 2013 , Ã¢â¬Å[The clip ] showed the rest of the world that there are Indigenous people here in Australia , and that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not this textbook carbon copy of someone standing there with a spear ; that there are modern Aboriginals , and this is one version [ of them].Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ There are confronting scenes : King scrubbing floors with her hands , and Roberts barefoot , dragging heavy machinery up a busy city street .
The symbolism was unmissable : Indigenous struggle and suffering against the prosperity of white Australia .
Bowie himself summed it up to ABCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Countdown as Ã¢â¬Åa direct statement about integration of one culture with anotherÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
A world of ideas was opening up to me ; university had awakened my political consciousness , I was questioning my country and my place in it , and David Bowie was as powerful a teacher as any of my lecturers .
Remember , this was 1983 .
We were virtually invisible , black faces were rare on our screens .
I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t overstate how stunning it was to see Aboriginal people in a film clip , with David Bowie no less .
Bowie had always been important to me .
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t remember the first time I heard him , but I also canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t remember a time when I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t listen to him .
The first song of his I recall was the strange little ditty
The Laughing Gnome :
Ã¢â¬ÅHa ha ha he he
he , IÃ¢â¬
â¢ m
a laughing gnome and you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t catch meÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Not his greatest moment , but I loved it as a boy .
Later I wore out my cassettes of Hunky Dory and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust , and fell in love with songs like Changes , Life on Mars and Starman .
In my teens I briefly formed a band with fellow Bowie devotees , inspired by the punk and new wave music scene .
Bowie spoke to the outsider in all of us Ã¢â¬ â and I certainly felt like an outsider .
Yet a decade after seeing black faces in the LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance film clip , I was hosting my own national television current affairs program .
In some way , Bowie made that possible .
For my birthday last year my wife bought me the complete Bowie vinyl collection .
Today , like so many , I am profoundly sad .
As he wrote in his first hit song , Space Oddity : the stars look very different today ."
2016-01-12,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
national newspaper send - off was impressive :
front page pictures in every title ; nine pages in the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror ;
seven in the Sun ; six in the Daily Telegraph and the Times ( including its wrap - round ) ; five in the Guardian ( plus a 12-page pullout ) , five in Metro and the Daily Star .
Even the Financial Times carried a page one photo of the singer .
And then there were the leading articles , in which there was a unanimous reaction .
All extolled the virtues of a pop star who became , to quote the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s editorial , Ã¢â¬Åthe first misfit megastar.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The paper said that Ã¢â¬Åif Bowie had a genius it was not of the narrowly musical variety , rather it was in grasping the full breadth of what the pop form involves , and then mastering not only the songs but also the clothes , the performances and later the videos.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Along with plenty of the tributes , it mentioned his various personas , such as Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke , adding that with Bowie Ã¢â¬Åqueerness hit the big timeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and that his androgyny was the precursor to Ã¢â¬Åthe gathering current interest in transgender.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The Independent also thought Bowie had Ã¢â¬Åliberated a significant number of young straight people , the ones who thought they were odd , that they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fit in , who felt trapped in suburban conformity ...
He was weird , and weird was good.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It believed that Ã¢â¬Åbetween the dawn of rock Ã¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll and the coda of punkÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie Ã¢â¬Åwas truest to the spirit of music as a sensibility of rebellion , of reinvention and of scandalising the respectable .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was a consummate performer and natural showman with a startlingly original mind who captured the spirit of the times before the word zeitgeist even became fashionable.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Telegraph thought
Bowie Ã¢â¬Åmuch more than just a singer - songwriter , actor and producer ... he transcended the ordinary , continually reinventing himself , ready to abandon highly successful musical identities and styles in order never to stand still.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
It said : Ã¢â¬ÅBowie was probably the most influential figure in the renaissance of British rock and pop in the Seventies , establishing an ascendancy it has never really lost , not even to the Americans .
He was a leader of fashion ...
He eschewed the usual self - promotion of the celebrity ...
Bowie is even credited by the German foreign ministry with helping to bring down the Berlin Wall with the lyrics from his album Heroes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The Times also referred to his impact in a divided Germany , reminding readers of his concert in June 1987 , when fans on the eastern side Ã¢â¬Åflocked to the Unter den LindenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to hear BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s concert on the other side of the Wall .
They could not see him but they got the message .
The paper paid tribute to the way in which he influenced cultural change : Ã¢â¬ÅHis music conducted a dialogue with a million solitudes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The MirrorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s short leading article was excellent : Ã¢â¬ÅLegend and genius are words bandied about too loosely , yet the epitaphs barely do David Bowie justice .
The lad from an ordinary London home went on to define successive generations , constantly reinventing himself to be one of the most influential artists of many times ...
We mourn an exceptional talent.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
For the Daily Express , Bowie was Ã¢â¬Åone of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
most influential cultural iconsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with a Ã¢â¬Åflair , originality and gift for reinventionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
that Ã¢â¬Åinfluenced countless artists from around the world.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Sun carried a piece by Dylan Jones in which he argued that Bowie Ã¢â¬Åmeant so much more than The Beatles , because he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just create a huge body of music , didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just release a bunch of singles and albums which influenced people at formative stages of their lives .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe also influenced how they looked , what they read and how they lived their lives.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Lesley - Ann Jones , writing in the Mail , recalled her days as a fan before , as a journalist , she became his friend and was able to offer an insiderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s view of his domestic life .
Whatever the changes over the years , she concluded that he was a Ã¢â¬Åboy from Brixton who conquered the world but never lost touch with himself ; or forgot , behind the make - up and the suits and the millions , who he really was.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
NB :
Clearly , it was also a day to bury glad news about another iconic character .
The Times carried the announcement of 84-year - old Rupert MurdochÃ¢â¬ â¢ s engagement to 59-year - old Jerry Hall .
If it leads to the altar , it will be his fourth marriage and , arguably , her first ."
2016-01-12,"Rollins has barely started this spoken - word performance when he starts talking about David Bowie .
A heartfelt tribute morphs into an anecdote , from 1997 , when his Rollins Band appeared on the same bill as Bowie at a festival , where the former punk found himself gazing silently at his hero in a foyer , like he was watching a rare bird .
Ã¢â¬ÅThen he stops , turns and looks right at me .
He says , Ã¢â¬ËRollins!Ã¢â¬ â¢ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m like , Ã¢â¬ËDavid?!Ã¢â¬ â¢
Implausibly , it turns out that Bowie was a Rollins fan , and ended up quoting the younger manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s books and even interview quotes back at him over lunch , during which an increasingly incredulous Rollins casually mentioned that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d love to meet Lou Reed .
A few weeks later , he was at home in his solitary Ã¢â¬Åman - holeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ when the phone rang .
Ã¢â¬ÅHenry .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lou Reed .
David said you wanted to talk.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an eyebrow - elevating but lovely story , which is typical of this three - hour marathon , during which Rollins uses the vehicle of an awed fan who got lucky to deliver heartfelt insights , self - deprecating comedy and walloping home truths .
The time flies , because RollinsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s delivery is every bit as honed and intense as when he Ã¢â¬Åwaged warÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with Black Flag and the Rollins Band .
Now 55 Ã¢â¬ â something he seems preoccupied by Ã¢â¬ â and grey , he no longer rampages around the stage , but his wordplay hurtles across countless subjects .
He discourses on everything from Los Angeles hairdressers ( Ã¢â¬ÅThey ask , Ã¢â¬ËHow do you feel about your hair?Ã¢â¬ â¢
I tell them I want it off my headÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and his cameos in awful movies to the Newcastle cold and how punk rock brought liberation from his racist father .
One minute weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re in Antarctica Ã¢â¬ â among penguin poo ( his big concern now is global warming ) ,
the next in LemmyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s small LA apartment .
It turns out Rollins knew the late MotÃÂ¶rhead singer too , and predictable yarns about the rock bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unfeasible capacity for alcohol give way to valuable insights on loneliness and freedom .
There are moments where itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s difficult to know where heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going with something , but not many .
If overarching themes emerge , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that Ã¢â¬Åbig - balledÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ macho Americans who hate science , socialists and Ã¢â¬Åyour Kenyan trickster
presidentÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ are the bane of humanity and that science about approaching environmental doom is Ã¢â¬Å50 times worse than the reportsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
After explaining why he visits the countries Dubya Bush warned him not to , he pulls everything together with a final thought : that travel and experience of other cultures offers a route to humanityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s salvation .
Ã¢â¬ÅI meet too many good people to believe that all is lost.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â¢ RollinsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Charmingly Obstinate tour visits Bridgewater Hall , Manchester , tonight .
Box office : 0161 - 907 9000 .
Then touring ."
2016-01-12,"It was just after dawn when , huddled against the bitter cold , a group of 50 junior doctors , retired medical professors and union activists gathered outside a funeral home near Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport , Greater Manchester .
Some held David Bowie - inspired placards labelling Jeremy Hunt Ã¢â¬ÅThe Man
Who Sold the WorldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and declaring Ã¢â¬ÅAll
The Young Dudes were Rebel Rebel - ingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , while one doctor brought a papier mÃÂ¢chÃ
Â© vulture that later withered in the rain .
Dr Stefano Prisco Penna , 26 , had gone straight to the picket line after finishing a nine - hour night shift in A&amp;E. Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m pretty knackered , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said , passing round Jaffa Cakes and Jelly Babies .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe work very hard ; weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been put under a lot of pressure and stress .
We do a lot for our patients , and for the government to say , Ã¢â¬ËWe donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to pay you for that effortÃ¢â¬ â¢ is a massive kick in the teeth.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Across England , as many as 38,000 members of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) walked out at 8 am in the first strike by junior doctors in 40 years .
The majority of those manning the 150 picket lines had not been born the last time doctors took industrial action , in 1975 .
Clutching a placard for the first time since his youth , Raymond Tallis , 69 , the former professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester , said he had been Ã¢â¬Åradicalised by the brutal assault on the NHSÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve not marched since I was a student , but I was radicalised as a result of Andrew LansleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Health and Social Care Act Ã¢â¬ â itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a direct assault on the principles of the NHS , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s now happening is what Chomsky said : the government want to defund , discredit , denigrate , devolve and denationalise .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the plan .
I was a doctor for 37 years
Ã¢â¬ â
this is a destruction of all I feel the NHS stood for.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Barely two hours into the strike , the first hospital emergency was declared .
Doctors outside Sandwell hospital in West Bromwich were ordered to return to their wards to help alleviate a Ã¢â¬Åsurge in activityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Some did return to the hospital , but others held out , accusing the hospital of using bullying tactics and pointing out that the letter sent to striking doctors by Dr Roger Stedman , the medical director of Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals , was dated Monday .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy first reaction was to cry when they called us back in , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Dr Anne De Bray , who has worked at the hospital for a year .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s been well planned .
They said they would call us individually if they needed us to come back into work .
Instead theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve emailed us a letter that was dated Monday , 15 minutes before our picket line was due to start.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At lunchtime , by which point 16,000 junior doctors were away from their wards and 3,300 operations had been cancelled , Jeremy Hunt spoke on the radio .
The strike action was very disappointing , the health secretary told BBC Radio 4Ã¢â¬ â¢ s World at One .
He urged junior doctors to get back to the negotiating table instead of continuing with Ã¢â¬Åthese very unnecessary strikesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The BMA , meanwhile , insisted that it was open to negotiation to resolve the dispute that began four months ago .
The government has offered an 11 % rise in basic pay for junior medics , but at a price : other elements of the pay package are to be curbed .
The number of hours during the working week that are classed as unsociable Ã¢â¬ â and therefore incur an extra payment Ã¢â¬ â is to be cut by 25 % .
For some , that is a cut too far .
Dr Helen Rielly , 36 , a paediatric registrar , went home in tears on Monday following an exhausting 14-hour shift that left her on the brink of quitting the NHS she loves .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see my family , my young daughter ; it was incredibly stressful at work ; high - intensity .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have any rest periods , any food or drink , and I was very thirsty at the end of my shift and couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t speak very well when I was handing over to my colleagues
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said , shivering in the cold outside Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport .
Ã¢â¬ÅI just felt so demoralised , and I went home in tears .
I realised that I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do any more of those shifts for less pay .
To do one every now and again is really hard work , but to do them the majority of the time Ã¢â¬ â which is what the government is trying to do Ã¢â¬ â would be so unsafe and unmanageable that IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d have to seriously think about what I would do with my work.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In Manchester , Dr Marianne Hilton , 36 , said the NHS was at breaking point and that she no longer felt confident in her ability to uphold the Hippocratic oath , which she took when she qualified in 2008 .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf the contract is imposed , then doctors will find it difficult to work safely and uphold their oath to do no harm , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m exhausted , and you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have the safeguards in place and youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re constantly bombarded with negativity by some of the media .
It has become too much.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
As the afternoon drew on , many of the picket lines disbanded as doctors prepared for emergency care shifts on Tuesday night .
At Sandwell hospital , executives said it was no longer necessary for medics to return to work .
Hospital executives fiercely denied that it had played political games by declaring an urgent incident , insisting that it was Ã¢â¬Ånot party to the national dispute in any wayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
With two larger walkouts planned in the next four weeks , HuntÃ¢â¬ â¢ s officials and the BMA are expected to get round the table again later this week to try to settle the dispute .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe deeply regret the level of disruption caused , but this is a fight for the long - term safety of patients and junior doctorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ working lives , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Dr Johann Malawana , chair of the BMAÃ¢â¬ â¢ s junior doctorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ committee ."
2016-01-13,"The past couple of days have been saturated with remembrances of David Bowie , who died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 69 .
Of course , much has been said about his towering music career .
However , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dry sense of humour is also worthy of note : he could be downright hilarious .
Bowie deftly navigated the world of comedy like a pro , unafraid of being made a fool of or losing his cool Ã¢â¬ â which of course was impregnable in any case .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a quality many professional comedians saw and appreciated in the rocker .
His gameness for goofing on himself was on full display during his multiple appearances on Conan OÃ¢â¬ â¢ BrienÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former show , Late Night .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe man was always outstanding , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ OÃ¢â¬ â¢
Brien noted on his TBS show in a tribute to Bowie on Monday night .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople remember what a phenomenal musician David Bowie was and that was the case : he was mind - blowingly talented.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
However , he also Ã¢â¬Åwas fun and he was always funnyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In one of his most memorable appearances , Bowie took part in a recurring Late Night gag known as Secrets where celebrities reveal their innermost thoughts .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was on tour in the United States back in Ã¢â¬ â¢ 89 and we did a show in Cincinnati , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ a deadpan
Bowie said , staring into the camera while holding a lit cigarette .
Ã¢â¬ÅDuring that show , I shouted out , Ã¢â¬ËItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great to be in Cincinnati!Ã¢â¬ â¢
That was a lie.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interest in the goofy even stretched into animation , as he was known to be a fervent fan of Spongebob Squarepants Ã¢â¬ â so much so that he voiced a role in a 2007 TV movie dubbed SpongeBobÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Atlantis SquarePantis .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve hit the holy grail of animation gigs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie said on his blog of the role at the time .
Ã¢â¬ÅYesterday I got to be a character on Ã¢â¬ Â¦ tan - tara Ã¢â¬ Â¦ SpongeBob SquarePants .
Oh Yeah ! !
We , the family , are thrilled .
Nothing else need happen this year , well , this week anyway.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
For a music legend to not only voice admiration for a Nickelodeon cartoon but turn in a role on a TV movie is a feat only someone with a career as unique as Bowie could pull off .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
fandom of Spongebob stretched so far that his first posthumous song will be a track he wrote for a forthcoming stage musical version of the cartoon to to debut in Chicago this summer .
However , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s single most memorable comedic moment Ã¢â¬ â besides a split - second , scene - stealing cameo in Zoolander for which he nabbed an MTV Movie award nomination
Ã¢â¬ â is an uproarious 2006 appearance in Extras , the follow - up to The Office starring Ricky Gervais .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s single scene also happens to double as one of the best moments of the entire acclaimed series .
The showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plot follows Gervais as his character desperately tries to navigate the thankless world of being a background actor , and in one episode he gets to meet the legend himself .
After a brief , awkward introduction between the two , Bowie is suddenly struck with inspiration for a song by the chance meeting and improvises a scathing takedown of GervaisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s loser character .
Ã¢â¬ÅLittle fat man who sold his soul , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ croons
Bowie out of the blue while a shocked Gervais looks on .
Turning around to play a nearby piano , Bowie continues : Ã¢â¬ÅChubby little loser , national joke!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ and soon leads the crowd in a sing - along .
Bowie nails the outrageous lyrics , singing the words Ã¢â¬Åpathetic little fat manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as if he were performing a ballad .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brilliant , and in a tweet following BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , writer - director Judd Apatow posted the clip and summed it up best :"

2016-01-13,"Time takes a cigarette and puts it in your mouth .
Did that happen ?
I think it happened , as I reacquaint myself with the nausea of the first fag in a while .
Grief is so physical , isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t it ?
The discombobulation , that slightly floaty feeling in your legs , a gutful of dread .
I know what grief feels like , thanks very much .
And I grieve for David Bowie .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a competition .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not just about Ã¢â¬ÅmusicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Or my lost youth .
My youth went the day I gave birth at 26
and I understood that everything was about the next generation .
And Bowie was always about what could be .
A rift has opened between those who know and those who donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
I consider myself lucky to have so many compadres of all ages who do know .
We are a little afraid of that knowledge these days .
We are vaguely aware that we wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t live for ever , but somehow we thought he might .
In some new incarnation .
We are in denial , maybe .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not the denial of the naysayers , who function in a most peculiar way .
There is a constant refrain of discomfort about public mourning from the zombified bourgeoisie who are fearful of crowds .
Fearful of feelings .
The joyous celebrations in Brixton were spontaneous .
Still the bitter mumblings about the Ã¢â¬ÅDianaficationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of England .
I wonder if some of these people take Ubers to random funerals and then correct the mourners on the permissible level of emotion .
I guess they learn this stuff in public school , where they are taught to confuse empathy with incontinence .
Certainly I got ticked off by several such types when Diana did die and I went to her funeral .
I adored her Ã¢â¬ â not because I thought she was Gloria Steinem or a closet republican because she wanted her son to be king instead of Charles Ã¢â¬
â
but because she was so brilliantly disruptive .
She simply would not accept the royal script : that Charles would keep a mistress and barely see his children .
She made her distress clear .
She did not want to breed in captivity .
So in 1997 , when she died , I had to tell the editor of the paper I worked for at the time that people were genuinely upset .
Because they were .
Not in a stupid way .
Many I spoke to were crying for her , her sons , and for their own losses .
They articulated that clearly .
This was signalling a cultural shift .
Candles and flowers .
A Protestant country looked like a Catholic one .
Or , sometimes , it was like being in India .
For one week , more anti - monarchy feeling gathered than had ever been present in all the hours I spent sitting in meetings about the need for a new constitution .
At the service in Westminster Abbey , when Earl Spencer made his dissident speech to the royals , we thought we could hear rain .
It was the gathering applause outside .
Nonetheless , people like me were Ã¢â¬ÅhystericsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Saint Christopher Hitchens claimed this mass grief was compulsory ( it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t ) and called it Ã¢â¬Åa one - party stateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The so - called left is fairly disgusted by the feelings of ordinary folk .
Just like the right .
This is passed off as a kind of iconoclasm .
How very radical not to care about the death of a young mother in a car crash .
So I feel the same about people deriding those who are mourning Bowie .
I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care if you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care .
More fool you .
For some , a hole has been ripped in the universe and we are lost , and we will be for a good while yet .
We are afraid .
For he was so damn smart and yet formed in the laboratory of creative social mobility , which we fear is also gone now .
If we can not reconstruct it , we just donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know where the new visionaries will be grown .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the social part , but the personal part is well Ã¢â¬ Â¦ not just his life .
We have his life to replay over and over .
But his death , the turning of his ending into something full of awe and humanity , is breathtaking .
Most people in the last days of cancer can not get dressed , let alone produce sounds and vision that sear our souls .
You see , we are troubled by what we now feel he was telling us and what we chose not to know .
We are troubled by the fact that , in talking of his death , we are talking of our own .
He once said : Ã¢â¬ÅI think ageing is an extraordinary process whereby you become the person that you always should have been.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Yes .
Ã¢â¬ÅAint
that just like me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sings .
The last line of Lazarus .
How many of us ever know what we are like or how to die ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a pretty big question for a mere Ã¢â¬Åpop starÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to pose .
So I am still reeling in that grey space he spoke of , between audience and performer .
I am not coping , to be honest .
Nor are many other people I know .
I have never felt like this about any other public death and doubt I will again .
What if there is never anyone else like him ?
My sadness does not mean I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care about Madaya or Istanbul .
But this grief is serious and rational .
Bowie was incomparable .
Leave us be with it .
There is always one damn song that can make you break down and cry .
I am sorry if you never heard it .
Because I did ."
2016-01-13,"Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re supposed to have a good time tonight , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ declared Woody Woodmansey , the last surviving Spider from Mars , addressing the crowd before his David Bowie tribute band , Holy Holy , were to take the stage .
Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s not a request
Ã¢â¬ â
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a fucking order .
Have a fucking good time , OK?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Holy Holy , with longtime Bowie producer Tony Visconti on bass , had booked the date long ago , as part of their tour playing the 1970 album The Man Who Sold the World Ã¢â¬ â on which both had featured .
On 8 January , Visconti had led a New York audience in singing Happy Birthday to Bowie over the phone .
Now , his band was presiding over a wake .
A book of condolences sat in the lobby at a makeshift shrine adorned by flowers .
With its dark stoner - rock feel , archly delivered vocals , and lyrics about insanity , serial killing , and having oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Ådormant willÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ sucked away , The Man Who Sold the World isnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t exactly the stuff of eulogies , but all of a sudden , the occasion was freighted with an entirely different meaning .
The show had quickly sold out after the announcement of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , another date added for the following night .
A TV crew filmed the queue outside , and there was an air of expectant solemnity in the unfeasibly packed old vaudeville 850-seater theatre .
Visconti told the crowd : Ã¢â¬ÅYesterday was almost the worst day of my life .
We had to talk about whether we were going to perform more on this tour , but thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no better way to work through grief except through music.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The assembled fans , many wearing Aladdin Sane lighting - bolts across their faces or Ziggy Stardust astral spheres on their foreheads , others dressed as Bowie - inspired dandies in defiance of the cold outside , raised a cheer ; they roared when the full eight - piece band emerged and the opening riff to Width of a Circle swirled out .
It was jarring at first to see the shaven - headed Glenn Gregory , of Heaven 17 , onstage in a sparkly suit - jacket taking BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s place with his old colleagues .
While his voice was strong and true , he looked stiff , deploying rock star - by - numbers poses ; beside him , Visconti , with a lightning bolt strap on his bass , seemed pale and drawn .
But Woodmansey pummeled his kit with the intensity of a man who wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to let a fire go out , summoning BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death - defyingly intense singing on his last album , the Visconti - produced Blackstar .
By the time the band rolled through the evil - sounding sludge of side twoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s She Shook Me Cold , with Woodmansey and gun - for - hire Paul
CuddefordÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cathartically wild drum - and - guitar feature , the band had loosened up .
Gregory grew in confidence , and Visconti even cracked the odd smile .
Ã¢â¬ÅTechnically , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not a tribute band ; we are the real dudes , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Visconti said when theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d run through the album .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd you know IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to choke on this , but we couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have done it without David Bowie.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He kissed his hands and lifted them to the sky , and the crowd screamed as if they were hoping the Star Man , whatever plane or planet he was on , could somehow hear them .
From here , Holy Holy played early-70s
Bowie hits , and the crowd loosened up too : there was dancing , spontaneous hugging between people whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just met , snogging , singing along to songs with wide but suddenly comfortable ranges ( Ã¢â¬ÅIs there life on Maaars?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , tears and most of all , beaming smiles .
For all of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s studied , arty aura , he could exude an easy warmth onstage , especially in the later years before a heart attack put an abrupt end to his touring .
And where he had effectively sacked Woodmansey and the Spiders without warning onstage in London in 1973 , by announcing he was killing off Ziggy Stardust , he approved Holy Holy and had his website announce their gigs .
Those close to him saw him as generous : Visconti has posted on his Facebook page : Ã¢â¬ÅHe made Blackstar for us , his parting gift.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The abruptness of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s constant changes could make him seem like the ultimate control freak , but while he was known to guard his legacy carefully , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a sense that at every turn , he was letting something go , stepping back before it could get stale so fans and followers could interpret it themselves , and make it their own .
And so it was with Holy Holy , who sounded better the more liberties they took .
After the last boisterous chords of Suffragette City rang out , Woodmansey again addressed the crowd : Ã¢â¬ÅWe can tell by your faces , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re having a good time .
We did .
And thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s exactly what Bowie would have wanted.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
It was a strange , mad celebration Ã¢â¬ â but a celebration nonetheless ."
2016-01-13,"Human beings do not fall to Earth .
They come from somewhere .
Located in time , space and history .
They have roots , families , traditions , backgrounds .
They are born and grow up in specific streets , into specific communities and within various networks of concern .
And in most communities throughout history , this has meant that human beings come with responsibilities that are pre - loaded .
That is , we have commitments even before we have chosen to have them .
David Bowie was an aristocrat of rock .
And a man of his time precisely because he fought against all the above Ã¢â¬ â letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s call it convention for now .
For Bowie , we are who we choose to be .
His famed capacity for reinvention was a minority report on the stultifying imposition of background on identity .
Sartre , famously , had another way of putting it :
existence precedes essence .
In other words , we are not handed our identity as something ready made , as some this - is - how - you - are essence .
But rather who we are is something we are to make up as we go along .
Our life journey , our existence , our choices , shape our essence .
There are no givens .
Even biology is rejected as destiny .
David Bowie was the super - glamorous poster boy for this whole philosophy of life .
As BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sometime hero Nietzsche proposed in the previous century , it is not the job of art to reflect life but rather to create it .
The human project is to make ourselves up as a novelist writes a novel or an artist creates a painting .
Only thus are we free , liberated from the dead weight of convention and destiny .
In NietzscheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s philosophy , the aristocratic ubermensch was first and foremost an artist , with himself as his greatest project .
On BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retake , the ubermensch becomes a celebrity artist and aspiring astronaut .
Ã¢â¬ÅI always had a repulsive need to be something more than human .
I felt very puny as a human .
I thought , Ã¢â¬ËFuck that .
I want to be a superhuman.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie wanted to rise weightless above the human herd .
But what if convention and history , our pre - loaded commitments , are not just the threads that tie us down Ã¢â¬
â like LilliputÃ¢â¬
â¢ s strings that imprison
the strangely brilliant ubermensch Ã¢â¬ â but rather are the connecting filaments of our civility , the infrastructure of care and concern , one for the other ?
For whatever else we mean by society , doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
it have something to do with that very un - Bowie - like idea of an obligation that precedes our responsibility to ourselves and our self - development ?
When it comes to morality , we precedes I.
And this places considerable limits on individual self - creation .
This is not about Bowie per se .
Bowie embodied a reaction against the drab social conservatism of the postwar era .
Though remember , it was in that period of drab conservatism that we invented the welfare state and the National Health Service ( inaugurated the year after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s birth )
Ã¢â¬ â arguably this countryÃ¢â¬ â¢
s finest moral achievements .
But nestled in the postwar reaction to fascism Ã¢â¬ â the ultimate and pathological imposition of un - freedom Ã¢â¬ â was a belief in its opposite , infinite freedom .
The freedom of the individual as the ultimate moral goal .
And as capitalism advanced , so choice became the only moral value many people thought worth advancing .
The world collapsed in on the black hole of the me , myself and I.
And what we have learned about this approach , especially as harnessed by libertarians , is that in practice , it means the destruction of public services and thus unfreedom for the many .
Yet mesmerised by the starmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sexual chemistry , we all mouthed along the lyrics of this unearthly vision of radical singularity .
But David Bowie was always a fiction , of course .
We knew relatively little of his life and he gave few interviews .
This is partly how he retained the inscrutable glamour of quasi - shamanic mystery .
But in real life , and without the liberation of his financial resources , the rest of us are all pinned down by moral gravity .
And rightly so .
You canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t escape the moral demands of a sick mother or a crying child through artistic reinvention .
You canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fix the local housing problems or run the local youth club Ã¢â¬
â and I repeat local deliberately Ã¢â¬ â by Ã¢â¬Åfloating in a most peculiar wayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , above the fray , beyond the limitations of the boringly specific .
And thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my Bowie problem .
His work was the fantasy of life without constraint , without the restrictions of ( moral ) gravity and directed exclusively by the lone star of choice .
This philosophy can only work in the realm of fiction and fantasy .
Back on planet Earth , the unencumbered life turns out to be more of a curse than a blessing .
Sorry
Ã¢â¬ â
I know Bowie was a great Ã¢â¬ â
but I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe in life on Mars .
Speaking ( presumably ) of God , Paul Weller had it right when he inverted Bowie :
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe he was an astronaut .
I must insist he was a socialistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2016-01-13,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s body has reportedly been privately cremated in New York following his death at the age of 69 .
In line with his wishes , no family or friends were present at the ceremony in the city where he had lived for much of his life , the Daily Mirror reported .
The cremation took place soon after his death , avoiding a funeral service for a star who had valued his deeply private lifestyle .
Carnegie hall in New York will host a memorial concert to Bowie on 31 March .
The show , planned before BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , was originally scheduled as a tribute with performances of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hit songs by Visconti , Cyndi Lauper , and The Roots among others .
It was announced on Tuesday that a tribute would be paid to Bowie at the Brit awards in London in February , celebrating what the chairman , Max Lousada , described as the Ã¢â¬Åextraordinary life and work of one of our greatest iconsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Sales and downloads of his final album , Blackstar , released on the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 69th birthday two days before he died , reached 43,000 in the UK in the 24 hours after the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
Global streams of Bowie on Spotify increased by 2,822 % following news of his death .
The critically acclaimed album , described by his long - term producer and friend Tony Visconti as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s parting gift , has topped the iTunes charts and more than half of the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top 40 chart has been taken up by albums from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue .
Visconti said that Bowie was planning a follow - up to Blackstar .
Visconti said that about a week before his death Bowie called him to say he wanted to make a final album .
He had apparently written and demoed five new songs .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt that late stage , he was planning the follow - up to Blackstar , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti told Rolling Stone .
Visconti said : Ã¢â¬ÅI was thrilled , and I thought , and he thought , that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have a few months , at least .
Obviously , if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s excited about doing his next album , he mustÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve thought he had a few more months.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-13,"It seems fitting that reaction to the death of David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â a digital native in spirit , if not in years
Ã¢â¬ â could be measured in spikes and ripples across the internet .
When BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death was announced on his verified Facebook and Twitter accounts on Sunday , the impact was first felt on social media .
Data from the social analytics company Max Kelsen showed that more than 6.1 m tweets about Bowie had been sent since 10 January .
In comparison , about 154,500 tweets were sent about him on his birthday , 8 January , and about 555,100 between 20 November and 14 December before the release of his new album Blackstar and single of the same name .
The analysis showed that most of those tweeting about Bowie were 35 or older ; 57 % were male .
Per capita , Irish users were the most active , followed by those from the UK .
Global streams of Bowie on Spotify increased by 2,822 % following news of his death .
That was a smaller percentage increase than for BB KingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music when he died in May ( 9,800 % ) , for the Everly Brothers on Phil EverlyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
death in January 2014 ( 4,275 % ) and for Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground after Reed died in October 2013 ( 3,000 % ) .
The difference can perhaps be explained by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s huge back catalogue and relative popularity in recent years that kept the number of streams consistently high even before his death .
Bowie had 4 m monthly listeners on Spotify , which rose by 62.5 % after news of his death Ã¢â¬ â meaning 2.5 m people listened to him on Spotify who had not done so in the previous month .
Heroes , from the 1977 album of the same name , was the most popular of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs on the platform in the 24 hours since the news of his death , with streams up 3,630 % , in comparison with the daily average .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance ( 1983 ) was second - most popular with an increase of 3,942 % , ahead of Blackstar ( up 1,120 % ) and Lazarus ( up 1,084 % )
Ã¢â¬ â both tracks off his 26th album , Blackstar , released just two days before his death .
Life on Mars , from 1971Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Hunky Dory , experienced the biggest increase of the top five , with streams up 4,238 % .
Bowie occupies all but three of the top 10 spots in iTunesÃ¢â¬ â¢ UK album chart ( Adele , Justin Bieber , and the indomitable Various Artists are hard to shake ) , and all of the top 10 videos .
Zane Lowe began his show on AppleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s global Beats 1 radio station on Monday with the title track from Blackstar , before digging into his favourites from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue , which he remembered discovering in his brotherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record collection .
Bowie himself predicted the rise of streaming services Ã¢â¬ â or something like them
Ã¢â¬ â more than a decade ago .
Ã¢â¬ÅMusic itself is going to become like running water or electricity , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told the New York Times in 2003 .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years , and nothing is going to be able to stop it .
I see absolutely no point in pretending that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not going to happen.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
A spike in searches for the word Ã¢â¬ÅandrogynousÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in the Merriam - Webster online dictionary was also attributed to the announcement of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
The word Ã¢â¬ â used to describe Bowie as long back as 1972 , and again in his obituary in the New York Times Ã¢â¬ â was continuing to trend on the site on Wednesday , days after his death ."
2016-01-13,"David Bowie had no feel for the 1960s .
No wonder he floundered .
Neither flower - power optimism nor insurrectionary bravado really turned him on : as he wrote in All the Young Dudes : Ã¢â¬ÅWe never got it off on that revolution stuff.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Even Space Oddity fixated on the loneliness of space travel rather than the pioneer spirit .
The 1970s , though : there was a decade that spoke to his anxieties .
A decade of cults , terrorists , scandals , recessions , defeats , environmental panic and a sense of constant crisis Ã¢â¬ â what Francis Wheen described in his book Strange Days
Indeed : The Golden Age of Paranoia as Ã¢â¬Åa pungent melange of apocalyptic dread and conspiratorial fervourÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie was to the 70s what the Beatles were to the 60s : a lightning rod , a tuning fork , a mirror .
With his mastery of dread , and the excitements of dread , the man who described himself as Ã¢â¬Åan awful pessimistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ understood the decadeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s strange energies like no other musician .
For Bowie , the 70s started a little late .
He described 1970 as Ã¢â¬Åa waste of a yearÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ because the delayed release of The Man
Who Sold the World enhanced his sense of depression and pointlessness ; the unreleased Tired of My Life presented him as a typical victim of post-60s malaise .
He only began to survey the new decade with confidence on Hunky Dory ( 1971 ) and what he saw was an exhausted landscape of fallen icons and sunken dreams , crying out for change .
Life on Mars ?
was his tour of the cultural ruins , with a teenage heroine who deserved better .
Bowie saw Ã¢â¬Åa leadership voidÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in rock and felt that the hungry new generation he described in Changes and Oh !
You
Pretty Things needed a new kind of rock star , attuned to the chaotic vibrations of the time : someone like David Bowie .
Ziggy Stardust was the physical expression of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s intellectual fascination with stardom and the power of exceptional individuals , fed by Warhol and Nietzsche .
In BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brain the overlapping appeal of rock stars and dictators
that disturbed leftwing observers was rather exciting .
At a time when more histrionic commentators were comparing western democracies to Weimar Germany , he revelled in decadence and desperate hedonism .
Not everyone was as precise as the JehovahÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Witnesses , who predicted that the world would end in 1975 , but there was a growing fear that time and resources were running out .
Bestsellers included Hal LindseyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s grimly millenarian tome
The Late Great Planet Earth .
HollywoodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best directors struck a note of cynicism and unravelling .
Newspaper editorials warned of irreversible decline .
And there was Bowie - as - Ziggy singing , Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got five years , my brain hurts a lot.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ziggy was killed off after a year because he had to die .
Time was racing on .
In 1973 , Bowie returned from a show in Japan via a long , grim train journey through the USSR and the Eastern Bloc , arriving home to tell his wife , Angie : Ã¢â¬ÅAfter what IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve seen of this world , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never been so damned scared in my life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Assembled from the debris of incomplete concept albums , Diamond Dogs ( 1974 ) was a marriage of two dystopias : the grey police state of Nineteen Eighty - Four and the insurgent anarchy of A Clockwork Orange .
Again , it felt timely when American cities were facing bankruptcy and the oil crisis threatened the western way of life .
Bowie imagined that his tribe of feral urchins , the Ã¢â¬Ådiamond dogsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , would use rollerskates because there was no oil for cars .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis ainÃ¢â¬ â¢ t rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he cried , madly .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is genocide.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie moved to New York in 1974 , when the US was experiencing the painful spasms of the Nixon administrationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death spiral , and detected Ã¢â¬Åthe lilting phrase before the crashing crescendoÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Young Americans ( 1975 ) found him searching for liberation in Philadelphia soul and Ã¢â¬Åone damn song that can make me break down and cryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ yet alienated by cocaine ( the 70s rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll drug ) and Ã¢â¬Åpsychological terrorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The title track saw America as a garbled stream of images glimpsed through a limousine window by a cold , curious outsider .
It was while he was bunkered in America that Bowie began getting into trouble for predicting the emergence of a Hitleresque figure who would scythe through the mess and impose tyranny .
Ã¢â¬ÅI believe very strongly in fascism , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he blathered , to his lasting regret .
Ã¢â¬ÅAdolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He couldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t have known that in a feverish corner of the British elite , powerful men such as the SAS founder David Stirling , were talking about giving Britain a dose of what Pinochet had brought to Chile .
Historians tend to identify 1975 as the nadir of 70s paranoia and gloom ( writing at the time , Martin Amis thought that Ã¢â¬Åeverything seemed ready for the terminal
lurchÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ )
and that was when Bowie recorded Station to Station ( released in 1976 ) , in which he scrabbled for a way out of the psychological pit he had dug for himself while fretting , Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s too late.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
This is the Bowie ( and the America )
we find so bleakly riveting in The Man
Who Fell to Earth .
A man who was all too convincing as a bewildered alien .
Another thing that makes Bowie the quintessential 70s artist is that his work was the junction box for so many of the decadeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s divergent styles , including glam - rock , soul , funk and krautrock .
The love of Kraftwerk and Neu ! that filtered into Station to Station was one of the things that led him to West Berlin for Low , Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( both 1977 ) , and Lodger ( 1979 ) where his hectic velocity took on a different flavour .
He was not exactly upbeat .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople simply canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t cope with the rate of change in this world , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all far too fast Ã¢â¬ Â¦
And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll get worse .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not really a cause for hope.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But his Berlin musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s freshness was a kind of optimism .
In this cold war city , an isolated outpost of a country convulsed by terrorism , he pulled back from despair .
Even when he worried about nuclear war on Fantastic Voyage ( the Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan )
he sounded more like a liberal humanist than an apocalyptic prophet .
He was , he said , Ã¢â¬Ålearning to be happyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , in his fashion .
These three albums reasserted BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s importance despite the onslaught of punk ( whose ferocious stars reminded him of the diamond dogs ) and anticipated the sound and style of the 1980s , when the myriad artists the Pet Shop Boys recently described as Ã¢â¬ÅBowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s childrenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ would thrive .
He emerged intact , if not undamaged , from a decade that he had done more than anybody to define .
Fear Ã¢â¬
â of the future , of irrelevance , of himself Ã¢â¬ â was the fuel that propelled him through it .
He was not alone in being scared but nobody else so consistently channelled that anxiety into art whose brilliance was a kind of consolation ."
2016-01-13,"ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Christmas Day in Berlin in 1977 .
Seated at the table are David Bowie and the film - maker David Hemmings , along with various partners , children and add - ons like me .
At a secluded restaurant in the Grunewald , the deep and dark urban forest that hugs the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s western fringe , we eat and drink too much and Bowie gives me a copy of Fritz LangÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biography , which one day will help me to write a book about Berlin .
In return , I gift him a retro Japanese Ã¢â¬Åspace jetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ model made of tin .
Just right for a wannabe alien .
At the end of the happy evening , I follow him downstairs to the huge , ceramic lavatory where Ã¢â¬ â as we stand before the urinals
Ã¢â¬ â
we sing Buddy Holly songs together , or at least a line and a half from Little RichardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Good Golly Miss Molly .
When Bowie moved from Los Angeles to Berlin in late 1976 , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been on the edge of physical and mental collapse .
At first , he fell back on old habits , cruising around the divided city with flatmate Iggy Pop , drinking KÃÂ¶Pi at JoeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Beer House , stumbling into gutters and transvestite bars , clubbing at the Dschungel and the Unlimited .
One night , Iggy sat in the passenger seat as Bowie rammed their dealerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s car again and again , for five crazed minutes .
He then drove around their hotelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s underground car park , pushing 70 mph , screaming above the screech of the tyres that he wanted to end it all by driving into a concrete wall .
Until his car ran out of fuel and the two friends collapsed in hysterics .
To defeat his demons , Bowie needed space and stability .
His estranged wife Angie no longer provided it .
For much of the time , she kept their son Zowie ( later Duncan Jones ) away from him , in London or Switzerland .
So his assistant Coco Schwab found him a modest , first floor apartment in an art nouveau building in the leafy Berlin area of SchÃÂ¶neberg .
Coco Ã¢â¬ â the devoted , unsung heroine of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career Ã¢â¬
â had its walls painted white as a private gallery for his dark images .
She ordered in blank canvases and tubes of oil paint .
She read Nietzsche beside him , beneath the fluorescent portrait he painted of Japanese author Yukio Mishima .
Above all , she went with him to the BrÃÂ¼cke Museum , to gaze at the works of Kirchner , Kollwitz and Heckel .
The expressionistsÃ¢â¬ â¢ rough , bold strokes and melancholic mood captured a sense of the ephemeral , as well as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s imagination .
In the capital of reinvention , and in CocoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s care , Bowie began to edge away from cocaine psychosis , finding his way out of his life of excess , remaking himself as an ordinary man .
He dressed in baggy trousers and dowdy shirts , and enjoyed the BerlinersÃ¢â¬ â¢ disinterest in him .
No one bothered him on the street , unlike in star - struck LA .
One night on a whim , he climbed onto a cabaret stage to perform a few Frank Sinatra songs .
The local audience shrugged and asked him to step down .
They had come to see a different act .
Away from the limelight , he composed , painted and , for the first time in years , Ã¢â¬Åfelt a joy of life and a great feeling of release and healingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , as he put it .
He realised his goal was not simply to find a new way of making music , but rather to reinvent Ã¢â¬ â or to come back to Ã¢â¬ â himself .
He no longer needed to adopt characters to sing his songs .
He found the courage to throw away the props , costumes and stage sets .
By the summer of 1977 , Bowie was on a creative high .
With producer Tony Visconti and friend Brian Eno , he began to make a new album .
Over long sessions in the studio , he ate almost nothing , sailing home to HauptstraÃÅ¸e with Eno at dawn , breaking a raw egg into his mouth , and sleeping a few hours before returning to the studio .
One of the first songs recorded that summer had been an instrumental track until , alone at the piano , Bowie began to sketch out some lyrics , eventually making it the title track and calling it Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Visconti rigged up three microphones with electronic Ã¢â¬ÅgatesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The first mic was 20 cm from Bowie , the second 6 m away , the third 15 m away across the vast , dark hall .
The gates were set to open when Bowie sang above a certain volume , forcing him to gradually lift his voice from a whisper to a shout , using the roomÃ¢â¬ â¢
s natural echo .
As Visconti adjusted the levels , Bowie continued to write the lyrics , then asked to be left alone with his thoughts and the piano .
Visconti slipped out and walked along KÃÂ¶thenerstraÃÅ¸e to meet his lover .
From the Hansa Sound Studio control room , Bowie saw them kiss , by the Wall .
Two hours later , the final lyric was recorded .
Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ became BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rock anthem , a droning , courageous wall of sound , fired with deep emotion , hammered by a clanging , metallic rhythm Ã¢â¬ â produced in part by Visconti hitting a studio ashtray .
Bowie called Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and his three Berlin albums , his DNA .
Time and again , it would be named one of popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest and most original singles .
Of course , there were moments of delicious madness both in Berlin and afterwards .
At his 31st birthday party with Iggy and Eno , at the LÃÂ¼tzower Lampe when the much - loved 60-year - old drag queen Viola was encouraged to sit on my knee and croon German love songs in my ear .
Bowie went home with the only Ã¢â¬ÅrealÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ girl in the place that night .
I had come to Berlin to work as the assistant director on Just a Gigolo , a film starring Bowie and Marlene Dietrich .
As the only native English - speakers on the picture , we ( Bowie , Coco , Hemmings and I ) naturally gravitated toward each other .
We spent many evenings together in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s HauptstraÃÅ¸e apartment .
He would play records and demo tapes for us and others , explaining how musicians and groups come together then break up in the pursuit of creative goals , likening the process to the Die BrÃÂ¼cke expressionists ; the Beatles and John Lennon ; Roxy Music and Brian Eno ; Der Blaue Reiter group and Kandinsky .
He introduced me to Brecht , spoke of Ã¢â¬Åquadrants and quantum leaps , creation and processÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â and even discussed the pitfalls of Warner BrothersÃ¢â¬ â¢ $ 15 m offer for a Ziggy Stardust rock musical .
Ã¢â¬ÅI am a generalist!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he told me one day on the set , meaning he was a Renaissance man , skilled in different fields and mediums .
Ã¢â¬ÅThen why are you most associated with rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I asked .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is only a front , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he laughed .
Fast forward to Earls Court in London Ã¢â¬ â the final venue of the European leg of the Isolar II tour .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s June 1978 and 18,000 fans are whistling and wailing for the intermission to end .
They clap their hands , stamp their feet and holler for Bowie to return .
He has performed live for 1.5 m people in 43 cities over the previous 14 weeks .
Behind the stage , along a concrete corridor , their starman sits in silence , dressed in snakeskin drapecoat and huge baggy white trousers , watching Coronation Street .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s his routine to catch an episode on video during the break : to let him get his breath , to occupy his mind but not engage it , to help him hold on to the stratospheric high from the concertÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first half .
In those few months in Berlin , Bowie made his journey from addiction to independence , from celebrity paranoia to radical , unmasked messenger who told us , all the fat - skinny people , all the nobody people , that we were beautiful , that we too could be ourselves .

2016-01-13,"Channel 5 has been accused of exploiting David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death for ratings after Celebrity Big Brother aired Ã¢â¬ÅtawdryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ scenes of housemates screaming at each other following a misunderstanding over who had actually died .
Media regulator Ofcom confirmed on Wednesday morning that it has now received more than 200 complaints about the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s coverage of the death of Bowie .
The starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former wife Angie is one of the contestants .
The latest farcical scenes were sparked after US TV reality star Tiffany Pollard went into hysterics after Angie Bowie told her that Ã¢â¬ÅDavidÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ was dead .
Pollard thought the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ex - wife meant fellow housemate David Gest
and she went on to tell other contestants that Gest had died , not Bowie .
Pollard , who discovered Gest was alive and in bed , then started screaming about the grieving Angie Bowie , accusing her of being Ã¢â¬ÅsickÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
As a result of the chaos , the show saw its ratings jump from 2.1 million on Monday night , to 2.4 million on Tuesday night , the highest audience for the series so far .
It launched with 2.1 million and the eviction on Friday was watched by just 1.9 million .
But some viewers were upset by the scenes , which ran at length during the highlights show , broadcast between 9 pm and 10 pm .
One viewer wrote :
Ã¢â¬ÅBig Brother , absolute tasteless tonight , using the death of Bowie for viewing figures and
publicity.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Another added : Ã¢â¬ÅOnly Big Brother can turn the death of a global icon into a tawdry farce.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Angie Bowie had earlier been told about her former husbandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death off - camera and decided to stay on the show .
She told Gest and actor John Partridge about the news when she returned to the house .
After Pollard noticed she was upset , Angie Bowie , who was married to the star for 10 years , then told her the news .
When Gest was found to be alive , although feeling a little unwell in his bed , a backlash against Angie Bowie began , with housemates thinking she had been making a twisted joke .
This led to uncomfortable scenes of a grieving woman being yelled at by other contestants .
Angie Bowie had told Pollard : Ã¢â¬ÅYou got ta do me a favour
, you canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t say a word .
DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dead.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When Angie Bowie took retreat from the mayhem in the diary room , she confided : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a mess .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a comedy of errors.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
She then added : Ã¢â¬ÅI forgot that she screams and she just started screaming
and she thought it was David Gest
and then she thought it was a joke
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
She didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know who I was talking about.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The beginning of the programme contained a warning : Ã¢â¬ÅBe prepared for intense scenes of emotional distress , very aggressive confrontations , entirely offensive language right from the very start and constantly throughout adult and sexual themes.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Ofcom said it has received 208 complaints related to Big BrotherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s coverage of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
It is understood that more than 150 of the complaints have been about how it was bad taste to have shown Angie Bowie grieving on camera and also that the show was Ã¢â¬Åmaking entertainmentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ out of the confusion about who had died .
Angie Bowie had been show weeping after hearing about the death of David Bowie , saying it reminded her of her motherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
More than 40 complaints objected to what they regarded as the Ã¢â¬ÅbullyingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of Pollard after her misunderstanding .
A further 16 people objected to PollardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅhystericalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ reaction and aggression over who had actually died .
A spokesman said the regulator would Ã¢â¬Åassess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or notÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."

2016-01-14,"The shock news of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s death led to a raft of touching tributes across the BBC , with fond recollections and a dusting - off of that fabulous back catalogue .
Mark Radcliffe opens Thank
You David Bowie ( BBC 6 Music ) by playing Ziggy Stardust on a piece of vinyl paid for by the paper round
he did when he was 14 .
Ã¢â¬ÅI always felt happier living in a world that had David Bowie in it ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd now it hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , so we are diminished.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an admirable sense of holding it together in his voice as he recalls memories of Bowie as a playful soul , borrowing his Viz annual and recording a jokey message with a dig at Manchester United on the last Mark and Lard show .
Def LeppardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Joe Elliott sums BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s death up perfectly :
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just rotten , really ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ while Dave Grohl enthuses about air - drumming to LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance and Marc Almond explains how Bowie taught him there was life outside a small town .
Radio 4Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Front Row :
David Bowie Remembered has interview snippets from the man himself , and collaborators who talk about his generosity , kindness and down - to - earth wit .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis myth that you have to be a huge superpower human being that has to be nasty to get things done just didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t exist with him , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ recalls Jonathan Barnbrook , who worked with him .
The archive interviews are just wonderful .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t dream of getting on a spaceship , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ d scare the shit out of me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Bowie , in the least ethereal way possible .
He talks about being hit by thoughts of death , alone in the studio at 5 am .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was an epiphany , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , before lightening the mood .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll have to go and look up epiphany in the dictionary to see if it was an epiphany.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the end , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs speak louder than any interview could and Simon Mayo turned his Drivetime show on Radio 2 into a Bowie special , taking requests from fans .
One caller , Brian , asks for Breaking Glass , but settles for Boys Keep Swinging .
Bizarrely , the most requested Bowie song is The Laughing Gnome .
At least The Gnome brings some much - needed jollity , a contrast to Rick WakemanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s moving piano version of Life On Mars .
Even if fans had made it through that Monday without tears , Wakeman provides a well - timed trigger for a cathartic cry on the commute home ."
2016-01-14,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family have said they are Ã¢â¬ÅoverwhelmedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by the reaction to his death and are now making arrangements for a private ceremony to celebrate his memory .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
death at the age of 69 was announced on Monday after he had suffered from cancer for 18 months .
In a statement posted on the late singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s official Facebook page on Thursday , his family said they Ã¢â¬Åwelcome everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s celebrationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and began with the words : Ã¢â¬ÅThank
youÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It continues : Ã¢â¬ÅThe family of David Bowie is currently making arrangements for a private ceremony celebrating the memory of their beloved husband , father and friend .
They ask once again that their privacy be respected at this most sensitive of times.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅWe are overwhelmed by and grateful for the love and support shown throughout the world .
However , it is important to note that while the concerts and tributes planned for the coming weeks are all welcome , none are official memorials organized or endorsed by the family .
Ã¢â¬ÅJust as each and every one of us found something unique in DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , we welcome everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s celebration of his life as they see
fit.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie was planning another album before his death , according to his long - time friend and producer , Tony Visconti .
About one week before his death , and with his latest album Blackstar nearing release , Bowie called Visconti to say he wanted to make a final album .
He had apparently written and demoed five new songs .
Visconti told Rolling Stone : Ã¢â¬ÅAt that late stage , he was planning the follow - up to Blackstar.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Although he had known since November that the cancer he was privately suffering was terminal , he still hoped for time to record new music .
Visconti said : Ã¢â¬ÅI was thrilled , and I thought , and he thought , that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have a few months , at least .
Obviously , if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s excited about doing his next album , he must have thought he had a few more months .
So the end must have been very rapid .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m
not privy to it .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know exactly , but he must have taken ill very quickly after that phone call.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
It has been reported that Bowie was cremated in secret shortly after his death .
He will be honoured with a tribute at next monthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Brit Awards , as well as a memorial concert at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Carnegie Hall on 31 March .
Blackstar , released on 8 January to mark his 69th birthday , looks certain to hold on to the No 1 spot in the charts on Friday .
It is also likely to be his first No 1 album in the US ."
2016-01-14,"Tributes to David Bowie
arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t intended to make you feel pessimistic , but the more you hear that he was one of the last innovators of rock music , someone who changed the rulebook of what an artist could be , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s natural to glumly wonder where the next Bowie will come from .
Equally , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s easy to look at todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s popstars , people as big now as Bowie was during his peaks , and feel a little comatose .
Adele , Ed Sheeran , Taylor Swift , Sam Smith and Justin Bieber :
many of them have produced exceptional albums , but they are hardly boundary - smashing .
As John Harris wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅRock music now seems to serve a different function .
It is so ubiquitous Ã¢â¬ â available for nothing , would you believe ?
Ã¢â¬ â that it tends to either offer a comfy kind of reassurance or stand for nothing but itself.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The closest we have to a Bowie , in terms of a beloved figure who makes pop music that is more than the sum of its parts , is probably BeyoncÃ
Â© .
But her music , while empowering , is a long way from the dramatic ambition of Bowie .
While her knack for visual motif is strong , she often plays the role more of curator , bringing existing ideas from the worlds of visual art , film , fashion and underground music Ã¢â¬ â rather than alchemising her own identity in the way that Bowie seemed to .
But to say that modern music has lost its capacity for innovation , to embody big ideas or take the form of high art , would be wildly off point .
There are plenty of people who embody a Bowie - ish type of sensibility and largely theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re considered a bit naff .
Artists such as Empire of the Sun , who dress up and have songs about fantasy lands , tend to be critically panned ; as are Muse , a band who carry the baton for some of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dystopian themes .
The same innovation the second time round always sounds hackneyed .
Rather , the past decade has seen completely different kinds of musical exploration , from KanyeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s adventures in sampling and sonic wizardry redefining the potential of hip - hop to LCD SoundsystemÃ¢â¬ â¢ s emotional assessment of the role pop music takes in our culture and ourselves , there have been plenty of artists who have expanded the potential for what music can do .
There have also been a slew of artists who , like Bowie , use madcap style and visual elements to create complex narratives and personas , and they explore wildly different stories from the ones
Bowie was telling .
Try telling Grimes , MIA or FKA twigs that a white man born in the 1940s has already done everything they could ever want to do with a music video .
There have also been genuine youth culture phenomenons with ideology and style that have confounded older generations .
Odd Future sparked a whole new tribe of teens in their image , frightening the UK government so much it has banned the rap collectiveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s leader , Tyler , the Creator , from the country .
The emo genre became such a cause for concern that the Daily Mail linked it to self - harm and teen suicide , sparking protests .
But even among those big , seemingly boring pop artists , there is subversion and discussion of complex themes , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just that the artist themselves is rarely involved in them .
A record such as Taylor SwiftÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1989 is a product of all that has gone before it : brilliant , highly listenable but pretty safe music that will do little to change the course of pop history .
But these days thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just the first part of the story .
All the things BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music were about Ã¢â¬ â gender , sexuality , false representation , futurism , politics Ã¢â¬ â were discussed in relation to SwiftÃ¢â¬
â¢ s album , just never by Swift herself .
Rather , the pop release begins a discussion between journalists , fans , and the hive mind of the internet that starts to draw out more complex themes .
So SwiftÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record was met by a tranche of think pieces explaining its impact on feminism , youth and global politics , even suggesting her video for Wildest Dreams is an accidental essay in race relations .
This is a new phenomenon .
If Robin ThickeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blurred Lines had come out in 1999 it may still have riled feminist critics but that would have been the beginning and the end of the outrage .
Instead , its lyrical metaphors were discussed everywhere from student unions to public debates .
The Guardian called it Ã¢â¬Åthe most controversial song of the decadeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s different about what pop tells us now is that pop stars are no longer the ones saying it .
Swift showed how little she understood racial dynamics when she waded into a Twitter spat with Nicki Minaj on the under - representation of black artists at the MTV VMAs .
While SwiftÃ¢â¬ â¢ s response to Minaj felt ill - informed , podcast The ReadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s analysis was poetry , and showed an understanding of the dispute better than either Swift or Minaj did .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true that mainstream pop artists are unlikely ever again to be as subversive as they were in the era of Bowie , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s because he was releasing music into a different cultural paradigm , and no one understood that better than him .
In a 1999 interview with Newsnight he spoke , with astonishing prescience , about how the internet will change the way we relate to artists : Ã¢â¬ÅIn the 70s there were still definitely artists , in the 60s there were Beatles and Hendrix , in the 50s
there was Presley , now itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s subgroups and genres .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hip - hop or girl power , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a communal kind of thing , becoming more and more about the audience .
The point of having somebody that led the forces has disappeared , because the vocabulary of rock is too well
known.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what I believe was most unique about Bowie .
Not his boundary - pushing innovation , but his ability to notice it in others , and change what he was doing to fit that .
Unlike his contemporaries , he never went on a diatribe bemoaning the state of modern pop or claimed that music had become stale .
Those worried about the state of music after Bowie should take comfort that he was more optimistic than anyone else about the future ."
2016-01-14,"Few musicians had as much impact on or involvement with David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career as Mike Garson .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
longest - serving musician , the New York - born pianist joined the Ziggy Stardust tour , and went on to play on 19 Bowie albums from 1973Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Aladdin Sane to 2010Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
A Reality Tour ( a live album from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final tour , recorded in 2003 ) .
Bowie once explained that Garson wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just an exceptional pianist but : Ã¢â¬Åvery few musicians understand the movement and free thinking necessary to hurl themselves into experimental or traditional areas of music , sometimes , ironically , at the same time .
Mike does this with such enthusiasm that it makes my heart glad just to be in the same room with him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Here , Garson remembers his friend .
Mortality wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t something David discussed , but he sang about it a lot .
I think he saw the pain and felt the suffering in life more than most .
Many of us put up filters and go into denial .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think he ever did that , and that came out in his music .
When we were on the tour bus in 1996 or 1997 , David said , Ã¢â¬ÅSomewhere in the late 70s I met this psychic , who told me I was gon na die around the age of 69 or 70,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
and he said this with total certainty .
It didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound like the ramblings of one of these crazy people : it was something which he absolutely didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t doubt at all .
I never told anyone about it , but it never left my mind .
It was my first thought when the news came in .
At the same time as I was enveloped in shock , I was thinking , Ã¢â¬ÅHe told me thatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Every year , as itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been getting closer , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been on my mind , because we were friends and musical comrades .
I had no idea he was ill .
A year ago , someone was writing a biography about me and they sent me a compilation of 50 of the best songs I worked on with David .
After IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d listened to them I thought , Ã¢â¬ÅMy God , we really did some magic together.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
So I immediately wrote that to David in an email .
Five minutes later he wrote back : Ã¢â¬ÅMike , we did an amazing body of work over those years.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t explain it , but it felt final , like we were never going to work together again .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t thinking death .
I just thought that he was moving on .
I realise now that he knew he was dying .
I was on stage with him in Germany in 2004 when he had his heart attack
and we had to cancel the last 14 shows of the tour .
It was more serious than people realised at the time .
He could have died then .
I think when something like that happens it really scares you .
Around 2006 , he called me and asked , Ã¢â¬ÅMike ,
do you think we should be touring?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I said , Ã¢â¬ÅDavid , only if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re feeling
it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
A year later he told the drummer Sterling Campbell , Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not feeling
it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Three months before the heart attack , his doctor had put him on cholesterol medicine , and he was very upset .
We had a trainer , a chef making really healthy food .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d stopped all the drinking and smoking and was living a beautiful life .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d meet him in the gym .
But the past took a toll on him physically .
I do believe he recuperated fully from the heart attack , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not sure you ever recover mentally from those things , because it puts the fear of God into you .
Even before the heart attack , he had told me , Ã¢â¬ÅMike , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going do much touring now.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He had a daughter , Lexi , and he wanted to be present for her childhood ( which he hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been for his son Duncan )
Ã¢â¬ â and he was .
When he found out he was ill 18 months ago , he really would have wanted to stay close to home .
Before he became successful , I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think he quite realised the price that fame would exact , in that it brings you all the money and adulation and all the rest of it , but you lose your anonymity .
I used to walk him to the limousine because he couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t go out , and
I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think David or anyone else can ever quite prepare themselves for what that can be like .
I think it took a lot of the joy out of his life .
So in the past few years , out of the spotlight , he would have been able to get that back .
I played with him at the last concert he ever did , in 2006 Ã¢â¬ â a private Aids benefit in New York with Alicia Keys .
He didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t allow it to be filmed Ã¢â¬ â perhaps because it was for charity , and he liked to do those things quietly , but also maybe because he was a little gunshy , because heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d not sung for a while .
But it was an amazing show , just piano and voice .
David and Alicia singing Changes was just magical .
It was the first performance since his recuperation , and he actually said that if he hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t done that , then maybe heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have never sung again .
Of course , he went on to do two more albums , but that was physically the last time I saw him .
We kept in touch by email .
When he recorded The Next Day he emailed me saying , Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no piano on this , so youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not neededÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and with Blackstar I think he was just after a different sound .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s David .
We worked together so much .
Most of the time on Aladdin Sane was just me and him in the studio , with him laying down the guitar parts .
We spent a lot of time together , and he was always talking about the creative process , or jazz , or Stravinsky , or Vaughan Williams .
My regrets are that we never got to do some of the things he talked about .
He wanted to do an album of Philip Glass songs .
He wanted to do a big band jazz album .
He wanted to do a Broadway show .
I havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t listened to Blackstar a lot :
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t quite go back to it yet .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s too dark .
But knowing David , he went out with the same bang as when he was doing anything .
He even stayed alive long enough to see the acclaim for the record .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
David : life and death was art for him .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve worked with a thousand singers , and he was so far above everyone else .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to miss that .
We just have to keep on finding things that he recorded , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be a lot to emerge that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never heard .
He leaves behind a body of work that would have taken anyone else five lifetimes .
As a planet , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve lost a great , great artist ."
2016-01-15,"ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long been clear that David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s was a polymath , an artist as much as a musician , that Ã¢â¬Åchameleon , comedian , Corinthian and caricatureÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he wrote of in his 1971 song Ã¢â¬ÅThe Bewlay
BrothersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But what can we make of his literary legacy , of his influences and output as a writer ?
It started and ended in a theatrical tradition .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I was a teenager ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said in 2000 , Ã¢â¬ÅI had it in mind that I would be a creator of musicals.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
And there are traces of the native talents of Lionel Bart and Anthony Newley in his earliest songs .
In another life he might have ended up at LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Theatre Royal Stratford East or the Royal Court .
The lyrics on his 1967 debut album David Bowie are a series of vignettes that seem destined for the stage : a child - loving ex - soldier is accused of paedophilia , a lesbian and/or trans man looks back on how she joined the army by passing as a man .
His material was outre even then , but his failure to attract mainstream musical theatre merely pushed him into further experimentation .
He then worked with Lindsey Kemp , mime artist and theatre director , honing some skills in non - verbal expression .
But learning mime did not stem his aptitude for words ; it gave him a whole new vocabulary .
Claiming his lineage from ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite clown William Kempe , Lindsey mentored him in the deep traditions of the stage as well as avant - garde theatre .
KempÃ¢â¬ â¢ s adaptation of Jean GenetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Our Lady of the Flowers clearly turned young Bowie on to that great dramatist and poet of the gutter , as he would later acknowledge in his 1972 paean to decadence , Ã¢â¬ÅThe Jean GenieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He began to develop a science fiction sensibility , drawing on the New Wave SF movement of Michael Moorcock and JG Ballard , other writers who used the genre such as Anthony Burgess and William S Burroughs , and an older fantasy tradition found in HP Lovecraft and Edward Bulwer - Lytton ( whose The Coming Race is name - checked in Ã¢â¬ÅOh
You
Pretty ThingsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , 1971 ) .
The stage was set for a great SF rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll musical , and , indeed , that is what 1972Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was intended to be , with Bowie as writer rather than performer .
But casting himself in the lead propelled him into true stardom .
Kemp designed the groundbreaking show in which there were elements of Japanese kabuki , Italian commedia dellÃ¢â¬ â¢ arte , snatches of Jacques Brel ; but a solid tradition of English stage shines through .
The coup de theatre is the finale of Ã¢â¬ÅRockÃ¢â¬
â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll SuicideÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , where the dying star reaches out to the audience , imploring : Ã¢â¬ÅGimme your hands , Ã¢â¬ â¢ cause youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re wonderfulÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , in a clear echo of PuckÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last words , a call for applause , in A Midsummer NightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dream ( first uttered by William Kempe )
: Ã¢â¬ÅGive me your hands , if we be friends /
And Robin shall restore amends.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Like all good authors , Bowie was always ready to kill his darlings , but murdering Ziggy Stardust on stage gained him instant mystique and a trademark modus operandi .
After a brief stint as Aladdin Sane , his next writing project was a theatrical adaptation of George OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Nineteen Eighty - Four , abandoned when Sonia Orwell denied the rights .
The songs that remain are rather wonderful , particularly the soaring Ã¢â¬ÅBig BrotherÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and the plaintively haunting Ã¢â¬ÅWe Are the DeadÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
They end up on the second side of Diamond Dogs ( 1974 ) , his darkest , most apocalyptic album .
But by now his life seems to have entered into a dangerous dramaturgy .
Much of the 1970s saw a series of doomed characters in search of a homicidal author .
Lost in a tailspin of drugs and paranoia in Los Angeles , each successive assassination merely brought him closer to killing himself .
He needed artistic salvation as much as anything .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe European canon is here , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sings on Ã¢â¬ÅStation to StationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( 1976 ) , boldly stating a new intention , a return from America to the Old World , to Germany where he would compose his Berlin Trilogy .
Much is rightly made of his formal experiments in music at this time , using influences of Krautrock bands such as Can , Faust and Kraftwerk .
But he was also exploring the artistic and literary legacy of German expressionism .
The culmination of this German period saw him playing the title role in the 1982 BBC2 adaptation of Bertolt BrechtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s play Baal .
In a masterly and often forgotten interpretation , Bowie completely embodies the callous , debauched and sexually ambiguous balladeer Baal , a character who anticipates his own creation of Ã¢â¬Åleper - messiahÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ziggy .
He certainly impressed the translator and leading Brecht scholar John Willett , who writes : Ã¢â¬ÅHe understood the play and had thought about it , and it was my impression that he knew more about Germany as a whole and BrechtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ambience in particular than anyone except possibly Marks [ the producer ] and myself.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And hereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where I come in .
Just as I had followed every literary reference in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s output from Ã¢â¬ÅThe Jean GenieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( aged 11 , I was looking up Ã¢â¬ÅgenetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ )
so I sought out Brecht at the very time
I was trying to write myself .
Threepenny Novel became the initial influence on my first novel The Long Firm , and I like to think it was its Brechtian qualities that Bowie admired when he came to praise it .
But , of course , I kid myself that I might be part of a canon .
Like all great writers , Bowie was a furious reader , so much so that when he issued his official reading list in 2013 , I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even make the top 100 ( ah , such fleeting glory Ã¢â¬ Â¦ ) .
The list is wonderfully eclectic , everything from the Beano to Transcendental Magic : Its Doctrine and Ritual by Eliphas LÃ
Â© vi .
Of British novelists , Orwell is there , as is Burgess and Bulwer - Lytton , and others he would have read growing up : John Braine , Keith Waterhouse and Muriel Spark .
His own contemporaries are well represented : Ackroyd , Amis , Chatwin , McEwan and , of course , Angela Carter .
Of my generation , the ones he influenced as mere teenagers when he first came on the scene , there are Sarah Waters and Rupert Thomson .
Worthy choices both , particularly Thomson , something of a Thin White Duke of British fiction , sustaining a long career by constantly changing the way he writes .
The rest of us simply owe Bowie for showing us all that work that never made it on the curriculum .
And in the last few weeks of his life the musical Lazarus opened off - Broadway , directed by Ivo van Hove , with his songs and a book by Enda Walsh .
He gives his own swansong on the video of the title song , an astonishing performance , seemingly from the grave .
Ã¢â¬ÅA farewell gift , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ as producer and long - time collaborator
Tony Visconti put it , Ã¢â¬Åfor now it is appropriate to cry.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And applaud .
Ã¢â¬ÅGive me your hands
Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-15,"It has been described as his parting gift , a knowing musical finale before he bowed out of this world .
And now Blackstar , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album which was released just two days before his death from cancer , has stormed to the top of the UK album charts .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album sold 150,000 copies in its first week , knocking AdeleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 25 from her seven - week stronghold at the top of the charts , and securing the pioneering musician his 10th No 1 album .
Blackstar had already been on course for the top spot before the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death was announced on Monday but purchases and streams by hundreds of thousands of mourning fans helped Bowie secure a quarter of the spots in the weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Top 40 album chart .
A total of 623,000
Bowie recordings were sold this week , including 241,000 album sales .
Nothing Has Changed , a 2014 best of Bowie compilation , shot to No 5 in the album charts and two other greatest hits albums Ã¢â¬
â the retrospective
The Best of 1969/74 , and Best of Bowie Ã¢â¬ â came in at No 11 and 18 respectively .
This week also saw a revival of sales of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s classic albums from the past six decades , including Hunky Dory , which re - entered the chart at 14 , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust ( 17 ) and Aladdin Sane ( 23 ) .
It was a similar story on the the iTunes chart where BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar made No 1 , Best of Bowie was at No 3 and his 1972 album
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust was at No 8 .
Tony Visconti , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long - term collaborator and the producer of Blackstar , said tthe singer had begun making the album 18 months ago after he was diagnosed with cancer .
It marked a new sound for Bowie , who brought in a group of renowned New York jazz musicians to work on the album .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe always did what he wanted to do , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Visconti in a tribute message .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd he wanted to do it his way
and he wanted to do it the best way .
His death was no different from his life Ã¢â¬ â a work of art .
He made Blackstar for us , his parting gift.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
As well as jazz influences , Bowie took inspiration from the rapper Kendrick Lamar for Blackstar , his 25th studio album , with songs such as Tis a Pity
She Was a Whore bringing together a hip - hop beat with free - form sax .
On its release in 8 January , it was received with almost universal critical praise , with the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alexis Petridis calling it Ã¢â¬Åambiguous and spellbinding Ã¢â¬ Â¦ a rich , deep and strange album that feels like Bowie moving restlessly forward.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Before his death , Bowie reportedly recorded five new tracks that he planned to release on a later date , either as part of a Blackstar re - release or as an entirely new album In an interview with Rolling Stone , Visconti revealed that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cancer had briefly gone into remission last year and that the singer had hoped to make a follow - up to Blackstar .
Before his death , Bowie reportedly recorded five new tracks that he planned to release on a later date , either as part of a Blackstar re - release or as an entirely new album
The mass outpouring of grief and nostalgia prompted by the news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death has led the singer to dominate the singles charts and streaming sites .
Streaming services reported that listens of his music had hit a high of 19 m this week , alongside 167,000 purchases of some of his most famous tracks .
Five of his songs re - entered the Top 40 , peaking at number 12 with Heroes , a new high for the track which only reached number 24 on its release in 1977 .
Despite being one of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most beloved musicians , Bowie only had five No 1 singles in his career and spent a total of just 13 weeks in the top slot .
Bowie was reportedly cremated in New York and his family said the singer would be commemorated in a small private ceremony ."

2016-01-15,"At the end of February last year , Bernard Turner , a 68-year - old former gamekeeper from Bodenham , Herefordshire , died of pneumonia .
He had lived with multiple sclerosis for eight years , bedbound for five .
Luckily Ã¢â¬ â if anything still was lucky
Ã¢â¬ â
he had his wife , Val , who not only loved him enough to be his full - time carer , but was also an experienced operating theatre nurse , then manager , who knew her way around patient care .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been married for 44 years by the time Bernard died , with Val beside him .
He had never known that she was dying , too .
Two years earlier , Val had discovered a lump in her breast and guessed the worst .
She had already seen her sister die of breast cancer , and knew that if she entered the world of scans and surgery and side - effects , she would have to stop caring for her husband Ã¢â¬ â to say nothing of the sorrow , guilt and anger it might cause .
So she did nothing , and the lump grew .
She was 66 when Bernard died , and her own health fell apart more or less immediately afterwards .
When the truth could no longer be hidden , she told it to her already grieving daughters , Julie and Clare .
Ten days later , on 17 April 2015 , Val Turner died , not two months after her husband .
Ã¢â¬ÅA work of art ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the music producer Tony Visconti called David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , but all except the very fastest and the slowest have to be .
Along with the horror of a terminal diagnosis comes the obligation to choose who you tell , or donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tell , as well as when you tell Ã¢â¬ â and whatever you choose becomes a statement that will shape you in their memory .
Not everybody wants to be remembered as a patient .
Leah Wilby , from Great Yarmouth , knew what it was like .
She was only nine years old when she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a cancer of the nerve tissue .
She was treated at AddenbrookeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Hospital in Cambridge Ã¢â¬
â
she even gave the Queen a bouquet Ã¢â¬ â and
five years later she was in remission .
Then the cancer returned , a week before Christmas 2009 , and this time it could not be beaten .
Wilby was a teenager by now , at a new school where her friends hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t known her as the girl with cancer , so she decided not to tell them .
Instead she focused her last months on her GCSEs , even once she knew that she would probably not live for the results .
Her treatment was arranged for the evenings so she would not miss school .
She died , aged 15 , on Monday 13 June 2011 , and was buried in the prom dress that she never got to use .
An important distinction : privacy is what Wilby wanted , not secrecy , and what Bowie did too .
It would be hard to imagine two more different cases , yet it seems that all either of them wanted in their final days was to carry on living .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fans , like WilbyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s classmates , were shocked when they heard the news , but what could they have given David and Leah if they had known ?
Not normality , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s for sure .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
cremation without a funeral shortly after dying , if thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what happened , seems a clever way to keep his family from the same glare .
Canny to the end , Jackie Collins did something similar , telling no one but her three daughters about her breast cancer for more than six years .
A few weeks before the end , she told others close to her , including her sister Joan .
Finally , with six days left , she announced everything in an interview with People magazine , achieving maximum exposure for her final message : get yourself checked .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s actually more common than you might imagine , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Jayne Molyneux , a nurse who helps people manage prolonged conditions as a clinical change manager at Bupa .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe find that when people are first diagnosed theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re more likely to keep it to themselves initially
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
Often people need to think through their condition themselves , and then , when theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re feeling in more control , have that sense of control about sharing.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
As a result , though every case is different , news of a terminal illness tends to move outwards , layer by layer , as each shocked group feels strong enough to tell the next , as the end gets closer , as the evidence gets harder not to see .
Whether or not the patient tells their family or friends , Molyneux would certainly encourage talking to someone .
Often people who are seriously ill worry about the effect on their work , although they neednÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , technically .
It is unlawful for an employer to sack you because of your health .
Indeed , under the Equalities Act 2010 , they are required to make any reasonable changes to your workplace or conditions that may help you do your job .
Nevertheless , people worry about subtle shifts in attitude , or maybe a weird reluctance among clients and colleagues to commit to anything longterm .
That was Nora EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fear , or one of them .
The writer , director and screenwriter was apparently worried that no one in Hollywood would back her projects if they knew she had myeloid leukemia .
For six - and - a - half years she lived with the diagnosis , telling almost no one but immediate family .
When she died in June 2012 , having seemed so healthy to her many friends , it was a profound shock .
A sharp wit , a snappy dresser and a controlling character
Ã¢â¬ â though much - loved Ã¢â¬ â EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s approach to dying , like BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , was carefully thought through .
In 2010 she published a book , I Remember Nothing , which now looks like a farewell .
( For instance , it ends with lists of the things she will and wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Ã¢â¬ÅmissÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and offers acknowledgements to Ã¢â¬Åmy
doctorsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ . )
She also left precise plans for a memorial service , even specifying friends who did not know that she was ill to give the eulogies .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe really did catch us napping , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Meryl Streep said , when her turn came .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe pulled a fast one on all of us .
And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really stupid to be mad at somebody who died , but somehow I have managed it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Being chosen made Streep feel Ã¢â¬Åso privileged and so pissed off and so honoured and so inept all at the same time that I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t help thinking that this is exactly what she intendedÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
There is a hard question implied here .
A few people asked it about Ephron .
When youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re dying , how selfish do you get to be ?
Obviously you are entitled to choose what you want , and to get cut some slack , but you canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t take away your bereaved friendsÃ¢â¬ â¢ entitlement to be annoyed with you .
As Molyneux has seen for herself , people kept in the dark , then left behind , have a lot to grapple with .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey wonder : why wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t I told ?
I wish I could have helped .
I could have done more if only IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d known .
We could have got something sorted out .
I would have been there more .
There are all of those questions , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
The columnist Frank Rich was a close friend of EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s for many years , and found himself among those who were Ã¢â¬Åpissed off at firstÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
. Ã¢â¬ÅNora exemplified self - awareness and truth - telling , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he wrote in New York magazine .
Ã¢â¬ÅHer choice to keep her illness a secret was not just out of character , but a Herculean task Ã¢â¬ Â¦
What was she telling us by making her final chapter a secret ?
What , if anything , was she telling us about ourselves?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Like so many of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s friends did this week , Rich found himself sent off in search of clues .
He went back through EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s books ( and found the last pages of I
Remember Nothing ) .
He replayed and re - evaluated his memories .
He re - read her old emails .
Had she meant to set a puzzle for him or Streep or any of the others ?
That was the puzzle itself .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the kind of thing you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t stop wondering about .
Mystery is the enemy of closure .
Not everyone agrees .
EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son Max said in his address at her memorial : Ã¢â¬ÅI think that she just kept quiet so the rest of us could keep enjoying being with her as much as possible.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Had he known , he said , Ã¢â¬ÅAll of those moments would have been bittersweet or sanctimonious Ã¢â¬
Â¦
I am so glad they werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that way.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Compare this with the Australian journalist Amanda Platell , whose older brother Michael died of lung cancer , aged just 40 , without telling many of his other friends or family that he was even ill .
Writing about it in the Daily Mail , Platell gave thanks for the Ã¢â¬Åprecious times , a chance to say the things you should , but never doÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
She is glad she had Ã¢â¬Åplenty of time to remember Ã¢â¬ â and to talk Ã¢â¬ Â¦
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think I would ever have forgiven Michael if he had not told me until the endÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
These are Ã¢â¬ â
letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s say it again
Ã¢â¬ â different cases , but maybe those left behind need to find a way to be glad about whatever happened , in order to move on .
Dike Omeje met Mike Garry in 1995 at a poetry slam , where they finished in first and second place .
GarryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mother , it turned out , had taught Omeje at school .
They even lived in the same part of Manchester , and shared doctors and dentists .
They became close friends .
Over the next 12 years they saw each other often at poetry events , they spent time with each otherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s families , and round each otherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s houses .
On Friday 12 January 2007 , Omeje rang Garry and they arranged to meet .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe went down to this reading and afterwards we chatted , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Garry says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember I had a Vespa .
He said : Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to get one of those , you know .
I keep getting parking tickets , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll save me the hassle.Ã¢â¬ â¢
I also owed him some money and said IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d go to the cashpoint and get it .
He said : Ã¢â¬ËDonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t worry .
Get me on Monday.Ã¢â¬ â¢
Then he went home and died.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Omeje had a type of lymphatic cancer .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d had it for 18 years , according to Garry , spanning the entire period of their friendship , and he never said a word .
He did not tell his family , and only told Ã¢â¬Åtwo or threeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ friends when circumstances forced it .
He refused all medical treatment , which doctors offered with increasing desperation .
Garry believes that Omeje hoped to survive the disease through a combination of healthy living and meditation .
Instead , he died alone in his flat , aged 34 , that Friday night .
It was Sunday by the time he was found .
Like EphronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , some of OmejeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s friends were initially angry .
Like Rich , Garry found himself hunting compulsively for clues to his dying friendÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thoughts and feelings .
There was that time Omeje refused to give a blood sample at a sickle - cell anaemia event Ã¢â¬ â most unlike him .
There were those casual mentions of being so tired that he fell asleep at the wheel .
Garry has since seen his own mother die of cancer , and now speaks admiringly of OmejeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅhonourÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I get cancer IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not telling no one , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m just disappearing , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not putting people through the slow , drawn - out inevitability of death.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
On the other hand , moments later : Ã¢â¬ÅEven after nine years , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m still not right with it .
I still find it hard to come to terms with his loss.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Might his friendÃ¢â¬ â¢ s secrecy be behind that ?
Ã¢â¬ÅYou might well be right .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll sit here and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll say he did the right thing , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m still deeply affected by the death of Dike .
I think about him all the time.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
We can only guess how those Ã¢â¬Åtwo or threeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ who kept the secret must be feeling .
OmejeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s decision was at the extreme private end of a scale that is longer than it used to be .
Alan RickmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s illness was neither publicised nor , it seems , zealously hidden .
Iain Banks announced his on his own website in April 2013 , a month after he found out about it , and two before he died .
Terry Pratchett invented a new career for himself as a right - to - die campaigner , following his diagnosis with AlzheimerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
In October , Victoria Derbyshire broadcast a video diary of herself from her hospital bed following a mastectomy .
Indeed , the cancer diary , once a shockingly raw novelty in the newspapers , is now a genre , with its own stars such as Stephen Sutton , and with old masters such as Clive James and Jenny Diski .
( They Ã¢â¬Åstill battle it out for third placeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Diski wrote in November , following the deaths of Oliver Sacks and Henning Mankell . )
Among such openness , is it now privacy that shocks ?
Does shocking people matter ?
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s for the dying to decide ."
2016-01-15,"For more than a decade before his death David Bowie seemed to disappear .
Beset by ill health after an on - stage heart attack in 2004 , he largely withdrew into a life at home in New York , becoming a ghost in the city where he had lived for a quarter of a century .
Yet as the world comes to terms with his death this week , admirers are digesting a remarkable late burst of creativity , a dramatic 18-month flourish capped by an apparently exquisitely well - crafted exit .
At 69 , Bowie reasserted himself both as a musician Ã¢â¬ â Blackstar , the album released two days before his death , is topping charts around the world Ã¢â¬ â and as a questing creative figure whose vision is still playing out on the New York theatre stage .
How did Bowie pull this off from the penthouse duplex he shared with wife , Iman , and 15-year - old daughter , Lexi , in the Nolita section of downtown Manhattan ?
The singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s encroaching frailty meant he kept his life local .
The theatre where his play Lazarus is running is no more than a few minutes walk away ; Magic Shop , the studio where he recorded albums
Blackstar and The Next Day , is even closer , on Crosby Street .
Each place would offer Bowie a last opportunity to work in the musical and theatrical worlds that he had specialised in amalgamating throughout his career .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t any single thing , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ longtime collaborator Mick Rock told the Guardian .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was the great synthesizer.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The picture that has emerged over the past few days is of a man who was able to shake off late career doldrums and , in spite of declining health , find a final , focused burst of creativity .
First , in 2013 , came The Next Day , an album that was a stylistic tour of his career ; then the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s David Bowie Is Ã¢â¬
â an exhibit of 300 objects of Bowie memorabilia revealing the consideration with which he had preserved the artefacts of his career ; the play Lazarus , now set for LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s West End ; and finally Blackstar , a jazz record that launched with a video that appears to anticipate his death .
According to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime producer Tony Visconti , Bowie had known since at least November that his cancer was terminal .
But even in his final weeks , Bowie had no idea how little time was left and was talking about a Blackstar follow - up .
Pictures from the opening night of Lazarus on 7 December last year showed Bowie still handsome and immaculate but possibly showing signs that he may have been unwell .
Theatre producer Robert Fox , who worked with him on Lazarus , said Bowie never complained .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe work was great and working with him was wonderful but it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t great that he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t well .
It was not good at all .
Some days he just wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t able to be around , but whenever he could be , it [ his cancer ] didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t interfere with his contribution .
It was just horrible for him , rather than difficult for us.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Fox believed the work was not specifically coloured by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sense of his own mortality .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe struggle with mortality goes on whether or not youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re unwell .
People write about that stuff even when theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re in perfectly good health , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
But Fox , who helped Bowie find a director and cast the actors , concedes it must have had some effect .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe would talk about his illness only to the extent that it affected his work .
Not in any other way .
He never grumbled .
But I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think he planned on not being around .
He was optimistic that something ( a treatment ) would come along that meant that he could be.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie had been battling cancer for six months when he entered Magic ShopÃ¢â¬ â¢ s expansive studio facilities in January 2015 to record his 25th album .
The studio , which has also been used by Coldplay and Arcade Fire , was already known to him ; he had recorded much of his previous album
The Next Day there .
But instead of rock musicians , he brought seven demos to progressive jazz saxophonist Donny McCaslin .
The sessions were short and light - hearted , typically running from 11 am to 4 pm over three sessions of a week through to March .
James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem came in to add synths and percussion and the tracks were finished off in ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own studio in April .
Visconti , who produced the album over the first few months of 2015 , told Rolling Stone that Bowie showed up for some Blackstar sessions without eyebrows or hair after undergoing chemotherapy .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was no way he could keep it a secret from the band , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told the magazine .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut he told me privately and I really got choked up when we sat face to face talking about
it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s affliction had not dulled his enthusiasm for work .
Ã¢â¬ÅHis energy was that of a very young person diving into everything with fearless joy and abandon , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said recent Bowie collaborator Maria Schneider , the orchestral - jazz composer .
Ã¢â¬ÅNot to say he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t serious .
He was very clear about what he did and didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Annie - B Parson , of New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Big Dance Theater company , was the choreographer on the Lazarus musical and worked in close proximity with Bowie from September until the opening night in December .
She said she did not know he was ill and did not think the actors knew either as they worked quickly to develop the show in a tiny studio at the New York Theater Workshop .
But the director of the musical , Ivo van Hove , told her something that she only now realises the significance of .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt the beginning , he said this was the saddest piece he had ever worked on ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deeply connected to death and a person contemplating his own existence from the first moment we see him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
During rehearsals , Bowie sat quietly , elegantly dressed in grey sweater and white shirt , writing with a stub of pencil on a piece of paper .
Physically , Ã¢â¬Åall criss - crossedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the choreographer noted , his slender arms and legs twisted about each other in concentration .
Bowie would not intervene , but the creative team would get feedback .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe insisted on spectacle .
What struck me was that Bowie was from some other place , he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t of this planet and he was cool with that , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Parson said .
It only occurred to her with hindsight that a personÃ¢â¬ â¢ s knowledge that they may have limited time left might fuel their creativity .
Bowie was suddenly prolific , driven .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was almost an insistence that he had so much to say .
He needed to get out these songs in time .
And he did ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Speaking on Friday from Warsaw , van Hove said : Ã¢â¬ÅThe first thing that struck me when I met in a room in New York with David and Enda [ Walsh , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s co - writer on the piece ] and they read it to me and played some of the music was the existential theme Ã¢â¬ â life and death and is there life after death or can you go on living just in your mind or your imagination?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When Bowie told van Hove , in strictest confidence , in November 2014 , that he had cancer and might not survive the project , the songs he was writing became deeper , especially Lazarus , the song of the eponymous musical and single .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is like his testament , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said van Hove .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
creative surge was stunning .
When he was feeling ill after treatment , he would stay away from rehearsals , but was intimately involved when in attendance and a genuine collaborator who thrived off his cohortsÃ¢â¬ â¢ ideas , van Hove said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was private about the details of his health situation .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t question him , but I knew he did not want to die .
He was in a struggle for life during those 18 months , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Some of the songs in the musical convey huge inner rage and a protest about violence in society , overlaid with poetry and layers of sound .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut in person he was always the perfect gentleman , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ van Hove said .
As Bowie became sicker , later in 2015 , van Hove said he saw fear in his eyes .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was fragile , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
After the opening night of Lazarus , Bowie had to sit down backstage with van Hove and Iman , exhausted after taking his bow .
Ã¢â¬ÅI escorted him to his car
and I somehow knew it was the last time I would see
him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Music video director Johan Renck was already thrilled to be working with his childhood hero last July on the title track of the diamond heist TV drama The Last Panthers that he had directed in England , when the British pop icon told him there was more to the tune they had just recorded .
A lot more Ã¢â¬ â a version that turned out to be Blackstar , the towering single from the album
Bowie had been writing .
Ã¢â¬ÅI flew from London to New York and met with him at his office in Soho to listen to the full track .
He put his hand on my shoulder and said with a grin Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ËI must warn you , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 10 minutes longÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
There was no way I could say no .
He had this warmth and this infectious smile and I knew it would be an interesting journey , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Renck said .
The two began a fiercely intense and , as it turned out , all too short collaboration .
Ã¢â¬ÅOver Skype he said Ã¢â¬ËI feel I have to tell you this .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m very ill
and I may not make itÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
I had been in this playful mood , pitching ideas back and forth with him like giddy 12-year - olds
and I was absolutely shocked .
He said : Ã¢â¬ËI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even know if by the time we shoot this video you will have to have a replacement for me to perform in itÃ¢â¬ â¢ ,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Renck said .
Bowie gave Renck no details of his cancer , only that he would be in cycles of treatment that meant he would have Ã¢â¬Åmy good periods and bad periodsÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , the director said .
Bowie asked Renck not to tell a soul Ã¢â¬ â this is the first time he has spoken publicly since BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
When Bowie and Renck came to shoot the video for Blackstar in September and , in November , the next single Lazarus , the mood was exuberant .
They shot Bowie performing for one day for each video and just five hours on those days in a studio in Brooklyn .
That was all his health would take , Renck said .
Bowie wanted it to feature an isolated village , then Renck came up with the idea of rituals that mixed the occult with a celebration of life .
Bowie also wanted a scarecrow in the video , Renck said , and sent Renck his sketch for the macabre character Button Eyes that he plays in both videos .
The sketch showed a bandaged head , buttons for eyes and just a small strip of a Mohawk for hair .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know if he would have hair left by the time of the shoot , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Renck .
In fact he did , a splendid shock of silvery grey hair Ã¢â¬ â though he had to be careful or it came out in tufts because of his cancer treatment .
Unlike the sweeping anthem Blackstar , Renck described Lazarus as a little gem .
Bowie reappears as Button Eyes , tormented on a hospital bed .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
just thought of it as the Biblical tale of Lazarus rising from the bed .
In hindsight , he obviously saw it as the tale of a person in his last nights , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Renck .
While working , Bowie talked of his family but kept himself quite private , while being very easygoing and friendly with the small crew that worked on the intimate shoot .
He would arrive so suave in suit and fedora and sip cups of tea , Renck said ,
Despite the warning , he did not realise the star was so gravely ill because he seemed so spritely while shooting .
He would get tired and take breaks , Renck said , but he seemed so happy .
The video of Lazarus shows Button Eyes and
also BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s other Ã¢â¬ÅcharacterÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , a dancer in a slick suit , gyrating in classic Bowie camp style then writing frenetically , a man desperately running out of time .
Finally the figure retreats into a wardrobe and shuts the doors behind him .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s haunting but also witty , mocking death , Renck said .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo
British , the wit , like a guilt thing , making sure itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not coming across as too serious or pretentious Ã¢â¬ â and yet that enhances the humanity of it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Renck and Bowie also agreed that the joke was that the star , legendary for his gender - bending and fluid sexuality , was going Ã¢â¬Åback into the closetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe closet , or coffin , if you will , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Renck ."
2016-01-15,"Karen Walker had just been listening to his new album on a flight to Geneva .
Elaine Wiggins , feeling like sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been punched , crawled into bed with her son .
Esther Schwarzbauer realised her fantasy of performing with the star would never be realised .
Everyone at the Birchmere music hall in Alexandria , Virginia , on Thursday night had a story to tell about where they were and what they were doing when they heard David Bowie died .
Hundreds had come to pay homage by listening to the Bowie tribute band Holy Holy , featuring his longtime producer Tony Visconti on bass .
Before the show , wearing a strap patterned with Aladdin Sane lightning symbols , Visconti walked on stage and told the audience : Ã¢â¬ÅSince this past Monday was just about the worst day of my life , and a lot of people shared the grief that I share IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m certain , we felt that we should come out now and tell you that we deliberated whether we were going to continue with the tour Ã¢â¬ â but weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re musicians , we just canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sit around and not play music .
You all know that music heals a lot of pain and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why we decided to come here and be with you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The 500-seat venue , where guests are waited on at tables , was close to full , with most ticket holders the wrong side of 40 .
To cheers , whistles and tears , Holy Holy played Bowie hits including Oh You Pretty Things and Changes , prompting someone to shout : Ã¢â¬ÅPlease sir , may I have some more?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The more included Life on Mars ?
and , lastly , Suffragette City .
Recalling the creation of the 1970 Bowie album The Man Who Sold the World , which he produced , Visconti said : Ã¢â¬ÅThe brains and the beauty and the creativity was a great man who left us recently : Mr David Bowie.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He held his arms aloft and audience members stood to applaud .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt gets easier to say that every night .
I got really choked up two nights ago in Toronto .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to even say his name but
letÃ¢â¬
â¢ s just celebrate his life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Drummer Mick Ã¢â¬ÅWoodyÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
Woodmansey , the last surviving member of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backing band the Spiders from Mars , emerged afterwards to sign autographs and pose for photos .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d done about two or three gigs before the news came and that knocked us sideways , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said , recalling the announcement of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death on Monday .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was just a bit surreal .
We were on the road playing those songs and then five oÃ¢â¬ â¢ clock in the morning got a phone call in the hotel .
I went to wake Tony up and the others and it was just like shock .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the last thing you thought was going to happen.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He added : Ã¢â¬ÅIt was known by a select few that he was ill .
There were a few hints that I got that I thought he was ill , but I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know as much as Tony did and it was unexpected that quick , I think even for David .
He never really prepared for it ; thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no way of preparing for that .
We thought what do we do , is it disrespectful to carry on ?
There were so many thousands of emails came in saying youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to carry on , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to carry the torch , we want to see it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The passion was evident in the audience .
Elaine Wiggins , 54 , who works at a consulting firm , broke down in tears as she recalled hearing of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death :
Ã¢â¬ÅI felt like IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been punched in the stomach .
My son was downstairs asleep and I crawled in bed with him and said , Ã¢â¬ËDavid Bowie diedÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
I got in the car and went to work and felt like I was in a fog all week .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve not had a lot of personal losses in my life but this really hit me hard .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo for me tonight is like a bit of closure , a funeral .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to talk to my friends about it .
They donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t understand : Ã¢â¬ËWhy are you crying for a pop star?Ã¢â¬ â¢
This is like a memorial , a cathartic release.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
During Thursday nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gig , Graham Warwick , a magazine editor , sent an email from his iPhone to the Guardian that said : Ã¢â¬ÅWhat a f - ing amazing and accidental way to celebrate his life and work .
They are amazing .
And the music sounds incredible .
Even now , so many years later .
[ My wife ] Karen is crying her eyes out.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Warwick , 60 , said he was in awe of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s late burst of creativity .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wanted to get this last thing out of him .
He knew he was dying .
He was saying , Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got more music in meÃ¢â¬ â¢
.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Esther Schwarzbauer , 30 , a booking manager , agreed : Ã¢â¬ÅI feel that he was better in touch with the concept of his own mortality in those last months .
It didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make him want to be immortal but to create as much as possible .
It gave him the opportunity to do more and go faster than before .
Most people with a diagnosis like that would slow down but he sped up.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

The background : It has been suggested that the one good thing about David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , the solitary crumb of comfort , is the thought of all the new Bowies who will hopefully emerge in his wake .
With such intense global focus on his life and work , surely there will be a slew of young musicians sufficiently inspired to take up his mantle .
But a new Bowie doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t mean a skinny young dude with pale skin and a zigzag painted on his face making facsimiles of Ziggy Stardust or Aladdin Sane .
For all the shared experience of our communal grief these last few days , the whole point of Bowie was : do as I say , not as I do .
The closest thing to a new Bowie in the past two decades wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a white bloke from South London reactivating glam , it was probably BjÃÂ¶rk .
In the past few years , his truest progeny , in terms of polymathery , progressive artistry and provocation ?
Perhaps Tyler , the Creator .
A new Bowie in 2016 might not even be working in music .
But still , we wanted to find someone for todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s column who would in some way pay tribute to his transformative urges .
Transviolet are not by any stretch of the imagination the new Bowie , but it wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be difficult to argue that he has been one of their guiding lights .
They donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t remotely sound like him , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in that very gesture of defiance that we feel we are paying homage to the man .
Where Bowie was playful , Transviolet are sincere and serious .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are interested in challenging the status quo , and inspiring conversations that will help us overcome our differences , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ they say .
Ã¢â¬ÅToo
many times we let characteristics define and , ultimately , divide us .
We are not the colour of our skin or the amount of money we have in the bank .
We are not our gender or our sexual orientation .
We are all humans in need of love , respect , and acceptance .
Everything else is a detail .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what the song New Bohemia is about .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s taking a step outside of your personal bubble and looking at the world from an outsiderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s perspective.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
How Bowie is that ?
New Bohemia will doubtless be a Rebel Rebel to the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s young fans , just as HalseyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s New Americana is to her acolytes .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a call to arms , their attempt at a rallying cry and kiss - off to a previous generation : Ã¢â¬ÅLook out , you rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollers , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ indeed .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rousing , with just enough of a patina of resistance about it ( Ã¢â¬ÅWe start a revolutionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) to make its audience feel different and special .
On Girls Your Age , Sarah McTaggart sings : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a renegade heart.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Slow , synthy
, it builds to a shimmering pop climax and stays there for 60 quietly convulsive seconds .
Night Vision , the new single , is also slow , a move as counterintuitive as Miley circa
We CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Stop .
Ã¢â¬ÅGet on your knees and praise me like you should , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ it goes , channelling the fervour of Ziggy if not the leper - messiah strangeness .
McTaggart sings about having Ã¢â¬Åthe world on my shouldersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
They have illusions of grandeur Ã¢â¬ â
but you should when youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re young .
Bowie did .
Bloodstream is also synthy , anthemic , with shades of Lorde .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not rewrite history :
Jean Genie and Suffragette City didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t effect a musical break with tradition ; rather they offered a souped - up blend of Detroit rock and glam pop .
Transviolet are in tune with the times and with whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s already out there , offering their twist on things , even if , as they declare in the line Ã¢â¬ÅOutlaw love make me lose controlÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
, there is an affinity with the alienated at every turn .
It might not be a case of meet the new Bowie , but we do feel confident in urging you to meet a new Bowie .
The buzz : Ã¢â¬ÅTransviolet want to take over the world and save it .
Our heroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â Nylon .
The truth : TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re the children of the revolution .
Most likely to :
Spit in the eye of fools .
Least likely to : Beat up the wrong guy .
What to buy : Night Vision is out now on Sony .

2016-01-15,"I went to YouTube just now to see if the memory IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve kept in my head for more than 43 years is correct .
When David Bowie appeared on Top of the Pops on 6 July 1972 performing Starman , did he really point at the camera on the line Ã¢â¬ÅI had to phone someone
so I picked on you - hoo - ooÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ?
He did .
In the glory days of Top of the Pops you couldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t watch things again .
You retained them in the archive of your memory .
People watched hungrily , believing it would be their only chance .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only slowly , in the years since 1972 ,
that I realised that I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the only one for whom this was a key moment .
The way Bowie pointed that finger , smilingly draped an arm around Mick Ronson , and looked beyond the camera to engage the audience sitting at home , stickily hemmed in by disapproving members of their immediate family , seemed of a piece with the new Ziggy Stardust persona weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been reading about .
It felt like an arrival long delayed .
People had been tipping Bowie for much of the previous year .
His album Hunky Dory had come out just before Christmas 1971 , with glowing reviews and a big marketing push from his new record company , but it hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really taken .
The New York Times called him Ã¢â¬Åthe most intellectually brilliant man yet to choose the long - playing album as his medium of expressionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In truth , Bowie was like everybody else , just trying to get a hit .
The last time heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been on Top of the Pops was playing piano behind Peter Noone on the latterÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
hit version of his own Oh !
You Pretty Things .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s people were furiously working the machine .
His first release of 1972 , Changes , was not a hit , despite being single of the week on Tony BlackburnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Radio 1 show .
When Bowie first came up with the Ziggy Stardust material , during a three - week trip to the US in February 1971 , his idea had been to have it fronted by Fred Burrett , a young clothes designer he and his wife Angie had met at a gay club called El Sombrero and decided to rechristen Freddie Burretti .
Bowie saw himself as the behind - the - scenes puppetmaster in that setup .
Maybe he worried that his teeth disqualified him from frontman duties .
Bowie at the time was an ideas man , pitching songs to everyone , including the horror actor Christopher Lee .
His publisher was one of the many people in the business who were backing Bowie , but it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t clear that his future was as a performer .
Whereas Hunky Dory had been extravagantly melodic , like the Beatles album that everybody was trying to make now there was a gap in the market , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was influenced by the Stooges and Velvet Underground records Bowie had been impressed by on his visit to the States .
It also owed a lot to the hit singles with which Marc Bolan , a fellow refugee from the obscurity of late night radio and the Arts Lab circuit , was tearing up the singles charts in 1971 .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be lots of guitars , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie told his producer Ken Scott .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou probably wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie had already recorded and sequenced Ziggy Stardust before Hunky Dory was released .
Such was the speed people moved at in those days of two albums a year .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was no time for second guessing yourself , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Scott recalled .
The only change made to the album was the replacement of a cover of Chuck BerryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Around and Around with Starman , a radio - friendly single made at the request of the boss of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
new record company , RCA .
Bowie had no problem doing him this favour , once he had finished the heavy lifting involved in recording the album .
In the early months of 1972 , before Ziggy Stardust came out , he and his new band were starting to appear on stage wearing the clinging space suits they had cribbed from Stanley KubrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s A Clockwork Orange , which had opened in cinemas in January .
On 8 February , they played the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Old Grey Whistle Test , the albums - centred programme that had been launched late the previous year .
Bowie stirred the pot further by turning up to an interview with Michael Watts from the Melody Maker in a camp playsuit and announcing that he was bisexual .
Everything was primed so that when Ziggy Stardust appeared in June 1972 , the market would be ready .
All of that investment in outrage and edginess paid off when Bowie appeared on Top of the Pops singing Starman .
That was the moment Bowie went above ground and nationwide .
The hype may have led us to expect something edgy and challenging .
The record was as simple and hummable a radio hit as you could possibly desire .
For the post - Beatles generation coming into their albums - buying majority , the record wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really the point .
The point was the way he looked at them .
Never a Dull Moment , David HepworthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book about music in 1971 , is published in April"
2016-01-17,"Deborah Harry and Chris Stein : Ã¢â¬ËHe showed up at our house one night with Mick Jagger Ã¢â¬ â that was pretty greatÃ¢â¬ â¢
The Blondie stars remember supporting Bowie in 1977 Chris Stein : The first time we met Bowie was when we supported him and Iggy Pop [ for The Idiot tour in 1977 ] .
We were in awe of him and Iggy right from the get - go .
He was always very charming and gentlemanly , but also wary and kind of catty at the same time .
I remember we talked about the new wave , and about [ Television frontman ] Tom VerlaineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hairdo a lot .
He was a little sarcastic and derisive of it , but at the same time I thought he was also kind of jealous of the attention the hairdo was getting .
Debbie Harry :
Yes , he had a good sense of humour .
It felt casual .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like we were trying to be intense or correct about things , we were just hanging out .
What was really impressive to me about David was that he had such a terrific sense of being an entertainer and also about the music business .
He was a very shrewd , very sharp guy .
That was consistent throughout his career : he had the ability to sell this oddity that he was , and make it clear to people who would normally be completely resistant to what he was doing .
He reached millions and millions of people .
Touring with him took us from being a very New York - based cult band into being possibly a real international music source .
CS :
And he did the same thing for Iggy , to a certain extent .
Iggy still had a kind of cult status ; he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a megastar in the A list , the way Bowie was .
But Bowie was very generous : he was just at the back , playing keyboards .
He was really concerned with the whole show moving smoothly .
The show was so professional and at the same time crazy and exciting Ã¢â¬ â
he managed to put the two things together .
DH :
That was when he had the Low album out , which was received poorly .
He got some real heavy criticism for that .
But there you go .
The whole show was wonderful and energetic .
It was our first big tour .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never played on such a big stage before .
He gave me some technical advice about working the different sides and centre , and advice about finding the light .
Theatrical stuff .
He worked in mime , and he had a real theatrical background .
On the stage he was elegant and such a strong presence : he was very graceful and versatile .
His versatility was one of his major points : he was truly a renaissance artist and man .
CS : After that , we hung out a bunch of times over the years and he was always very gracious .
I saw him in the summer of 2013 for the last time .
We were talking about Lou Reed and how we were worried about Lou .
Bowie was like Andy Warhol : when he walked into a party it would be like the pope had arrived .
It was a combination of his notoriety and his persona .
He came to our house with Mick Jagger one time and that was fucking awesome .
They showed up in the evening : the doorbell rang and it was Bowie and Jagger .
I got to smoke a joint with Mick Ã¢â¬ â that was pretty great .
DH : They were curious about our new home , and just wanted to hang out , I guess .
So they dropped in , and we actually let them in the house [ laughs ] .
CS :
In terms of music , Bowie was definitely a big influence on us , especially in the way he was always reinventing himself and his style .
And his eclecticism : never being scared to experiment and go in different directions .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d seen the Spiders from Mars show at Radio City [ in February 1973 ] before I met [ Debbie ] .
Everybody from downtown was at that .
DH : I went to see him during the Ziggy Stardust tour at Carnegie Hall .
So we had both been influenced or appreciative [ of Bowie ] even before we met or started working together .
CS :
One time , years ago , we performed Heroes with Robert Fripp live .
The song is very simple but so imaginative at the same time Ã¢â¬ â the whole anthemic quality of it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about the glory of being a weirdo .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a great sentiment .
David Bowie touched everybody , for GodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sakes .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s crazy .
The music and just everything about him has run into so many facets of our society .
I think people underestimate the masses .
People , especially nowadays , are ready for things that push the envelope a lot more , and Bowie was always pushing it .
I mean , in the first images we were seeing of him he was wearing a dress .
DH : It always seemed very important to have talked with him and to have met him .
One thing that really surprised me about him was he was chameleon - like , which is obvious in the transition of characters he developed over the years , but youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never notice him if he was out walking in the street .
He was very clever , he was very good at that : he walked around the city streets wherever he was and
no one ever really recognised him .
CS :
Musically , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m amazed at this last bit of stuff ,
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m just starting to get into it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interesting that he chose to go in a jazzy direction .
He references passing in these videos and music that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s put out .
And IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never seen anything like this before .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been struggling to try to think of something similar
and I really canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t .
Maybe Byron , or Yukio Mishima , the Japanese writer , who killed himself very dramatically , but that was more sloppy than this thing that Bowie has done now .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just amazing that he pulled this off .
DH :
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like a Romantic poet .
The thing thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really great about this is that Ã¢â¬ â putting myself in his place , and thinking , Ã¢â¬Åwow , what a great idea this is , to hold on toÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â instead of lying around being sick and miserable , he took the energy he had left and was creative , doing this thing that he liked the best .
So now I think that thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the most admirable part of it , although itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a little hard to take right now .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a great tribute to his strength and creativity .
He had a totality to his vision , and he carried it through to the end .
Kate Bush : Ã¢â¬ËHe was wonderfully eccentric Ã¢â¬ â and he was oursÃ¢â¬ â¢
The singer - songwriter recalls a musical icon David Bowie had everything .
He was intelligent , imaginative , brave , charismatic , cool , sexy and truly inspirational both visually and musically .
He created such staggeringly brilliant work , yes , but so much of it and it was so good .
There are great people who make great work but who else has left a mark like his ?
No one like him .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m struck by how the whole country has been flung into mourning and shock .
Shock , because someone who had already transcended into immortality could actually die .
He was ours .
Wonderfully eccentric in a way that only an Englishman could be .
Whatever journey his beautiful soul is now on , I hope he can somehow feel how much we all miss him .
Carlos Alomar :
Ã¢â¬ËHe wanted to be hip
so I took him to see some Latin bandsÃ¢â¬ â¢
The guitarist played on many Bowie albums The first time I met him he had finished with the Spiders from Mars .
It was the mid-70s and he was recording with Lulu .
I was one of the session musicians and when I got to the studio a pasty , 98 lb , orange - haired man covered in white pancake makeup came through the door .
He was really sweet , dropping all these Americanisms like [ adopts British accent ] :
Ã¢â¬ÅHey
manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s really coolÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
He wanted to be hip
so I took him to see some Latin bands and then to the Apollo theatre to see Richard Pryor .
Can you imagine what it was like backstage after the show ?
Pryor was like Ã¢â¬ÅWhoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s this white guy?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
David wanted me to work with him .
He asked me to play on Diamond Dogs and tour with him and I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do either .
Finally he asked me to do an album with the theme of Ã¢â¬Åthe sound of PhiladelphiaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
and I agreed .
I brought this troupe of amazing musicians to the Young Americans ( 1975 ) album sessions , like my wife , Robin Clark , my best friend , Luther Vandross , and the bass player Emir Kassan .
It took three weeks to record the album .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ d never done that before , his albums with the Spiders took three to four months to make .
It was in the cocaine days and he needed to stay up because the recording would happen all through to night .
We worked 20- to 24-hour days on that album .
They would wake me up to do a guitar track at three in the morning and Luther Vandross at 4 am to lay down a backing vocal .
My favourite memory of working with him was when Tina Turner came in to record Tonight ( 1984 ) with us .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d never seen him so nervous , not in front of record companies , not in front of managers or anybody .
But , man , he was like a little school kid trying to make sure everything was just right .
He said , Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to go out for dinner and youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to come!Ã¢â¬ â¢
I said , Ã¢â¬ÅSheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Tina Turner , sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not going to bite you !
Get some man balls.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He was so nervous .
In the end , it was a wonderful meeting .
We found out that sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist .
David was a Buddhist and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a Buddhist , so we ended up speaking about our life philosophies .
The conversation was fuelled by drink , so it went from heaven to hell pretty fast [ laughs ] .
The last time I saw him was at Tony ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s birthday party .
We were having a great time but he looked a little bit frail .
I just figured , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all getting older .
There was no indication that anything else was going on .
But the master had planned it a certain way : he had his birthday which we celebrated like crazy , then he released Blackstar and then , oh by the way , he died .
The sequence of events doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t give you enough time to process them because your brain is trying to decipher the message
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in that great record .
David was like a comet , blazing brightly into the sky .
That comet travelled too fast for us to see it and take it all in at once .
Gail Ann Dorsey : Ã¢â¬ËI thought his call was one of my mates playing a practical jokeÃ¢â¬ â¢ Played bass in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band 1995 - 2016
In my case , it was not a matter of being Ã¢â¬ÅintroducedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to David Bowie , but somehow , by the fickle and unfathomable laws of the universe , I happen to be one of the extremely fortunate musicians in an endless sea of amazing musicians to be Ã¢â¬ÅchosenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by him .
It was the spring of 1995 and I was in Bath , writing and recording music for a solo album project with Roland Orzabal of Tears for Fears .
A telephone call came completely out of the blue one afternoon .
I naturally assumed it was one of my London mates playing a practical joke on me !
Ha ha !
It took me a minute or two of embarrassing myself to finally realise it was indeed Mr Bowie himself asking if I would be interested in playing bass in a band he was putting together for a tour with Nine Inch Nails that coming fall .
Obviously , my answer was not Ã¢â¬ÅnoÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and so it seems , from where we find ourselves today , the rest was historyÃ¢â¬
Â¦
In the 20 years following that life - changing phone call , some of the mystery of how he stumbled upon me became a bit clearer .
Bowie was an astute observer .
He was a man who was constantly seeking the new , the now , and had a voracious appetite for devouring the sweet seeds of the future .
As a human being as well as an artist , he was able to see the potential for creative expression in virtually everything and everyone around him ; perhaps the God - given aptitude that set him apart from the rest .
Through his work , it feels like he knows us , even better than we know ourselves .
That certainly proved to be true in my case .
To watch David work , to be witness to his brilliant and nimble mind , and to be a member of his extraordinary team for the realisation of his unparalleled artistic visions is just as educational and exhilarating as one would imagine .
[ Working with ] an artist of his calibre and stature could have been a disappointing , nightmarish charade of ego and hierarchy , but there was always an atmosphere of professionalism , respect , endless humour , and loveÃ¢â¬ Â¦
While no one can claim to be Ã¢â¬ÅperfectÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as a human being , as an artist , he was .
Sadie Coles : Ã¢â¬ËHe invited us all to see him play in Hanover Street one nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ Gallerist whose first space features on a Bowie album cover The first address of Sadie Coles HQ was 35 Heddon Street , London .
I think Sarah Lucas pointed out it was the site of the cover of Ziggy Stardust and that seemed to us to bode well for our new venture , particularly as Bowie then turned up unannounced at our Sarah Lucas show , The Law ( 1997 ) .
He called the [ Heddon Street ] gallery and chatted to director Pauline Daly , inviting us all Ã¢â¬ â Sarah and a host of YBAs to see him play in Hanover Street one night .
He was an inspirational example of how an artist can choose to protect themselves , and their work , from the polluting noise of the unnecessary .
When we were seeking permission for music rights for a documentary on Sarah Lucas it was a revelation to realise how super - minimal David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s management was .
Meaning his extraordinary output was truly pure , truly his vision and not filtered through a host of PR agencies , managers and business people : an artist living the life he wanted to live , on his terms , making the work he wanted to make .
That can teach us something .
His was an elegant life , work and exit .
Edwyn Collins : Ã¢â¬ËHe was never aloof .
He was easy to fall in love withÃ¢â¬ â¢
The Scottish singer - songwriter first fell for Bowie as a teenager
We were so lucky , to be adolescent when Bowie burst on to the scene .
We got him in real time , when we were forming , and the yearning for each new record from him was so thrilling .
Then it arrived Ã¢â¬ â who got it first ?
Who could afford it , had saved up ?
Congregating in bedrooms , devouring it , no talking .
A side , B side , flip it over , needle to the start , again and again .
Our Bowie rituals .
For quite a long time , in Dundee and then Glasgow , most of my waking hours were spent thinking about Bowie .
I know David made himself seem alien and strange , but he was never aloof .
He was easy to fall in love with .
He was warm , you could walk around with him in your head all day
and it comforted you .
I read he was asked about teenyboppers liking him and he said something like his mind was at its best when he was 14 .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know if mine was , but when I started writing songs , it was Bowie lyrics that made me think I had to improve my early dismal efforts .
At the fag - end of the Orange Juice days , a good memory Ã¢â¬ â on stage at Crystal Palace Bowl , at a GLC - funded all - dayer .
I sang Memory of a Free Festival .
Kind of taking the piss , but the truth is , I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to learn the words .
I knew them then and still do now , even though IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve forgotten the words to many of my own songs .
In return for all heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s given me I wished him a long and happy old age with his family .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m very sad he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get it .
Other people had other idols .
I repeat , we were the lucky ones .
We had Bowie .
Julien Temple : Ã¢â¬ËHe talked often about his need to engineer an elegant exitÃ¢â¬ â¢ Film - maker , directed Bowie in Absolute Beginners ( 1986 )
I first saw Bowie at Glastonbury in 1971 as a golden midsummer dawn broke over the do - it - yourself version of the Pyramid stage .
His voice and acoustic guitar were complemented by what seemed like a celestial dawn chorus of birds
and I thought he must be singing to us from another dimension .
That may have had something to do with chemicals in the air at the time but , extraordinarily , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve experienced exactly that same extra - dimensional feeling of spectral , spellbound awe when listening to him ( stone cold , Spotified sober this time round ) singing Lazarus from beyond the grave .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s proved more difficult than any of us could have imagined to process our collective sense of loss but surely if any death can be seen to be something positive it has to be DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
In transforming his own death into a provocative and mysterious work of art , he has left behind a haunting and disorienting final masterpiece that ensures he will remain in communication with each one of us as though he were still alive .
When I knew him well in the 1980s
Ã¢â¬ â we worked together on Absolute Beginners among other projects Ã¢â¬ â
David talked often about his compelling need to engineer an elegant exit mechanism from the circus of pop stardom and fame .
A Houdini - like disappearing act .
A velvet parachute floating down and away from the public eye .
He was obsessive about it even then and it is beyond extraordinary that he has now managed to pull it off with such breathtaking ingenuity and precision .
A Garboesque process that began with him invisibly evading the rabid buzz - hounds of the Twittersphere has ended with what seems like a magnesium flash , a sudden trick of the light and a triumphant vanishing act .
As he confides to us in Blackstar , he was operating way beyond the confines of a pop stardom which for him was always only the means to a bigger end .
We should remember Bowie as a great human emancipator on the BolÃÂ­var or Mandela scale .
An emotional liberator of people .
He was the patron saint of the outsider , the uninvited and the misfit .
All those lonely teenagers in each generation , unsure of who , or what they could possibly be Ã¢â¬ â or become .
In other words all of us .
Like the mirrored gallery of personas at the end of The Lady from Shanghai , he appeared capable of being anything he wanted to become and he challenged you to think about yourself in the same way .
When I met him I was expecting the Man
Who Fell to Earth but what I got instead was more like the insecure guy next door .
Initially shocked by that , I soon realised he was very aware of this strange tension between the weird and the normal within himself .
He knew it was refracted somehow through his brother [ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s half - brother , Terry Burns , who suffered with schizophrenia and killed himself in 1985 ] and recognised it as the wellspring of his creativity .
The Blue Jean film [ JazzinÃ¢â¬ â¢ for Blue Jean , a 21-minute short film released in 1984 ] we made together was based upon it .
His ordinariness was the secret behind the uniquely intimate relationship that exists between him and his audience and explains his ability to reach people on such a universal scale .
To touch them , teach them , like his brother taught him , and turn them on to the stranger aspects of themselves .
To watch him transition from normality into something completely incandescent as he stepped on stage was something miraculous to behold .
He contained within him a kind of Blakean star power that he seemed to be able to summon up and unleash at will .
We should be profoundly grateful that someone standing on the edge of nothingness could send out and bounce back thoughts and feelings from beyond the limits of mortality to confound and catalyse us all over again .
As he first did a lifetime ago when he beamed down that band from MarsÃ¢â¬ Â¦
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢
s hard to think of him as history , because he was always the future .
Robert Fox :
Ã¢â¬ËHe looked exhausted but made not one complaintÃ¢â¬ â¢ Theatre producer who worked with Bowie on his stage musical Lazarus I met David Bowie over 40 years ago .
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t remember the exact date .
It was at a small party thrown by mutual friends in a flat off LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Fulham Road .
Somehow I found myself talking to him about Bryan Ferry Ã¢â¬
â
he was joking that I should be his manager for some long forgotten reason .
Over the ensuing years we saw one another infrequently , but it was really after he moved to New York that we spent more time together when I was there producing various plays .
He would come to see the shows and loved to talk about all aspects of the theatre .
On 20 October 2015 , the first day of rehearsals for the musical Lazarus , just after the cast had gathered together , I got a call from Coco Schwab , DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime friend and colleague , asking me to go to a studio on Ingraham Street in Brooklyn .
I knew that I would see David there , but I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know anything else .
When I arrived I was taken by Coco through the studio that was being set up for a film shoot , into a dressing room at the back of the building to find David sitting quietly , dressed in what looked like Victorian pyjamas , having hair and makeup done .
He was cheerful and talkative , explaining the physical set up for the shoot and his character for the video of his new song Lazarus , the title song of our musical .
I was surprised that he wanted to undertake such an arduous task , knowing as I did that he was very unwell .
I knew this not because I was part of some elite inner sanctum , but because he had to tell a small group of people working on Lazarus , so that we could understand why he might be unavailable for certain periods of time .
He was soon called on to the set
and I went and sat with the director of the shoot , Johan Renck .
David climbed into a bed that was hung vertically to give the impression that he was defying gravity which allowed him to lift off a Ã¢â¬ÅflatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ bed .
He also had by now had his head wrapped in bandages with button eyes preventing him from seeing anything .
I had got off a plane only the night before after a 21-hour flight and was beginning to think that I was tripping as Johan Renck and his lighting cameraman jabbered away in Swedish , discussing the complexity of the shot .
Then Ã¢â¬ÅactionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â
the first take Ã¢â¬ â and then a second and so on up to 10 .
The camera was on the end of a crane , which was attached to a track , being operated to move by remote control and being required to end on a close - up circling DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bandaged head .
By take 10 , I was wondering how in the name of God David could tolerate this seeming torture , but he did so with jokes and good manners , until he quietly said that he needed a bit of a break while they all prepared for the next set - up .
And so he went back to his dressing room
and I followed shortly thereafter .
He looked exhausted but made not one complaint .
He asked for a salad and said heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d go and sit quietly on his own .
I left to go back to Manhattan , realising yet again that nothing was going to stop David from finishing all the work he had undertaken .
This involved spending the rest of that day completing the shoot .
It also meant , in the weeks that followed , attending rehearsals , band calls and run - throughs of Lazarus and appearing on opening night , 7 December , to lend his support and encouragement to everyone involved .
I have been fortunate to have worked with a number of huge creative talents , and David was as great as , if not greater than , any of them .
He had one quality that was unique in my experience
Ã¢â¬
â
he had his ego completely in check .
Not for one second did he behave with anything other than impeccable manners , humour and grace and a desire to collaborate on an entirely even playing field .
He had nothing but support and encouragement for his colleagues and his highly tuned and immensely well disciplined brain inspired others to try to achieve their best .
The extraordinary outpouring of love and sadness over these past few days is , of course , to do with him being a great artist , but it is also as much to do with him having been a great man .
Nicola Tyson :
Ã¢â¬ËYou felt in safe hands with him .
He made it OK , made you want to make artÃ¢â¬ â¢ Painter who was a regular at the influential Bowie Nights at BillyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , Soho , in the 1970s It would be easy to start this by saying :
Ã¢â¬ÅFor my generation , Bowie was a defining influenceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , but his influence didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t stop Ã¢â¬ â or even begin Ã¢â¬ â with my generation .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence spanned the last 50 years , in which he consistently surprised and inspired us anew , with different and unpredictable creative co - ordinates .
The very early punk scene of Ã¢â¬ â¢ 76-Ã¢â¬ â¢ 77 had a dark Roxy Music / Bowie / Warholian glamour component .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t yet purely about moronic ugliness , uniformity and gobbing .
After hours Ã¢â¬ â once the gigs were over and the pubs had shut Ã¢â¬ â the then small London punk scene took safe haven in the handful of West End gay clubs , where anything went already and creative outsiders were welcomed .
When punk went mainstream in Ã¢â¬ â¢ 78 and the underground thrill was gone , inevitably it was from within that milieu and in those venues that the next scene would develop .
Inevitably , too , Bowie Ã¢â¬ â pop cultural magician , androgyne , fount of subversive creativity , master of flamboyance and understatement Ã¢â¬ â would be its muse .
In 1978 , I was 18 , still a teenager like most of the Bowie NightsÃ¢â¬ â¢ crowd .
We hadnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t wanted punk to end Ã¢â¬
â
it had only just got started , most of us having only found our way to it in early Ã¢â¬ â¢ 77 .
So to fill the void we needed to invent a new scene and Bowie Nights was a start .
It meant self - expression , self - invention , pushing on out beyond your comfort zone and , most importantly , beyond that of everyone else .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shocking to think heÃ¢â¬
â¢ s no longer there .
You always felt in safe hands with him
Ã¢â¬ â heÃ¢â¬
â¢ d make it all OK , make it into art , make you want to make art .
It feels like another anchor with the past has been pulled up and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll have to drift on into the future now without his singular , sophisticated guidance ."
2016-01-17,"David Bowie fans may still be in mourning but it seems that , commercially , the musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s golden years are just beginning , with 17 of his albums storming into the Australian Recording Industry Association ( Aria ) top 100 albums chart .
Blackstar , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
25th and final solo album , which long - serving producer Tony Visconti last week referred to as a Ã¢â¬Åparting giftÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , made its debut at No 1 on the albums chart .
According to the association , the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sales climbed dramatically after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death on 10 January .
Aria said Blackstar was
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first official Aria No 1 album .
Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , released in 1980 , and LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , released in 1983 , were No 1 albums before the Aria charts were established in July 1983 .
Bowie now holds the Aria charts record for most albums in the top 100 by a single artist .
Michael Jackson previously held the record with 14 .
There are 13 David Bowie albums in this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top 50 :
Nothing Has Changed ( The Best Of David Bowie ) ( No 3 ) , Best Of Bowie ( No 9 ) , The Best Of David
Bowie 1969/1974 ( No 14 ) , The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust
And The Spiders From Mars ( N0 21 ) , The Next Day ( No 23 ) , The Best Of David Bowie 1980/1987 ( No 30 ) , Aladdin Sane ( No 35 ) , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance ( No 37 ) , Diamond Dogs ( No 41 ) , Heroes ( No 42 ) , Hunky Dory (
No 45 ) and The Best Of David
Bowie 1974/1979 ( No 49 ) .
This means Bowie has equalled the Aria charts record for most albums in the top 50 by a single artist , set by Michael Jackson , who achieved the feat after his death in July 2009 .
A further four Bowie albums appear in the lower half of the top 100 : Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) ( # 52 ) , Sound + Vision ( # 72 ) , Low ( # 83 ) and Station To Station ( # 95 ) .
On the singles chart , three Bowie tracks have re - entered the top 50 : Space Oddity ( No 31 ) , Heroes ( No 36 ) and his collaboration with Queen , Under Pressure ( No 42 ) .
A further five are present in the top 100 : Starman ( No 54 ) , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance ( No 63 ) , Changes ( No 80 ) and Life
On Mars ?
( No 83 ) .
Justin Bieber continued to dominate the top of the singles chart , his song Love Yourself spending its sixth week at No 1 ."
2016-01-17,"An hour after the BBC alert at 2.05 am that David Bowie had died , a slender woman in a dark fur coat and heels swerved her car into the bike lane opposite the entrance to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apartment block in New York .
The woman , who said her name was Kate , got out carrying a small candle , convenience - store flowers and a note that read :
Ã¢â¬ÅThank
You David .
May The Gods Bless Us All.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
She arranged the items carefully .
The candle kept blowing out in the wind .
She turned to speak : Ã¢â¬ÅFirst Lou Reed , now David Bowie .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really it for New York .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
over.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅA transitioning moment , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ was all she would say by way of further explanation .
The city was dark .
It was cold .
The drunks in the bar across the street were drinking heavily on the news .
They danced in unsteady huddles to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hits .
Jean Genie , Heroes .
Young Americans .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance .
At 4.30am , everyone was finally tossed out .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe lost a legend , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Dave the barkeep .
Anxiety about ManhattanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gentrification is hardly new .
But with the loss of each big figure associated with a past that many feel was wilder and more creative Ã¢â¬ â though that can just mean sleazier and more dangerous Ã¢â¬ â there is deepening sense of disconnection from the city that shaped , and was shaped by , artistic figures from the Beat poets to Andy Warhol .
Bowie himself , drawn initially to the wildness of WarholÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Factory and its unusual , gender - fluid members , turned out to be as much an example of the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gentrification as he had been representative of its infamous wild side .
Despite efforts to redress the imbalance , ranging from potential restrictions on undeclared foreign ownership of apartments in the so - called shadow - maker towers going up around the city , to public housing projects for the underclass , are under way .
Housing in Manhattan remains expensive , and beyond the reach of the kind of avant - garde characters Bowie first came to sample .
Anyone seeking relics of rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll would be better off heading to New Jersey .
CBGB , the shuttered punk - rock club in the Bowery ,
Ã¢â¬ÅreopenedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ last month as CBGB LAB Ã¢â¬ â lounge and bar Ã¢â¬ â at Newark airport .
During last week , the mini - Bowie shrine grew into a major monument of flowers , offerings , artwork , even feather boas , dedicated to the artist and his adopted personas .
But people were paying tribute to more than Bowie himself .
Unlike Lou Reed or John Lennon , Bowie was not especially associated with New York .
Over 25 years , he had made himself almost invisible .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I first came to New York , I was in my early 20s , discovering a city I had fantasised over since my teens .
I saw it with multicoloured glasses , to say the least .
Also , I rarely got up before noon and hit the sack again around four or five in the morning ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie told New York magazine in 1991 .
Ã¢â¬ÅThese days , my buzz can be obtained by just walking , preferably early in the morning , as I am a seriously early riser .
I leave only if work demands it .
I am not a secretive guy , but I am quite private .
I live as a citizen pure and simple .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t go for the disguise thing Ã¢â¬ â IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never found it necessary , at least not since my real hair colour grew in years ago .
I suppose wearing jeans is the nearest I get to confounding expectations.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The city itself was his disguise .
Bowie would live incognito , with his wife Iman and daughter Lexi , a small inner circle Ã¢â¬ â manager Coco Schwab and archivist Jimmy King Ã¢â¬
â and more recent additions , including actress and Bowie lookalike Tilda Swinton .
Over the years , people began to ask questions : Where was he ?
What was he doing ?
Was he sick ?
Was he emulating reclusive Greta Garbo ?
As it turned out , the theories were not entirely wrong : freebasing cocaine , plus years of heavy smoking , had brought on a heart attack on stage in 2004 that had triggered several subsequent strokes .
He had grown obese through medication .
Then rumours of cancer began to circulate .
Like many musicians , he was protected by his circle .
Iman would say her husband , secluded in his rooftop eyrie overlooking downtown New York , was always working , that he read the British papers , avidly kept up with the nationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political news .
In fact , Bowie was in effect living a well - appointed , middle - class life : raising a daughter , being a house - husband ( Iman sells fashion wares on shopping channel QVC ) , and spending weekends in his secluded country estate , 100 miles north , near Woodstock in the Catskills .
It was not so radically different to the life he lived in Geneva in the 1980s or , minus the drugs , the lifestyle he lived with Iggy Pop in the Turkish quarter of Berlin .
They were living anonymous , middle - class lives and enjoying their culture and money .
Around new year , the couple would have gatherings .
A relaxed dinner followed by a video , one year
The Man Who Bought Mustique , about the eccentric British aristo Colin Tennant , who developed the private island where Bowie owned a Batik villa .
Yet should we be surprised that Bowie , notwithstanding a two - year burst of creative energy that included two albums , The Next Day and Blackstar , a record - setting exhibition of memorabilia , David Bowie
IsÃ¢â¬
Â¦ and a play , Lazarus ,
that in effect rounded off his life , had chosen a relatively anonymous existence ?
After a lifetime in the spotlight , Bowie valued privacy for himself and his family above all else .
Manhattan offered anonymity , and anonymity became his disguise .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe just looked like an older Englishman dressed smartly with a checked scarf , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said one New York resident last week .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was like he was hiding in plain sight.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Even the crowds that gathered in tribute outside 285 Lafayette Street would have been unlikely to see him during his lifetime : he liked to come and go through the service entrance at the back of the building .
And where better to live a sensible , wealthy , middle - class life than contemporary Manhattan , a city Ã¢â¬ â like central London Ã¢â¬ â awash with foreign money with swaths of property owned through foreign shell companies whose ownership Ã¢â¬ â and source of income Ã¢â¬
â is unknown ?
Last week , the US government cracked down on the practice , giving financial authorities new powers to seek transparency .
But many feel this may be too late : Manhattan is increasingly an enclave for the absent super - wealthy or inhabitants devoted to developing well - paid corporate identities , not extreme transformations of personality , creativity or decadent lifestyles that New York , and famous inhabitants from the poets and abstract expressionists to Bob Dylan , Warhol , Johnny Thunders , the Ramones et al , exemplified over the years .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe artists got pushed out , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Len Forgione , 37 , Ã¢â¬Åand with it an era of glitz and glam.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But that was not all that Bowie represented , he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅMusical genius , nonconformity , confidence in oneself , and gender fluidity before it was the norm.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The city that shaped the mourners also shaped Bowie and Reed .
Ã¢â¬ÅNew York was an inspiration to David , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s manager , Tom Sarig .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was drawn to the grittiness , the vÃ Â© ritÃ Â© of it .
But while Lou was conspicuous in the city , a fixture , David blended in .
He was a ghost in it in a way.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Reed and Bowie remained good friends , with Bowie lending support to the Delmore Schwartz scholarship Reed established at Syracuse University .
It also now appears both men paid the same deadly price Ã¢â¬ â liver cancer Ã¢â¬ â for earlier drug problems .
But at least while both were alive , albeit living essentially safe middle - class lives , there was still some connection to New YorkÃ¢â¬
â¢ s wild past of the 1970s
Ã¢â¬ â a past that is set to be celebrated next month with HBOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Vinyl and in recent books , including St Marks
Is Dead :
The Many Lives of AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Hippest Street .
Were BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s mourners grieving a broader spectrum of loss ?
Yes , said video artist Rebecca Tiernan , 26 , who had come to pay her respects at his apartment .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe represented a creative time in New York that I fantasise and glamorise in my mind.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She , too , left flowers and disappeared into the crowd ."
2016-01-17,"Shaun Keaveny ( 6 Music ) | iPlayer Lauren Laverne ( 6 Music ) | iPlayer Thank You
David Bowie ( 6 Music ) | iPlayer The Best Show
The Untold ( Radio 4 ) | iPlayer For just about everyone I know , Monday morning was not a good time .
I switched on the radio , to 5 Live , and heard mention of David Bowie .
I thought , Ã¢â¬ÅGreat , Bowie!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ , and then realised , and changed channelÃ¢â¬
Â¦
At such a time , truly , there is no other station to go to .
BBC 6 Music on Monday was exactly right .
Shaun Keaveny , with Matt Everitt , had the unenviable task of getting everyone who was waking up through the horrible news , over and over .
They did it beautifully , as did Lauren Laverne after them .
Radio is all about tone , and their tone was perfect : they were clearly as sad as us , and getting through by talking about that sadness , and playing the music , along with a few other appropriate tracks .
Whereas on 5 Live , when they played Space Oddity , Nicky Campbell interrupted , to tell us Ã¢â¬ÅI love this bitÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
What ?
Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s an acoustic guitar , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe man who brought the world so much musicÃ¢â¬ Â¦ a giant has passed away at the age of 69Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I have no doubt at all he was genuinely upset , but really , could Campbell be any more Partridge ?
On 6 Music , Keaveny just kept playing beautiful Bowie tracks , and gently reading out listenersÃ¢â¬ â¢ reactions .
Laverne , when she was on , read out an email from a listener whose young son was obsessed with Bowie , to the extent of always asking face - painters for a Ziggy lightning stripe , instead of , say , tiger stripes or Batman .
She advised the young Bowie - lover to learn to play guitar .
Lovely .
After her , Mark Radcliffe presented a special , the naffly titled , Thank You
David Bowie .
As he spoke to Stuart Maconie at the end , their excitement that Bowie had ever even existed at all spilled out and , again , made us feel a little better .
Radio is astonishingly heartening when it can do such things , express what weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re feeling and let us in at the same time .
6 Music is still broadcasting , of course , because of people campaigning for it to stay .
One of those who campaigned was David Bowie .
In the US , Tom Scharpling is considered one of the godfathers of podcasting .
His show , The Best Show , started on WFMU , a public radio station , and moved to being a standalone podcast in November 2014 ; but his approach Ã¢â¬ â rambling , funny , freeform Ã¢â¬ â is often imitated , usually by male comedians .
On Tuesday night , he did a two and a half hour show on Bowie .
Many in the US loved this episode , so I mention it ; but it was not my cup of tea .
Scharpling talks too much for me , with pauses that are too long .
He waffled on for an age , and then took some calls from his listeners , who told their tales of BowieÃ¢â¬ Â¦
but , you know , they were all pretty mundane .
The show would have been better if it had actually featured more Bowie and , of course , if there had been a producer or editor strong enough to tell Scharpling that .
In the end , I switched off and listened to Blackstar instead .
For all you non - Bowie types , why not try a couple of theseÃ¢â¬ Â¦
Grace Dent has a new series on Radio 4 , The Untold , which is a good thing .
The idea is that the series tells us untold tales of 21st - century Britain , from the inside out .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very podcasty , in the Radiotopia sense , and DentÃ¢â¬ â¢ s presentation is sensitive and modern , with a storytelling feel and Ã¢â¬ â
yes Ã¢â¬ â a lovely tone .
She doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do the interviews , which I am sad about , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the way these days
( the producer Laurence Grissell did all the fieldwork , getting excellent interviews ) .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great when the BBC takes the best of American podcasting , uses its own resources and skills , and comes up with a great new listen .
The first Untold story was about Steve , a man struggling with a gambling addiction , and what happened to him and his relationship with his family .
Riveting , human stuff ; and there are 11 Ã¢â¬ â 11 !
Ã¢â¬ â more programmes to come .

2016-01-17,"Among the first tributes paid to David Bowie after the announcement of his death last Monday morning was that by David Cameron , who spoke of Bowie as Ã¢â¬Åa genius who provided the soundtrack of our livesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , citing his own days at Eton listening to a friendÃ¢â¬ â¢ s copy of Hunky Dory .
Putting aside the unlikely image of the prime minister rocking out to Queen Bitch , Cameron was shrewd enough to recognise that someone very special had checked out , and that the nationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collective heart would face the working week sorely bruised .
It made quite a contrast to the silence with which Margaret Thatcher greeted the assassination of John Lennon a generation earlier .
If CameronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s remarks show how deeply assimilated into our culture pop has become , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death highlights how far popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s powers of subversion and invention have atrophied .
Over the tempestuous decade of his 1970s glory years , Bowie illuminated popular culture in a way unequalled since , and which is unimaginable in the X Factor era .
Bowie didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just entertain , he intrigued and provoked , cross - pollinating his music with painting , literature , film , fashion and stage .
From the outset he maintained that he was an artist who just happened to be working in pop , and when he told the Guardian in 1986 that Ã¢â¬ÅOf all the art forms , rock is the living art formÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
, he was the proof of his words .
As Ziggy Stardust he became the first sci - fi rock star , his androgynous Ã¢â¬ÅalienÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ guise a metaphor for taboo sexuality Ã¢â¬ â or simply for being a teenager .
When he put his arm round guitarist Mick Ronson during a 1972 Top of the Pops performance of Starman , he beamed the sexual revolution direct into the nationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s living rooms .
This weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deluge of tributes , tweets , anecdotes and street shrines attest to the depth of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s impact , the public sense of loss made pungent by a last album , Blackstar , released two days before his death , on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 69th birthday , and showcased by a racked , haunting video ( for the single Lazarus ) that made a jaw - dropping finale to a dazzling career .
In retrospect , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mildly shocking to recall that even as he cut his fearsome trajectory through 70s pop Ã¢â¬ â shape - shifting between Ziggy , Aladdin Sane , Diamond Dog , Young American , Thin White Duke and the Ã¢â¬ÅBerlin trilogyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of Low , Heroes and Lodger Ã¢â¬ â BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career was largely off the radar of the mainstream media .
Cracked Actor Ã¢â¬ â
Alan YentobÃ¢â¬ â¢ s BBC documentary of the 1974 US tour , revealing a frail , coke - addled Bowie on the edge of dissolution , as weird and remote as his role in The Man
Who Fell to Earth Ã¢â¬
â was very much the exception .
Mostly , it was left to the music press to chronicle BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dizzying pirouettes .
Here he was a fixture , an obsession : when I joined NME in the mid-70s ,
Bowie , Roxy Music and the Stones took it in turns to own the cover .
Any excuse would do Ã¢â¬ â a record , a concert , a poll - win Ã¢â¬ â while in writer Charles Shaar Murray , the paper had a personal hotline to Bowie that extended to hanging out at recording sessions .
When BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fractious mother , Peggy , fell out with her famous son over his alleged negligence , it was in the pages of NME , not the tabloids , that she waged war .
And when Bowie returned to Britain from the US in May 1976 , it was NME that published a photo ( under the headline Ã¢â¬ÅHeil and FarewellÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) suggesting that Bowie , standing in a Mercedes convertible at Victoria station , had given a fascist salute .
Eyewitness accounts suggest he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , but remarks he had recently made to the Swedish press Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅBritain could benefit from a fascist leaderÃ¢â¬
Â¦ I believe very strongly in
fascismÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â had made him a marked man .
With the National Front on the march , and protest reggae booming in Brixton and Birmingham , pop was becoming politicised and twitchy .
Eric ClaptonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unsavoury observations on immigrants and the formation of Rock Against Racism were just a few months down the line .
Bowie apologised many times for his remarks , blaming drugs for bringing him Ã¢â¬Åto the edge of calamityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â but absolutist notions had long haunted his work .
On Hunky Dory he had warned Ã¢â¬ÅGotta make way for the Homo SuperiorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( NietzscheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ubermensch ) while casting a disdainful eye on the masses ( Ã¢â¬Åthe mice in their million hordesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
An occult dabbler ( Ã¢â¬Ådressed in CrowleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s uniformÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , Bowie clearly relished the role of Ã¢â¬ÅsuperbeingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , living on the edge , pushing himself ever harder .
1976Ã¢â¬
â¢ s
awesome Station to Station found him in Wagnerian mode , imperiously gazing over mountains and oceans , declaiming Ã¢â¬Åthe European canon is hereÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ while Ã¢â¬Ådriving like a demonÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ between the stations ( sephiroth ) of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life , Ã¢â¬Åfrom Kether to MalkuthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In reality he was an emaciated , snow - blind wreck , cowering in his rented Beverly Hills home in terror of psychic attack from Hollywood warlocks , exorcising an unwelcome demon from his swimming pool .
Small wonder that Station to Station also included the fervent Word on a Wing , aptly described by its creator , a former Buddhist , as Ã¢â¬Åa prayerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s easy to view the rest of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career as a long retreat from the excesses and dark currents of that time .
Assessing Cracked Actor in 1987 , Bowie expressed amazement that he was still around .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I see that now I can not believe I survived it ; I came so close to throwing myself away ,
physically.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
His move to Berlin in late 1976 was an attempt to put distance between himself and his demons .
Here , living in a flat above a car parts shop in grimy SchÃÂ¶neberg , he planned to clean up and get healthy , a mission hopelessly compromised by the arrival of an old cohort , Iggy Pop .
Berlin proved good for Bowie nonetheless .
Gradually , the powders were edged out , to be replaced by booze ; there was a final split with his wife , Angie ; and his formidable creativity surged back .
Low , released in early 1977 , was a startling change of direction , its bleak electronica the product of an alliance with Brian Eno .
Ever obsessive , NME ran two opposing reviews of the record , the late Ian MacDonald finding it Ã¢â¬Åstunningly beautifulÃ¢â¬ Â¦
the sound of Sinatra reproduced by Martian computersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Hot on its heels came Heroes , yoking EnoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s experimentalism to more conventional songcraft in its evocation of life on the cold warÃ¢â¬ â¢ s front line .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
monochrome edginess meant he sailed through the insurrections of punk .

Bowie stayed revered .
He watched as post - punk acts like Joy Division and New Order borrowed Low for their template , and New Romantics like Culture Club , Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet borrowed his clothes .

Ã¢â¬ â by the early 80s
Bowie needed to reassert his authority , his brand .
A label change helped him to do so , with 1983Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , a calculatedly commercial offering cut with ChicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Nile Rodgers and based on Chubby CheckerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Twist Again .
The accompanying video , shot in the Australian outback with a storyline about native Australians , repositioned Bowie from spooky alien to mature humanist , the message reinforced by his tanned , healthy appearance .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance remains BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bestselling album .
He would have other creative peaks , but not before a series of chronic , justly overlooked albums Ã¢â¬ â
Tonight , Never Let Me Down , Tin Machine Ã¢â¬ â that found him floundering for relevance and even a decent song .
His tours , for all their technical innovation and theatricality , hinted that serial experimentalist Bowie was being superseded by recycler - of - old - hits Bowie .
It was surely no coincidence that his return to form , on 1993Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Black Tie White Noise , came alongside marriage to Somali supermodel Iman Abdulmajid .
Their relationship marked the start of what Bowie called his Ã¢â¬Åreal lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , one that saw him happy to renounce his claim to any pop crown .
Speaking to the Guardian in 1997 he put it this way : Ã¢â¬ÅYou have had an extraordinary life , one a boy from your background could never dream of , so you might as well decide you are now going to have a real , real life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ His interviews from this era have a delightful quality , full of self - deprecation and jaunty humour .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
no mystique left now , not even a tattered raiment ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told a baffled Jeremy Paxman in 1999 , Ã¢â¬Åand frankly , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a lot better for it .
Mystique is not very good for oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s personal life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie met the Britpop era with a sartorial nod Ã¢â¬ â a distressed union jack frock coat by Alexander McQueen Ã¢â¬ â and a wave of dismissal in the shape of a new album propelled by drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass rhythms .
Ã¢â¬ÅI thought , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the end of the millennium and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re still playing like weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re the Rolling Stones , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said collaborator Reeves Gabrels of the shift , with 1999Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Hours as the post - rave chill - out album .
Bowie had other calls on his time .
An early enthusiast of the internet Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Åan alien life formÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â he launched his BowieNet platform in 1998 , flushed with funds from leasing the rights to his back catalogue the previous year .
The arrival of his daughter , Alexandria , in 2000 opened a joyous new dimension , though he kept working , delivering 2002Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Heathen , a dreamy confection of old and new material , and 2003Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Reality , a crafted call to Ã¢â¬Åface the music and danceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And then silence .
A heart attack during a 2004 tour of Europe required major surgery and effectively shut down public Bowie for the best part of a decade .
His previous few albums had been streaked with intimations of mortality that now became more alarming .
There were occasional bursts of activity
Ã¢â¬ â recorded duets , final onstage performances with Alicia Keys in 2006 and David Gilmour in 2007
Ã¢â¬ â but mostly it was silence .
Bowie retreated into the family apartment in New York , to be occasionally spotted in anonymous garb on ManhattanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s streets .
There were rumours about his health , but he and Iman ( who has her own cosmetics business ) removed themselves from public life .
Bowie broke the silence in 2013 with The Next Day , a gnarly rock album spitting anger at warmongers , zombie celebrities and The Reaper with equal venom , as he prepares to Ã¢â¬Åstumble to the graveyard and lay down by my parentsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , adding archly , Ã¢â¬Åjust remember duckies , everybody gets gotÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
So this week has shown .
Few fans of The Dame would choose his last 20 years as their favourite chapter from a famously diverse career , yet for Bowie himself it was his truest era , his Ã¢â¬Åreal lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , partly because he was no longer obliged to be David Bowie .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
married David Jones , a totally different person , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Iman .
Bowie kissed goodbye to David Jones at 18 , changing his name partly to avoid confusion with the MonkeesÃ¢â¬ â¢ Davy Jones .
In part , one suspects , he also wanted to shed the psychic burdens that weighed on his motherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s side of the family .
His mother Peggy had two sisters who were sectioned , one confined after ECT treatment , another lobotomised for Ã¢â¬ÅnervesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The treatment of mental health was a primitive practice back then .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s older half - brother Terry , to whom he was close
( he was the subject of Jump They Say , and perhaps The Bewlay Brothers ) , suffered from schizophrenia and was also confined , just as Bowie was making his mark with Space Oddity in 1969 .
Madness became a recurring theme in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , providing him with the character of Aladdin Sane .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stage name was also part of showbiz , which had besotted him from boyhood .
Like most of his generation , he became infected by the mutant spores of rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll
Ã¢â¬ â Buddy Holly and Little Richard were favourites Ã¢â¬ â
but he also loved the tinsel , glamour and artifice of old - time show business .
He conceived Ziggy Stardust as a musical before realising he had to sing it himself , and would later shed his estuary yelp in favour of a neo - operatic baritone ; his Presley - like cover of Nina SimoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Wild Is the Wind became a signature song .
Those influences persisted until the end .
Did David Bowie know that Elvis Presley ( with whom he shared a birthday ) had recorded a song , Black Star , for a 1960 western ?
Of course he did ( the song , never issued , became Flaming Star ) .
Is it relevant ?
Oh yes .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen a man sees his black star / he knows his time , his time has come/ Black star donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t shine on
meÃ¢â¬
Â¦ Give me time to make a few dreams come true.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-17,"When David Bowie and Michael C Hall met for the first time , the rock star looked at the actor , held him in his gaze for a moment and then asked : Ã¢â¬ÅWhat is it with you?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hall didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t ask him to elaborate ; he knew Bowie meant Ã¢â¬ÅdeathÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
You canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t shake how strange a constant it has been in the 44-year - oldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life and work .
Consider his great TV roles .
First , there was HBOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wonderful Six Feet Under , in which Hall made his name as the tightly wound David Fisher , a mortician in the familyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s funeral parlour .
Then , his stardom exploded with the Showtime series Dexter , in which he played a droll forensics expert who moonlights as a serial killer of serial killers .
And now , Hall is the star of a show bound up , inside and out , with death , immortality and the afterlife .
In Lazarus Ã¢â¬ â the David Bowie musical that sold out long before it opened and well before the Starman himself died Ã¢â¬
â Hall plays Thomas Newton , a man who canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t die .
So when he woke up last Monday and learned , via Ã¢â¬Å25 or 30 textsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , that Bowie had passed away , Hall felt a familiar Ã¢â¬Åinternal fist
clenchÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
Handsome and anonymous in a West Village cafe , he balls his right hand and then spreads his fingers wide as he tries to explain : Ã¢â¬ÅSome sort of old survival mechanism kicks in .
I think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about holding on , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about mirroring what I see to not be victimised by trauma.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And then these words come out in a quiet rush :
Ã¢â¬ÅTo not be a pitiful , fatherless son.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When Hall was 11 , that fulcrum age of not really child but not quite teenager , he lost his dad to cancer .
It is young to experience death , but HallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life was coloured by it from the start : his older sister died from congenital heart disease before he was born .
It is easy , in other words , to get pretty heavy Ã¢â¬ â pretty fast Ã¢â¬ â with him .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
all right , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he laughs ,
Ã¢â¬ÅitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inevitable ...
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
and he makes a laissez - faire wave .
Because , luckily for him , Hall also has a great capacity for silliness .
You can see levity in everything he does Ã¢â¬ â in the eyes of that affable murderer Dexter , or in the movement of the leaping but gravity - bound Newton on stage at the New York Theater Workshop .
Before Lazarus , Hall was splattered with glitter on Broadway in the title role of the gender - bending Hedwig and the Angry Inch .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhich served , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he jokes , Ã¢â¬Åas a very elaborate glam audition.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He already had the job before he met Bowie , but when it came time to sing , Ã¢â¬ÅI felt the butterflies start turning to bats .
And Bowie said , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â Hall affects a voice of self - mocking kingliness
Ã¢â¬ â
Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ËNow sing my songs for me.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In other words : Ã¢â¬ÅHe was sort of naming the absurdity of the moment , which I really appreciated .
I think he took pains to put people at ease .
He was so generous , and palpably kind.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hall began to sing
Where Are We Now ? , from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album
The Next Day , facing the pianist , and it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t until he reached the last verse that he became aware of Ã¢â¬ÅoohsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ coming from the figure in his peripheral vision .
He turned and looked .
Bowie , eyes closed , was singing the backing vocals .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd I thought : Ã¢â¬ËOK , this is it .
I have nothing left to fear.Ã¢â¬ â¢ And that , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he smiles broadly , Ã¢â¬Åwas an amazing day .
I kept it together , but when he left , I was alone in the apartment and my legs went out , and I sort of fell to the floor .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve never met someone for whom I had such reverence .
And the thing about meeting him was not just that I knew him , because I was so familiar with his music , but , because of the resonance of his music and the way it affects anyone who comes to love it , there was a sense that he knew me.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
On opening night , Bowie sent him , Ã¢â¬Åa very , very amazing gift and note .
Out of respect for his intense privacy IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll just say that it was an artefact from his past that he had passed on to me .
And it will be a talisman to me for the rest of my life.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
There is a magnificently long pause as Hall seems to internally weigh up whether or not to say more .
His forehead creases deeper .
Finally , he signals that the thought has been dismissed and we move on .
With yet more Bowie eeriness , the cast were scheduled to record the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s soundtrack on that Monday of his death .
The recording session became a sort of wake .
Ã¢â¬ÅI did feel that a part of my work was to empty myself out and let it move through me ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hall says .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs is often the case when youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re performing , but in this case , all the more so .
Since he has passed , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s probably been a more potent sense of his presence.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Like countless others , for example , Hall has spent the past few days playing Blackstar on repeat .
This , the elegiac album Bowie released two days before his death , includes those lines :
Ã¢â¬ÅLook up here , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heaven.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
On the table between us are the iPhone and earphones that Hall was listening with when he walked in .
He indicates them : Ã¢â¬ÅThis is what he gave us so IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll take it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heavy , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s soothing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He uses similar words to describe getting through the show last Tuesday : Ã¢â¬ÅSo much of what I love about him characterised what I loved about doing the show that night Ã¢â¬ â
it was simultaneously heavy and as light as air.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Hall calls Bowie Ã¢â¬ÅdichotomousÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Årevealed and impenetrable , and heartfelt and detached .
Even his presentation of himself as an alien is what made him so universally relatable to humans .
Because we all , in some way or another , feel that way , and Ã¢â¬ â depending on your appetite for airy - fairyness or scientific background
Ã¢â¬ â
he brought the stardust in.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
If anyone in the cast of Lazarus knew how ill Bowie was , they kept it to themselves .
Hall can certainly appreciate the wish to keep such a thing private .
At the age of 38 , he was diagnosed with HodgkinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lymphoma , a form of cancer .
He told no one on the set of Dexter , just got the job done and then quietly began chemo the day after filming wrapped on the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fourth season .
The show ran for a critically acclaimed eight seasons , during which Hall racked up five Emmy nominations .
He has a characteristically modest explanation for its success : Ã¢â¬ÅSome people like the bad boy and some people like the boy next door , and he sort of manages to present both .
So I guess he kind of had that broad spectrum of appeal in his twisted way.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
With awards season looming at the end of 2009 , he foresaw a barrage of questions over his conspicuous baldness and so , in January 2010 , he released a statement confirming he was undergoing treatment .
At the Golden Globes four days later , he wore a knit hat with his tuxedo and when he won best actor he bounded up to the podium to deliver a brief and grinning acceptance speech that made no mention of illness .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe language surrounding cancer is not language
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m particularly comfortable with ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
( He is now in remission . )
Ã¢â¬ÅThis idea of Ã¢â¬Ëbravely succumbingÃ¢â¬ â¢ or Ã¢â¬Ësuccessfully fightingÃ¢â¬ â¢ or Ã¢â¬Ëwinning the battle againstÃ¢â¬ â¢ ...
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to do anything to encourage that language .
People say : Ã¢â¬ËYou beat cancer.Ã¢â¬ â¢ And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like : Ã¢â¬ËNo , a cocktail of chemotherapy drugs beat cancer.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He goes on , scoffing :
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen people go get chemo , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not injecting themselves with will
Ã¢â¬ â
I have lost various loved ones to cancer , and I certainly donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel that I am any stronger or braver than them.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He did , however , receive his diagnosis with extraordinary calm .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was a sense of bemusement , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut a sense of , Ã¢â¬Ëof courseÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ â yÃ¢â¬ â¢ know ?
Of course thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a part of the story.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He is referring to the fact that , at 38 , he was a year younger than his dad had been when he died .
The age had always had a morbid significance and
so : Ã¢â¬ÅI felt justified in what had been a preoccupation with this threshold in my life since age 11 Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ËWell ,
here I am.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Another vast and thoughtful pause before he offers this : Ã¢â¬ÅIn a way , the relatively sunny picture I had in terms of my prognosis , revealed to me the extent of my survivorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guilt .
I was like :
Ã¢â¬ËWell , dad had real cancer.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
There is something familiar about that filial inferiority complex .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
m thinking of the pilot episode of Six Feet Under , in which the closeted Fisher
( arguably TVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first great gay character ) has to prepare the body of his own father .
Who then appears beside him , a revenant , with this petty paternal put - down : Ã¢â¬ÅOh , no , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re doing me?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hall , who lives in Manhattan with a cat and a dog ( heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been married twice to actor Amy Spanger and then to Dexter co - star Jennifer Carpenter and is now dating Morgan Macgregor , an editor ) has experienced similar kinds of psychological communion with his dad .
Ã¢â¬ÅI mean , even in the moment when I received the diagnosis , I felt a twinge of connection .
I think those are clues that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve looked for my whole life .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m never more encouraged than to hear someone talk about how eerie it is that I move like my father.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In December , for example , Hall sang Lazarus on the Colbert Show , and when the number ended he stepped back and gestured to the band .
Afterwards , his mother told him that in that moment he had looked exactly like his father .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd that was heartening to me .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s some sense of not being alone , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅOf being inhabited .
In a way that feels good.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ That description could serve for acting itself .
Did his grief coincide with his decision to become an actor ?
Ã¢â¬ÅI think it became all the more of a lifeline for me at that point , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd the need to escape and the need to process things or confront things indirectly was probably solidified by that trauma.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Most of his career , though , has been about inhabiting trauma , so much so that I half expect his IMDb page to be spattered with blood .
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have nightmares about embalming people or killing people or my home planet ...
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , referencing Six Feet Under , Dexter and Lazarus respectively ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut when so much of your spiritual , psychic , emotional energy is dedicated toward the authentic simulation of some fiction , it affects you in some way .
I mean , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the tricky thing about playing a character for a long time Ã¢â¬ â
you initially feel itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s therapeutic .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re tilling what would have otherwise been dead soil and airing it out .
But after a while , it feels like youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re reinforcing bad habits .
I mean , yeah , it was nice to check in with my doormat issues , but after a while I was ready to stop playing David Fisher , you know ?
Or , it was nice to really explore the degree to which I struggle with my own sense of authenticity , but after a while I was ready to stop playing Dexter.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hall once said that it was only by secrets that he had a sense of himself .
It sounds like a rather grave pronouncement , but when I mention it , he sparks into playfulness .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut we always have one , you know?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He points at me : Ã¢â¬ÅYou have one !
I always try to have one .
It could be anything :
Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m wearing womenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s underwearÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ â whatever Ã¢â¬ â
or , Ã¢â¬ËI killed my family.Ã¢â¬
â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And that Ã¢â¬ â knickers and homicide , the silly and the deeply dire Ã¢â¬ â seems like a very Michael C Hall pairing .
Death comes for us all , even starmen , so
letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s put on our red shoes and dance while we can ."
2016-01-17,"Robert Peston did not enjoy the most auspicious start to his new role as ITVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political editor last Monday .
First , he woke up to the news that his childhood hero David Bowie had died and then , when we arrived together at his new corporate home , the man at reception asked him where he worked .
The former BBC economics editor simply raised an eyebrow and said , in the slightly imperious and nasally voice that helped make him one of the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best - known TV reporters , Ã¢â¬ÅI work here.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Peston is ITVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s star signing in an increasingly fierce competition over news and current affairs .
In the months since he announced he was leaving the BBC , a public spat over ratings between ITVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s anchor Tom Bradby and the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Huw Edwards has led to the rivalry between the flagship 10 pm news shows being described as the Ã¢â¬Åbattle of the bongsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
On Monday night , ITVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s News at Ten will get a revamp with a new title sequence including more dramatic music and nationwide graphics .
Its figures Ã¢â¬ â an average of 1.92 million viewers since the start of the year , above last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1.78 million but not much higher than January 2015 , are still overshadowed by the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s average of more than 4 million .
So why did Peston leave the BBC ?
After a long pause he says he was Ã¢â¬Åready for a changeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
After 10 years covering business and economics , during which he reported on some of the biggest stories and also endured the long illness and death of his wife Sian , Peston made no secret of his desire for change when his youngest son finished school .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhy did I come to ITV ?
Partly because I admire what Tom and the others are trying to do , making it more upmarket with more space for serious stories
Ã¢â¬ Â¦ that obviously plays to all my instincts .
But what swung it was being offered my own show .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe moment they offered me that I thought IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to regret this for the rest of my life if I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t say yes .
The BBC couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t simply manufacture a show out of thin air.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Peston on Sunday is expected to start this spring , possibly before MayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s local elections .
With a Ã¢â¬Åproper budgetÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he says his dream first guest
Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Åwe
wonÃ¢â¬
â¢ t get herÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â is Angela Merkel .
In his first appearance alongside Bradby last Monday , Peston appeared slightly nervous .
But it was a huge improvement on his BBC debut in 2005 , when he was forced to stand outside in freezing wet conditions without a coat talking about the budget .
He went on to break several award - winning stories and gain the sort of fame that led to separate Twitter accounts for his hair .
A former political editor of the Financial Times , he describes the current political situation as Ã¢â¬ÅgrippingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , suggesting the Ã¢â¬Åcrisis in the Labour party and crisis in the Tory party over EU reformÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as the two biggest political stories in the UK .
He refuses to answer only one question during this interview Ã¢â¬ â whether he is pro - EU .
He cites Jeremy Corbyn , the rise of nationalist parties across Europe , Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the US as Ã¢â¬Åall part of this new phenomenon of millions of people feeling that the establishment doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get it , doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t understand them and is not talking to them .
Or that theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve lied to them for years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He wants ITV news to act as the publicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åintelligent friend helping you to understand the big issues , whether itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how you vote , invest your money , the job you do or education for your kidsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
As the son of a Labour peer Ã¢â¬ â and card - carrying party member until starting his career Ã¢â¬ â is he worried about being accused of bias ?
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬
â¢ m not going to deny where I came from , or that I love my dad , but I am an objective journalist who left party politics behind when I became a journalist ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI do genuinely challenge anybody to go through my reports and prove that I am biased.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the run - up to the last election , his view that austerity was a huge issue led to accusations he was pro - Labour , while his work on the deficit was attacked by Ed MilibandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s party .
Ã¢â¬ÅBecause
I was attacked by both sides I thought I must be doing the right thing ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
While at the FT , his Ã¢â¬Åendless spatsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with Alastair Campbell became so embittered the Labour spin doctor called him a Ã¢â¬ÅcuntÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ across the Commons lobby .
Although always keen to focus on the story , he is surprisingly opinionated for a man who is now ITVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political figurehead .
He cites the Ã¢â¬Åestablishment consensusÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ over the benefits of immigration and media failure to report on the impact on Ã¢â¬Åindividual communities of large unplanned influxes of peopleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for part of that distrust of the media .
As well as the failure to spot problems in the banking industry .
Ã¢â¬ÅVast numbers of people who support Corbyn , for example , would simply say their concerns about living standards are just not picked up by most of mainstream print media .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s not just trade union members and students who fear whether the Murdochs or the Mails or the rest donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t reflect their views , you meet mothers from middle - class backgrounds who you wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t necessarily think of as being hard - left , who say they have more in common with the Corbyn agenda than youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d expect .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not to say Corbyn is going to command the kind of support to allow him to win an election but
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He insists he will Ã¢â¬Ånever ever bad - mouth the BBCÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , which he Ã¢â¬ÅlovesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
and thinks has been good for both him and the nation as a whole .
But he says of his new employer : Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll never have the incredible resources of the BBC , but we do have a sort of flexibility [ and ] simply being smaller brings an advantage.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
So is the BBC too big ?
Ã¢â¬ÅYou will never hear me say that I want a smaller weaker BBC ...
[ But ] I think there are issues around a level competitive playing field which are perfectly legitimate issues for debate.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In comments that partly explain some of the animus felt by some former colleagues towards the ever - competitive Peston , he says : Ã¢â¬ÅNow IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m here
I want [ ITV ] news to humiliate the BBC , get better scoops , win viewers
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
We are not going to be an existential threat to the BBC but we are going to give them a bloody good run for their money.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Peston denies applying to be BBC political editor Ã¢â¬ â insiders suggest because others were in line to get it
Ã¢â¬ â
but he did talk about hosting Newsnight one night a week and has a track record of applying for big jobs .
In 2010 he applied to become Radio 4 controller and at the start of 2015 he applied to become editor - in - chief of the Guardian , having thought Ã¢â¬Åwhat , in a dream world , are the jobs I would like to do?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ .
A management job in the future is not Ã¢â¬ÅinconceivableÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he says , but Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a reporter .

2016-01-18,"David Bowie has been given his own constellation , consisting of seven stars that shine in the shape of the lightning bolt .
Belgian astronomers announced the registration of the constellation , which appropriately sits in the vicinity of Mars , following the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death last week .
It is a fitting homage to Bowie , who used the universe as a key inspiration throughout his career .
Bowie first found success with the single Space Oddity and later crafted the persona Ziggy Stardust , an extra - terrestrial rockstar .
His hits also included Starman and Life on Mars .
He appeared on the cover of the 1973 album Aladdin Sane with a red and blue lightning bolt painted on one side of his face .
Belgian radio station Studio Brussel and the MIRA public observatory teamed up to register the constellation , but finding the right place for the legendary rock star in the heavens was a complicated task .
Philippe Mollet from the MIRA Observatory said in a statement : Ã¢â¬Åit was not easy to determine the appropriate starsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅStudio Brussels asked us to give Bowie a unique place in the galaxy , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅReferring to his various albums , we chose seven stars Ã¢â¬ â Sigma Librae , Spica , Alpha Virginis , Zeta Centauri , SAA 204 132 , and the Beta Sigma Octantis Trianguli Australis Ã¢â¬
â in the vicinity of Mars .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe constellation is a copy of the iconic Bowie lightning and was recorded at the exact time of his death.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The creation of the constellation is part of the Stardust for Bowie tribute project , where fans can use Google Sky to add their favorite Bowie songs with a short note to a virtual version of the constellation .
Bowie died on 10 January aged 69 after an 18-month battle with cancer ."
2016-01-18,"David Bowie touched many lives .
His death at the age of 69 led to an outpouring of grief across the world , as friends , musical collaborators and fans alike shared their memories , stories and Bowie - related recollections .
When we asked our readers to share their own Bowie memories , we received hundreds of stories .
From catching a first glimpse of the man ( often while watching Top of the Pops ) to seeing him live in concert over the decades , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clear he shaped and inspired many lives .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor a skinny crooked - toothed youth in the early seventies , Bowie was a godsend , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Jonathan Mark Hauser .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was a very repressed time , and he made me realize the world was a bigger and more interesting place.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
There were also more intimate encounters .
It turns out quite a few of our readers met Bowie himself , and have shared a fantastic array of invaluable personal stories that say a lot about the man and the artist .
Here are some of our favourites out of the stories we received .
My mum cooked him a Fray Bentos pie in 1969
It was Guy Fawkes night and the whole band was there .
He didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t eat the pie .
My mum , Valerie Jubb , and her flatmates went to Bonnyrigg Regal , just outside Edinburgh , on a Friday night to see him play .
The band didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t show up as they got lost en route from Perth .
My mum and her friends waited in the bar to hitch a ride back to Edinburgh .
The band showed up late and they got talking .
Mum and her flatmates thought Ã¢â¬Åwhat the hellÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and invited them to let off fireworks and for dinner .
The band was staying in nearby Broughton and they accepted ( her flat was on nearby Northumberland St ) .
Mum pulled out all the stops with a Fray Bentos pie .
She says he ate very little and none of the pie Ã¢â¬ â
it may have been her cooking apparently !
Then they let off fireworks in the garden .
[ Note for non - UK readers : a quick Google search can probably explain why he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t touch the pie . ]
Space Oddity had just been a hit that summer , I believe .
She always said he was incredibly polite but distant .
Got the impression he was coming to terms with impending stardom .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one of my favourite stories and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve very possibly told to everyone who has spent more than five minutes in my company .
It never occurred to me he would do something as mundane as dying .
Sad day .
By Sara Sanderson
He changed my nappy
In 1969 , when I was only a couple of months old , my Mum visited an old friend Mary Finnigan who was living in Beckenham .
I think Mary and my Mum had been at Ealing art school together in the mid 60s and were looking to Ã¢â¬Åcatch upÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ after a few years at either ends of London .
When they met up at the house she was staying at , Mary introduced my Mum to a certain David Bowie whom she was having a fling with .
And , when theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d gone off for a walk together , they left me in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s care and , ever the renaissance man , he did the honours when I disgraced myself in the underwear department ...
By RonnieOServalan I was his body painter .
And then he changed my life
I met David Bowie in 1991 , in Dublin , on a shoot for [ the Tin Machine ] video [ see main picture ] .
I was his body painter .
Three days later he walked me into my first NA ( Narcotics Anonymous ) meeting in Dublin .
Wherever one went with him , there was always a seismic shift .
Space and time changed .
Mine , beyond all recognition :
Every moment of my reality changed in at moment , on that day .
I am now almost 25 years clean and sober .
I know I would not be here without that intervention , and all the years working with him , subsequently , reinforced the power of recovery , sobriety and faith in the self .
By Carolyn Cowan He kissed my hand
It was the summer of 1965 and I was on holiday in Bournemouth with my friend Valerie .
We were 15 .
The Nashville Teens were playing in a concert with several others and we turned up very early to a completely empty hall .
An incredibly handsome young man was practising on stage , talking and moving round .
He came over to us and chatted for a while , telling us that he was introducing the different acts and also singing his own song .
He was tall , skinny , blonde , totally charming and absolutely charismatic .
As people started to arrive he bowed to us , kissed our hands and told us to watch him .
Needless to say , we forgot all about the Nashville Teens and were mesmerised by a young Davy Jones ...
And thrilled not long afterwards to see him become the famous David Bowie .
Eight years later I was a newly qualified teacher in a challenging secondary school and told this story to one of my classes .
The next day , the most difficult pupil in the entire school came rushing up to me in the assembly hall .
He threw himself to his knees in front of me , grabbed my hand and asked Ã¢â¬ÅMiss , is this the hand that was kissed by David Bowie?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He then kissed it in front of the entire school , bowed to me ..... and my reputation was assured !
My middle name is Jean , so guess which is my favourite song ?
By Dyllis
J Wolinski He was my babysitter
Growing up in Maidstone in the 1960s , we didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get up to London much .
But one day my parents wanted to go shopping in town
so we stayed with my older half - sister who was living in a place with David Bowie and Marc Bolan .
She was seeing Tony Visconti , who was working with T Rex at the time .
It was 1969
and I was only three , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got vivid memories of arriving at this big tall building in South London with a huge set of steps .
Well , they seemed huge for a three year old .
The whole family were there
Ã¢â¬ â me , my older brother , my mum and dad Ã¢â¬ â
and we stayed the night on the sofa and my sisterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spare mattress .
The next morning we all woke up and had breakfast and my sister said she had to go to work .
It was then we got introduced to this person Ã¢â¬ â
sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ d arranged for David Bowie to babysit us .
He took my brother and me to the nearby playground where my sister worked and spent the whole afternoon playing with us on the tyre swings .
It was a self - contained adventure playground with big mural walls and all kinds of playing frames made out of timber with soft earth in case you fell .
Where we played at home there was just a metal swing and metal slide in concrete .
I remember the bus journey we took there more than I remember David Ã¢â¬
â we got to sit on the top deck right at the front .
My mum would never let us sit there
Ã¢â¬ â
those Routemasters used to take off while you were still climbing up Ã¢â¬ â
but David Bowie said : Ã¢â¬ÅLetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s go upstairs!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He was that sort of guy
Ã¢â¬ â someone getting on with his life .
When we got back to the house , David and Marc let us play on their instruments .
We sat in the kitchen and they held the chords down for us as me and my brother strummed .
I have an image of Marc Bolan learning over in a cream shirt with burgandy polka dots but all I can remember of David was his guitar
Ã¢â¬ â a Gretsch with white and gold plated machine heads .
By Colin Hartley I met him Ã¢â¬ â in my frequent hallucinations
The most bizarre Bowie concert I ever saw was in 1996 .
It was his first Ã¢â¬ â and last Ã¢â¬ â performance in Russia , at the Kremlin Palace in Moscow .
It was a very strange time .
Moscow was awash with money and violence as the KGB and the mafia fought over the spoils of the Soviet Union .
Bowie landed like an alien in the middle of it all .
Suddenly , there was an announcement that David Bowie , this extraordinary Western star , was going to play there Ã¢â¬ â and the new Russian rich came flocking to hear him .
So we were in a small concert hall inside the Kremlin , packed with nouveau - riche who had paid a lot of money to see him but had no idea who he was , what he represented or anything about his songs .
They were totally bemused , transfixed , glued to their seats but showing no reaction at all Ã¢â¬ â while in the meantime , a few of us at the back were going nuts .
It was a characteristically bizarre moment in the life of the most eclectic and brightest star of them all .
There was also a period in my life
Ã¢â¬
â
I think it was 2002 - 3 after the Heathen Tour Ã¢â¬ â where I regularly had hallucinations about David Bowie calling me when he came through Paris ( where I live ) .
He would call , we would meet in a bar and he would ask me what his next musical direction should be !
For years I thought it had actually happened .
It didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t !
The only possible explanation ( no , I was not on drugs ) is that the 2002 gig at Le Zenith ( as part of the Heathen tour ) had such an effect on me that in some sense it infiltrated into my subconscious .
Obsessive ?
Surely not !
By Alexis Rowell Touching him was one of the high points of my life In 1987 , my father Ã¢â¬ â Shane Porteous Ã¢â¬ â was a star of A Country Practice .
We knew it was popular in the UK but were still stunned when his agent rang up and said Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie loves the show and would like to meet when heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s over here touringÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
We three kids were in our teens , well - familiar with Bowie , and essentially stood over Shane and said Ã¢â¬ÅNOT WITHOUT USÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
So all four of us got backstage passes and tickets to the show .
This is the programme with the backstage Ã¢â¬ÅpassÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ sticker stuck to it .
And we met him .
I was already in love ( teens , pthah ) but I stood there and listened to this vibrant , vibrating man with hair that made him taller than my fatherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 6 feet talk about wombats in the snow and what it was like being an actor , in that voice ...
oh , that voice .
He could read the phone book and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d buy the album .
He was so damn plain NICE .
And cute ( did I mention teens ? ? ) and charismatic .
Apparently David is ( was ) unlikely to remember the meeting , due to the 80s being rather ... entertaining ... for him .
I shall never forget , and I tell the story at every possible moment because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one of the high points of my life .
I TOUCHED DAVID BOWIE .
By Fiona McNeill
It was almost like having dinner sitting next to a Cambridge Don
My girlfriend and I were just twenty one and twenty three years old respectively , and we both had been working and living in Germany for some time .
In the spring of 1983 , we decided to get away for a week to the German Alps .
We were sitting down to dinner at a restaurant that was off the beaten path , so to speak , and the place was dead .
There was only one other couple eating there with two children , when up the gravel path came a couple dressed for the red carpet .
They proceeded to sit down at the table next to us and both my girlfriend
and I were , to put it politely , shitting our pants .
It was David Bowie and Catherine Denuve .
Not wanting to appear like idiots , my girlfriend and I went into a quick Ã¢â¬Ëmind your mannersÃ¢â¬ â¢ huddle and tried our best to act nonchalant about this turn of events .
I remembered that his real name was Jones , so I said , Ã¢â¬ÅNice to see you Mr. Jones.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At which point he laughed , and then happily engaged us in conversation over dinner and wine for two hours or so .
Disclaimer :
I was no fan of David Bowie at this point , I thought he was just another media attention seeking rock star .
But , after hearing him speak about art , literature , and culture almost as an academic scholar .
I was most impressed .
He never once brought up his music or his career .
It was almost like having dinner sitting next to a Cambridge Don .
As he was leaving the restaurant he shook our hands and thanked us for a lovely evening
And then he mentioned that he would be touring this summer , and if we would like tickets to the show , he would make sure that they were left at the gate under my name .
I of course said that we would appreciate that , and it was a most kind offer of him to do so for us .
So , later that summer : sure enough , the Serious Moonlight Tour was coming to Frankfurt , were we than lived .
My girlfriend and I debated whether we should go to the show and see if he kept his promise or not .
We were afraid to go , because of the disappointment it might cause , to an otherwise fantastic memory of our encounter .
After having a row about this issue , we arrived late to the venue and went to the ticket office desk and asked if Mr. Jones had left tickets with our name on it , expecting the worst .
And lo and behold !
He left us two VIP passes for us .
David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
stage persona has nothing to do with the artist David Jones .
This was the biggest lesson I learned from this encounter .
He was a consummate gentleman , witty , funny , and droll in his remarks , and very well read .
After meeting him I became a lifetime admirer of the man , and then the artist .
Truly a classy Gent .
By Incubatorjones I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t flattered by his friendship , I was improved by it
I met David at a party at Jimmy DestriÃ¢â¬ â¢ s (
BlondieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s keyboardist ) apartment on Jones Street in Greenwich Vlllage in Ã¢â¬Ë79 .
We talked for a while about books and music .
A couple of days later Coco Schwab , his longtime friend and assistant , called me and invited me to his suite at the Carlyle Hotel .
I thought , Ã¢â¬ÅWow .
A party at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s place .
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t wait to see whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gon na be there.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ followed immediately by , Ã¢â¬ÅWait a minute .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m nobody .
Why have I been invited?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ A few evenings later , with much trepidation
, I made my way there and knocked on the door .
Coco let me in .
I walked into the little living room .
No one else was there .
Ã¢â¬ÅI guess IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m
early.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅNo , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re right on time .
David will be out in a minute.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I looked around .
There was a small table set for three .
David appeared and immediately picked up our conversation where weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d left off at DestriÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
It took a minute for me to realize that I was to be the only guest .
Coco had cooked a delicious dinner for the three of us .
We talked into the night and I went back to my place on Perry Street in The Village , not quite believing what had just happened .
David returned to New York for a few months to act in The Elephant Man .
Once a week or so , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d call me up after a performance , still adrenalined out , and ask to come over to my dumpy little apartment and shoot the breeze until he got tired .
We became good friends .
He came to my birthday party that year and gave me a signed first edition of an Edward Gorey book , which he , David , inscribed to me .
I still have it .
I left NYC in Ã¢â¬Ë81 shortly after his run in the play ended and quickly lost touch with him .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had no contact with him since .
I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t express adequately how much our short friendship way back then meant to me and still means to me .
His conversation and opinions were fascinating and opened a number of artistic and philosophical doors for me .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t flattered by his friendship , I was improved by it .
I guess what IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d like to say is that those qualities of his that stood out to me were that he was unpretentious , intensely intellectual , intellectually hungry , and straight - up honest .
An extraordinary man , truly .
Rest in peace , David .
I am so honored to have known you a little .

2016-01-18,"A parade of Mardi Gras proportions took place in downtown New Orleans on Saturday afternoon , as the city celebrated the life of David Bowie in typically flamboyant fashion .
The event , which saw thousands of people line the narrow streets of the historic French Quarter , had been publicised just a few days earlier .
The invitation on the Facebook event page read : Ã¢â¬ÅDress in your best Bowie outfit or something more strange and meet us at 4 pm on Saturday 16 January at Preservation Hall.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The hosts were the Canadian band Arcade Fire and an ever - popular local institution , The Preservation Hall Jazz Band .
Over the course of a few days , almost 11,000 people had shown an interest in attending the event , which was named Pretty Things :
A Memorial Parade for Bowie .
Although Bowie , who died last week , only performed in Louisiana a handful of times , his love of Arcade Fire was well documented and he collaborated several times with Win Butler and Regine Chassagne .
The couple have recently become part - time residents of New Orleans and had reportedly been working on a Bowie - themed project with Preservation HallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creative director , Ben Jaffe .
The resonance of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s passing , the involvement of respected , high - profile musicians and a city excitedly primed to begin the Carnival period in earnest Ã¢â¬ â Mardi Gras season started officially on 6 January Ã¢â¬ â came together in a perfect storm of colour , costume and music .
By mid - afternoon , crowds dressed as every conceivable version of Bowie were converging in the sunshine outside Preservation Hall on St Peter Street .
As 4 pm neared , the numbers were Ã¢â¬ÅastonishingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Ã¢â¬ÅinsaneÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬Åway beyond Mardi GrasÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , depending on which Tom , Duke or Ziggy you spoke to .
The event was to include aspects of the local Second Line funeral march tradition as well as the kind of public parading New Orleans does to world standard .
A parade route had been published , but New Orleanians are unlikely to spectate when they can participate , and there was a need to be in on the action from the start .
As Butler , Chassagne and Jaffe appeared on the balcony above Preservation Hall , a sea of people stretched as far as you could see .
Minutes later , the doors of the jazz club swung open and the red - and - black - uniformed Preservation Hall musicians were lead by Butler , in a hot pink suit , into the throng .
Hundreds of lightning - bolted faces nodded along as Oh !
You
Pretty Things became the dirge Ã¢â¬ â the slow hymn portion of the march .
Jeremy Thompson , a local event producer , was marching .
Ã¢â¬ÅNew Orleans is much like David Bowie , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s worn many faces , adapted to changes and is comfortable in its own skin .
Bowie took every opportunity to revel in costume and celebrate life .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no wonder
so many of us are participating in this send - off.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Willingly or otherwise
, regular Saturday afternoon tourists were engulfed as the parade meandered to the shores of the Mississippi .
Some motorists , notably less enthused , had no choice but to sit in their vehicles as people danced around them .
Fame rang out as the band approached the riverfront , the musical pace becoming more celebratory .
Despite the encroaching chaos Ã¢â¬ â detailed planning in New Orleans often gets lost in the glitter Ã¢â¬ â Butler retained his role as talismanic leader , hollering through his bullhorn .
Some tempers heated up in the fray , and at times the streets felt intimidatingly crowded , but most people submitted to the once - in - a - lifetime nature of it all .
As the band circled back towards their ultimate destination , music club One Eyed JackÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ,
crowd - pleasing Bowie hits came thick and fast , from Under Pressure to Suffragette City .
Faces became smeared with tears of joy and sadness , as well as sweat .
It was as if Mardi Gras had been condensed into a couple of hours and dedicated to a man able to unite hip queer kids , Midwestern tourists , local families and couples who had driven overnight to take part .
Next SaturdayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Krewe de Vieux parade has traditionally been the start of the Carnival celebrations that last until Ash Wednesday , but this outpouring of local love for Bowie kick started the season in an unexpected way .
Attendance estimates varied from 5,000 to tens of thousands .
Isaac Kozell , a local writer and comedian , was one of them .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was an overwhelming sense that everyone was there for the right reason , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅEven those who were unwittingly swept into the current quickly realized that if they abandoned their plans , they too could have a place in the spectacle.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
They too , were heroes .
Just for one afternoon ."
2016-01-19,"And there it is .
As sure as night follows day , the news that Kanye West is considering making an album of David Bowie covers and interpretations has provoked the inevitable apoplexy .
The venom thrown at West is dispiritingly predictable , and to a degree understandable .
After all , he makes himself very easy to dislike Ã¢â¬ â just as Bowie made it extremely easy for terrified parents and uptight bores to dislike him in his creative heyday .
The fact is , though , that West is the closest we have to Bowie in the modern mainstream .
There is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does ( 30m - odd album sales and counting ) while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically .
This is a man who could enter a sales race with 50 Cent at the peak of his fame , and win with an album full of musical references to King Crimson , Aphex Twin and Italo - disco , and lyrics that depict a mind and a global situation in as much turmoil as Ziggy or Diamond DogsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apocalyptic narratives ever depicted .
A man who brings to audiences of millions tracks that sound like Autechre or Gary Glitter or both , co - produced by Glaswegian former happy hardcore DJ turned electronica experimentalists or gender - subversive Venezuelan noise musicians , with lyrics about slavery , deities and the drug trade .
A man who has posed difficult questions about the nature of masculinity in popular culture , and blended rapÃ¢â¬ â¢ s braggadocio with equal measures of doubt and fear .
A man who can get Paul McCartney making records that will be pumped out of Jeeps in Atlanta , and with one phone call fill the stage for the Brits with the cream of underground grime stars .
There is nobody else Ã¢â¬
â nobody
Ã¢â¬ â this weird in the mainstream .
This is not Ã¢â¬ â as if it needed to be spelt out Ã¢â¬ â to say that West is Ã¢â¬Åthe new BowieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , or is as good as Bowie .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not even to say that West is a great artist , or even a good person .
All of those are value judgments , and only decades of posterity will tell whether WestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s importance , influence or popularity will approach BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
Anyone is more than entitled to dislike West : as I say , he makes it easy .
Even fans find it hard sometimes : he has said and done crass and questionable things , from his association with Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to his creepy support for the rapper TygaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s relationship with Kylie Jenner , which began when she was 17 ( the age of consent in California is 18 ) .
But then , is anyone going to pretend that Bowie , too , wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a ( scary ) monster at certain points during his creative heyday ?
The point is , you might find WestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work offensive or lacking merit .
But you can not deny that he has made records that sound like no one elseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , taking enormous creative and commercial risks each time , lyrically examining the nature of what he does as well as questioning the collective mood of the times , inhabiting myriad disturbing alter egos , and becoming loathed and vilified like no other musician .
He has expressed himself in other media as well as music , and entered partnerships with artists from the most mainstream to the far leftfield .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what makes him like Bowie , and why it makes more sense to have him pay artistic tribute to Bowie rather than any of the MOR pop stars who are rumoured to be lined up for a tribute at the Brits .
Yet here we are , once again , with social media flooded with venom about what an Ã¢â¬ÅidiotÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ he is ( always the digs focus on his intelligence ) , with his face photoshopped on to penises , and memes showing how he and Justin Bieber are responsible for the rot of modern culture .
In comparison to this collective roar of disgust , the disgruntlement at the likes of Chris Martin and Noel Gallagher being considered worthy to step into BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shoes is but a murmur .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s almost as if people who claim to love Bowie in all his variety and transgressiveness donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t actually like it that much when other stars step outside their allotted roles ."
2016-01-19,"In the early 1970s , David Bowie encouraged other musicians to record versions of his songs , the most memorable of which was All the Young Dudes by Mott the Hoople , a hardÃ¢â¬ârock group from the west of England .
The groupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drummer was a founder member , Dale Griffin , who has died aged 67 after suffering from AlzheimerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s disease .
In later years , Griffin had a second career as a record and radio producer , working on many sessions for John PeelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Radio 1 show while maintaining MottÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heritage through the issue of CD compilations of the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work .
He was born in Ross - on - Wye , Herefordshire , and grew up with his parentsÃ¢â¬ â¢ collection of big band records before being attracted to early rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll in the late 50s .
At Ross grammar school , he played drums in various shortlived bands with the bass guitarist Peter Watts .
Watts gave Griffin his lifelong nickname
Ã¢â¬ÅBuffinÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , amending the sobriquet SniffinÃ¢â¬ â¢ GriffinÃ¢â¬ â¢ to Ã¢â¬Åthat bugger
GriffinÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and finally Ã¢â¬Åsnigger BuffinÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
After leaving school , Griffin and Watts joined the Doc Thomas Group , where they met the guitarist Mick Ralphs and singer Stan Tippins .
This band spent the summer performing in Italy , recording an album in Milan in 1967 .
By 1968 , however , the group was fragmenting and the following year Griffin , Watts and Ralphs plus the organist Verden Allen re - formed under the name Silence .
Moving to London , they failed an audition at Apple , the record company owned by the Beatles , but were spotted by the brilliant and eccentric record producer Guy Stevens .
He saw them lugging a Hammond organ up a flight of stairs to a pub concert room and decided to sign them : Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care what they sound like , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done it .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got the organ up the stairs.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Stevens already had a new name for the group , Mott the Hoople , the title of a novel by Willard Manus .
He also placed an advertisement for a new singer after Tippins decided to return to Italy .
Among those responding to the description Ã¢â¬ÅSinger wanted .
Must be image - minded and hungryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ was the charismatic Ian Hunter , who got the job .
Despite the enthusiasm of Stevens , the self - titled debut album and its successor Mad Shadows sold poorly and Mott the HoopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s live shows were far more popular than their records .
From 1969 to 1972 , they toured Britain frequently , with occasional forays into the US and mainland Europe .
Audiences responded wildly to their shows , whose excitement owed much to GriffinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s subtle yet powerful drumming .
The mildly riotous behaviour of their fans at the Royal Albert Hall in July 1971 caused the hallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s management to place a temporary ban on rock concerts there .
The commercial failure of Mott
the HoopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
third and fourth albums , Wild Life and Brain Capers ( both 1971 ) , brought the group to the brink of collapse .
It was then that Bowie stepped in to offer them a choice of his songs Suffragette City and All the Young Dudes , plus the help of his manager , Tony DeFries , to secure a new recording contract .
Bowie himself produced All the Young Dudes , an anthem to fashionable youth , which reached No 3 in September 1972 .
The accompanying album was a Top 30 hit and in late 1972 Mott the Hoople flew to the US for a tour that Hunter chronicled in his book Diary of a RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Star , which describes Buffin Griffin as Ã¢â¬Åmessy and lovable , breaking everything he touchesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
All the Young Dudes was the first of a run of five major British hits for Mott the Hoople .
It was followed by Honaloochie Boogie , the top 10 singles
All the Way from Memphis and Roll Away the Stone , and The Golden Age of Rock and Roll .
At the end of 1974 , the album Mott the Hoople Live was issued just as the group decided to disband following several personnel changes and after Hunter had fallen ill from exhaustion .
He recovered to pursue a lengthy solo career , while Griffin and Watts continued with the shortened name of Mott , recording two albums in 1975 and 1976 .
They subsequently formed British Lions with the former Medicine Head singer John Fiddler before setting up Grimstone Productions to produce albums by Slaughter and the Dogs , Hanoi Rocks and others .
Griffin next began a long association with the BBC , producing live sessions for the John Peel Show by hundreds of artists , among them Nirvana , Smashing Pumpkins , U2 , the Smiths and Billy Bragg .
He was also passionate about preserving the output of Mott the Hoople , piecing together Two Miles from Heaven , an album of previously unreleased material , and a three - CD box set All The Young Dudes ( 1998 ) , which was the result of three yearsÃ¢â¬ â¢ research .
In 2007 he was diagnosed with early onset AlzheimerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , which limited his participation in a Mott the Hoople reunion concert two years later .
Griffin gave several interviews about his illness , in order to correct common misconceptions about the condition .
He is survived by his partner , Jean Smith .

2016-01-20,"I am not an Eagles fan .
I know little of their output beyond the omnipresent Hotel California
, Take
It Easy , One of These Nights , Tequila Sunrise , and so forth .
Their delivery is too laidback for me , too easygoing .
Give me Neil Young any day .
I do not deny their popularity , however Ã¢â¬ â the album Their Greatest Hits ( 1971 - 1975 ) alone has sold more than 42 m copies
Ã¢â¬ â nor the fact that their music clearly means a great deal to a great many people .
Like all music that has grown in stature over time , their songs come laden with associations Ã¢â¬ â emotional , personal and communal Ã¢â¬ â for the individuals concerned .
A few days ago , their founding member Glenn Frey died .
It is the third ( or fourth , depending on how you view it ) high - profile death to hit the rock world in the last few weeks .
To a community mourning the passing of MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lemmy , David Bowie and Mott the HoopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dale Griffin , it feels like a particularly hard blow .
Not for me , personally , but I certainly empathised with othersÃ¢â¬ â¢ sense of loss .
Like a great many people , I suffered a profound feeling of shock and bereavement when Bowie died last week .
Indeed , my Facebook feed has been swamped with talk about little else since .
This grief has gone far beyond that of a Ã¢â¬ÅnormalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death ; so much so that a few commentators have suggested it is in some way false , or that to cry in public is unseemly , which in turn prompted an outcry against this callousness and lack of empathy .
This week , I have come across a new form of mourning .
My Facebook feed has been peppered with jokes and comments from friends gloating over the death of Glenn Frey , rejoicing that the karmic balance of the world is being restored somehow .
God took Bowie , but this is OK because God has also taken Frey .
That strikes me as hypocritical and grossly insensitive .
Many of these jokes came from the same people who were so worked up over a handful of others criticising their mourning of Bowie .
What is it about social media that brings out the mob mentality in people ?
What is it about social media that can make someone credibly claim to be distressed at being mocked for their ( very public ) grief , and then only a few days later turn around and mock others for feeling precisely the same about someone different ?
Your taste is your own , but that does not give you a licence to claim it is superior to someone elseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
Nor does it give you a licence to mock a sense of bereavement .
Perhaps such Ã¢â¬Åmusic fansÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ should remember the John Peel axiom of popular music : there is no such thing as good or bad music , only good and bad listeners .
Frey wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a Donald Trump or a Margaret Thatcher .
He was a musician and songwriter , whose songs brought comfort and hope and dreams and solace to millions .
The same as the songs of Lemmy and David Bowie and countless others did .
You might not have liked these songs , but you could at the very least show the same respect towards his grieving fans as you have demanded from others ."
2016-01-20,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s list of collaborators reads like a cavalcade of pop - culture power brokers : Brian Eno , Lou Reed , Iggy Pop , John Lennon and Queen .
He also recorded with Arcade Fire , TV on the Radio and LCD
SoundsystemÃ¢â¬ â¢ s James Murphy .
Missing from that list ?
Fellow British act Coldplay , who once contacted Bowie in the hope of collaborating , only to be turned down by the music giant .
The bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drummer , Will Champion , told NME they had invited Bowie to record vocals on one of their songs .
Bowie replied , Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a very good song , is it?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
( Or as the singer , Chris Martin , once told the story : Ã¢â¬ÅHe called me and said , Ã¢â¬ËItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not one of your best.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ )
The band appear to hold no grudges .
Champion said : Ã¢â¬ÅHe was very discerning Ã¢â¬ â he wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
just put his name to anything .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll give him credit for that!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He also said that for anyone involved in music , Bowie was Ã¢â¬Åone of the points of reference for absolutely everythingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and his death was Ã¢â¬Åquite disorientatingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The guitarist , Jonny Buckland said :
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve all loved his music for as long as weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve known about music.Ã¢â¬

Musicians have been paying tribute to Bowie at concerts around the world since his 10 January death .
In New Orleans on Monday an event called Pretty Things :
A Memorial Parade for Bowie was co - hosted by the Canadian band Arcade Fire .
Bowie provided guest vocals to the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 2013 song Reflektor .
A tribute show will be held at Carnegie Hall in New York on 31 March , with performances by Cyndi Lauper , the Roots and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long - term producer Tony Visconti .
During her Rebel Heart tour Madonna performed BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Rebel Rebel in Houston , Texas , and told the audience she was paying tribute to the man who had inspired her career ."
2016-01-21,"It would have been one of the most unusual pairings in musical history Ã¢â¬ â but how would it have sounded ?
According to a new account Ã¢â¬ â from an unlikely source Ã¢â¬ â Elvis Presley asked David Bowie to be his producer .
The claim comes from country star Dwight Yoakam in an interview with US newspaper the Orange County Register .
In the article , published before a concert in southern California , the singer was asked about Bowie , whom he had met in 1997 , and with whom he shared a love of Elvis .
Yoakam said Bowie told him that six months before ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death in August 1977 , Presley had phoned asking him to produce his next record .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat was based on Elvis having heard BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Golden Years , and I thought Ã¢â¬ËOh my God , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a tragedy that he was never able to make that
, Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Yoakam told the paper .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
couldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t even imagine 1977 David Bowie producing Elvis .
It would have been fantastic .
It has to be one of the greatest tragedies in pop music history that it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t happen , one of the biggest missed opportunities.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Despite the disparity in rank Ã¢â¬ â the King , asking a favour of the Thin White Duke Ã¢â¬ â the request was not acted on .
Bowie was a dedicated Elvis fan , reputed to have an encyclopedic knowledge of PresleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , and the two shared their birthday Ã¢â¬ â 8 January .
Bowie said that he had originally offered the song Golden Years , which appeared on the Station to Station album and reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK , to Elvis .
The story goes that he asked his then wife , Angie , to deliver the request , but she was too nervous to do so .
Since BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death last week , another link with Elvis has been uncovered .
An Elvis song called Black Star Ã¢â¬ â which remained unreleased for decades after being recorded in 1960 Ã¢â¬ â was cited as a possible inspiration for his farewell album .
The songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lyrics say : Ã¢â¬ÅEvery man has a black star / A black star over his shoulder /
And when a man sees his black star / He knows his time , his time has come.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie produced other artists occasionally , usually those who were his heroes or friends .
In the early 1970s he worked on Lou ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Transformer , Mott the HoopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
All the Young Dudes and Iggy and the StoogesÃ¢â¬ â¢ Raw Power .
While his work on the former two was acclaimed , the third was more problematic , and more than two decades after its original release , Iggy Pop went back to remix an album that had often been seen as tinny and trebly .
Bowie fared better producing Iggy PopÃ¢â¬ â¢ s solo albums The Idiot and Lust for Life ."
2016-01-21,"Andrew Haigh , director of 45 Years and Weekend , is working on a biopic of fashion designer Alexander McQueen , according to Deadline .
McQueen , who killed himself in 2010 , was a mercurial talent who developed a reputation as one of haute coutureÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brightest stars .
The four - time British fashion designer of the year worked with David Bowie on his 2006 - 07 tour wardrobe and counted Mikhail Gorbachev and Prince Charles among his clients when he was a Savile Row apprentice .
McQueen became infamous for his dramatic and sometimes controversial catwalk shows .
His Highland Rape show in 1995 showcased bedraggled models with ripped clothing that exposed their breasts .
The designer claimed he was commenting on the Highland clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries , when thousands of Scots were displaced by wealthy aristocratic landowners .
McQueen , who struggled with drug addiction in the later stages of his career , killed himself nine days after the death of his mother , Joyce .
An inquest found that the 40-year - old had taken cocaine , sleeping pills and tranquillisers before hanging himself .
The biopic will be based on a script by playwright Chris Urch , author of Land of Our Fathers and The Rolling Stone .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thought heÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be working from Blood Beneath the Skin , a biography of McQueen written by Andrew Wilson .
Haigh is on a critical high after 45 Years , named in the top five of many criticÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best of 2015 lists .
That film , which tells the story of a retired couple whose long - term relationship is shaken by the discovery of a long - buried secret , has earned its star , Charlotte Rampling , a best actress Oscar nomination .
Rampling and her co - star , Tom Courtenay , were given acting prizes at the London CriticsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Circle awards last week , where 45 Years also won best British or Irish film ."
2016-01-22,"The designer of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar album cover has explained the reasoning behind its stark appearance .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was a man who was facing his own mortality , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Jonathan Barnbrook told the design magazine Dezeen .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Blackstar symbol [ Ã¢Ë â¦ ] , rather than writing Ã¢â¬ËBlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ , has as a sort of finality , a darkness , a simplicity , which is a representation of the music.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Barnbrook , who also designed BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s covers for Heathen , Reality and The Next Day , as well as the Nothing Has Changed series of compilations , said the use of abstract shapes was a development from the controversial cover for BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous album , The Next Day , and the black star itself referred to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s awareness of his own mortality .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe idea of mortality is in there , and of course the idea of a black hole sucking in everything , the Big Bang , the start of the universe , if there is an end of the universe , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThese are things that relate to mortality.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Even the vinyl version of the cover , with the star cut from the sleeve , referred back to mortality : Ã¢â¬ÅThe fact that you can see the record as a physical thing that degrades , it gets scratched as soon as it comes into being , that is a comment on mortality too.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Barnbrook also spoke about his working relationship with Bowie , and the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interest in cover design .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe understood the value of the image on a record cover , when other people had forgotten about it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Barnbrook said .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had a renaissance in the 1970s and 1980s of album covers because the format of vinyl , but then it dropped when CDs were introduce .
There are still good record / CD covers around , but a lot of time nowadays the cover just had to be Ã¢â¬ËniceÃ¢â¬ â¢ , it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a thing that provoked discussion , our covers wanted to have that discussion again .
Some people hated them , some people really liked them.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He revealed that Sony , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s label , had been unhappy with the cover for The Next Day , which featured the cover of his 1977 album Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s face obscured by a white square on which was printed the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey were quite shocked with the cover , and they were pretty sure that it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to work , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt actually became a very successful viral campaign.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-01-22,"People were still wondering what David Bowie had been trying to tell them David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s death last week set the amateur detectives sleuthing .
What had he been trying to tell the world with his final album , and with the videos for Lazarus and Blackstar ?
Had he set up a Tumblr to add to the mystery ?
Did it all feed into something greater ?
His last gift to the world appeared to have been a puzzle so complex that it might take years to reveal the answers Ã¢â¬ â and even then weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll likely never get those answers confirmed .
One thing we can be sure of , though Ã¢â¬ â because it was made plain by the designer of his album sleeves , Jonathan Barnbrook Ã¢â¬ â is that the cover of Blackstar was a deliberate reflection of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s awareness of his own mortality .
Bowie and Elvis ?
( And Springsteen , Waits , Young Ã¢â¬
Â¦ )
One of the weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stranger news stories was buried deep in an article in a local newspaper in California .
The Orange County Register carried an interview with the country singer Dwight Yoakam ahead of a gig .
It being post - Bowie , the paper naturally asked about him .
It turned out Yoakam had met Bowie in 1997 , and they had discussed Elvis .
And , said Yoakam , Bowie said he had been called by the King a few months before his death in 1977 , with a request to produce new Presley music .
Bowie .
In 1977 .
Producing Elvis .
Imagine the catering Ã¢â¬ â peppers , milk , peanut butter , hamburgers Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Meanwhile , a studio outtake emerged from 1985 in which Bowie , having a bit of fun , was heard impersonating some of his contemporaries : Bruce Springsteen , Neil Young , Tom Waits , Iggy Pop , Lou Reed and others .
The clip had been recorded by Mark Saunders , who worked on the Absolute Beginners soundtrack .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s well worth a few minutes of your time ( the Lou Reed and Tom Waits , especially , are spot on ) .
Last bit of Bowie for now ( we promise ) .
With added Kanye At the start of this week , it was reported that Kanye West was planning a tribute album of David Bowie covers .
The story was later denied , but not before a certain section of the world decided that this was an outrage .
A petition was drawn up to demand it be stopped ( if you laid all the petitions demanding Kanye be prevented doing something end to end , they would stretch from here to Jupiter .
Fact ) .
Social media ignited with people who do not listen to rap explaining why this was a desecration .
So we got Joe Muggs to write about why Kanye is actually the nearest thing to Bowie
we have these days .
Then we stepped well back .
Yasiin Bey , formerly known as Mos Def , cares not for your borders ( and heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retired )
Remember when Yasiin Bey was picked up by South African customs at Cape Town the other day ?
Turns out heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been trying to leave the country on a Ã¢â¬Åworld passportÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , a document recognised by only six countries ( and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the claim made by the organisation that issues it ) .
That didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t stop Bey sending a long and rambling message to Kanye West Ã¢â¬ â which West duly posted on his website
Ã¢â¬ â complaining that his treatment was politically motivated .
Oh , and announcing his retirement .
To be honest , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re only inclined to believe that one after five years of public silence ( a rule we apply to all musical retirements ) .
A writer was finally allowed to ask R Kelly about the sex - crime allegations against him For years , people sent
to interview R Kelly have been told :
DONÃ¢â¬ â¢ T ASK ABOUT THE SEX .
And they have duly complied ( to our shame , us included ) .
Finally , Chris Heath Ã¢â¬ â writing for GQ Ã¢â¬ â was told Kelly would Ã¢â¬Åspeak about his whole life without restrictionsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It made for an odd encounter .
Kelly spoke about being sexually abused as a child , and described it as Ã¢â¬Åa generational curse , so to speak , going down through the familyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It seemed as if he was preparing for the big confession , but then he backed away .
He couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t speak about his long - rumoured marriage to Aaliyah , because Ã¢â¬Åwhen thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s two parties involved in any situation , both parties have to be respectedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even say whether it was him in the infamous video showing a man engaging in sexual acts with a young woman , believed to have been 14 at the time : Ã¢â¬ÅBecause of my lawyers , to this day I can not have those kind of conversations .
Being advised by my lawyers in this.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a strange , disturbing and extraordinary interview .
Glenn Frey of the Eagles died Glenn Frey was 67 when he died Ã¢â¬ â from complications from rheumatoid arthritis , acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia Ã¢â¬ â and heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been one of the very biggest rock stars of all time .
The first Eagles greatest hits record remains the second - biggest selling album of all time , and the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reunion tours in recent years raked in the money from their boomer audience .
Yet the band were never liked by critics .
It took FreyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death to make those critics wonder if maybe the audiences had been right .
Meanwhile , Everett True wondered why the same people who had been furious at those scoffing at their mourning of Bowie were on his social media timelines mocking FreyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
The deaths of Bowie and Frey lent a sombre note , too , to the opening couple of dates of Bruce SpringsteenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s US tour Ã¢â¬ â on night one he covered Rebel Rebel in tribute to Bowie , on night two he played Take
It Easy , which Frey co - wrote with Jackson Browne .

That Fat White Family album sounds icky The consensus around albums is usually that they are good or bad .
Not with Songs for Our Mothers , the second one from Fat White Family , which was met with disgust from many reviewers .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat did their mums to do deserve this?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wondered Will Hodgkinson in the Times .
Lee Arizuno of the Quietus , while able to find the lolz in songs about Shipman and Goebbels , felt compelled to shout Ã¢â¬Åenough of your shit!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ at a song trying to mine humour from Ike Turner beating up Tina .
Our own Alexis Petridis reckoned : Ã¢â¬ÅIn a world in which someone appears to find almost everything , no matter how innocuous , Ã¢â¬ËproblematicÃ¢â¬ â¢ , hereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s something so wilfully , relentlessly , self - evidently problematic as to boggle even the most libertarian mind .
You donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to be the kind of person who spends their days forensically examining the lyrics of pop records in order to find something problematic to be horrified by the disgusting line in Satisified , where frontman Lias Saoudi compares a woman fellating him to a starving Auschwitz inmate reduced to Ã¢â¬Ësucking the marrow out of a boneÃ¢â¬ â¢ .Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not easy when your underground band goes overground Paul Lester tracked down some of the musicians whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d seen themselves as alternative Ã¢â¬ â toiling away willingly in obscurity

2016-01-22,"Glam rock normally makes us think of platform heels and elaborate makeup , but the 1970s genre still stomps its way through popular music to this day .
With the late passing of glam pioneer David Bowie , it was timely that the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis celebrate the heydey of the glam rock genre on our Guardian Radio Hour .
For the second show in the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 10-week radio series on NTS , Alexis talked to the GuideÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kate Hutchinson about glamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s early innovators , forgotten outliers and its modern descendants : T Rex to David Bowie and Iron Virgin to Perfume Genius .
More than just ludicrous costumes and very big hair , glam was a statement of gender non - conformity and the source of a sound thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s subsequently influenced everything from techno to heavy metal .

2016-01-24,"Critics are supposed to have perspective on their subject .
We are supposed to have some degree of insider knowledge .
We have access to the industry machinery , at least in theory ; sometimes access to the artists themselves .
As a breed , we were driving blind with David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar .
Not one of us knew for sure that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final hour was so close , although speculation about his health had been rife for years .
I made the trip to the PRÃ¢â¬ â¢ s offices to hear a playback in December Ã¢â¬ â twice through .
This is standard practice for major releases .
No one likes it , but it plugs leaks .
A secure stream would be available shortly before release ; IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d refresh my memory , check lyrics on headphones before filing my copy .
No written lyrics were available .
In that conference room , I wrote reams of jumbled notes about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rather quaint use of Nadsat ( Anthony BurgessÃ¢â¬ â¢ s youth argot from his novel A Clockwork Orange ) , and of his nods to mortality , of the most fantastic deployment of jazz in a non - jazz setting , of Kendrick Lamar , of how perhaps Bowie was allying himself with him , and jazz ( Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not a white starÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , of songs written from multiple perspectives , of Ã¢â¬Åsomething very wrongÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , of memento mori all over the place , of how the final song , I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Give Everything Away , effectively signs off .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying to , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sings on Dollar Days , which I first misheard as Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying tooÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t use any of it .
Ã¢â¬ÅPennies for the boatman , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
I thought , when I first saw the video for Lazarus , set in a sanatorium , in which BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eyes are wrapped in bandages , with what look like buttons on top .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t use that either .
I assumed that Lazarus was written in character , like other Blackstar songs , not least Sue
( Or in a Season of Crime ) , in which the ailing Sue seems to be tended , then perhaps murdered , by the protagonist .
Of all the conspiracy theories and occultists having a field day in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s symbolism , no one has quite explained whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going on in Sue .
The biblical Lazarus , of course , didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t actually stay dead ; BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical of the same name was a sequel of sorts to The Man Who Fell to Earth , in which an alien thoroughly fails to assimilate on Earth .
Lazarus had all sorts of enticing paths to follow , other than the tomb .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know then about the unreleased Elvis song Black Star ; I hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seen the Villa of Ormen Tumblr yet .
I saw no reason at the time to belabour BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70s interest in the occult .
Mainly , I recoiled from writing about what now are obvious references to dying and finality , because I was keen to avoid cliche , and ageism , and the ghastly literalism common to more confessional singer - songwriters .
Although no one can truly avoid writing about themselves , Bowie was an artist in the fullest sense , one whose career was littered with aliases , performance , experiment and a hugely learned set of reference points .
He may have been 69 , but it would have been presumptuous , alarmist and intellectually lazy to assume he was pondering his own death .
Or so I thought .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re at a point in the life cycle of an art form where its founders are hitting the final buffers .
Mortality ?
Johnny CashÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last album , American IV , in which the country singer did explicitly explore his own looming mortality , leads us to assume they are all at it .
Around the time of his brain aneurysm a decade ago , Neil Young probably was .
But
heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s got a new girlfriend now .
A few years back , around the time of Old Ideas , Leonard Cohen was candid about his eagerness to say all he could before his own final deadline .
That other giant of mystique , Bob Dylan , had quite a body count on his 2012 album , Tempest , but , crucially , these were the passings of others .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not trying to start an argument about the superiority of Bowie to any of these artists , but with Bowie , the starting point for analysis has never been lived experience .
Bowie was a lot more fun than that .
I regret not writing about mortality in my review .
Who doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to look like a seer ?
But I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t regret it that much , because we have been left with a tremendous album , Blackstar , which was tremendous even before it became a roman Ã clef and an epitaph .
In all the outpourings of affection for Ã¢â¬Åour DianaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( as my neighbour wryly quipped ) , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest album has , in fact , got a little lost .
BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatness doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t depend entirely on its codedness , on its sad context .
It is a silvery , allusive , restless piece of art Ã¢â¬ â death or no death ."
2016-01-24,"In January 2013 , Suede returned from their 13-year hiatus with the announcement of an album , Bloodsports .
The news was eclipsed somewhat by another comeback album Ã¢â¬ â
The Next Day by David Bowie , the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first in a decade .
Fast forward three years , and here poor Suede are again Ã¢â¬ â another album , another overshadowing , blacker than the first .
For Suede , there is no escaping Bowie , whose album - cum - death two weeks ago knocked most other musical activity into a cocked hat .
Singer Brett Anderson has riffed on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocal style , to the glamorous , seedy , outsider personae Bowie created , since the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s beginnings .
Listening to Night Thoughts , the main downside of this seventh Suede album is that it is an album by an indie rock band heavily influenced by Bowie , but not enough by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s searching spirit and latterday musical courage .
Otherwise , Night Thoughts is just grand Ã¢â¬ â an unexpectedly poignant and cinematic record from a band who are enjoying a fruitful second life .
Bloodsports found the band comprehensively reinvigorated , if still playing on well - rubbed Suede textures Ã¢â¬ â lust , the thrill of the chase .
Night Thoughts is even better ; deeper , more candid , more vulnerable .
There are still tracks called things like The Fur and the Feathers and Outsiders , perhaps the most Suedey of Suede song titles .
But Anderson has talked about viewing his younger self through the prism of his older self here , his relationship with his father through his own fatherhood .
And so Night Thoughts finds Anderson fretting and regretting at the darkest , most yin hour of the clock .
Tightrope is full of fear , but not the kind that is half - thrill .
There is a string section Ã¢â¬ â often the last refuge of the pedestrian indie band trying to sound grandiose Ã¢â¬ â but here , Suede pull it off , and it brings lashings of romance to AndersonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s angst .
Every passage of guitar band music is more ruminative than of old , balanced out by something a little more imaginative , such as the stately string intro to When You Are Young , later reprised as When You Were Young .
The excellent What I Am Trying to Tell You is a list of AndersonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s personal failings , whose soured glam shimmy sounds like the arrogant Suede in their pomp , but with a much higher emotional intelligence score .
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Her
What She Wants packs in more self - flagellation , undercut with something more sinister , as AndersonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s protagonist regards the woman he is singing about with intriguing ambivalence .
Youth Ã¢â¬ â a key ingredient in SuedeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lubricous dramas , all Ã¢â¬Åbattle plans and distant drumsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â is gone .
The overblown exaggerations of greenhorns has been replaced by a twilit dread based on lived mistakes and real perdition .
The dark nights of the soul only get darker with time , and Night Thoughts proves an unexpectedly congenial companion volume ."
2016-01-25,"Screenwriter Nicole Perlman has said she has Ã¢â¬Åno interestÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in remaking the 1986 David Bowie - starring film Labyrinth , despite news reports stating the contrary .
In a widely cited story , the Hollywood Reporter wrote on Friday that the fantasy film would be Ã¢â¬Årebooted for the 21st centuryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
According to their report , TriStar had Ã¢â¬Åclosed a deal with the Jim Henson Co to produce a new iterationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and had hired the Guardians of the Galaxy cowriter Nicole Perlman to write the script .
But Perlman quickly took to Twitter to categorically deny that she was involved in a reboot of the film .
Ã¢â¬ÅGuys , please donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t fall for all the clickbait , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she wrote .
Ã¢â¬ÅNo one is remaking Labyrinth .
That movie is perfect as it is.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Perlman told Guardian Australia that she first began talks with the Jim Henson Company about a project well over a year ago but she could not discuss anything further about it .
She was upset by the implication from news reports that she or the company would seek to profit from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
Ã¢â¬ÅAll I can say is that the timing for the story was awful ; it felt like a punch in the gut ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music helped me through some of the hardest times of my life .
I respect him as a musician , an actor , an icon and , most importantly , as a human being .
It would have been a dream come true , to write something for him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Perlman said Labyrinth was her favourite childhood movie
and she has no interest in remaking it .
Entertainment Weekly claimed the supposed Labyrinth film project would be a sequel to the original , not a reboot .
The Jim Henson Company has been contacted for comment .
Labyrinth starred Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King and Jennifer Connelly in one of her earliest roles .
The film was directed by Jim Henson , who also cowrote the film .
Although it received mixed reviews and flopped in the box office at the time , it gained a cult following over the three decades since its theatrical release ."
2016-01-26,"If the rumours are true , next monthÃ¢â¬
â¢ s Brit awards will feature a David Bowie tribute from a supergroup consisting of Damon Albarn , Bono , Noel Gallagher , Adele and Coldplay .
Never mind that most of those artists have no obvious connection with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s legacy , and that he declined to get involved with Coldplay when he was alive .

When Al Jardine hugs the Foster the People guy at the end of Good Vibrations , does he really have any idea who he is ?
Does anyone ?
Of course , the Beach Boys have done a pretty good job of trampling on their own legacy down the years , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s still upsetting to see Adam Levine joining in .

Florence and Dizzee are both such exuberant performers that what could have been a car crash turned out to be a crowdpleaser ; a specially released version of You Got the Dirtee Love rocketed to No 2 the week after the ceremony .
But would you listen to it again now ?

2016-01-27,"If youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re like me , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve spent much of the past two weeks listening to David Bowie songs .
( Bowie died on 10 January , in case youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re just now waking up from a very long nap .
If so : good job ! )
In Five Years , the first song on his most famous album , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , he imagines what it would be like to learn that the world was ending .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one my favorite songs of his , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve listened to it often these past weeks .
But I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t relate to the sentiment , exactly , because Tuesday , the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced , using the Ã¢â¬ÅDoomsday
ClockÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as an indicator , that as far as they can tell , the world is no closer to ending than it was last year
Ã¢â¬ â though itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also no farther away .
The SSBBAS was started in 1945 by scientists involved with the Manhattan Project with the express intent of gauging , and reporting , just how close mankind was to wiping itself out with nuclear weapons ( and has since added Ã¢â¬Åthe changing energy landscape , climate change and emerging technologies , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ to its list of concerns ) .
Midnight on the Doomsday Clock , as you might have guessed , means the end of the world .
We were three minutes to midnight last year and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s where we remain .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not as close
as weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever been Ã¢â¬ â
the clock struck two back in 1953 , when the US and Russia were both testing Hydrogen bombs Ã¢â¬ â but certainly too close for comfort .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a big part of me , though , that says , Who cares ?
( Likely a reaction that many of you are having to reading this very article ! )
All those years after taking a first philosophy class and reading Nietzsche and having it blow your mind and then finding out that he really wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t so terrific after all , and all that listening to the Doors and later learning the same about them , the nihilist argument carries .
So what if the world is ending ?
Is that really so bad ?
The world disappoints us in so many ways .
People are stupid and cruel and life is full of pain and misery .
We kill each other and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re killing the planet we live on .
Would it really be a net negative for everything to come to a full , abrupt stop ?
This week I stepped into a puddle of slush that was deeper than it looked , and I felt the icy slush - water crest the top of my boot and thought , No , that wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be bad at all .
In fact , it would preferable to the alternative .
As the cold , wet liquid seeped down and soaked my sock , it occurred to me that it might even be something to celebrate .
But other days , I focus on how good it feels to put a nice warm new sock after peeling off a wet , cold one .
Everything changes , and sometimes for the better .
What else is there to do with our time except to try our best to enjoy it ?
That points towards hedonism when youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re young : have a second helping of pie and a third refill of your drink .
But then when you get older , when you have a kid or kids , if you do that , it becomes something different .
I did that
and it became different for me , at least .
Now the end of the world seems a little sadder .
And my attitude about it is more one of , Let me not let this life - sustaining environment end on my watch .
Did you ever read Cormac McCarthyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel The Road ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really good .
I often think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the best novel written this century .
( It came out in 2006 . )
If you have not read it , and you still plan to do so , click this silly article off your screen now and go pick up the book instead , because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m about to talk about the end .
( Of the book , I mean .
I realize weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re already talking about the end of everything else . )
The Road is a post - apocalyptic novel that tells the story of a father wandering the remains of the American east coast , trying to keep his son alive while most of society has descended into rape and cannibalism and human farming .
The language is extremely terse in describing an ash - blanketed black - and - white world .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s any mention of color at all through the first 286 pages of the book .
( Someone can surely check me and correct me on that , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve looked and not found any . )
The dad dies in the end , but the kid is found by another family of survivors and then the story zooms backwards in time , centuries , eons , who knows how far back ?
And we find this : Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains .
You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow .
They smelled of moss in your hand .
Polished and muscular and torsional .
On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming .
Maps and mazes .
Of a thing which could not be put back .
Not be made right again .
In the deep glens were they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery .
Those are the last words in the book .
People often say The Road is super - depressing , but I find great joy in it .
IÃ¢â¬
â¢ m flooded with a sense of peace when I read those last words .
Because to me it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seem like weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re zooming backwards in time ; we may well be zooming forward .
Who knows what will come as we come closer and closer to destroying ourselves and rendering our planet uninhabitable ?
Who knows what will happen after the clock ticks midnight ?
Maybe time will go on .
Maybe people will have moved on to space stations by then .
Or Mars .
Who knows what theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll grow there ?
Who knows what theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll find .
Maybe brook trout .
That would be a treat .

Another insightful contribution to the debate about labels , and whether gender identity should define a person , this time from Razel Reid .
Modern day society is still being painfully exposed under the microscope .

Worth noting that while based in London , GIDS accept referrals nationwide .

IsnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t it fantastic to feel part of something ?
* pats self on back and feels rather smug *
All of which segues nicely into a parallel conversation
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been taking place about representations of other , non - binary gender identities .
Have binary constructions historically just been easier to get our heads round I wonder ?
Humans have a categorical approach to existence ; label yourself or be labelled by others at your peril !

childrenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s books after writing her book about an intersex character : This is an interesting point which worries many people confronted with the LGBT+ alphabet soup , even those with the best of intentions .
The solution is easy : After all , Lisa Williamson wrote The Art of Being Normal which has been a crucial intervention in transgender representation .
There is a lone dissenting voice , however : The exception being perhaps David WalliamsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book of that very name ?
Some answers posited in response to PatrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s earlier question about the greater levels of visibility for male - to - female transitions :
Ooh this is sneaky , Lisa Williamson - we like it !

Was 2015 the best year for transgender rights in history ?
In 2012 , US Vice - President Joe Biden called transgender rights Ã¢â¬Ëthe civil rights issue of our timeÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
Since then , leaps have been made year - on - year : increased protection from discrimination in the workplace ; more flexibility for designating gender identity on social media profiles ;
the UK ParliamentÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first ever inquiry into transgender inequality .
Caitlyn JennerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s turn on the cover of Vanity Fair led to unprecedented levels of global discussion , Emmy - nominated Laverne Cox ( who herself appeared on the cover of Time in 2014 ) starred in the 3rd season of NetflixÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Orange is the New Black , and in the UK Rebecca Root took to the small screen in BBC
TwoÃ¢â¬
â¢ s Boy Meets Girl .
Major gay rights group Stonewall finally came out in support of trans rights almost exactly a year ago , in February 2015 .
With increased visibility can come increased risk , however , whether thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in terms of media portrayals Ã¢â¬ â where feminist icon Germaine Greer courted controversy for her comments about trans women and a TV panellist called it a Ã¢â¬ËcrazeÃ¢â¬ â¢ in November Ã¢â¬ â or , more horrifically , in the real world : in 2015 , the murder rate of transgender people ( overwhelmingly of colour ) reached an all - time high in the US .
Still , talking can only ever be A Good Thing .
NHS referrals for young people have increased five - fold since 2010 , signalling not only that society may be becoming more accepting but also that young people are increasingly able to talk about their experiences .
To act you first need to articulate .
For that , we at Guardian ChildrenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Books believe that books have no small part to play ; young adult fiction is at the forefront of all this , writing stories that are , yes , diverse , but also engaging , exciting , and enlightening .
After all , figuring out your identity as a teenager is complex for everyone and schools can be unforgiving places at the best of times : what we need are stories , stories , stories .
So what role does fiction have to play in furthering tolerance for trans and other non - binary people and , having taken great strides in that direction ,
what next for 2016 ?
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be discussing all this and more between 7 - 8pm this evening , using # Gdnteentrans .

2016-01-29,"David Bowie once auditioned for Lord of the Rings , according to the actor Dominic Monaghan .
Monaghan , who played hobbit Merry in the blockbuster fantasy trilogy , revealed to the Huffington Post that he was surprised to see the Thin White Duke while auditioning for the role .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was at the HubbardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , which is a pretty notorious casting agency office in London , doing an audition for Lord of the Rings , and when it ended I went over and talked to John Hubbard , who was running the audition , and he said , Ã¢â¬ËHey , it went really well .
You should wait around for five or 10 mins .

ï¿½ said Monaghan , also known for his turn in JJ AbramsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Lost .
Ã¢â¬ÅI thought , Ã¢â¬ËOh , OK , cool , and I sat in the reception office .
As I was reading a magazine waiting , David Bowie came in and signed his little list and went in .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m assuming he read for Gandalf .
I canÃ¢â¬

He may have read for something else , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a huge David Bowie fan , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m lucky enough to know his son .
Just seeing him in person was pretty special to me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson has long hinted that Bowie was in fact up for the role of Elrond , the half - elven lord of Rivendell .
Despite the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s previous experience playing a goblin king in the Jim Henson fantasy Labyrinth , the part eventually went to the Australian actor Hugo Weaving .
Jackson told Entertainment Weekly in 2001 : Ã¢â¬ÅThese are famous , famous characters , loved for nearly 50 years .
To have a famous , beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie died on 10 January in New York , aged 69 , after an 18-month battle with cancer .
Director James Gunn also revealed recently that the singer was wanted by Marvel for a cameo role in the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy movie ."
2016-01-30,"David Bowie left an estate of around $ 100 m to his wife , Iman , and his two children , and stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali , according to his will .

As well as a 25 % share in the estate , Bowie left a property on Little Tonshi Mountain , near Woodstock , to his and ImanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 15-year - old daughter Alexandria .
Duncan Jones , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 44-year - old son from his previous marriage to Angela Barnett , also received 25 % .
Bowie sold 140 m records during a career spanning more than half a century , and also made an estimated $ 55 m from selling so - called Ã¢â¬ÅBowie bondsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â basically turning his royalties into financial instruments .
The remaining 50 % of the estate goes to Iman , as well as all his other properties , including their apartment on Lafayette Street in Manhattan , according to the Daily News .
Bowie died of liver cancer on 10 January , two days after his 69th birthday .
His last album , Blackstar , was released the same day .
His death caused an international outpouring of grief .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music skyrocketed on the music streaming service Spotify , putting Life on Mars , Heroes ,
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance and Blackstar , the latter from his newest and final album , all into the siteÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top-10 chart within 24 hours of the announcement of his death .
A galaxy of celebrities Ã¢â¬ â including Joel Madden , Kanye West , Madonna ,
One DirectionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Harry Styles , Iggy Pop , Sir Paul McCartney , Ricky Gervais , Brian Eno , KissÃ¢â¬ â¢ Gene Simmons and Lorde , among many others Ã¢â¬ â paid heartfelt tribute to Bowie .
Annie Lennox wrote a poem for him .
In Brixton , in south London , where Bowie was born in 1947 , hundreds of fans gathered for a mass sing - along .
Tribute concerts in London and New York have scheduled memorial concerts .
In Soho , New York , near where Bowie and Iman lived , fans gathered to lay candles and flowers .
In accordance with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wishes , there was no funeral held for him .
Instead , his close family scattered his ashes following a Buddhist ceremony on the Indonesian island of Bali ."
2016-02-02,"Lady Gaga is set to perform a tribute to David Bowie at the Grammy awards , the show organizers announced on Tuesday .
Gaga had been booked to perform during the show before Bowie died last month , Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich told the New York Times .
But when news of the legendary artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death broke , Ehrlich began discussing a possible tribute with Gaga and her manager .
Several other artists approached Ehrlich about participating in the tribute , but he said he decided to have Gaga Ã¢â¬ â whose style and music were influenced by Bowie Ã¢â¬ â perform solo .
In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter conducted shortly before BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , Gaga spoke fondly about the artist .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I fell in love with David Bowie , when I was living on the Lower East Side , I always felt that his glamor was something he was using to express a message to people that was very healing for their souls , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe is a true , true artist and I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know if I ever went , Ã¢â¬ËOh , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to be that way like this , Ã¢â¬ â¢ or if I arrived upon it slowly , realizing it was my calling and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢
s what drew me to him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s performance will not open the Grammys but will probably last six or seven minutes and cover Ã¢â¬Åat least three or fourÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ songs , Ehrlich said .
The tribute , Ehrlich said , will Ã¢â¬Åbe a true homage to who David was , particularly musically , but not ignoring his influence on fashion and pop culture in a broader wayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The musical director of the performance will be Nile Rodgers , who produced BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s albums
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance and Black Tie , White Noise and described him as Ã¢â¬Åthe Picasso of rockÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2016-02-02,"The Berlin film festival is to stage tributes to Alan Rickman and David Bowie , it has been announced .
In a wide - ranging press conference , festival director Dieter KÃÂ¶sslick provided more details of the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s programme , alongside already revealed events such as the world premiere of Terence DaviesÃ¢â¬ â¢ A Quiet Passion and an opening gala presentation of the Coen brothersÃ¢â¬ â¢ Hail , Caesar !
The festival , which opens on 11 February , will screen Ang LeeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Sense and Sensibility , in which Rickman plays the key supporting role of Colonel Brandon , while the Bowie tribute will be the 1976 Nicolas Roeg film The Man Who Fell to Earth .
The competition for the Golden Bear has been finalised and will include Thomas VinterbergÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Commune , inspired by his own childhood ; Alex GibneyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s documentary Zero Days , about cybercrime and internet surveillance ; Genius , directed by Michael Grandage ; and Mia Hansen - LÃÂ¸veÃ¢â¬ â¢
s Things to Come .
Also screening in competition will be Alone in Berlin , an adaptation of the celebrated Nazi - resistance novel , and Midnight Special , from Mud director Jeff Nichols , about a man trying to protect his gifted son from government agents .
Joining the Coens and Terence Davies in the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s non - competitive sections will be Spike Lee , with his anti - gun parable Chi - Raq , Don Cheadle with his Miles Davis biopic Miles Ahead , and Michael Moore with his satirical documentary Where to Invade Next .
Also showing will be experimental documentary The Seasons in Quincy :
Four Portraits of John Berger , made by four directors including Tilda Swinton .
The increasing status of TV work is also reflected in the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s programme .
Berlin will show episodes from series two of Better Call Saul as well as two BBC miniseries : Love , Nina , adapted from the book by Nina Stibbe about working for literary editor Mary - Kay Wilmers , and The Night Manager , starring Tom Hiddleston .
The Berlin film festival runs from 11 to 21 February ."
2016-02-04,"One of my favourite music films is the meandering 2007 spoof biopic , Walk Hard :
The Dewey Cox Story , starring John C Reilly .
It was a commercial flop that failed brilliantly on many other levels .
It cracks very good jokes at the expense of numerous real stars , events , genres and entire eras , taking on half a century of not just musical history , but historiography .
Its targets are famous ones .
No cult figures or untold stories here : Johnny Cash , the Beach Boys , the Doors , Ray Charles , punk rock Ã¢â¬ â and the Beatles .
Yet it is only in that last sequence , set in the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Rishikesh retreat , that the joke is likely to be obvious to anyone not a music obsessive .
Why did it misfire where its obvious ancestor , Eric IdleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1978 Beatles parody
The Rutles :
All You Need Is Cash , hit the bullseye unerringly ?
The latter is more concise and had the advantage of a single , massive target .
But that alone doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t explain it .
Walk Hard aimed a popgun at sundry legends .
The Rutles had an entire mythos to play with .
Certain acts ( Elvis , the Beatles , Pink Floyd ) have a myth system that has coalesced around them : a mandala of images , symbols and stories , each of which instantly conjures a resonance singular to that act , and which cumulatively define that act even in the absence of its music .
Others of comparable cultural significance or commercial stature ( Little Richard , the Rolling Stones , Genesis ) do not .
The BeatlesÃ¢â¬ â¢ mythos was so swiftly established that Eric Idle could parody it within a few years of the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dissolution in the knowledge that every reference would be not only understood but , much more importantly , felt .
Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s is found in an entire visual language that has for decades accompanied anything Floyd - related on tour , and without which those shows would be something lesser .
It functions even without the elements tied to specific albums ; Gerald ScarfeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
animations for The Wall , the flying pig on Animals .
A circular screen , a crashing Spitfire , young men in Cambridgeshire meadows ,
British second world war army uniforms : these things are instantly , evocatively Floydian , in the way
a monochrome Liverpool terrace is innately Beatlesque .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not that the major acts without a mythos lack for legends about them .
Nor for iconography .
All successful acts have that .
The StonesÃ¢â¬ â¢ tongue and lips emblem is perhaps the most recognisable example in pop .
But that lends itself to branding , not myth - making .
In this context , there is a crucial difference between myth and legend .
Legend is exalted storytelling ; myth is a narrative , which to fans and often even casual observers has a sense of scripture about it , of revealed text .
Iconography , in the pop sense , is imagery that signals stardom and relevance ; a mythos involves a mystical expression of that imagery .
An act with a mythos constitutes its own self - contained universe .
An act without one is part of our own .
Joy Division have a mythos .
Despite MorrisseyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Messianic status among his acolytes , the Smiths are merely ( to praise them with faint damnation ) legendary .
The Beatles have become icons after the original , religious sense ; the Stones , in the more commonly invoked modern , cultural sense .
When John Lennon said his band were more popular than Jesus , knowingly or not he prefigured their eventual status as a kind of alternate faith with its own sacred artefacts and stations of the cross .
Largely thanks to the efforts of his once maligned widow , who has applied to his memory her outstanding talent for artistic transformation , Lennon himself has been preserved in this faithÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mythos as the secular saint he plainly wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , a beatific figure surrounded by Elysian white , singing hymns of peace .
Legends are often much alike , but each myth system is unique .
We are at this moment witnessing one transmute into the other , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fascinating .
It has taken less than a month for such a mythos to start crystalising around David Bowie , as we immerse ourselves in his vast and endlessly engrossing legacy .
A formerly loose amalgam of images and anecdotes is taking on the aspect of gospel .
Lo , he came unto Berlin , where he did make three albums .
( Only one in its entirety , but this is scripture now . )
Verily did he drive around that hotel car park with Iggy .
Why is it happening only now ?
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d argue it is testimony to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s artistic fluidity that only death could bring this about Ã¢â¬ â that he never sat still enough long enough for a mythos to cohere .
A mandala needs a still centre .
Even in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s years of absence , there was still a sense of anticipation ; that he had somewhere yet to go , that what happened next would be of real moment , that it mattered that something did happen next .
This proved true .
A mythos requires that its source be culturally static , but that alone is not enough .
It also requires there be something supernatural about the way that source is experienced , a quality that fame and enduring recollection alone canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t provide .
That is why Elvis , the Beatles and Pink Floyd ( as an entity , not as individual musicians ) generated one , where the others did not .
They are not simply golden gods in a pop pantheon .
Any major act can achieve that .
By tapping into the collective unconscious as others couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , they became holy ghosts , possessed of something ineffable denied to ordinary deities .
Now , finally , justly and sadly , Bowie has , too .

2016-02-04,"One of the most striking aspects of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s death was its deftly plotted artistry .
Most established musicians shrug helplessly against the dying of the light ; a handful remain unpredictable and self - challenging throughout the later chapters of their careers .
Among them we count John Cale , a sprightly 73 , who arrived at this intimate In the Round show in a T - shirt , tattered Converse and conductorÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
coat , as if it was dress - down Friday at the Proms .
The avant garde Paul to Lou ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s irascible John in the Velvet Underground , his solo work over four decades has covered alt - folk , experimental drones , cranky electronic pop , leftfield opera and an abusive attitude towards violas that has probably earned him a 500-yard restraining order from every string section in the world .
Cale is no septuagenarian shrugger .
London last saw him perform a 2014 Barbican show accompanied by an Ã¢â¬ÅorchestraÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of flying drones resembling giant space wasps , and reconstruction is his current byword .
In April heÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll rework Velvets material at a Paris anniversary show , and his new album M
: Fans is a distorted neo - disco reimagining of his bleak 1982 Ã¢â¬Åpersonal exorcismÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ album Music for a New Society .
Tonight , studying a laptop and seated at a keyboard containing every sound from tuning orchestras to exploding minarets , he treats a career - spanning selection to the same inspired tenderising over two hours as disjointed and unsettling as they are utterly absorbing .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a full - canon reboot .
The Endless Plain of Fortune , from 1973 , becomes an authoritarian avant disco piece with a climax that sounds like Four Tet : The Opera .
Coral Moon ( 1975 ) could now be a twisted poltergeistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s love song from an Eli Roth torture - porn remake of The Music Man .
Fear Is a ManÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Best Friend starts as a Bowie boogie , turns into a piano sonata , then ends in a fit of deranged glam screaming , as if the Spiders from Mars are being attacked with a gigantic rolled - up newspaper .
Yet even when scouring the danker corners of M : Fans Ã¢â¬ â on desolate sound collage Close Watch , or his stirring and strange rewrite of the church - organ ballad
If You Were Still Around , now with added ghost trains Ã¢â¬ â a slithering melodic subtext binds the set .
Take the stunning Buffalo Ballet , redone as a Magnetic Fields industrial torch song with a melody seemingly played on an oil rig , or the malformed funk rock of Ship of Fools with its trumpet - like guitars teasing hints of 1960s Batman . Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gon na be some changes , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Cale intones on Changes Made ; his work here is far from done ."
2016-02-06,"Barbara Ellen , Observer columnist
So , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s official Ã¢â¬ â Lady Gaga will perform a tribute to David Bowie at the Grammy awards ceremony .
Erm , why ?
Bowie delivered an album , Blackstar , on his deathbed Ã¢â¬ â wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t playing the harrowing Lazarus video be a more fitting way to pay homage to an artist whose urge to create and inspire remained undimmed to the very end ?
This isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a swipe at Gaga or at Kanye West Ã¢â¬
â the slap - down to the latterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ( swiftly abandoned ) plans to release a Bowie tribute album
had a dismaying whiff of racism about it .
Nor is it about being precious : not only was Bowie all about the Ã¢â¬ÅnewÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he had his own career troughs .
I once endured a fledging Tin Machine gig that felt akin to being trapped inside a haunted combine harvester .
However , Gaga , West , the Grammy organisers et al need to realise that some ( rare , cherished ) artists stand completely alone .
So what if Gaga was influenced by Bowie Ã¢â¬ â who wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t ?
Nor is it artistic snobbery to point out that aligning yourself to an esteemed artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work in this way is a presumptuous piggyback too far .
Does everything have to be tweaked or Ã¢â¬Åre -
imaginedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in the form of celebrity karaoke ?
Peter Robinson , editor of Popjustice
You ask Ã¢â¬Åwho wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ regarding BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influence on the current landscape .
It seems obvious : everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influenced by Bowie , like everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influenced by the Beatles , if only by musical osmosis .
Then you look at the charts and you do wonder if itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a stretch to find Bowie in Fetty Wap , Ed Sheeran or Selena Gomez .
Any influence is certainly too subtle for an awards show audience .
Fair enough , if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re influenced by Bowie you wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t necessarily look or sound like Bowie , just as a new punk couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t by definition be anything like punk , but at least with Lady Gaga you have a reasonably current act whose debt to Bowie is as prominent as the Ziggy flash she homaged eight years ago .
I agree covers should be approached with caution and
I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think we can underestimate the danger of the Brits wheeling out Paloma Faith and Mick Hucknall .
But regarding your own suggestion of screening the Blackstar video , if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to celebrate Bowie you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t ignore the stone - cold bangers that could pack a wedding dancefloor in five seconds .
Also , do you not think the Grammys whacking on a video , then going Ã¢â¬ÅBowie !
What a guy !
Anyway , hereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Justin BieberÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ might come across as slightly half - arsed ?
Perhaps thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a third way .
But what could it be ?
BE Good point about the wedding - stompers ( who can resist ? ) , but still IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d love them to play Blackstar Ã¢â¬ â change the mood , rattle the audience .
IsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that what Bowie was all about ?
With Gaga , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d say itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all a little too signposted .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also an irritating sense of Ã¢â¬ÅBowie fans really need to hear from me
right nowÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
No , they really donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t Ã¢â¬ â park your ego , love .
Mick Jagger , Brian Eno , Nile Rodgers Ã¢â¬ â
can you imagine the likes of them trundling on stage to do a Bowie cover ?
And they were his peers and collaborators .
Only in music does a tribute comprise a pale facsimile of an artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work .
When Alan Rickman is remembered at awards ceremonies , I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t imagine actors turning up solemnly dressed as Professor Snape Ã¢â¬ Â¦ though perhaps they should .
As you touched upon with your Ã¢â¬Åthird wayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , with someone as multifaceted as Bowie , there seems to have been a missed opportunity to do something truly amazing and unexpected Ã¢â¬ â say , his new music set to choreography by his early collaborator Lindsay Kemp , if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s up for it , thus closing a meaningful circle ?
When you have such an immense and diverse stretch of creative influence , isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t new original art the only worthwhile homage ?
PR Regarding your point about what Nile Rodgers might have to say about the whole thing , one would hope heÃ¢â¬
â¢ s keen , considering heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the performanceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music director .
He responded to naysayers on Facebook , as it happens , noting that negative remarks reminded him of Ã¢â¬Åwhen Bowie decided to work with Ã¢â¬Ëthe disco guyÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ .
We might not witness Brian Eno sidling on in a meat dress , but the stirring way in which Lady Gaga paid tribute to Alexander McQueen at the 2010 Brits suggests to me that we shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t rule out something unexpected Ã¢â¬ â even if to some the big surprise is just that , actually , the performance isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t terrible .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s death prompted some of the best music journalism IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever seen ; it also prompted some of the worst ; but I was moved by all those articles , with one or two notable exceptions , because they came from the heart .
I expect the Grammys and Lady Gaga feel a duty to do this
but I also feel that Gaga , at least , is doing it for the right reasons .
Is there any guarantee that an interpretive dance routine would be any better , or that the people on stage would be more genuine in their actions ?
BE
Ah , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve just been in the land of fitful Wi - Fi , so
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heartening to realise that Rodgers is involved .
Though are his and GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s situations truly comparable ?
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Dance was a huge musical departure for Bowie Ã¢â¬ â is Gaga the shock choice for a Bowie tribute at the Grammys ?
Many would consider her the downright obvious choice Ã¢â¬ â and one thing that Bowie wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t was obvious .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not vehemently anti covers as tributes per se
( Bruce Springsteen played some Bowie songs live in the immediate aftermath of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death ) .
I just think that thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been enough time to plan something more special .
However , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re right that Gaga should be given a chance .
These are highly unusual circumstances because Bowie was unique .
This isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just about an artist dying Ã¢â¬ â
it feels as though an entire culture has been disembowelled .
Call me a saddo , but to my mind something like Ã¢â¬Åinterpretative danceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old mime mucker twinned with his raw new material would have hit the spot nicely
Ã¢â¬ â also making Bowie the focus rather than the tribute artist .
Then again , this is Bowie : whatever was done by whomever , I suppose thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ d always be some Bowie fan
whingeingÃ¢â¬
Â¦ PR SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a shock choice , but she feels like a bold choice .
SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll put in more effort than anyone else on the current pop landscape , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s impossible to predict what sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll do , and looking on social media itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great to see younger generations excited by the kind of tribute that might otherwise have passed them by .
Anyway , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s almost a win - win scenario .
If itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a nightmarish fiasco , we can reflect even further on how Bowie was so unique that even one of 21st - century popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most creative performers couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t touch him .
If itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great , we can be happy , then sad , then happy again .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d hope for one of the two extremes , though Ã¢â¬ â the worst tribute to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s legacy would come in the form of something average ."
2016-02-06,"Perhaps the most striking thing about David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death last month was how meticulously crafted it seemed .
In the days of grief and grief - policing that followed , critics pored over his final album Blackstar and claimed to find within it all manner of cryptic hints about the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s passing .
Bowie , it seemed , had left a parting gift : the proverbial tree in whose shade heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never sit .
Of course , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
lyrical exit was soon overshadowed by
a mass re - examination of his entire lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work .
Nineteen of his albums re - appeared in the UK Top 100 , while NetflixÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Currently Trending section Ã¢â¬ â
this generationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
obituary of record Ã¢â¬
â was soon dominated by a striking image of Bowie in full regalia as Jareth the Goblin King .
The fact that Labyrinth Ã¢â¬ â a wobbly film by any measure Ã¢â¬ â remains one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most iconic movie roles says something about the idiosyncrasy of his acting choices .
Among 18 feature film appearances , Bowie played a vanishing FBI agent , a semi - fictionalised Serbian physicist , and Pontius Pilate , but he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t step into the shoes of an ordinary man until 1991Ã¢â¬ â¢ s The Linguini Incident , in which he starred as a down - on - his - luck New York bartender , albeit while looking like heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just stepped off stage from the Glass Spider tour .
This week , the film is reissued on DVD , with distributor ITV presumably intending to give at least some share of the profits to charity ( to do otherwise might reasonably be seen as a shameless attempt to cash in on the death of a man beloved by millions ) .
Alongside Bowie , Rosanna Arquette plays a waitress keen to leave the service industry behind and become an escape artist .
The pair join forces to rob the chintzy establishment in which they both work : him hoping to finance a sham marriage for reasons simultaneously enigmatic and entirely unintriguing , her keen to purchase an antique wedding ring once owned by Harry HoudiniÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wife .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the kind of premise that could apparently get a film green - lit in 1991 , though it held no appeal for audiences ( director Richard Shepard later described the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best review as coming from his father , who called it Ã¢â¬ÅlongishÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
You can just about see what Shepard was aiming for : namely something approaching the surrealist chic of Twin Peaks , which was then at the height of its powers .
Instead , the stilted dialogue and static camerawork leaves The Linguini Incident feeling more like Invitation
To Love , the intentionally gaudy soap opera watched by the characters of Twin Peaks .
Bowie , for his part , said he was Ã¢â¬Åquite happyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with the film , which may cause fans to think themselves lucky that his final years were dedicated to music , and that his movie career remained where he so ingloriously left it : with an inexplicable cameo in the 2009 Vanessa Hudgens musical Bandslam ."
2016-02-08,"Michael Nyman Ã¢â¬
â Time Lapse
In the thick of making the minimal - leaning , string quartet David Bowie tribute that I just put out with Jherek Bischoff , I began thinking about strings and my more classical - leaning influences and about how strings can translate melody and music .
When I first found Michael Nyman as a teenager , I made it the soundtrack to my life , and it was one of those beautiful backwards discovery experiences as I let his soundtracks lead me to the films of Peter Greenaway .
I would probably never have come to appreciate GreenawayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s films if I hadnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t already fallen in love with the music .
This is one of my all - time favourite Nyman arrangements , from my all - time favourite Greenaway movie , A Zed and Two Noughts .
I love how , like classic Nyman , it just builds and layers and builds .
Beck Ã¢â¬ â
Lonesome Tears Best string arrangement ever , and composed by BeckÃ¢â¬
â¢ s dad !
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been obsessed with his album Sea Change ever since it came out in 2002 , and I always come back to it .
I saw Natalie Merchant at a talk a few months ago , when IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just given birth , and she told a story about how this was the only album that would make her daughter go to sleep in the car ( I also asked her for mom advice and
she said : Ã¢â¬ÅDonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tour.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I think
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to fail . )
Anyway , she was right , Beck works like magic on a baby , and this song in particular has a part at the end , which I thought was just a magic trick that Beck played on my ears , a kind of go - sonic MÃÂ¶bius strip , but is actually a sound called a Shepard tone .
It was used by the Beatles on I
Am the Walrus and in the music for Super Mario 64 .

Strung Out in Heaven :
A Bowie String Quartet Tribute is out now"
2016-02-09,"The Berlin film festival opens on 11 February on something of a high , having secured a number of high - profile participants and screenings for its 10-day run .
Hollywood stars such as George Clooney and Channing Tatum will grace the red carpet on its opening night , Meryl Streep will lead the festival jury as it deliberates over the winner of the top prize , the Golden Bear , while the legacy of such high - profile figures as Alan Rickman and David Bowie will be celebrated in special tribute events .
Berlin has always had a predilection for socially engaged film - making , and with titles such as existential drama Death in Sarajevo by the Bosnian director Danis TanoviÃâ¡ and refugee documentary Fire at Sea , from Italian film - maker Gianfranco Rosi , among the competing films , this looks likely to continue .
However , the festival has given its prestigious opening slot to Hail , Caesar !
, the star - stuffed comedy about HollywoodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s early-50s golden age , directed by festival favourites Joel and Ethan Coen .
This is in sharp contrast to the 2015 edition , which opened with Nobody Wants the Night from Spanish director Isabel Coixet , which drew mixed reviews and remains unreleased in the US and UK .
Following the presentation of the big - budget mountain movie Everest as the opening film at the Venice film festival in September 2015 , it may indicate that EuropeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s major film festivals are ready once again to embrace Hollywood .
Hail , Caesar!Ã¢â¬ â¢ s roster of big - name actors Ã¢â¬ â including Clooney , Tatum and Tilda Swinton Ã¢â¬
â is likely to add considerable lustre to proceedings Ã¢â¬ â as does the presence of Streep as jury head , an unexpectedly high - profile appointment .
Saying Ã¢â¬Åcelebrities are also artistsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , festival director Dieter Kosslick suggested that Ã¢â¬Åthe Berlinale has had good relationships with the studios for many years and
the studios know that the festival is a good launchpad for their filmsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
However , he points out the Ã¢â¬ÅdiversityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s programming , and adds : Ã¢â¬ÅWhat links many films is the Ã¢â¬Ëright for luck and happinessÃ¢â¬ â¢
they postulate.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Nick James , editor of Sight and Sound magazine and a member this year of the Berlin jury , said : Ã¢â¬ÅIf
you look back , Berlin has consistently got high - quality product into the festival .
Every year sees strong Hollywood titles.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Securing Streep would appear to be part of the same process of fostering relationships : the actor was awarded an honorary Golden Bear in 2012 , which paved the way for KosslickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s successful invitation for 2016 .
The festival director said : Ã¢â¬ÅYou always can get a Ã¢â¬ËNo , Ã¢â¬ â¢ but we got a Ã¢â¬ËYes.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
James also suggests that Berlin has bounced back from a period when high - profile films , jostling for position on an ever - more frantic awards - season circuit , tended to sidestep the festival due to its calendar position Ã¢â¬ â too late to influence Oscar voting , too early to generate momentum for the following year .
Says James : Ã¢â¬ÅI think Berlin was at a disadvantage for a while , when everyone was holding their films back for Cannes , but that has ameliorated over the last few years.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Part of the change in thinking , no doubt , was due to the Oscar success of The Grand Budapest Hotel , which opened the Berlinale in 2014 , and went on to be nominated for nine Oscars a year later .
As one of EuropeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pre - eminent film festivals alongside Cannes and Venice , Berlin has , over the decades , forged its own identity , becoming renowned for selecting socially engaged material .
In 2015 , for example , the main Golden Bear was won by Taxi Tehran , from Iranian film - maker Jafar Panahi who has struggled with punitive working conditions since his arrest in 2010 , including spells of imprisonment , accusations of anti - state propaganda and travel bans .
For Kosslick , who has been director of the festival since 2001 , film - makers are Ã¢â¬ÅseismographsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of their individual societies , with their films Ã¢â¬Åreflecting the world we live inÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
James says : Ã¢â¬ÅBerlin has always shown a huge range of European cinema in particular , and the Berlinale programmes are very interstested in political cinema , that has been very clear over the years .
Issue - driven films have always played a prominent part in the programme.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Kosslick emphasises the amount of films dealing with migration in the festival lineup Ã¢â¬ â including Gianfranco RosiÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
documentary Fire at Sea , which examines the experiences of the inhabitants of the Italian island of Lampedusa , currently one of the frontlines of the migration crisis .
However , Berlin is not above indulging in a little sentimentality , as the series of tribute screenings to recently departed entertainment industry notables suggests .
Alan Rickman will be commemorated with a screening of Sense and Sensibility , the Ang Lee - directed Jane Austen adaptation which won the Golden Bear at the 1996 Berlinale , while Bowie Ã¢â¬ â who lived and worked in Berlin for an extended period in the late 1970s , and is described by Kosslick as Ã¢â¬Åan avant - garde artist who expressed his creativity in many disciplinesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â will be recognised with a showing of the Nicolas Roeg - directed sci - fi parable
The Man
Who Fell to Earth , which competed in Berlin ( but failed to win an award ) in 1976 .
The festival will also honour Italian director Ettore Scola , who died in January , with a screening of his 1983 dialogue - free film The Ball , which won Scola the Silver Bear for best director .
Ã¢â¬Â¢
The Berlin film festival opens on 11 February and runs until 21 February ."
2016-02-09,"We live in a world awash with stories of stolen metadata , search engines that allow us to watch live videos of babies sleeping and toys that can be hacked to steal your childÃ¢â¬ â¢ s name , birth date and gender ; what Al Gore summed up as our Ã¢â¬Åstalker economyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
So the image of Jennifer Lyn Morone , standing in an oversized suit , bulldog - clamped down her spine like a fabric dinosaur , and talking about the Ã¢â¬Åbusiness opportunityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of buying her Ã¢â¬Åblood , sweat and tearsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , is strangely hilarious .
But Morone is only doing what David Bowie , Madonna , Prince and Kim Kardashian have hinted at : turning herself into a registered company , Jennifer Lyn MoroneÃ¢âÂ¢ Inc. Walking into Neoliberal Lulz at Carroll / Fletcher gallery in London , you are confronted by an introductory video of Morone , her hair static , her cheeks flushed , talking down the camera in the corporate babble that saturates modern life .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy data is a resource for me to exploit , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Morone , the camera panning round to reveal the bunched jacket at her back .
Ã¢â¬ÅI want to make me ,
my life and my experience my business.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Another video shows Morone conducting a three - way boardroom meeting as director , secretary and treasurer .
There are adverts for diamonds made from her hair , her own signature perfume and a manual called How to Become a Corporation in 10 Steps , on sale in hardback .
But the most troubling , and arguably most daring part of MoroneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s exhibit are the dossiers of the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s real data Ã¢â¬ â her bank statements , emails , medical records , photographs , digital content , all of it Ã¢â¬ â on sale for as little as ÃÂ£100 .
IsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t she terrified by the possible ramifications ?
Ã¢â¬ÅPerhaps I would be if I had more money , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Morone , in her native drawl .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interesting to see what could happen Ã¢â¬ â how something like that is treated once itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an artwork ; why people are buying that .
Is it because a gallery is telling them itÃ¢â¬
â¢ s worth something ?
Or because they just want to know that stuff?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The complete dossier , including a yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s worth of data on her character , demographic , lifestyle , health , digital activity , identity , finance , can be yours for ÃÂ£7,000 .
Morone , who moved to London 14 years ago , studying Design Interactions at the Royal College of Art after a BA in sculpture , wants to highlight our state of Ã¢â¬Ådata
slaveryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â the willingness to submit our every moveto social media and confess our darkest secrets to the search bar , lining the pockets of big business as we do .
But the show also explores how much value society puts in data Ã¢â¬ â birth dates , heart rates , holiday photos Ã¢â¬ â compared to art .
Ã¢â¬ÅArt is a business , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Morone , flatly .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s just how many people you can get to believe in something .
Same with the show ; same with the stock market .
This show proves itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s impossible to live outside any market .
Everything Ã¢â¬ â whatever its intention at first Ã¢â¬ â gets turned into some sort of product.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s satirical , of course , but like all satire , it intends to make the familiar unfamiliar . Ã¢â¬ÅDo people have to ask my permission or sign a terms and conditions agreement if they want to speak to me?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ asks Morone .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a ridiculous scenario , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what we do every day , with technology like Google Glass and Skype .
You donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know who the end user is and for what purpose .
We sign away our rights without thinking.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
We are no longer a proletariat , argues Morone , but a procureiat - constantly creating profit for someone , somewhere ; probably shareholders in a company registered in Delaware that harvests our data like a hurricane . Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a whole rule book that other people are playing with and we donÃ¢â¬

The purpose behind Jennifer Lyn MoroneÃ¢âÂ¢ Inc is to make people think a little more about the mess weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got ourselves into .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen knowledge and wealth are in the hands of so few , it becomes a scary situation .
When I started looking at the data industry , I realised it was just another industry .
When the Snowden revelations came out people were concerned about privacy , but I was interested in the value of that information .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s such a high - worth industry .
So who is collecting and trading that information for profit?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a question that , for Morone , is best answered by running headlong at the problem ; by embodying the discomfort ; by turning her flesh and blood into commercial commodities .
The fact it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite work Ã¢â¬
â that the suit jacket is too large
, the boardroom meeting straight out of a sketch show , the corporate diagrams just a little too hand - drawn Ã¢â¬ â is the point .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe jacket doesnÃ¢â¬

Ã¢â¬ÅThis whole thing doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite fit .

The Cure - Jupiter Crash Not all astronomical activity is thrilling , as Robert Smith reminds us in this gloomy tale of romantic disappointment .
The song recalls his experience of watching the remnants of the Shoemaker - Levy comet crashing into Jupiter in 1994 : a much - anticipated cosmic event at the time .

Ã¢â¬ÅNature has a way of yielding pleasureÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Ross reassures us , semi - scientifically .
Written by the Bee Gees , it surely ranks as one of the filthiest songs to be covered by Steps .
Kate Bush - Cloudbusting
This moving , celebratory single from Ã¢â¬ËHounds of LoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ is inspired by the Austrian radical scientist Wilhelm Reich .
Having been a respected psychoanalyst , ReichÃ¢â¬ â¢ s psychosexual experiments became increasingly eccentric , and in the 1950s he invented a Ã¢â¬ËcloudbusterÃ¢â¬ â¢ , a machine designed to induce rain .
Bush tells the story from the perspective of ReichÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son , Peter , recalling his fatherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eventual arrest .

The song itself is a typically wide - eyed and questing reverie .
BjÃÂ¶rk - Mutual Core
In 2011 the Icelandic innovator released Ã¢â¬ËBiophiliaÃ¢â¬ â¢ ; an album comprised of profoundly science - influenced meditations , with each track accompanied by an immersive mobile - app .
Other tracks tackled quantum physics , conservation and crystallography , while Ã¢â¬ËMutual CoreÃ¢â¬ â¢ considers plate tectonics ; an area not often addressed in rock music .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat you resist , persistsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , warns the knowing , sensual vocalist .
Kate and Anna McGarrigle - NaCl Kate McGarrigle , that late figurehead of folk royalty , wrote NaCl for the 1978 album Pronto Monto .
Rather than applying science to human love , as other songwriters on this list have , McGarrigle does the reverse , telling the story of the romantic courtship of a chlorine and a sodium atom , who marry and become sodium chloride .

Josh Ritter - The Temptation of Adam One of RitterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s

The Temptation of Adam tells of a love affair between two scientists inside an underground atomic weapons silo , peppered with nuclear physics - related wordplay .
Ã¢â¬ÅOur love would live a half - life on the surfaceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ fears the increasingly - mournful narrator , as he considers pressing the Ã¢â¬Ågreat big buttonÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to ensure their love will never die .
Ella Fitzgerald - How High the Moon Nancy HamiltonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s jazz standard , sung energetically by Ella Fitzgerald , expresses love as a condition of cosmic wonder and uncertainty , staring at the moon in child - like bafflement .
Though not the most factually knowledgeable song on the list - Ã¢â¬Ådoes it reach to Mars?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ asks Ella - it articulates that most important scientific characteristic : curiosity .
Jarvis Cocker - Quantum Theory Ã¢â¬ÅSomewhere everyone is happyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , sings Jarvis on his first solo album ,
Ã¢â¬Åsomewhere fish do not have bonesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He thereby expresses the poignancy of the multiverse : a perfect world exists somewhere among infinite inaccessible alternatives , but that knowledge is scant consolation to Jarvis Cocker , struggling with disappointment , grief , and presumably a few too many bones in his haddock .
They Might Be Giants - I am a Paleontologist During the naughties , the always - lovable indie duo TMBG turned their hands to making educational albums for children , explaining literacy and numeracy in cheerful and irreverent terms .
The third such album was Ã¢â¬ËHere Comes ScienceÃ¢â¬ â¢ , and featured this catchy number - the only song on our list to feature the word Ã¢â¬ËpachycephalosaurusÃ¢â¬ â¢ .

Joanna Newsom - Emily Emily , the first of only five tracks on NewsomÃ¢â¬ â¢ s second album , is a yearning , 12-minute love - letter to her sister Dr Emily Newsom , an astrophysicist .
The long , meandering song expresses JoannaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s abject amazement at EmilyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brilliance , and the strange divisions between them as artist and scientist respectively .
During the chorus , Newsom wrongly defines the word Ã¢â¬ËmeteoroidÃ¢â¬ â¢ , illustrating her failure to fully grasp her sisterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s knowledge - fans are divided over whether or not the error is deliberate .

2016-02-15,"Hero worship is a funny thing .
It can inspire and liberate while often being grounded in fantasy .
Did David Bowie influence modern culture quite as much as he is currently credited ?
Do artists really learn anything from other artists or do they just need to believe they do ?
Creation , after all , is such a scary thing ; the blank canvas a terrifying void .
Pinning up your artistic heroÃ¢â¬ â¢ s works in your studio may be as sentimental as playing Life on Mars a thousand times in a week .
You certainly canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t leave the National GalleryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s exhibition about the cult of the Romantic artist EugÃÂ¨ne
Delacroix without realising his Bowie - like status in the minds of rebels from Paul CÃ Â© zanne to Vincent van Gogh , from Gustave Courbet to Henri Matisse .
There is a wonderfully nutty quality to some of the homages the French pioneers of modern art paid to him .
CezanneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Apotheosis of Delacroix ( 1890 - 04 ) shows him and his fellow artists kneeling and praying as Delacroix is transported aloft .
Henri Fantin - LatourÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Immortality imagines an angel scattering roses on his name , inscribed across a Paris park .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to see from this exhibition how Delacroix really influenced CÃ Â© zanne .
The latterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s art is so tough , so intellectual .
Surely it owes as much to Poussin as it does to the fiery yet subtle colours of Delacroix .
Art is one vast chain of interconnections , and a painting held up as an example of reverence for Delacroix may actually remind you of some other model .
Anyway , CÃ Â© zanne is such a revolutionary that he cuts through tradition with a razor .
I just donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t buy the idea that he relies on Delacroix for much .
Van Gogh will prove a better disciple , surely ?
He writes so passionately about Delacroix in his letters to Theo , and this exhibition includes his eerie 1889 painting
PietÃ ( after Delacroix ) in which he demonstrates his understanding of the way the earlier artist used colour .
Yet his Ã¢â¬ÅcopyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ is pure Vincent .
Its frenzied vortices of colour tell us more about his pain and suffering when he painted it Ã¢â¬ â in the asylum where he was incarcerated after cutting off his ear Ã¢â¬ â than they do his connection with an artist who had shone two generations back .
The real problem with this exhibition is that it fails to communicate the sensationalism and excitement of Delacroix himself .
Take his painting The Death of Sardanapalus .
This orgiastic vision of sex and death is a monstrous pink divan of amoral chaos .
A tyrant is having his harem killed in shocking scenes of slaughter
Ã¢â¬ â shocking because the artist shows no compassion , only a fascination with flesh and gold .
Painting has been liberated from reason in this 5m - tall masterpiece .
There is a version of it in this exhibition Ã¢â¬ â a Ã¢â¬Åreduced replicaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ painted by Delacroix that miniaturises the whole colossal massacre down to a canvas less than a metre wide .
Yes , the colours are still druggy , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not the full hookah .
Nor is the version here of Women of Algiers in their Apartment ( 1847 - 9 ) anything like as haunting in its chromatic perfume as the great , famous painting by Delacroix on the same subject , famously copied by Picasso .
The failure to borrow at least one of the LouvreÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stonking Delacroix masterpieces makes this an exhibition without a hero .
There are lots of interesting works by him here and some lovely ones , too : his faintly decadent still life A Basket of Fruit in a Flower Garden ( 1848 ) oozes a heady scent of overripeness .
But the final insult comes when you are obliged , right in the middle of the exhibition , to watch a boringly shot film about mural projects in Paris .
This , instead of seeing any of the grand visual barbarities that made his name .
Not even Liberty Leading the People .
DelacroixÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sinful sensuality is dulled by this over - worthy exhibition , and without it his modernity is killed .
His greatest admirer of all was the drug - addicted poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire .
By missing out Baudelaire , who should have had an entire room to himself , we donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really see the historical connection between ecstatic scenes such as The Death of Sardanapalus and the absinthe drinkers of the avant - garde .
OÃÂ¹ sont les fleurs
du mal ?
DelacroixÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Romantic depravity does echo in the heightened , hallucinogenic paintings of the symbolist visionaries Odilon Redon and Gustave Moreau .
But it is left to Matisse to save the day .
His study for Luxe , Calme et VoluptÃ Â© ( 1904 ) is a rapture that takes its title from BaudelaireÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poem The Invitation to the Voyage .
Sheer liberated joyous colour will set us free , this painting asserts .
I just wish the curators had accepted its hedonist invitation instead of constructing this show like a series of notes for a seminar .

2016-02-16,"Lady Gaga has trafficked in Bowie - isms since she first crash - landed into pop music with The Fame , her 2008 breakthrough collection of dance - pop hits and slickly offered sexuality .
Over the past 18 months or so , though , sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been seemingly paying her music - industry debts for the messy , indulgent 2013 album Artpop , which will go down in history as one of those Ã¢â¬Åinteresting failuresÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gone to great lengths to prove sheÃ¢â¬
â¢ s a pop artiste worthy of the pantheon , singing the Star - Spangled Banner and selections from The Sound Of Music on pop cultureÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
biggest stages , dueting with Tony Bennett and teaming up with Diane Warren .
So it makes sense that her apology tour would wind its way to the Grammy stage in the form of a tribute to the late David Bowie , whose shape - shifting Gaga has emulated perhaps more fully than any other pop star .
( Happy fifth anniversary of Gaga arriving at the Grammys in an egg . )
The tribute , produced by former Bowie collaborator Nile Rodgers and underwritten by Intel , smooshed together a slew of tracks from the Thin White DukeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70s and 80s offerings .
( No Blackstar tracks here , alas . )
Sporting a flame - red Ã¢â¬ â¢ do , Gaga began the show becoming one with Bowie through the magic of digital projection ; she then went through a few outfit changes a la her 2013 Video Music Awards performance of the Artpop lead single Applause , going from caped to feathered to jumpsuited as the music ( and the piano she took to ) shifted around her .
While she kept up ably Ã¢â¬
â say what you will about her flights of fancy , the woman has keen pop instincts and a strong voice Ã¢â¬ â
and it was gratifying to see Rodgers up there smiling and strutting after his own dealings with cancer
, there was something slightly dissatisfying about the whole thing .
Cutting down the sprawling catalog of Bowie is no mean feat , of course , but having so many selections only represent the classic - rock - canon - approved slice of the manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work seemed reductive ; there was more to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s appeal than face paint and flashy jumpsuits , as any of the eulogies that have poured forth since his death on 10 January could have shown .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s constant pushing toward the edge Ã¢â¬ â toward the ridiculous , the sublime , the otherworldly Ã¢â¬ â deserved more of an homage than hasty costume switcheroos and zips through choruses .
A Gaga performance of , say , Five Years or even the Blackstar closing statement
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Everything Away might have stopped the show , honoring BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s artistry and the way he kept going , working on his art even under shifting critical winds , until the very end ."

It was epigrammatic in an age that often seems allergic to the tease .

Its construction was watertight .

Ã¢â¬ÅGagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ is slang ; slang with a specific slur in mind .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bedfellow to the likes of Ã¢â¬Åbag
ladyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
and Ã¢â¬ÅcougarÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â both reckoned Ã¢â¬ÅinformalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by the dictionary and unacceptable by the public .
Jenny Beavan might have not minded her friend Stephen Fry calling her a tramp on primetime telly at the Bafta awards on Sunday , but the Great British public cooked up enough chagrin to have her more than covered .
I do not feel that I am someone who is easily offended .
At university , my nickname was Ã¢â¬Åbag
ladyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â doubtless deserved , hopefully meant with some friendliness .
Generally speaking , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s me
whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the crass one , either at the time or retrospectively realising prior insensitivities as the stockpile of lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nightmares mounts up .
And yet little makes me bristle as much as someone casually slinging about the word Ã¢â¬ÅsenileÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ or Ã¢â¬ÅgagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â usually preceded by Ã¢â¬ÅIs he Ã¢â¬ Â¦ ?
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ or Ã¢â¬ÅSheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gone
totally Ã¢â¬
Â¦ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Some illnesses command immediate respect and seriousness as a response .
When someone has cancer , people do not tend to roll their eyes and titter at the victim .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe big CÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ aside Ã¢â¬ â hardly the most upsetting idiom
Ã¢â¬ â
it does not have a lot of slangy synonyms .
Dementia Ã¢â¬ â incurable , at best only delayed by treatment Ã¢â¬ â is treated differently .
It is fair game .
In part this is because it is in the interests of the non - sufferers to remain ignorant of the offence they may cause .
Stay in the dark and you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be expected to know when you might have put your foot in it .
Dismissing someone as Ã¢â¬ÅgagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ makes it easier to kid yourself that your responsibilities towards them have gone the same way as their marbles .
In my experience , the people who describe dementia - sufferers in this way tend also to be those who consider those relatives who are no longer capable of recognising them as unworthy of concern , as if Ã¢â¬ â rather than being ill Ã¢â¬ â they had consciously chosen to slight them .
These are people whose sense of self worth seems so central that they can not conceive of a relationship that might not involve mutual appreciation ( though they donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t often have the same trouble with a baby who doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have immediate recall of their name , current position at work and holiday plans for the forthcoming season ) .
The other reason Ã¢â¬ÅgagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅsenileÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ continue to do the rounds is the invisibility of those they insult .
These people are missing from a society unwilling to extend a welcome , their own ability to reach out curbed by both the disease itself and by being , in the main , still of the generation unfamiliar with if not mobile phones then certainly social media .
They are also in general less willing to cause a fuss or challenge apparent medical authority .
They are less sure that they are important .
This will change .
Baby boomers will not take being insulted lying down .
Instead , they will tweet and blog about their experience .
They will whistleblow on bad care and shame shunning relatives .
They will make sure people know what they are going through .
Even if they may struggle to communicate , their access to self - publishing means they wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t stop trying .
And for those who reach retirement in 20 yearsÃ¢â¬ â¢ time , reporting on your day to people you have never met will be second nature .
These people will not tolerate being dismissed as Ã¢â¬ÅsenileÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Moreover , they may even seek to reclaim the word , just as other marginalised groups have taken ownership of terms previously created to be pejorative .
It is a happy vision : a care home full of elderly people
whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve co - opted Ã¢â¬ÅgagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as a term of endearment , merrily updating their feeds and publishing their columns , online and enfranchised , as visited by children as any other relative , as much a part of the community as anybody else , healthy or unwell .
A better vision yet , of course , would be if this care home were at the centre of the community , in a society in which its progressiveness had stretched a bit deeper than the lexical .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere is no use indicting words , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote Samuel Beckett in Malone Dies , Ã¢â¬Åthey are no shoddier than what they peddle.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
When we get huffy about phrasing , then , it must be about the deeper meaning , not so we can call out someone who happens to be one step behind the correct terminology .
I hate it when people use the word Ã¢â¬ÅgagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But I squirm yet more when IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m trapped in a social media echo - chamber filled with the sound of sanctimonious virtue - seeking .
For the moment , though , we are stuck with Twitter as the main forum for public debate .
And so we should doubly celebrate Duncan
JonesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s contribution .
If you have only 140 characters , concision is compulsory , and precision yet more crucial .
We need to know exactly what the words mean that we are wasting space on .
And , thank goodness , there is no emoji for Ã¢â¬ÅsenileÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ just yet .
As for the 60 smiley faces forÃ¢â¬ÅGagaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â well , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not quite dictionary definition ."
2016-02-18,"PJ Harvey will perform at Glastonbury 2016 , joining headliners Coldplay , and Jeff LynneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Electric Light Orchestra on the Sunday bill .
Announcing the news via Twitter , Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis confirmed the news of HarveyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s return to the Worthy farm event , playing the Other stage in support of her new album , The Hope Six Demolition Project .
Eavis also told BBC 6 Music that a tribute to David Bowie would be taking place at the festival , and that the Friday and Saturday night Pyramid stage headliners are expected to be revealed in the next few weeks .
The Metro also report that Emily Eavis dropped a huge hint as to who may be taking up the other two slots : Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got three brilliant British bands headlining the festival , although I havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t actually told anyone that yet!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Speaking about Coldplay , who will become the first act ever to headline the Somerset event four times , Eavis described the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long - lasting relationship with the band .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a definite sense of pride to see them go through everything theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been through to become this massive band ,

Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brilliant to have them back.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

Dave Grohl News broke this week that David Bowie refused the offer to work with Dave Grohl , making him one of the few musicians ever not to have collaborated with the Foo FightersÃ¢â¬ â¢ leader .
To be fair , nothing has emerged featuring Grohl performing with Father Abraham and the Smurfs , either , though weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve heard rumours thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bootleg on the internet of the Foos performing The Smurf Song with Father Abraham at the Amsterdam Paradiso , but without any actual smurfs on stage .
Grohl approached Bowie two years ago , asking him to sing on a piece of music for a film .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s response : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid , I watched the movie and I got to be honest , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not my thing
Ã¢â¬ Â¦ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m
not made for these times .
So thanks ,
but I think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m gon na sit this one out.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Grohl replied , and received a response from Bowie : Ã¢â¬ÅAlright , well thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s settled , then .
Now fuck off.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Perhaps Bowie was worried that him plus a hard rock guitarist might have resulted in Tin Machine 3 .
( Since publication of this article , many of you have alerted me to the fact that Grohl and Bowie did in fact work together on Heathen and at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 50th birthday concert .
I am going to listen to The Smurf Song on repeat all weekend as penance .
Apologies . )

Coldplay
You want your hero to appear on one of your songs .
The natural thing to do is to send them a recording and then wait .
Your preferred response would be an email a couple of hours later with a vocal already recorded and attached .
Failing that , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d settle for a note saying : Ã¢â¬ÅScheduleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s busy , but letÃ¢â¬ â¢ s try to find some studio time.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
You could probably understand silence Ã¢â¬
â after all , heroes are busy people .
What you might want least of all would be for said hero to respond :
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a very good song , is it?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Which of those do you think happened when Coldplay approached Bowie ? 3 .
Scottish independence
The Brit awards are famed as a platform for hard - hitting political campaigns .
Remember that time in 2004 when Liberty X used winning best British single to call for a thorough investigation of HMRCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s complicity in allowing major corporations to minimise their tax burden ?
But BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s words at the 2014 ceremony still came as a shock .
First , there was the fact that he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t speaking them , delegating that task to Kate Moss Ã¢â¬ â you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think Bowie would have contemplated turning up to anything so vulgar as the Brits , do you ?
Then there was the content of them .
Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon , consider yourself rejected .
Ã¢â¬ÅScotland , stay with us , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ intoned Moss .
And , lo , Scotland did indeed vote to stay part of the UK .

A knighthood Bowie had already turned down a CBE in 2000
Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅI seriously donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know what itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s for ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said Ã¢â¬ â but Buckingham Palace doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t give up easily , what with the Queen being a huge fan of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s early-70s albums ( she went off him a bit with Station to Station , but loves Low and Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ ) .
And so , in 2003 , Bowie was offered a knighthood for having made Ã¢â¬Åa major contribution to British lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Again , he said no : Ã¢â¬ÅI would never have any intention of accepting anything like that .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not what I spent my life working for.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Imagine how Chris Martin would have felt if that was how Bowie had rejected the Coldplay song .

A Danny Boyle musical Like all good and sensible musicians
, Bowie was prone to saying no to requests to use his music .
You have to , if you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to see Life on Mars being used on confectionary ads , or The Jean Genie advertising Gap , or Always Crashing in the Same Car soundtracking Top Gear .
But what if someone who is respected in their own field comes to you , saying they want to make a movie about you ?
Maybe a hugely well - regarded film - maker like Danny Boyle , who has a script by the equally well - regarded Frank Cottrell Boyce .
You still say no .
Boyle said BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rejection left him Ã¢â¬Åin griefÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .

Doctor Who Peter Capaldi said last autumn that he wanted David Bowie to be a guest star in Doctor Who .
He had no chance .
Doctor Who composer Murray Gold told Den of Geek in 2013 of his encounter with Bowie at an ice cream stall : Ã¢â¬ÅI said , Ã¢â¬ËI write music for Doctor Who , Ã¢â¬ â¢ and he said , Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not doing
it.Ã¢â¬ â¢
I said , Ã¢â¬ËWhat do you mean?Ã¢â¬ â¢ and he said , Ã¢â¬ËThey want me to do it.Ã¢â¬
â¢
I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know what it means , to this day , but thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what he said .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know in what capacity , as an actor or as a musician.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ 7 .
Flight of the Conchords
The New Zealand comedy - music duo were longtime Bowie fans , having written the song
Bowie in Space years ago , and when they began their own series for US TV , they wrote an episode in which they were to be visited in a dream by Bowie .
And who better to play Bowie than Bowie ?
Through intermediaries , they approached him .
As the ConchordsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Jemaine Clement wrote in the Spinoff : Ã¢â¬ÅThe someone we knew talked to the someone they knewÃ¢â¬ â¢ s friend of someone who represented him and possibly approached him about it .
And he ( or quite possibly merely a representative ) said that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d just done Ricky Gervais and Stephen MerchantÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Extras and didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to do another thing acting as a version of him .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ d rather just continue being the actual him .
Fair enough , so would we .
We wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be meeting our hero .
Through the disappointment I was extremely relieved .
As exciting as it is to meet your hero , the relief of not having to meet them is another , quite different and pleasant feeling.Ã¢â¬

Red Hot Chili Peppers
The worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s premiere funk - metal band with socks on their penises revealed earlier this year that they had repeatedly asked David Bowie to produce them .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn the beginning we would call him , and he would say no , respectfully , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ singer Anthony Kiedis said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThen , later , we would write long emails explaining everything , and why it was time for us to really get our ships on and he always respectfully declined.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He said no Ã¢â¬Åtwo or three timesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Kiedis said , though Brian Eno has turned down the group eight times .
Fellas , take a hint .

A Bond film
Bowie was a man with a firm appreciation of his own talents , and while he doubtless would have been able to bring suitable villainy to the role of Max Zorin in A View to a Kill Ã¢â¬ â a role eventually taken by Christopher Walken Ã¢â¬
â
it was the downsides that turned him off .
Not the prospect of acting opposite Roger Moore , who was 57 and distinctly unactionlike by the time the film was released , but the idea of whether it was the best use of his time .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t want to spend five months watching my stunt double fall off cliffs , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .

Puss in Boots Bowie , famously , learned a great deal from Lindsay Kemp Ã¢â¬ â the dancer , mime artist and choreographer .
He studied with Kemp in the 1960s Ã¢â¬ÅI taught him to express and communicate through his body , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Kemp .
Ã¢â¬ÅI taught him to dance .
I taught him the importance of the look Ã¢â¬ â makeup , costume , general stagecraft , performance technique .
I gave him books to read and pictures to look at .
We talked about kabuki , avant gardists , the world of the music hall , which we were both attracted to.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
They worked together on many projects , but some didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t come together .
As Kemp told the Guardian earlier this year : Ã¢â¬ÅOne Christmas , I asked him to play Puss in Boots in Musselburgh .
His agent came back and said that ÃÂ£10 a week wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really enough Ã¢â¬ â could I get it up to ÃÂ£15 ?
Management said no , we couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .

2016-02-22,"ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s every reason to be scared of cancer .
The latest research suggests that one in every two people in the UK will be diagnosed with some form of the disease during their lifetime .
In January alone , cancer was responsible for the deaths of national treasures David Bowie , Alan Rickman and Terry Wogan .
So itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OK to be scared , even angry , but we must not be silent about cancer .
We need to arm ourselves with knowledge about how to prevent , spot and treat the many forms of the disease .
So how can you raise this difficult topic with your pupils ?
Primary A sensible place to start is with a definition of cancer .
This can be found in What Does It Mean , a childrenÃ¢â¬ â¢
s magazine designed for young people who know someone with cancer , from Bupa .
The magazine addresses common questions such as Ã¢â¬ÅWhat are cancer cells made of?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅCan I catch it?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ , and includes a glossary of key terms that introduces words such as symptom , tumour and operation .
For younger pupils , the short film A Boy Named Finn is a useful entry point for a discussion of the illness .
It tells the story of a ( puppet ) boy who was diagnosed with the disease at the age of four .
Using puppetry , animation and interviews with children who have had cancer , it introduces the idea of diagnosis , treatment and recuperation in a way that is non - threatening ( and actually quite upbeat ) .
MummyÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
Lump , a picturebook from Breast Cancer Care , explores how a breast cancer diagnosis affects a family Ã¢â¬ â told through the perspective of siblings Jack and Elly .
The book , which can be ordered online or downloaded as a pdf , looks at how the disease is detected and the long process of treatment .
It doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t shy away from exploring how this can change the way a person behaves ( by being tired and unable to play , for example ) and the impact of the illness on their loved ones .
Hospitals are a recurring theme in cancer conversations
Ã¢â¬ â and you can make your pupils aware of the vital work of medical staff with this resource from TeachIt Primary .
It details a day in the life of a nurse , explaining the many duties and responsibilities of the role , bringing in complex language with a dictionary definition task and testing pupilsÃ¢â¬ â¢ understanding with a comprehension activity .
Try turning your classroom into a research laboratory with these lesson plans from cancer campaign Wear
It Pink .
They invite budding scientists to investigate the questions Ã¢â¬Åhow can we make squashy playdough?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ( for key stage 1 ) and Ã¢â¬Åhow can I make this lightbulb light up?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ for ( key stage 2 ) , with ideas for further tasks and ways to raise funds for cancer research .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also important that students understand how to lower their risk of skin cancer by staying covered up in the sun .
This simple animated video will teach them how .
These Safety in the Sun posters from Twinkl also offer useful information and advice , explaining how the sunÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rays are harmful , how skin cancer can develop , and how the simple acronym A.W.A.R.E can help them to avoid burning .
Secondary Ensure your students understand the biology behind cancer with these beautiful animated videos .
They offer an in - depth look at how cancer cells behave differently from healthy ones and how cancer spreads through the body , presented in a way thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s engaging ( and not terrifying ) .
The ability to notice and talk about changes to your body is a vital part of staying healthy , but adolescence can be a difficult time to do it .
The breast mates workbook from Breast Cancer Care , aimed at girls aged 11 to 16 , includes vital information on detecting breast cancer , as well as offering information on whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s normal , how to find the right bra and how to develop body confidence .
For the boys and young men you teach , this information pack from cancer charity
Orchid gives a comprehensive guide to testicular cancer .
It offers facts , figures and diagrams letting them know what testicular cancer is , what factors could put them at a higher risk of developing it and how to check themselves for symptoms of the disease .
You can also look at current affairs relating to cancer with this collection of recent news stories , put together by The Day .
It includes resources and discussion questions on topics such as the plans to sell cigarettes in plain packaging ; the research that found 50 % of the population will suffer from cancer ; and the inspirational speech given by a student in New Zealand after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease .
Recent projects also offer opportunities for discussion about cancer and how it is explored by those battling it .
When photographer Jo Spence was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1990 , she created The Final Project , a series of provocative images ( now on display for the first time )
that address her feelings about the illness .
The video game designer Ryan Green created That Dragon Cancer , a game based on his experience of his sonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s terminal brain cancer , which prompted heated debate .
Finally , the silver screen has offered many moving portrayals of battles with cancer , and IntoFilm has guides to two recent tearjerkers .
The Fault
In Our Stars , based on John GreenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bestselling novel , looks at two teenage cancer patients falling in love , while Me , Earl and the Dying Girl is about a friendship that forms in the wake of a leukaemia diagnosis .

2016-02-23,"Always the innovator , even after death , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album , Blackstar , is set to be turned into an Instagram miniseries that begins this week .
Entitled Unbound , the Ã¢â¬ÅInstaMiniSeriesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ consists of 16episodes that provide Ã¢â¬Åvisual interpretationsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the album .
It will star Rookie Magazine founder Tavi Gevinson and Six Feet UnderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Patricia Clarkson .
According to a post on the site , Carolynn Cecilia and Nikki Borge , who wrote and directed the series for the social network , were given music from his 28th studio album so that they could create the episodes Ã¢â¬Åwith no limits or preconditions on his partÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It takes the audience Ã¢â¬Åon a journey of evocative images inspired by the moods suggested in the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , lyrics and artworkÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Following BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death on 10 January , many fans discovered a new narrative on the Blackstar record : pop obsessives gleaned cryptic clues about his death , with its title , track names , videos and artwork all said to offer insight into the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s acceptance of death .
Below is a trailer for the series , its gothic mood evoked by dreamlike choreography and a dark , eerie library backdrop .
The series premieres on 25 February , with a new episode every Monday , Tuesday , Thursday and Friday ."
2016-02-23,"More than 40 years ago , David Bowie penned the most eloquent possible ode to the debauched beauty of Iggy Pop with his song Jean Genie .
On Monday , Iggy got to repay the favor in the most reverent possible setting by performing that classic at this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Tibet House all - star concert at Carnegie Hall .
The annual Tibet extravaganza Ã¢â¬ â now in its 26th , 28th or 30th year , depending on when you date its fuzzy origin Ã¢â¬ â always has transcendence on its mind , an ideal vehicle for a Bowie salute .
The connection between the late star and the cause runs deep .
He performed at two shows in the past , and the eventÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stalwart organizer , Philip Glass , has created symphonies based on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Low and Heroes , part of which he performed at one such benefit several years ago .
The concert series serves to benefit the cultural center Tibet House in New York .
But the cause has both spiritual and political ambitions , the latter addressing the plight of the Tibetan people at the hands of the Chinese .
As usual , the tone and construction of the concert was meant to function as a refuge , both from lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s distractions and from musical expectations .
For a shot at the universal , the lineup cut a wide swath , offering standbys ( Glass , Gogol Bordello ) , a taste of todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s avant talent ( FKA twigs , Basia Bulat ) as well as actual Tibetans ( Dechen Shak - Dagsay and a group of chanting local monks ) .
For a savored non sequitur , they threw in the seasoned soul singer Sharon Jones .
To expand things even further , headliner Iggy didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t just sing , he read two new poems , both of which touched on spiritual issues .
The cast of the night also spanned a wide age group ( late 20s to late 70s ) , represented a daunting array of regions ( hopping from Africa to Canada to the Ukraine ) and touched on a wealth of genres ( Ã¢â¬Ånew musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , throat singing , R&amp;B , folk , glam - rock ) .
The night began on the holiest note : with a largely acapella chant by six Tibetan monks .
Their mix of low tones and high tones thrived on the intimacy and calm of breathing .
Bulat , who followed , performed in a voice as high as the Himalayas , with a tone as clean as the air up there .
The Canadian folk singer , who accompanied herself , by turns , on autoharp and guitar , addressed love from two sides .
Her aching piece
It CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Be You deals with the shock of betrayal .
Someday Soon reversed the power struggle , letting her be the one who leaves .
Continents away came the sound of Gambian kora master Foday Musa Suso .
In his three numbers , Suso connected African folk , jazz fusion , European classical music ( aided by harpist Lavinia Meijer ) and modern minimalism ( via GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s added piano arpeggios ) .
In Tamala , SusoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thumping rhythms gave swing to the koraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s naturally woody texture .
Meijer provided her own link to Glass , performing a solo version of his piece Metamorphis # 2 , which injected worry into the harpÃ¢â¬ â¢ s angelic tones .
The punching soul of Jones raised the otherwise meditative mood to the rousing , aided by backing from the Patti Smith Band , rather than her usual Daptones .
Decked out in a mod dress , Jones provided the ideal look for She AinÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a Child No More , which has the spy - rock flavor of a song from the Sunset Strip in 1966 .
In case you missed the connection , the Scorchio String Quartet came in for a cameo , offering a taste of the James Bond Theme .
Shak - Dagsay , a Tibetan by heritage who was raised in Switzerland , elaborated her Himalayan singing with hints of country , folk and even art - rock , once her backing band got into the groove .
For a dash of the theatrical , FKA twigs provided clean choreography and costuming in her two songs .
She , and her three backing musicians , appeared monk - like in white robes and bare feet .
Her lithe moves drew from yoga poses to create a vision as ravishing as her vocals .
The band played lightly , leaving lots of room in songs like Good to Love , in the process breaking R&amp;B into a tone poem .
To underscore the political subtext to the event , Gogol BordelloÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs voiced concerns of the oppressed and the displaced .
By contrast , their punky take on Romany folk communicated pure joy .
Iggy , who appeared in a finely tailored suit , closed the show , first by offering the poems
, I Talked To A Smart Guy and Mom and Dad
are Gone .
On each , his incantations were accompanied by SusoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s kora and the string quartet .
Both readings dealt with the spiritual consequences of ambition .
The latter also pondered legacy , extending the theme of IggyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s forthcoming album with Josh Homme , Post - Pop Depression .
Only in a setting as accepting as this could the star get away with moves this personal .
After delivering the more accessible Jean Genie in all itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s blues - rock bluster , the whole cast joined Iggy on a song he wrote with Bowie , Tonight .
Sharon Jones inhabited the part taken by Tina Turner in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recording of the piece .
The songsÃ¢â¬ â¢ lyrics deal with savoring life in the wake of a death , offering the perfect nod to a departed spirit that , on this night , seemed so present ."
2016-02-24,"You might suggest there was a certain ideological disparity at the heart of the 2016 Brit Awards , were it not for the fact that using the phrase Ã¢â¬Åideological disparityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ seems a bit much when discussing an ITV show whose dedicated light - entertainment bent was underlined by the presence of Ant and Dec as hosts .
Aside from the excitement caused by the presence of various huge stars , including Rihanna , Justin Bieber and The Weeknd Ã¢â¬ â
it is traditional for the annual celebration of British music to draft in the biggest global names it can get , in order to make British music look like the poor relation to whatÃ¢â¬ â¢
s happening in America Ã¢â¬
â
the big noise was a tribute to David Bowie : an event that fans of the late star curiously seemed to regard less with anticipatory excitement than a profound wariness , as if haunted by the very real possibility it might involve Olly Murs and Robbie Williams recreating the Dancing in the Street video Bowie and Mick Jagger made for Live Aid .
As it turned out , the tribute was great , certainly a vast improvement on Lady GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at the Grammys , who rampaged through the late singerÃ¢â¬
â¢ s back catalogue like it was an obstacle on ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s A Knockout .
Here we had Lorde performing Life on Mars , accompanied by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longstanding backing band , bathed in red light .
It was proof of something itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s often easy to doubt Ã¢â¬ â that the Brits can very occasionally get something right
Ã¢â¬
â
but still it seemed like a weird fit with everything else that was going on .
Here they were , paying tribute to an artist whose legend rested on his changeability , his nonpareil ability to shift and change , his refusal to do what people expected , in the middle of an evening devoted to being as predictable as possible .
The nearest you got to a surprise was BjÃÂ¶rk suddenly appearing onscreen wearing something berserk on her head , or Australian psychedelicists Tame Impala picking up best international group .
There seemed a chance they would give it to Eagles of Death Metal , a great band with a decade of critically acclaimed albums behind them , whose sudden leap from cult concern to appearance on the BritsÃ¢â¬ â¢ radar following the Paris attacks seemed a bit galumphing at best .
Elsewhere , they stuck doggedly to giving out the gongs to the artists that almost anyone would have realised was going to get them the minute they clapped eyes on the shortlists .
If you thought the nominations were boring , Ã¢â¬Ëyou ainÃ¢â¬
â¢ t seen nothing yetÃ¢â¬ â¢ seemed to be the message .
The dementedly optimistic Father John Misty fan , sure that the acerbic , complex singer - songwriter would triumph over Justin Bieber for best international male , was in for a bad night , as were the scant handful of black artists nominated ( none of them British ) , including Kendrick Lamar .
Laura Mvula , the hugely inventive singer - songwriter who elected to boycott the Brits over Ã¢â¬Åthe diversity
issueÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ must have felt fully justified in staying at home .
They handed out pretty much everything to Adele except the podium and the autocue , which gave her the opportunity to beat the person charged with blanking out anything deemed offensive with a well - timed burst of swearing , and to express solidarity with Kesha , the artist currently locked in a grim battle involving allegations of sexual abuse against her producer Dr Luke and Sony , the label that releases AdeleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s records in the US .
Two sparks of spontaneity in an evening of pre - chewed patter .
A churlish voice might suggest she triumphed over her old rival and fellow best British female nominee Amy Winehouse by the simple expedient of not having died four - and - half - years ago , but
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to argue that 25 isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the British album of the year in terms of commercial impact .
What price Jamie XXÃ¢â¬ â¢ s homage to LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vibrant history of dance culture next to an album that sold 15 m copies in a month ?
Ã¢â¬ÅThe artists who are honoured tend to be those who have achieved the very highest levels of chart success , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said a Brits spokesperson in response to MvulaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s condemnation and the succinct summary of Top 10 rapper Stormzy , who suggested the make - up of the nominations amounted to Ã¢â¬Åtaking the pissÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Even leaving aside the issue of racial diversity , that might be the Brits problem .
The Bowie tribute aside , it gave every impression of existing only to underline .
You canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t argue with the sales figures , but being repeatedly told what you already know is deathly dull .
Brit awards 2016 : the best moments Ã¢â¬ â in pictures"
2016-02-25,"When the Grammy awards paid tribute to his father , David Bowie , the film director Duncan Jones seemed less than overwhelmed .
However , the Brits performance of Life on Mars , by Lorde and the backing band that worked with Bowie on his final two tours seemed much more to his taste .
Jones tweeted that the performance was Ã¢â¬Åjust Ã¢â¬ Â¦ beautiful .
Thank you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
His words evidently came as a relief to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime keyboard player , Mike Garson , who was among the performers .
He replied : Ã¢â¬ÅThank you Duncan .
So glad you enjoyed it .
that means a lot to the band.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When Lady Gaga performed her Bowie megamix at the Grammys last week , with a band led by Nile Rodgers , Jones had been much more equivocal , tweeting : Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ËOverexcited or irrational , typically as the result of infatuation or excessive enthusiasm ; mentally confused.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Damn it !
What IS that
word!?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The word , of course , was gaga .
The Brits performance was not without its issues , though .
While the band had been rehearsing thoroughly , they had been doing so with Guy Pratt Ã¢â¬ â who has worked extensively with Pink Floyd , among others Ã¢â¬ â playing bass .
Pratt posted on Facebook after the show : Ã¢â¬ÅSo you know that Lorde/
Bowie thing on The Brits ?
Well I was the bass player for all the rehearsals right up to this afternoon when Gail Ann Dorsey got in from San Francisco .
Amazing honour to play with that lovely bunch , but talk about a wind up.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The band that played with Lorde consisted of :
Mike Garson Ã¢â¬ â keys ( joined Bowie in 1972 )
Earl Slick Ã¢â¬ â guitar ( 1974 )
Sterling Campbell Ã¢â¬ â drums ( 1994 )
Gail Ann Dorsey
Ã¢â¬ â bass ( 1995 )
Gerry Leonard Ã¢â¬ â guitar ( 2001 ) Catherine Russell Ã¢â¬ â keys (
2002 )"
2016-02-25,"The Brit awards 2016 drew a TV audience of nearly 6 million and sparked a Twitter storm during performances by stars including Adele and Rihanna , and a tribute to the late David Bowie .
The annual ITV coverage of the British Phonographic IndustryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s awards show was watched by an average audience of 5.8 million , a 27.5 % share of all TV viewing between 8 pm and 10.20pm on Wednesday night .
The show , which was hosted by Ant and Dec for the second year , matched the popularity of last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s event , which was notable for Madonna falling down a flight of stairs .
A major promotion of the event by Twitter helped fuel 7.5 million tweets about the show .
AdeleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s acceptance of the global success award caused the peak rate of tweets , at 55,000 per minute at 9.25pm .
The most - tweeted about individuals were One Direction band members Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne , with Adele third .
Just two years ago , the ceremony sparked more than 4 m posts on the social media site .
The Brits narrowly fended off the final of BBC1Ã¢â¬ â¢

The Great Sport Relief Bake Off , which drew an average of 5.4 million TV viewers and a 24.7 % share between 8 pm and 9 pm , to win its slot .
In 2014 , the Brits slumped to 4.6 million viewers , matching the record low set in 2006 .

2016-02-26,"Previously unpublished photos from David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only visit to Mexico show the star soaking up the local culture , from the work of legendary artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo to ancient Aztec architecture .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s concert promoters commissioned Mexican photographer Fernando Aceves to record these intimate moments between the legendary musician and the cultural heritage of Mexico .
The UK music star was preparing an article for the magazine Modern Painters and wanted to document his visits to major cultural institutions , including the Palacio de Bellas Artes , the Frida Kahlo Museum and the archaeological site of Teotihuacan .
Ã¢â¬ÅThose photographs would be only a reference for him , that was the goal , recording the visit and nothing else , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Aceves .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe knew exactly what he was talking about and what he wanted to see , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ recalled the photographer .
The singer - songwriter arrived in Mexico City three days before his concert at Foro Sol , in October 1997 during the world tour to promote his Earthling album .
Aceves snapped Bowie appreciating the work of the muralists Diego Rivera , JosÃ Â© Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie was a nice guy , but reserved .
He addressed me as the photographer that accompanied him , he agreed to what I asked .
He told me : Ã¢â¬ËAnything you see , you ask me , Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Aceves .
Before leaving Mexico , the rocker wrote Aceves a letter thanking him for the time they worked together on the photoshoot and gave him some instructions of the formats he required the images to be for his magazine article .
Ã¢â¬ÅAn agreement was reached at the end .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s funny , because he said : Ã¢â¬ËFernando , I have no money to pay for this [ the photoshoot ] , because it is not a project that will make me richer , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a personal project
, Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the photographer recalls .
BenjamÃÂ­n Salcedo , editor of Rolling Stone Mexico , was one of the lucky attendees to attend the concert at Foro Sol .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was a magical night , with a setlist of all his periods , from the electronic Earthling to the classics like Ziggy Stardust , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Salcedo .
Ã¢â¬ÅI saw many musicians from the music scene in Mexico among the audience , some connoisseurs of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , and some others that were there out of pure curiosity , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he added .
In Mexico , Bowie has been a marked influence on several generations of artists , including musicians , theater directors , designers , photographers and visual artists like Javier Pulido
Ã¢â¬ÅMonster
TruckÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , who in 2014 presented the exhibition Ã¢â¬ÅCosmo EpiphanyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ at the University Museum of Contemporary Art
( Muac ) in Mexico City , inspired by the career of the British composer and musician .
The exhibition , which brought together 30 pieces including installation , video and a collection of two - dimensional pieces , was based on Diamond Dogs , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s studio album inspired by George OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel 1984 .
In the field of music , Bowie was also a creative inspiration for Mexican musicians such as singer Julieta Venegas , rock band ZoÃ Â© and jazz fusion group Troker .
In recent weeks , Troker , a band who has performed twice at the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Glastonbury Festival , recorded a version of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final single , Blackstar .
Ã¢â¬ÅHis music level was always trend setting , very few artists can enjoy such a thing .
He had a great style , even to say goodbye , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Christian JimÃ Â© nez , TrokerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pianist .
Bowie only played in Mexico once , but his fanbase remains loyal .
A remastered version of Bowie and Brian EnoÃ¢â¬
â¢ s 1977 hit Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ ranks second on SpotifyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s list of MexicoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 50 Most Viral .
The list also includes other songs of the British artist , such as Space Oddity , The Man Who Sold the World and his epitaph , Lazarus , the first single from his latest album , Blackstar , released just two days before he died from cancer last month .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat happens with Bowie , that does not happen with other musicians and artists , is that his work is transverse and transgenerational , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Uriel Waizel , head of music content of Ibero 90.0 FM , one of the most important music stations in Mexico City .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe knew how to change between ages , genres , art movements .
And that is what kept him strong .
His work and music was always of great taste : refined and edgy .
There are few factors that could make him undesirable : few would dare to assert that they do not like Bowie or that they can not find a point of connection with his work , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ concluded Waizel ."
2016-02-26,"The first vignette from InstagramÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
new miniseries Unbound , featuring music from David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
final album Blackstar , is as enigmatic as youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d expect from such a project .
Before his death the British singer provided film - makers with unmediated access to the music and images from the album , with Ã¢â¬Åno limits or preconditionsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The 15-second clip features a group of people sitting in a dimly lit library .
One woman spins a globe with a glass of red wine in her hands , another distractedly works on a piece of embroidery .
The others chat and share books , with the exception of a figure in the corner who looks on in silence and whose back faces the camera .
The keen eyed will spot a book on the table bearing a large , black star on the cover in reference to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 28th album .
Haunting strains of
the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
titular opener plays over the looped video , or possibly from an old - timey radio that is in shot .
Within the first hour of posting , the clip collected more than 300 likes .
However , several users expressed confusion and frustration over the clipÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brevity and seemed unaware that Instagram limits videos to 15 seconds .
The 16-part series was written by Carolynn Cecilia and directed by Nikki Borges for InstaMiniSeries , an account publishing episodic clips , and was created exclusively for Instagram .
New episodes of Unbound will be released every Monday , Tuesday , Thursday and Friday .
Among the series cast are the Rookie Mag editor - in - chief , Tavi Gevinson , as the protagonist , the American actor Patricia Clarkson ( The Green Mile , Far From Heaven , Dogville ) as a lounge singer , and Borges as Ã¢â¬Åwoman in a red dressÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
According to a press release on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s site , the series features Ã¢â¬Åevocative images inspired by the moods suggested in the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , lyrics and artworkÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ rather than a Ã¢â¬Åliteral , linear narrativeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Borges said Bowie had always been about Ã¢â¬Åreinvention over repetitionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and that Ã¢â¬Åhis innovations have influenced our own work as we transform a social media platform into a creative outletÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2016-02-26,"A major exhibition exploring the multiple revolutions of the late 1960s Ã¢â¬ â from flower power and music to wide - reaching social , cultural and intellectual changes Ã¢â¬ â is to open at the V&amp;A museum in London .
More than 200 LPs from the collection of the late Radio 1 DJ John Peel will be displayed in the show , which opens in the autumn and will be run by the team behind the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s blockbusting David Bowie show .
They are reuniting to explore the fabulous music , the avant - garde films , the drugs , the miniskirts , the flares , the hair , the nudity , the sex , the riots , the humour , the absolute refusal to dress anything like your mum or dad .
And then the downhill aftermath with the arrival of the 70s .
Co - curator Victoria Broackes said PeelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record collection would Ã¢â¬Åform the spine of the exhibitionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ when it opens in the autumn .
Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s because the show explores a period where society and music went hand in hand ; music was a vital form of communication amongst young people and music will be integral to the exhibition , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½

The albums include songs the pioneering Peel would have played while presenting his late - night pirate radio show The Perfumed Garden on Radio London in 1967 .

Broackes said the exhibition was more than a Ã¢â¬Åa trip down memory laneÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and would consider the effect of the years , good or bad , on our lives today .
Co - curator Geoffrey Marsh , director of the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theatre and performance department , agreed .

Other highlights include a moon rock on loan from Nasa and the space suit worn on the Apollo 8 mission by William Anders , the man who took the Earthrise photograph in 1968 .
The show will explore the periodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s momentous legal changes .
In 1967 alone , homosexuality was decriminalised , an unmarried woman could finally be prescribed the pill and abortion was legalised .
In 1968 , theatre censorship ended , which led , the following day , to the opening of Hair .

2016-02-29,"The late David Bowie has been remembered during this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s In Memoriam section of the Oscars .
Bowie , who died in January at the age of 69 , appeared on the big screen in films such as The Man
Who Fell to Earth and Labyrinth .
Bowie was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best original song for his theme from Cat People .
He was recognised by the Academy in a tribute that also remembered Wes Craven , Alan Rickman and Omar Sharif .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s big screen career began with a number of small roles but was truly kicked off with the lead in Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
The Man Who Fell to Earth .
His notable roles also included Tony ScottÃ¢â¬ â¢ s romantic horror
The Hunger , cult fantasy Labyrinth and Martin ScorseseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s controversial drama
The Last Temptation of Christ .
His life and work has also been remembered at both the Grammys and this weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Brit awards , where the singer Lorde performed an emotional tribute .
Bowie died in January , 18 months after he was diagnosed with cancer .

The concert , called David Bowie : Nothing Has Changed , will also star iOTA , Deborah Conway and Jack Ladder , with each performer choosing which Bowie songs they will cover .
Singer - songwriter iOTA said the British musician had Ã¢â¬Åamazing depthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and never disappointed .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe came to the end of an amazing life with a lot of class and integrity .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s taught other artists how to be in the world and how to do it right.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The show will cover a 30-song set list , which creative director Amanda Pelman said will include some of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more obscure numbers , alongside hits Changes , China Girl , Life on Mars , Under Pressure , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance and Starman .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe most important thing to me was how BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s canon would be portrayed with real integrity and nuance by the orchestra and artists with a sympathetic voice to the work , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Pelman , who worked as a casting agent on the musical adaptation of Academy Award - winning film Priscilla Queen of the Desert .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt would be foolish to suggest we can represent the whole of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s canon ; the 30 songs are both the highest - selling songs and some of the most quirky performances.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie died in January , 18 months after he was diagnosed with cancer .
An outpouring of grief followed , along with tribute concerts and performances around the world .
He was remembered at the recent Grammys with a tribute by Lady Gaga , and at last weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Brit awards when New Zealand singer - songwriter Lorde covered Life on Mars .

2016-03-17,"The Independent , Mirror and both of Richard DemondÃ¢â¬ â¢ s titles , the Express and Daily Star , suffered sharp falls in daily traffic in February , as most of the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s press saw declines in online visitors .
The decline follows a surge in digital readership between December Ã¢â¬ â traditionally a weak month due to holidays Ã¢â¬ â and January during which coverage of the deaths of David Bowie and Alan Rickman will have attracted international readers .
Only the Sun , which dropped its paywall at the end of November , and the Guardian recorded increases in daily average visitors during the month , according to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures published on Thursday .
All the major national newspaper sites experienced year - on - year growth except Mail Online , which was down slightly by 2.2 % but is still by far the largest site with an average of 14.4 m unique browsers a day .
The IndependentÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fall in average unique readers will be especially concerning as the paper is moving to a digital only future when it scraps its print editions this month .
On Wednesday the independent launched a new subscription app costing ÃÂ£12.99 .
Meanwhile the picture in print remains bleak , with the vast majority of paid - for national newspapers recording declines , led by the Sun on Sunday whose circulation fell by just over 5 % .
The Daily Star and Daily Express , which have cut prices aggressively since last year , recorded small increases in sales , as did the Daily Telegraph , though the latterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s increase can be attributed to a rise in multiple copy sales known as bulks .
The free Evening Standard and Metro also recorded small increases in circulation .

2016-03-17,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record producer Tony Visconti painted an apocalyptic portrait of todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music industry in his keynote speech at South by Southwest on Thursday .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get any worse , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti said after reading out a half - hour short story set 10 years in the future , in which there was only one worldwide record label which had entirely stopped signing artists as they were too expensive and troublesome .
Instead , records were made by compliant , malleable pop stars and sold through the lottery .
In a rambling speech , Visconti said that todayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record labels were simply repeating the formulae of the past , with diminishing returns .
He described mainstream pop , aimed at a teenage audience , as Ã¢â¬Åa computer and a vocal that was doctored to goodness knows how muchÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
On the other hand , he said , there are songwriters like Sun Kil Moon , Ã¢â¬Åwho just wrenches you and will tear your heart out Ã¢â¬
â
thatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s an album
I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t listen to without tears falling and my dear friend David Bowie turned me on to that album.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The producer said that record labels need to reacquaint themselves with the notion that they are selling culture , and discover artists of the calibre of Jimi Hendrix or Joni Mitchell .
Fans , he said , Ã¢â¬Åused to put a vinyl record on a turntableÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and play it hundreds of times .
Ã¢â¬ÅNone of that goes on today .
There are great people all around us Ã¢â¬ â the next David Bowie lives somewhere in the world , the next Beatles , the next Springsteen but theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not getting a shot , theyÃ¢â¬
â¢ re not being financed.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Streams on Spotify , he added ,
donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t pay artists a living wage but rather the price of Ã¢â¬Åa
nice steak dinnerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Visconti was sceptical about artists self - releasing their music , saying that the vast amount of music being uploaded on to YouTube , for instance , was Ã¢â¬Åclogging the arteriesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the music business as it was unmediated and unfocused .
He said that the decline of record sales , while the world population climbs , was due to the poor quality of modern pop music .
Ã¢â¬ÅBack in the 70s Fleetwood MacÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Rumours sold between 14 and 16 m .
Since then the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s population has nearly doubled to close to 8bn and last year Taylor Swift sold 12 m .
With the population doubling how come we canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sell records ?
The record labels now are not giving you quality , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re disenchanted , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t buy records.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
However , most commentators attribute the decline in record sales to the fact that music is so easily acquired for free on the internet .
In another familiar bugbear , Visconti also took aim at TV talent shows , saying that they gave the impression Ã¢â¬Åthat becoming a big star is just luck .
They think get a great hairdo and makeup and everythingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be hunky dory Ã¢â¬ â until next week.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Visconti concluded that the music industry needed to be more adventurous when looking for new artists .
Ã¢â¬ÅLook at those freaks out there , the really weird ones , because thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what the public wants to hear ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
He added that labels need to spend time nurturing talent , citing the example of Kate Bush , who was developed over several years by EMI before she released her first single .
Visconti also shared his memories of the music scene of the 60s and 70s , including his early work with David Bowie .
He remembered their first meeting , and being startled by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eyes which appeared to be different coloured .
Ã¢â¬ÅI wondered , which eye do I look in?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The producer concluded that he had had a charmed life , Ã¢â¬Åbut I worked my butt offÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ."
2016-03-17,"Cliff Michelmore , one of the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best - known television presenters over the course of the 1950s and 1960s , has died at the age of 96 .
A nightly presence on television screens in the era of two channels , Michelmore was best known for fronting the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ground - breaking current affairs programme , Tonight , which included the first television appearance of David Bowie , aged 17 , in 1964 .
He presented the programme from 1957 to 1965 , before working on the series 24 Hours .
His work included hosting the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s coverage of the Apollo moon landings and general election results programmes , the popular
So You Think specials and presenting Family Favourites on BBC radio with his wife Jean Metcalfe .
Born in Cowes , Isle of Wight in 1919 , he served in the RAF during the second world war and began a broadcasting career with the British Forces Network in Germany in 1947 .
His later work included hosting the travel programme , Holiday , as well as Sunday religious broadcasts , nostalgia programmes and work for ITV .
Michelmore stepped down in 2003 but made a brief return to BBC television at the age of 87 to contribute to an evening marking the 40th anniversary of the 1967 sterling devaluation crisis .
Antony Jay , who was a trainee when Tonight was first broadcast on 18 February 1957 , wrote in the Guardian in 2009 that Michelmore was the first TV celebrity who came across as Ã¢â¬Åone of usÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe rapidly became a national figure , but he was much more than a television celebrity , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Jay recalled .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was no pretence , no feeling of Ã¢â¬ÅperformanceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ about him , in spite of the consummate professional and technical skill he brought to the programme .
He was just Cliff , take him or leave him .
And of course the audience took him , in their millions.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-03-21,"Spoiler alert :
this recap assumes youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve seen episode six of Vinyl on HBO or Sky Atlantic .
DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t read on if you havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
Ã¢â¬ËDoes surrounding yourself with idiots make you feel superior ?
How will you break new ground if this is who executes your vision?Ã¢â¬ â¢
It probably stands to reason that imaginary friends always get the best lines .
Last year Christian Slater owned pretty much everybody else on television in Mr Robot , and here , Richie FinestraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hallucination of dead partner - in - crime Ernst steals the whole series so far .
For sure , a character so acerbically hilarious could probably never exist , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s palpable just how much fun the writers have had in bringing him to Ã¢â¬ÅlifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Certainly itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a neat device to illustrate what a nightmare Richie has descended into : as good as he is , another hour of a sweaty Bobby Cannavale charging round shouting at people would be tiresome .
This way we get the same , but with an enigmatic German on his shoulder speaking his most unpleasant thoughts .
With Devon gone and the cops seemingly closing in , Richie returns to work and sets about trashing everything around him .
The realisation that Ernst isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t real and RichieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s doing all this stuff alone makes it all the more brutal ; slurring in front of his kids , bailing on a meeting for a doomed hook - up with the secretary , making a scene outside MaxÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Kansas City in front of Andy Warhol , bullying his artists , achieving little more each day than glugging and snorting .
And nobody ( well almost nobody ) is doing anything to stop him .
WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also better this week is
that RichieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s antics are leading somewhere ; thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more movement to the plot and depth to the relationships .
Holed up in the Chelsea Hotel with Ingrid ( Birgitte Hjort SÃÂ¸rensen , showing some real warmth in a show that tends to lack it ) , Devon makes heavy weather of her lot in life ( Ã¢â¬ÅDay after day in that house , I hear this creaking back and forth .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the sound of me hanging myself from the rafters.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ )
But her friend counsels that Richie is a good man , revealing of her own husband , Ã¢â¬ÅErnst could be so merciless .
Richie softened him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Encouraged by memories of happier times , Devon does resolve to try again , returning home , only for RichieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bungled apology to reveal that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so out of it
he thinks heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been hanging out with Ernst .
With Devon furtively taking the kids and fleeing , Richie is schooled in what rock bottom feels like , and the sting comes via flashback .
Ernst was killed in a car accident in Coney Island with a wasted Richie at the wheel .
No wonder all the talk of hot dogs was playing on his mind .
Ã¢â¬ËI canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be the first person to say it to your face Ã¢â¬ â the logo looks like a toiletÃ¢â¬ â¢ Out of all the relationships , Richie sets fire to this week , perhaps the most compelling is that with Zak , as Ray Romano finally gets to do some proper acting .
Turning up six hours late and high as a kite for ZakÃ¢â¬ â¢ s daughterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bat Mitzvah , Richie still finds a way to make it all about him , playing unwelcome camaraderie to his Ã¢â¬ÅbrotherÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with his grand vision for Alibi Records , and Zack just flips .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a powerful scene , set amid a swanky ceremony that this near - bankrupt man can ill afford .
For a show so steeped in excess , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s effective to witness the boring , domestic consequences of RichieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s selfishness .
It feels well - earned when Zak snaps , punches Richie out with a despairing cry of Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a record man!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
We also see more of ZackÃ¢â¬ â¢ s predicament than ever Ã¢â¬ â an old - schooler without RichieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s instinct in a changing world that he can not understand .
Like most of the staff , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s blindsided by AndreaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s forward - facing vision for the company .
All those records sold and not one of the staff realised their logo looked like a toilet .
VinylÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at its strongest when it makes the most of its setting , weaker when doing the generic anti - hero stuff and little else .
This episode , Cyclone , made the most of both .
Fact and fiction
There must have been high - up meetings at HBO about the David Bowie cameo .
Filming completed months ago , and you could make a case that it would have been disrespectful to cut that sequence .
But for me , the sight of Noah Bean goofing up the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s standard impersonation - of - a - rock - star thing felt a bit awkwardly too soon .
Incidentally , Todd HaynesÃ¢â¬ â¢ 1998 glam - rock tribute Velvet Goldmine came about because Bowie refused the director permission to make a straightforward biopic , leading the director to make the far more interesting fantasy retelling of his story .
Meanwhile , the photographer Devon poses nude for in an attempt to rediscover her artistic calling was based on George Segal .

2016-03-21,"Lambeth council is to protect the David Bowie mural in Brixton , south London , that became a shrine after the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death in January .
The mural , on the side of Morleys department store on Tunstall Road , has drawn thousands of fans who have left tributes and flowers to the Brixton - born singer .
Lambeth council announced that a local listing would protect the mural and that it was considering renaming the area after being Ã¢â¬Åoverwhelmed by the outpouring of affectionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The council is also in talks with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family about suggestions for a permanent memorial , including statues and place naming .
Lib Peck , the council leader , said in a statement : Ã¢â¬ÅIt is ultimately the familyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s decision as to what may be appropriate .
We must respect that and be patient .
Lambeth residents have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of affection visibly demonstrated by floral tributes , messages and people visiting the Bowie mural to pay their respects to this unique Brixton boy.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Peck added that the council was in contact with the Bowie fan club and other Brixton organisations Ã¢â¬Åwho want to honour the memory and legacy of this extraordinary artist.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The councilÃ¢â¬ â¢ s street - cleaning team has been working to maintain the floral tributes at the site , but remaining flowers will be removed next week .
Photographs of the mural , posters and tributes commissioned by the council will be mounted and given to Morleys , the O2 , Pop Brixton and other organisations that wish to display them .
Morleys will keep messages on the brick wall while non - perishable items such as drawings and cards will be stored in the council archives .
Bowie died in January aged 69 following an 18-month battle with cancer .
Hundreds of fans converged in Brixton after his death to pay tribute his career .
Groups sang along to guitars at various locations , including the Ritzy Cinema , which had Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie : Our Brixton Boy .
RIPÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ written in the lettering above its entrance .
Last week , the Australian artist who created the Brixton mural in 2013 , Jimmy C , said he chose the area after researching BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not much street art out here , not compared to east London where I normally paint .
I found the wall and got the go - ahead from Morleys , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told Brixton Bugle newspaper .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople naturally started coming here , so that was amazing .
By the end of the day there were thousands of people here.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie was honoured at the Brit awards last month , when singer Lorde and the backing band that worked with Bowie on his final two tours performed a moving rendition of Life on Mars .
The performance received thanks from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son Duncan Jones , who tweeted that it was Ã¢â¬Åjust ...
beautifulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie was also honoured at the Baftas and the Grammys , where Lady Gaga performed a medley of his hits , backed by a band led by Nile Rodgers .
Bowie fans will be able to buy a rare re - release of The Man

2016-03-22,"David Bowie believed the young New Zealand singer Lorde was Ã¢â¬Åthe future of musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , his longtime pianist Mike Garson has said .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid really liked Lorde , and he felt like she was the future of music , and they had a few wonderful moments together , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Garson told fans during a Periscope Q&amp;A. Garson was explaining how Lorde came to be selected to perform the acclaimed tribute to Bowie at this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Brit awards .
Ã¢â¬ÅShe was the perfect choice , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅSome of DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family members and DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s management had some suggestions
sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ d be the right one .
They wanted to bring the next generation in.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The pair rehearsed in London and New York before the performance , in which Lorde performed Life on Mars with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backing band .
The performance met with the approval of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son , Duncan Jones , who tweeted afterwards that the tribute was Ã¢â¬Åjust Ã¢â¬ Â¦ beautiful .
Thank you.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Garson said of LordeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s performance : Ã¢â¬ÅIt was an amazing , momentous experience , and she really did justice to him .
She was so nervous .
She actually said if she didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sing the song to David , she couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have gotten through it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-03-28,"My friend Maria McCormack , who has died of pneumonia aged 61 , spent much of her life as a dedicated companion of rock musicians .
Her outgoing character and hedonistic lifestyle led her to befriend musicians such as Wilko Johnson ( Dr Feelgood ) , Phil Lynott ( Thin Lizzy ) , Lemmy ( Motorhead ) and Glen Matlock ( Sex Pistols ) as well as the painter Edward Bell , who was known for his David Bowie album covers .
In the early 1970s in London , at the Speakeasy and the newly opened Dingwalls Dancehall , Maria Ã¢â¬ â frequently in cahoots with her brother Michael Ã¢â¬ â got to know many key figures from the worlds of music and the underground press , including the publisher , poet and philanthropist Felix Dennis .
Felix was quick to spot the commercial potential of Kung Fu , and Maria joined him in late - night drives around London , selling his new Bruce Lee magazine to people in cinema queues .
At one point she was simultaneously working as a librarian in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and as a dancer at the Windmill Theatre in Soho .
She also played bass in an all - female rock band , Sleek .
Her fellow dancer and Sleek founder , Voyna Crofts , once said of Maria : Ã¢â¬ÅShe was so lovely , talented and gorgeous , she could do anything she wanted.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Maria was born in Sydney in Australia , where her parents , John , a Geordie career soldier , and Sarah ( nee Hone ) , a housewife from Northern Ireland , had emigrated from the UK .
The family soon returned home and Maria spent most of her early years in Newcastle , County Down , where , as a natural tomboy , she happily wandered the Mourne Mountains .
When the Troubles began to take hold in Northern Ireland ( her uncle was John Hume , leader of the SDLP ) , the family moved to England , settling in Wembley in north - west London .
After attending Sacred Heart school in Wealdstone , Maria worked in town planning , but by 1973 the lure of music and musicians had proved irresistible .
Spinal TapÃ¢â¬
â¢ s dictum of Ã¢â¬Åhave a good time , all the timeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ certainly applied to Maria , and over the next decade she immersed herself in the world of rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll .
By 1987 , however , she had met John Perry , guitarist in the band the Only Ones , and they became long - term partners .
Having met John , Maria went into higher education and gained a degree in social sciences from Royal Holloway and Bedford New College , University of London ( now Royal Holloway , London ) .
She then became a medical secretary at St Charles hospital in Ladbroke Grove , west London .
In recent years , however , the after - effects of her earlier wild lifestyle , coupled with undiagnosed coeliac disease , meant that Maria was unwell for much of the time , and dependent on JohnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s steadfast support .
On the rare occasions she could be persuaded out she was still
good company Ã¢â¬ â entertaining , generous and kind - hearted .
She is survived by John and by her three brothers , Gerard , John and Michael ."
2016-04-04,"Power ballads , thunderous stadium rock , swaggering R&amp;B , a tribute to fallen musical heroes like David Bowie , a ZZ Top cover , and even an appearance by rebranded country singer Kiefer Sutherland .
The three - hour show may have been billed as the Academy of Country Music awards , but its programming was obviously much broader than that .
SundayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s live telecast was , tellingly , broadcast from Las Vegas , the capital of illusion .
The location fit this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ACMs , which treated the actual awards as afterthoughts to the main event : the promotion of modern country stars , particularly predominantly male , white newbies who didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t perform anything closely resembling country music .
More on that later .
The awards , if they did matter , belonged to Chris Stapleton , the brooding and bearded Nashville outsider who last year came to represent a supposed turning point at country radio , which had largely been spinning its wheels with Ã¢â¬Åbro countryÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ : that is
, muscle hunks in baseball caps who deliver party songs about drinking beer on the beach .
That may be an overstatement , but as Dierks Bentley sang Sunday : Ã¢â¬ÅGot a new girl , she got it going on / we drink all day , and
party all night.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
So it was telling that two of the genreÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest stars , Bentley and Luke Bryan , opened the show with a comedy bit in which they , and other stars like Carrie Underwood , claimed they were responsible for StapletonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s success .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was a fan of him before he had the beard , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Jason Aldean .
Stapleton ended up good on that promise , winning four awards including album and song of the year .
The adulation got so heavy that , in accepting the award for vocal group of the year , Little Big TownÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kimberly Schlapman thanked Stapleton for not being a vocal group .
Of the 13 awards , only seven made the actual show , with the rest announced as early as last week .
The real spotlight was on the performances , the last of which was StapletonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Fire Away , a haunting country ballad that featured the singer harmonizing with his wife , Morgane .
That was the most country moment in a night filled largely with male performers Ã¢â¬ â a reflection of current country radio playlists from which women have been shrinking in recent years , leading many female artists to charge programmers with sexism .
Indeed , among the few women who did perform Ã¢â¬ â newcomers Cam and Kelsea Ballerini along with Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert Ã¢â¬
â two were matched with male counterparts : Ballerini with Nick Jonas and , in a performance of ZZ TopÃ¢â¬ â¢
s Tush , Lambert with Keith Urban and guitarist Billy Gibbons .
The performance of the latter concentrated on requisite guitar shredding between Urban and Gibbons , leaving Lambert , one of country musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fiercest voices , with not much to do .
Strangely , the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s homogeny became even more evident when Tim McGraw performed the ballad Humble and Kind , a recent single connected to an online movement promoting global harmony .
While in the middle of the MGM Grand Garden Arena , McGraw was surrounded by a multi - ethnic , multi - racial cast of people whose presence inevitably reminded the viewer of how singly uniform this industry remains .
Then there was what the ACMs promoted as a Ã¢â¬Åonce in a lifetimeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ event : the pairing of legend Dolly Parton with pop star Katy Perry .
Who ordered this mismatch ?
Wearing a sparkly cowgirl outfit , Perry introduced Parton , who received the Tex Ritter award for a recent television biopic of her life .
Despite recent albums by Loretta Lynn , Willie Nelson and others , she was the only veteran invited to this party .
The duo rushed through a medley of PartonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Coat of Many Colors , Jolene and 9 to 5 near the end of the night , with Parton ad - libbing quips between lyrics .
The three hours closed with the ACMsÃ¢â¬ â¢ highest honor : entertainer of the year .
Presenting was British actor Tom Hiddleston , who portrays Hank Williams in a new biopic .
Before naming its recipient , he said the award would go to a singer who would be Ã¢â¬Åfollowing in Hank WilliamsÃ¢â¬ â¢ footstepsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Then he called Jason Aldean to the stage .
Earlier in the night Aldean sang Lights Come On , a pounding electro - rock anthem with lyrics such as : Ã¢â¬ÅYeah , the drink that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re drinking , the smoke that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re smoking /
The party we throw , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going all night
long.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅAs an Englishman and as an actor , I feel very much like a guest at this party , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hiddleston said earlier .
Well , at least he has an excuse ."
2016-04-21,"PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death appeared to confirm what many people have been saying : 2016 is proving to be annus horribilis for celebrities .
The year was not even a fortnight old when the news that shocked the world broke : David Bowie had died from cancer at the age of 69 in New York City .
Almost no one had known Bowie was ill Ã¢â¬
â
he had gone to great lengths to conceal the fact from even close friends .
The musician Ã¢â¬Ådied peacefully , surrounded by his familyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ after an 18-month battle with cancer .
His death came just three days after the release of Blackstar on his 69th birthday as a parting gift to his millions of fans .
Alan RickmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
death Ã¢â¬ â coming just four days after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ â upset the young and old alike .
After his first big film role in Die Hard in 1988 , the British actor won a new generation of fans with his portrayal of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films .
He suffered a stroke last August , but again decided to keep his health a private matter .
Like Bowie , he died at the age of 69 from pancreatic cancer .
As well as Bowie and Rickman , January also brought with it the death of British television and radio personality Sir Terry Wogan on the very last day of the month .
He died after a short illness at the age of 77 .
A hint came last November , when he pulled out of hosting BBC1Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Children in Need appeal for the first time in its 35-year history due to poor health .
As well as serving up acerbic commentary for the Eurovision song contest , Wogan presented the Radio 2 breakfast show for 12 years from 1972 and again from 1993 until 2009 .
Exactly two months later , another star closely associated with the BBC Ã¢â¬ â comedian Ronnie Corbett Ã¢â¬ â died aged 85 in hospital in south London , surrounded by his family .
His double act with Ronnie Barker made the pair some of the most successful entertainers of the 1970s and 80s .
CorbettÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death came a few days after the death of an international football superstar Ã¢â¬ â Johan Cruyff .
The Dutch maestro , famed for a piece of skill named in his honour , the Cruyff Turn , died aged 68 of cancer at his home in Barcelona .
And on the day before Prince added his name to this list , the British comedian actor and writer Victoria Wood died of cancer at home with her family .
She was 62 and also had not made public the state of her health .
The tally of deaths is significant , and 2016 is not yet four months old .
The Guardian has given over the front page of its print edition to all of these public figures Ã¢â¬ â except Cruyff , to whom the Sports section dedicated its front page .
The GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s obituaries page , according to its editor , is no longer able to fit in all the public figures who would have historically figured on the page because of the rise in high - profile deaths .
The nature of fame and celebrity has changed radically in the past decade , with the rise in internet use and mobile devices such as smartphones , along with the plethora of television channels available .
As well as actors , musicians , royalty , sporting figures , politicians and the like , there are now hundreds of reality TV stars , comedians , game show hosts , mavericks and people famous simply for being famous .
That means there are far more celebrities whom more people will have heard of when their number is up ."
2016-04-22,"In the late 70s and throughout the 80s , the yearly advent of a new Prince album brought with it a visual image as strong and defining as the music contained within .
Ã¢â¬ÅI wear what I want because I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really like clothes , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he lied once , in a rare interview .
Like David Bowie , Prince toyed with the ideas of the Ã¢â¬ÅotherÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ :
the feminine , the alien , the raceless .
Through costume and artwork , he created the Prince that became iconic : the wistful flÃÂ¢neur with Egyptian - style eyeliner .
Part Pierrot , part Little Richard and part doe - eyed Bambi .
Taken in isolation , each element of his style was one thing , but combined with the music , they spun a web of mystery , a crescendo of coded whispers about gender , sexuality and visual identity .
In 2016 Ã¢â¬ â when the most talked - about label in fashion , Vetements , is a gender - neutral one and where the likes of Gucci and Tom Ford have combined men and womenÃ¢â¬ â¢
s shows Ã¢â¬
â PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Ågrey areaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ style was pioneering .
It all began in 1979 on the cover of his second album .
Here the fledgling Prince appeared shirtless , a halo of Farrah Fawcett waves .
On the back of the LP , his intentions to kick against rock and soul conventions were clear : there he was , sans clothes , riding atop a winged white horse : a Dionysian nymph full of sexual intent .
But that was a subtle , soft - focus opening shot compared to what was to come .
1980Ã¢â¬
â¢ s Dirty Mind remained his most extreme look ( until , of course , the backless pants ) ; a Mac , bikini briefs and a neckerchief .
The sexually open content of the lyrics was mirrored by his look , which riffed on the teddy boy revival but added the spectre of the flasher in the local park .
On stage , he would augment the look with thigh - high stockings , a fact not appreciated by Rolling Stones fans who booed him off stage when he opened for the band on tour .
By 1984Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Purple Rain ( and under the guidance of costume designer Marie France ) , he had perfected his iconic look : frilly shirts that were the cousin of Princess DiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pie - crust shirts , stack - heeled platform boots and his hair tightly wound into a rapturous bouffant of dancing curls .
It was dandyish but it also nodded to the military jackets of Jimi Hendrix and the psychedelia of Sgt Pepper .
This European romantic look cut through his band , the Revolution , but also his associates , such as Sheila E and the Family .
Musically , he was generous with his talent and his proteges were many .
He liked doubles , multiples of himself and these proteges sartorially mirrored his stylistic changes : silk camisoles for Vanity 6 , zoot suits for the Time .
On his 1988 Lovesexy tour , his polka - dot suits were colour matched by the complementary bodycon outfits of dancer Cat and Sheila E , which were proto - Henry Holland .
As one of the biggest pop stars in the world , Prince brought a new conversation about gender to fashion .
He wore high heels and lace gloves , making the world think about how a man or a woman should dress , pushing the boundaries of taste and acceptability .
As singer Frank Ocean highlighted in his tribute : Ã¢â¬ÅHe made me feel comfortable with how I identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for the archaic idea of gender conformity.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A noted influence on Donatella Versace , Tommy Hilfiger and Matthew Williamson , Prince also directly and indirectly influenced the look of Blood OrangeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dev Hynes , DÃ¢â¬ â¢ Angelo and Justin Bieber .
Prince ignited the conversation about gender that we are still having today ."
2016-04-26,"David Bowie was a huge fan of the BBCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1920s gangster drama Peaky Blinders , even going as far as to send a picture of himself in the razor - bladed caps that give the show its name to star Cillian Murphy , according to its creator Steven Knight .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe sent a photo of himself with razor blades in his cap to Cillian about a year ago , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Steven Knight told the Radio Times .
Ã¢â¬ÅI got in touch with his people who came back straight away and said he was a big , big fan.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Knight added that Bowie , who died in January , also sent a representative from his label , Sony BMG , to provide an early hearing of the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last album Blackstar a week before its existence was made public .
He said : Ã¢â¬ÅAnd then on the following Tuesday we heard that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d passed away .
It seems that his people were keen to establish that we could use it before he died.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Knight said Bowie was merely the most prestigious among a roster of stars who have expressed their admiration for the show , including actors Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise , and director Michael Mann .
As evidence of its appeal to the great and good , the Radio Times has assembled a list of quotes praising Peaky Blinders , some of which may come as more of a surprise than others .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
JosÃ Â© Mourhino (
Ã¢â¬Åfascinating to see Birmingham all those years agoÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and Snoop Dogg ( Ã¢â¬Åthe hats are wickedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) but thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also Tom Hardy ( Ã¢â¬ÅI love Peaky BlindersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
Given Hardy appeared in season two and is set to reprise his role as Jewish mobster Alfie Solomons in season three , one might have expected the producers to take his public support for granted ."
2016-04-28,"Hailing from a tiny town in Louisiana , Kyle Craft isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the most obvious character to reinvent himself as a silver - haired glam desperado , but inspiration struck after he found a David Bowie album in K - Mart .

2016-04-28,"Hopes are stubbornly high for Ricky GervaisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s decision to revive The Office and David Brent in the cinema later in the year , a creation for which he will always have hall - of - fame status Ã¢â¬ â and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s incidentally impossible to remember his appearance with David Bowie in Extras with anything other than awe .
But thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s frankly little in the way of comedy gold to be mined from GervaisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest venture , which he has written and directed .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a mainstream bromantic comedy of medium - budget blandness produced specially for Netflix , and based on the 2009 French film EnvoyÃ
Â© s
TrÃÂ¨s SpÃ Â© ciaux .
The film gives us some satiric hints of Wag the Dog and Tropic Thunder Ã¢â¬ â with a slight touch of the leaden and widely forgotten buddy movie Hollywood Homicide with Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford .
Special Correspondents shows that Gervais has a plausible Hollywood career , but thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a baffling lack of real laughs and performance chemistry between the leads , and very little of the acid characterisation and cynical discomfort which is vital to his screen presence .
These have been brutally minimised by commercial and generic considerations ; itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all gooey oyster and no grit , and the romcom element is cumbersome .
Eric Bana ( who started in comedy ) plays Frank Bonneville , a radio journalist in New York : heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a conceited womaniser and blowhard , professionally teamed up with a nerdy little sound engineer and action - figure enthusiast Ã¢â¬ â played by Gervais Ã¢â¬ â called Ian Finch , perhaps in homage to Finchy from The Office .
Poor , sad Ian is improbably married to Eleanor , a glamorous media - wannabe who hates him ; she is played by Vera Farmiga , who does her considerable best with the big diva notes her character is required to hit later on .
Wolfish Frank has eyes for Eleanor of course , but meanwhile , the sweet , good - natured fellow journalist Claire ( a thankless role for Kelly Macdonald ) has a bit of a crush on Ian .
Frank and Ian get their big break when they are sent to Ecuador to cover a revolution , but farcical events mean they never get there .
Instead they secretly hole up in New York in a room above a cafe owned by a friendly South American couple ( played by America Ferrara and RaÃÂºl Castillo ) , where they realise they can fake their reports over a cellphone using background sound effects of jungle creatures , helicopters , gunfire , etc created digitally by Finch .
And it all goes swimmingly until they have to fake their own kidnap and their sensationally popular bogus reports start affecting US government policy and the Ecuadorian revolution itself .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a decent premise , and the story hangs together , just about , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not until about 20 minutes in that we get a real gag , concerning the spelling of the word suicide , and the film suffers from the romcom disease of being very light on the com .
It should be said , however , there is a very nice line about the experimental jazz that Frank and Ian are dismayed to hear coming from a certain bar .
Gervais has a worrying habit of giving his characters dialogue intended to tell the audience what they are supposed to think .
Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re an arrogant , selfish hack who survives because everyone thinks theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a local celebrity , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
FrankÃ¢â¬ â¢ s boss tells him .
Ã¢â¬ÅI care about everything , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says
Ian , Ã¢â¬Åbut
nothing seems to happen to me , because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m boring.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Later he says : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a shitty wife Ã¢â¬ Â¦ although I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t really care ; I can see her for what she really
is.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Frank and Ian bicker and squabble and become friends , but you can see how Gervais would like to be playing both roles somehow
, they are Jekyll - and - Hyde versions of the same , transparent idiot , liable to come an obvious cropper at every turn .
Special Correspondents could have been played by anyone , written by anyone ; itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a very interesting vehicle for the distinctive one - off talent that is Gervais ."
2016-05-04,"It was one of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite records .
That may be as much of a recommendation as anyone needs , but BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fulsome appreciation of The Glory of the Human Voice , the deliciously ironic title for RCAÃ¢â¬ â¢ s release of Florence Foster JenkinsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recordings , is itself a wonderful distillation of the Florence phenomenon : Ã¢â¬ÅShe had and was blissfully unaware of , the worst set of pipes in the world of music
Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Be afraid , be very afraidÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢
d have to be very brave or very stupid to go against BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opinions .
Thankfully , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m both , and on the eve of Stephen FrearsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new film that celebrates her life , and her climactic 1944 performance at Carnegie Hall , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s time for a little perspective on the Florence story .
For a start , to make your public debut anywhere as a singer at the age of 76 is a terrifying prospect ; to do it at Carnegie Hall , New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s prestigious concert venue , requires astonishing reserves of self - confidence , and quite possibly , self - deception .
She might have been a truly terrible singer , but Florence Foster Jenkins was musically talented .
There , I said it .
As a child , she was touted as a piano prodigy , played her first public recital at the age of eight , and as Ã¢â¬ÅLittle Miss FosterÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ performed at the White House for President Rutherford B Hayes .
Her devotion to music led to her break from her family : her wealthy father refused to sanction further musical study , so she eloped with a much older man , who she married aged 17 or 18 .
The union was a disaster , not least because she contracted syphilis from her husband ( treatment for the disease would make her completely bald in later life ) .
As a newly single woman she supported herself by teaching piano but that career collapsed , however , after an arm injury meant she couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t play .
It was only through her mother , and then her fatherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inheritance after his death in 1909 , that Florence started her transformation into the grandiose grande dame of Manhattan society .
As St Clair Bayfield wrote ( Bayfield became her common - law husband and manager ) , the essence of the Florence Foster Jenkins story was that she never knew what her singing voice was really like .
Not because she couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t hear it , but because she lived as a legend in her own lifetime .
Her annual vocal recitals resounded in a gilded echo chamber of praise , approbation , and acclaim for the brilliance of the Verdi ClubÃ¢â¬ â¢ s president .
It would have been social suicide in the echelons of ManhattanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s high society for any mere member to risk criticism of their patroness Ã¢â¬ â and only a handful ever did .
After her recordings ( which have never been out of print ) appeared in the early 1940s , she would play her own performances of the Queen of the NightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Act 2 aria from MozartÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
The Magic Flute to her friends alongside versions by genuinely glorious divas Luisa Tetrazzini and Frieda Hempel .
Without saying which was which ( and my goodness , you really can tell the difference Ã¢â¬ Â¦ ) , she would ask her audience to write down which they preferred .
As Donald CollupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s documentary on Florence , A World of Her Own reveals , only one person is known to have demurred from the opinion that hers was the best , and this bravely honest person was promptly castigated by Florence for her lack of taste .
That Queen of the Night recording is the unimpeachable , incomparable classic of the Ã¢â¬ â alas
Ã¢â¬ â
very small Foster Jenkins discography , with her accompanist , the joyously monikered CosmÃ Â© McMoon .
But the notion that she couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sing a single note in tune or in time is wide of the mark .
True , most of her recordings are the right notes in the wrong place , but if you dare to listen to her other recordings , you will discover that Florence did have a very occasional relationship with musical accuracy , which of course only makes the effect of the whole more miraculously hilarious .
But make no mistake : being this bad is hard .
One of the reviews of the Carnegie Hall concert got it right .
Robert Bagar in the New York World Telegram wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅOf all the singers appearing before the public today , only Mme .
Jenkins has perfected the art of giving added zest to a written phrase by improvising it in quarter tones , either above or below the original notes .
Think of the difficulties involved in making this possibleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bagar was right .
You try it : those exquisite shadings of pitch and frissons of out - of - tune vibrato are perfectly designed to induce the greatest possible injury to the piece , and to your eardrums .
And they are almost impossible to replicate , because what makes them so magical in FlorenceÃ¢â¬
â¢ s performances is that you can hear that she is really trying for the right note , the right word , the right rhythm .
The truth of is , most of us are more like Florence than we are Tetrazzini , so perhaps we hear some echo of our common humanity in her vocal trials and tribulations .
But Florence had something else too : a sheer joy in her performances .
HereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bagar again : Ã¢â¬ÅShe was exceedingly happy in her work .
It is a pity that so few artists are , and the happiness was communicated , as if by magic to her hearersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Florence had a heart attack days after the Carnegie Hall recital Ã¢â¬ â perhaps induced by reading her reviews
Ã¢â¬ â
and she died a month later .
But that heroically misplaced happiness in her abilities still communicates today ; indelibly , appallingly , magnificently .
The Ã¢â¬Åworst set of pipes in the worldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ?
Perhaps not , after all Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Florence Foster Jenkins is on general UK release from Friday 6 May."
2016-05-05,"Record collectors and David Bowie fans Ã¢â¬ â we need you .
After spotting someone claiming that they left their Blackstar vinyl sleeve in sunlight for a few hours , unintentionally revealing a whole constellation of stars , we wondered whether you would help us test out their discovery ( follow the link for instructions ) .
Is it intentional design quirk aimed at giving fans something else to remember their hero by ?
Or is it a classic bit of internet attention seeking ?
Jonathan Barnbook , the sleeveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s designer , has previously said the cover referred to the idea of mortality and that the singer always wanted design to provoke discussion .
The plan seems to have worked .
If youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a Blackstar owner who would like to help us verify ( is this really the gift that keeps on giving ? ) or debunk the mysterious constellation by sending in your pictures , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d advise taking the vinyl out of itÃ¢â¬ â¢

2016-05-05,"Ã¢â¬ÅRock the ground , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ declares a red neon sign high above the Globe stage where the new artistic director , Emma Rice , makes her debut with a revival of one of ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best - known plays .
The Globe certainly rocks with laughter in an irreverent evening in which the jokes come fast and furious , and it may rock with shock at the way Rice mashes up the Elizabethan with the modern and ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s text with a touch of David Bowie , George Formby and some original songs from composer Stu Baker , a Kneehigh favourite .
No wonder the evening extends to almost three hours .
Rice , whose only previous encounter with Shakespeare was a production of Cymbeline for the Royal Shakespeare Company , makes no claims to be a Shakespeare specialist and has stated her belief that too often in this country ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plays are treated like a kind of cultural medicine that are supposed to do you good .
Towards the end she even inserts a tongue - in - cheek line alluding to British theatreÃ¢â¬ â¢ s obsession with text .
Purists may argue that she overfills the sugar spoon in her determination to make the medicine go down .
And the relentless jokiness does detract from the comic climax in which the rude mechanicals Ã¢â¬ â played as a gaggle of Globe stewards and cleaners , led by the redoubtable Rita Quince ( Lucy Thackeray ) , with Bankside Health and Safety officer , Nick Bottom ( Ewan Wardrop ) trying desperately and failing to be an alpha male in the all - female crew Ã¢â¬ â perform Pyramus and Thisbe .
It seems flat after the strenuous comedy that has come before .
RiceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most potentially contentious change , which sees Helena becoming Helenus , yearning desperately after Demetrius , who sees marriage to Hermia as the best way to secure his place in society , works beautifully .
That has a lot to do with the unaffected directness of Ankur BahlÃ¢â¬ â¢ s poignant performance as Helenus .
The scene in which the quartet of lovers argue in the forest Ã¢â¬ â BÃÂ¶rkur JÃÂ³nssonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s design offers a barrage of white - balloon blossoms atop fragile green stems Ã¢â¬ â is a pleasure , with the gay best friend relationship between Helenus and Anjana VasanÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
delightful Hermia turning sour .
PuckÃ¢â¬ â¢ s observation : Ã¢â¬ÅLord , what fools these mortals be ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ has seldom seemed truer , but it applies equally to the inhabitants of the fairy world .
Katy OwenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s distinctive , hyperactive Puck , decked out in devilÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ears , is desperate for affection from Zubin VarlaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cold - hearted Oberon .
As she falls head over heels for Bottom , Meow MeowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Titania increasingly loses her clothes , her inhibitions and her dignity .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nicely done .
The production understands the irrational power of Eros , but it never fully taps into any sense of the enchanted and uncanny .
Even PuckÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final speech is unnecessarily undercut with comic business .
For the first production in what has been dubbed the Wonder Season , this lacks a genuine sense of wonder and magic .
There are times when , for all its exuberant gleefulness and merry laughter , it seems a tad charmless .
Less could be more .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a production likely to mature in emotional depth .
For now , it is an entertaining and rowdy night out in which Rice demonstrates that she understands the dynamic of the Globe and the groundlings demonstrate their willingness to go with her on a journey .
It may not be the dreamiest Dream , but it could be the start of a great love affair .

2016-05-10,"Jude Law is to return to the London theatre in an adaptation of the Luchino Visconti film Obsession , directed by one of the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most in - demand directors , Ivo van Hove .
The Barbican Centre will announce on Tuesday the return of van
HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s company , Toneelgroep Amsterdam , to its stage in 2017 Ã¢â¬
â but this time with a big name British actor on board .
Van
HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Broadway productions of the Arthur Miller plays A View From the Bridge and The Crucible picked up nine Tony nominations last week , and he was the man David Bowie called to direct his musical Lazurus , which was released two days before the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
The Belgian directorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
stripped - down productions pack a powerful punch that stem from his belief that audiences are more open to adventurous theatre than many believe .
Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s why they pay that amount of money , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he told the Guardian .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t pay money any more just to see a star on stage in a bad play , badly directed .
All those shows stop after a few weeks , A View from the Bridge [ which was at the Young Vic in London before its transfer to the West End and Broadway ] went on and on and on.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
After the success last year of ToneelgroepÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Antigone , starring Juliette Binoche , van Hove said he had talks with the Barbican about what to do next .
One idea was to use British actors alongside Dutch .
Ã¢â¬ÅI thought :
Ã¢â¬ËWho would I like to work with?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Jude Law was number one on my very small list .
He immediately responded very positively Ã¢â¬
Â¦ it happened very quickly .
Law was filming the forthcoming TV series The Young Pope in Rome at the time , so van Hove headed there to discuss what the project might be .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe immediately connected to each other .
He is such an easy - going man Ã¢â¬ â very open , very transparent , generous .
We talked about projects but also a lot of other things Ã¢â¬ â movies , theatre Ã¢â¬ Â¦
I felt at home with him.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The resulting production is based on the 1943 feature film Obsession , itself based on James M CainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel The Postman Always Rings
Twice .
It tells the story of Gino Costa , a handsome itinerant vagabond , to be played by Law , who becomes involved in a chilling , destructive love triangle .
The film gave rise to Italian neorealism , a movement which explored and highlighted the lives of ordinary people during times of upheaval .
Van Hove said he was attracted to characters who were poor and content to be so because Ã¢â¬ÅI come from a very small village
and I connect with these storiesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Law was last on stage in the West End production of Henry V , directed by Michael Grandage , at the end of 2013 .
The Talented Mr Ripley actor said he could not wait to return to the Barbican 22 years after working there with the Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢
d heard great things about Ivo van Hove and when I saw A View from the Bridge at the Young Vic and then Antigone at the Barbican
I knew he was someone I really wanted to have the opportunity to work with.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
After Obsession opens in London next April it will tour to Vienna , Amsterdam and Luxembourg .
It will be one of four van Hove shows at the Barbican next year , the others being Roman Tragedies , a six - hour compression of Coriolanus , Julius Caesar and Cleopatra and a double bill of After the Rehearsal and Persona based on the films of Ingmar Bergman .
Also announced were details of the BarbicanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s autumn and winter theatre and dance programme for 2016 , which will include the RSC bringing productions of Ben JohnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Alchemist , Christopher MarloweÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Doctor Faustus , Melly Still directing Cymbeline , and RSC artistic director Gregory Doran directing his partner Antony Sher in King Lear ."

I hope that future generations will be able to grab it off the shelf and give it a listen , and I hope the first time they start side one they get completely swept away in the story of a man who was looking back at his home planet at a time when that still seemed like a tenuous proposition .

2016-05-16,"For every iconic photo on an album cover , there are dozens of less iconic outtakes .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re usually condemned to the dustbin of history , but , as proved by Outside the Lines , a book that collects outtakes from album cover shoots of the late 70s and early 80s , they frequently tell their own story , distinct and occasionally more truthful than their more famous siblings .
Sometimes , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re suggestive of the pains to which some artists went to get the right image Ã¢â¬ â the disturbing cover of 1979Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Lodger was achieved by David Bowie lying on a specially made metal support and being pressed beneath a pane of glass Ã¢â¬ â and sometimes theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re telling about the internal dynamic of the band involved .
In one outtake from the Parallel Lines shoot , Debbie Harry looks down , adjusting her dress , her hair covering her face , but she somehow still completely dominates the photo : she still feels like the centre of attention , even when sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s looking away .
The street - tough image projected by the RamonesÃ¢â¬ â¢ debut album cover was so pervasive that when the band arrived in London in 1976 , Johnny Rotten allegedly asked their associate Arturo Vega if he thought they would beat him up : Ã¢â¬ÅHe thought the Ramones were a real gang , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Vega subsequently chuckled .
The question would never have arisen had Rotten seen the rest of the photo shoot , where the Ramones look rather sweet and impish .
For all that the artists and photographers involved clearly made the right decision when selecting their cover shots
Ã¢â¬ â would the SpecialsÃ¢â¬ â¢ eponymous debut album have had quite the same impact if it had featured the band posing a little awkwardly on the roof of a cinema ?
Ã¢â¬

2016-05-23,"Madonna is a controversial choice to perform a Prince tribute Madonna , clad in regency - era ruffles and a purple suit in a tribute to PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Purple Rain video , provided the climax to the three - hour ceremony .
Perhaps wary of going the route of Lady GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
crazed David Bowie tribute at the Grammys , Madonna instead performed Nothing Compares 2U ( written by Prince but made famous by Sinead OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Connor ) , then brought Stevie Wonder on stage for a quick blast of Purple Rain .
There was nothing wrong with her performance , but it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite hit the musical g - spot that a soul singer would have done .
Then again , as the last woman standing of the 80s superstar triumvirate born in the US midwest in the summer of 1958 ( the other , of course , being Michael Jackson ) , perhaps Madonna really was PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only true peer , though The Black Entertainment Network certainly didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t think so , promoting their own Prince tribute with the tweet Ã¢â¬ÅYeah , we saw that .

Thanks to her Stakhanovite work rate

SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s got a while before she catches up with the champ though Ã¢â¬ â Maria Carey , who has spent 79 weeks at No 1 .
To mark this momentous statistic , Rihanna scooped a fan - voted award for Ã¢â¬Åchart achievementÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and performed Love on the Brain swathed in a green fur , on a set festooned with giant cobwebs .
Las Vegas is a safe bet for pop stars
The ceremony took place in Vegas (

Instead , she scooped five awards including top artist , and even got her new video played in full , despite the fact that rather than being a Bad Blood - style extravaganza , it contained little more than Adele moving a floral - patterned skirt around .
Now thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s power .
Pink really likes to fly The nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s other new song was PinkÃ¢â¬

The frantic activity was memorable .
The song Ã¢â¬ Â¦ not so much .
Justin BieberÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Sorry is still a tune Justin Bieber got the most teen - hysterical response of the night and took home two awards , including best male artist and top social media artist .
His performance of Company and Sorry started off as a son - et - lumiÃÂ¨re extravaganza , with lights playing over a semi - transparent curtain , behind which Bieber danced , but soon settled into a pretty straightforward version of Sorry , with the newly - shorn singer offering a few Michael Jackson - style crotch grabs to cheer it up .
Fortunately , the song is good enough to need little adornment Ã¢â¬ â even after months of ubiquitous airplay .

2016-05-24,"The last time Tracey Emin opened an exhibition of her work Ã¢â¬ â in Hong Kong in March Ã¢â¬
â
she caused international headlines by announcing that she had married a stone in the garden of her house in the south of France .
The artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s latest exhibition , at Lehmann Maupin in New York , continues the theme .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s called Stone Love , although the title , picked out in one of her famous neons , is actually taken from the first line of Soul Love , by her late friend David Bowie : Ã¢â¬ÅStone love , she kneels before the grave /
A brave son , who gave his life to save the slogans.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The morning the show opens , Emin meets a small group of journalists to take us through the exhibition and then give one - to - one interviews .
Apologising profusely , she arrives half an hour late , having battled traffic across Manhattan from the East Village , where she has a home , after deciding years ago that she was spending too much money staying in the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hotels ( she has a third house in London ) .
Once famous for being constantly out on the town , Emin says she hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t exactly embraced New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s social life .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been coming here nearly 20 years and I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know hardly anybody , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she tells me .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really friendly but everythingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a transaction .
From the top to the bottom , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what America is Ã¢â¬ â
thatÃ¢â¬
â¢ s why people came here .
There was a gold rush .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m friends with Princess Eugenie and we were joking about the fact that in London you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see anyone at the weekend , but here youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got your 8 oÃ¢â¬ â¢ clock breakfast , brunch , lunch then linner .
I said , Ã¢â¬ËWhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s linner?Ã¢â¬ â¢ and she said , Ã¢â¬ËThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s between lunch and dinner.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Emin laughs .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all about a meeting.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Resplendent in a black skirt and top , and gold jewellery subtly enhancing a somewhat piratical air , at 52 Emin is naturally less wild today than she was when she memorably turned up trashed to the live TV discussion programme Sixty Minutes in 1997 , but MargateÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most famous export still has lashings of charisma , with an attitude chaser .
Ã¢â¬ÅCan you tell someone to stop walking with high shoes?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she demands as she assembles the dazzled hacks and attempts to collect her thoughts above the clomping of someone crossing the floor .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf I had a gallery
, I wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t allow people to wear high shoes because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s too noisy.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Stone Love includes three neons ( the other two say
Just Let Me Love You and ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Different
When You Are in Love ) , half a dozen bronze sculptures , four large embroidered calicos and a host of sparse , airy paintings , a step on from her celebrated show at LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s White Cube in 2014 .
Almost all the works depict naked women in sprawled and anxious repose , their faces turned away or scribbled over Ã¢â¬ â which doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t entirely disguise the fact that they are clearly self - portraits .
Before we even knew what a selfie was , for a full decade Emin took Polaroids of herself
Ã¢â¬ â she has more than 5,000 .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople presume
I was narcissistic , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just that I was much more open about myself and how I felt .
But now everybodyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s doing it
Ã¢â¬ â
itÃ¢â¬
â¢ s part of culture.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The figurative works are more traditional and the materials more classical than , for instance , the used condoms , stained knickers and empty vodka bottles that went into famous works such as 1998Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
My Bed , which recently sold for ÃÂ£2.45 m and is currently on show at Tate Britain , overlooked by two Francis Bacons handpicked by the artist .
Nonetheless , Stone Love is still unmistakably Emin , from the swooping gouache curves of her womenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backs to the hot - and - heavy titles like I Just Wanted to Sleep
With You , She Knelt Before Him
and I Wanted More .
A year after a show at AustriaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Leopold Museum , where her work was hung with that of Egon Schiele , and with exhibitions alongside Munch and Picasso to come , Emin seems to be engaging much more overtly with art history than her YBA contemporaries , though she says that has always been the case .
Ã¢â¬ÅI went to the Royal College of Art , and when my peer group were doing FreezeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â the 1988 group show organised by Damien Hirst Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅI
was in Turkey up a mountain doing watercolours of donkeys , looking at Chagall .
I was not on their planet at all , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m still not .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut now I think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s become more evident to people , people are giving me a bit of slack , and theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve stopped being so aggressive Ã¢â¬ â how fucking horrible people were about me in the press in England .
It was outrageous .
Someone said to me , Ã¢â¬ËA lesser artist would have given up.Ã¢â¬ â¢ But IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not going to give up.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
She might not be giving up , but Emin is going on a yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sabbatical .
She announced the break with an advert in Artforum magazine , which featured a picture of her and her four representatives , their contact details and a note in her famous handwriting that , read : Ã¢â¬ÅIf you need anything call one of these people.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Having done two or three shows a year for the past nine years , Emin needs a rest Ã¢â¬ â not from art , she says , but from everything that goes with it .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to have an opening , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t want to do an interview , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t want to do any charity work , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t want to have any meetings about specifications and framing .
I want to wake up every day and make art , and go to bed dreaming about art.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She wants to exercise more , too .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy mind seems very agile and working well , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not up to muscle .
I used to swim a kilometre a day , but now I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , so IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d like to get back to that again .
I like kayaking , I do some horse - riding
and I just want to get physically and mentally fit for the next chapter.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At the TateÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gala dinner a couple of days before
, she says , one woman made the mistake of supposing to Emin that she was taking time off in order Ã¢â¬Åto keep the market at bayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â in other words , that the sabbatical will have a beneficial effect on her workÃ¢â¬ â¢ s prices .
Emin was not amused .
Ã¢â¬ÅOh my God .
I said , Ã¢â¬ËHow dare you insult me ?
How dare you insult my passion ?
You know fuck all about art.Ã¢â¬ â¢
This is my vocation in life .
You wouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t say to a nun , Ã¢â¬ËYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to be really quiet for a year , are you going to stop believing in
God?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Her relationship with art , she says , only gets more intense over the years .
Pointing at a bronze sculpture of two figures called The Wedding , Emin says gleefully that her studio manager had reservations about the piece because she said that the bride reminded her of Princess Fiona from Shrek .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd I said , Ã¢â¬ËOh wow , I watched it at Christmas and absolutely loved it.Ã¢â¬ â¢
Subconsciously I must have taken in this supreme childlike character .
My idea of marriage is like Princess Fiona , so I was so pleased when she said
that.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Emin points between the legs of a bronze , a figure on her side titled I Just Wanted to Sleep With You .
Ã¢â¬ÅHer vaginaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just like this hole , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not used , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a vacant thing .
It should be a vortex , you go up inside it and come back the other side as another human being , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no good .
So itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a different place , different space.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Emin has always expressed and explored her sexuality through her art .
Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963 - 1995 was a tent viewers could enter and ponder their own bedfellows ; in Why I Never Became a Dancer she recalls being Ã¢â¬Åslut - shamedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as a teenager ; and a series of artworks about a botched abortion she had in 1990 formed the centrepiece of her 2011 retrospective at the Hayward in London .
This has earned her plenty of disapproval .
Instead of an art critic , she snorts , one paper got a Ã¢â¬Åvaudeville music hall - type theatre criticÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to review her 2014 White Cube show ( the Daily MailÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Quentin Letts , who inevitably called it Ã¢â¬ÅvulgarÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey
shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have been allowed .
But the images looked good Ã¢â¬ â 45,000 people went to my show in four weeks.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
If thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bad review illustrated with great images , she adds , Ã¢â¬Åit makes a lot of people go to the show.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Emin has been single for seven years .
To coincide with her Hong Kong exhibition , a magazine commissioned her ex - boyfriend Mat Collishaw to photograph her , but then turned down the results as they didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t look like the Ã¢â¬ÅMad Tracey from MargateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the Britart years .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey wanted the photos to look sexy like I did 20 years ago .
But I was going , Ã¢â¬ËNo , IÃ¢â¬ â¢
m nearly 53 , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not possible , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not happening.Ã¢â¬ â¢
So thereÃ¢â¬
â¢ s this kind of weird expectation of people wanting me to be how I was.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want Stone Love to be regarded as too sexual , saying that she loves the lyrics of the Bowie song Ã¢â¬Åbecause theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re an expression of all the other different kinds of love that you can haveÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
Her loves , she says , are unconditional , and also unconventional .
It doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get much less conventional than marrying a stone Ã¢â¬ â not a rock , she says , which has been cut by humans , but a stone .
Emin shows me a picture of the stone in question : itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s large , volcanic and covered in lichen , situated under a tree , with a magnificent sea view .
She was amused by the furore her wedding created .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was in Hong Kong and my mum said she put the news on and it said ,
Ã¢â¬ËAnd the artist Tracey Emin was married this summer in a secret ceremony in France Ã¢â¬ Â¦ to a stone.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Yet she says she was making a serious point , too , embracing her status as a single , middle - aged woman , as well as expressing the artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s love of her materials , and her work .
The stone , she says , is Ã¢â¬Åbeautiful , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
paleolithic , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
monumental , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dignified , it will never , ever let me down .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not going anywhere : itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a metaphor for what I prefer to live with .
I prefer to be single , doing everything I want to do and how I want to do it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Better than that , it cheers her up .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I feel really low Ã¢â¬ â anything from Ã¢â¬ËI shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have said thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ to Ã¢â¬ËI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feel very wellÃ¢â¬ â¢ , to Ã¢â¬ËI feel a bit lonelyÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ â
I think about the stone
and it actually makes me feel better.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In the UK , EminÃ¢â¬ â¢ s public persona is so enormous , and often controversial ( never more so than when she revealed that she was voting Conservative at the 2010 election , though she was hardly alone in being disillusioned by the then Labour government ) , that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to detach it from her influence as an artist .
Nonetheless , her impact is pretty clear , from her sexual frankness to her refusal to be hemmed into one medium .
Ã¢â¬ÅEven if they reject or dislike what I do , the young generation can bounce against what IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d say that about the 70s , really hardcore feminists that worked really hard , they made it possible for me to do what I do.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Just as she may have anticipated the selfie , Emin also made it more acceptable to explore oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s private Ã¢â¬ â even abject Ã¢â¬ â emotions in public , which is one of the reasons she is disliked by those who accuse her of narcissism .
Look at journalism , she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅTwenty years ago , people would never have said : Ã¢â¬ËSo , I was standing outside the school gates with my coffee , thinking about the Pilates that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been doing this morning , about that fact that I shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have worn the purple leggings because theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re so unflattering Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Ã¢â¬ â¢
This is how a serious piece of journalism would start now .
The person could be about to write about fucking Isis or something .
Before , it just would have been cold and analytical Ã¢â¬ â especially serious newspapers like the Guardian .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brilliant!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â¢ Tracey EminÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Stone Love
is at Lehmann Maupin , New York until 18 June"
2016-05-27,"I had been a David Bowie fan since Hunky Dory was released in 1971 .
Back then , he was a cult figure , but with his worldwide Ziggy Stardust tour , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d hit the mainstream .
This was the final show of that tour , at the Hammersmith Odeon in London .
That day , I skived off school with four or five friends , jumped on a bus from Wembley and bought tickets off some touts .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d earned the money working extra hours the previous weekend at Wembley market : I was on a stall selling high - waisted flares .
That day in Hammersmith , I was wearing my mumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s black velour Ã¢â¬ÅbudgieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ jacket , black velour flares and red platform boots .
I was 13 .
We had time to spare , and most people hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t arrived when a limo purred to a stop in the middle of our small crowd .
It was the first time IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d seen one ; it was incredibly big .
A man who looked just like Bowie was waving from the back ; I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t pay too much attention as a lot of people looked like Bowie back then .
There was one security guy and one policeman .
Then the man got out , and we were bowled over .
Bowie was shirtless , and wearing denim dungarees .
He was smoking in a very masculine way , puffing on the cigarette like a builder in a working menÃ¢â¬ â¢ s club .
He looks aloof and focused , but just after this photograph was taken , the limo pulled away and he turned and spoke to us .
He thanked us for coming and said he hoped we would enjoy the show .
It struck me how polite and sweet he was .
We felt so privileged .
He had this quaint English accent , like someone from a 1950s documentary about the lower - middle classes of London .
He sounded different later in life ; the longer he lived abroad , the more south London his voice became .
During the gig , he famously told the crowd he was retiring , although he meant Ziggy Stardust , not himself .
People were crying outside , distraught .
He came back , of course .
I saw Bowie on stage more than 30 times , but never got this close again .
The day his last album , Blackstar , was announced , I pre - ordered it on vinyl and booked the afternoon of Friday 8 January off work to listen to it .
I thought it was brilliant , but my son said , Ã¢â¬ÅDad , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
really depressing.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I was in my car the following Monday when my daughter called me in tears .
Bowie had seemed so alive ; his death followed a spurt of activity .
While I was listening to the album I thought : Ã¢â¬ÅHow great to be nearly 70 and still pushing boundaries.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
I felt there was hope for me yet .
I think most of us have a little bit of Bowie in our DNA : he crossed generations and genres .
I loved him as a boy because he gave me an identity Ã¢â¬ â someone , I hoped , who was enigmatic enough to appeal to everyone at school , from skinheads to girls to teachers .
At the same time , he was like no other rock star , full of glamour and showmanship .
And his songs were so good .
He was shocking , daring and outrageous .
As he grew older , he grew no less cool .
Everyone has their younger self still inside them ; the boy in this photograph died a little , too , when Bowie died .

2016-06-01,"Chrysalis Music co - founder Chris Wright , who signed artists from Blondie and Billy Idol to Spandau Ballet but famously passed on
Ã¢â¬Åone - hit wonderÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
David Bowie , is to be reunited with the legendary label almost three decades after selling up to EMI .
Wright , who sold the record company to EMI , 26 years ago , is to return as chairman following its acquisition from Warner Music by music business Blue Raincoat .
Warner Music acquired Chrysalis following UniversalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ÃÂ£1.2bn acquisition of EMI in 2012 , after regulators forced UMG to sell off a number of subsidiary labels to satisfy competition concerns .
Blue Raincoat , co - founded by ex - Chrysalis chief Jeremy Lascelles and Sade producer Robin Millar , has acquired Chrysalis Music for an undisclosed sum .
Wright , who co - founded Chrysalis in 1968 with Terry Ellis in a student basement flat , will return as non - executive chairman .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor me this is an historic and emotional day as Chrysalis is back in the hands of myself and my partners at Blue Raincoat , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Wright .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll run it as an independent [ label ] , revitalising the catalogue for the digital age .
We believe it can become a new home for many established artists to sit alongside the incredible acts we already have.Ã¢â¬

Artists already on the Chrysalis Music roster include The Specials , Debbie Harry , Sinead OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Connor , Ten Years After and Ultravox .
Wright officially severed all ties with Chrysalis in 2010 when he sold the music publishing arm Ã¢â¬ â which included BlurÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Damon Albarn , Thom Yorke of Radiohead and Bowie , whom he passed on signing as a recording artist Ã¢â¬ â for ÃÂ£107 m to BMG UK .
In 1971 , Wright said he turned down signing Bowie as a recording artist because he seemed a one - hit wonder
Ã¢â¬Åa pop artist , not an act with any longevity.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅHe was in our office in Oxford Street all the time , often pleading with us for money to go and make demos ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ recounted Wright in media interviews three years ago .
Ã¢â¬ÅOur receptionist would ring around and we would all pretend to be out.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He also passed on signing Dire Straits , who went on to sell more than 120 million albums , because while he thought they were Ã¢â¬Åvery goodÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ he also found them
Ã¢â¬Åvery
boringÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And Chysalis bowed out of the bidding war for the Spice Girls , after tabling ÃÂ£250,000 , because executives felt that only one of the band could sing and none seemed to be songwriters .
Wright , now 71 , made ÃÂ£29 m from the sale of the publishing business in 2010 , and said at the time that he was moving into Ã¢â¬Åsemi - retirementÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Lascelles , whose resume includes working with artists including Phil Collins and Culture Club , said that it was something of a moment getting Wright back on board .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor him to be reunited with a company that he started nearly 50 years ago is pretty special , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is a wonderful moment .
Chrysalis Records is for the first time in many years back in the hands of an independent.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
After selling the record label to EMI , Wright later set up a radio operation , which included the fast - growing Heart and Galaxy stations , and diversified into television Ã¢â¬ â making Midsomer Murders and covering Formula 1 .
However , the City did not care for the mini - media conglomerate he created and the television arm was sold .
The radio stations were offloaded to the Tabor family , which now own the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest commercial radio group with networks such as Capital , for ÃÂ£170 m in 2007 ."
2016-06-05,"Hundreds of tributes celebrating the music of David Bowie , Prince and MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lemmy will be staged during this monthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Glastonbury festival as the Somerset event morphs into a rolling commemoration of three rock stars who passed away since Christmas .
Organisers have revealed that they are finalising Ã¢â¬Åparticipatory aspectsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for the 177,000 sellout crowd to honour Bowie , who first played at an embryonic Glastonbury in 1971 as a relatively unknown performer and went on to become one of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most feted musicians before his death in January , aged 69 .
It is thought that festivalgoers will be encouraged to perform a Ã¢â¬Åflash mobÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ set to the Bowie classic Starman , following similar events staged to the music of Dolly Parton in 2014 and Lionel Richie last year .
One confirmed tribute is a set by the electronic pop four - piece Hot Chip in honour of Prince , the innovative American songwriter who came close to playing at the Somerset festival on several occasions and whose death in April was last week officially attributed to an opioid overdose .
Lemmy , whose band performed at last summerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s festival and who died in December , aged 70 , will be honoured in a set involving a giant sculpture , although full details are yet to be divulged .
Last week Glastonbury announced 3,062 acts for this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s festival , on at least 75 stages , with sources conceding that such has been the outpouring of emotion towards the three musicians that hundreds of tributes will unfold over the festival , including a generous number certain to incorporate Bowie and Prince cover versions in their sets .
Ã¢â¬ÅSome of the stuff we donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even know about because thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so much happening , particularly Bowie , because he was such a key character , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said a festival spokesman .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that well known when he first came down to play , and he actually stayed in the farmhouse.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Among an increasingly long list of confirmed tributes to Bowie is the decorating of the Pyramid stage with a giant metal lightning bolt , a homage to the sleeve of his Aladdin Sane album , which will effectively double as a centrepiece for the festival , suspended above headline acts such as Coldplay , Muse and Adele .
On the Saturday night , American composer Philip GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ symphony , based on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1977 album , will be performed by conductor Charles Hazelwood , the British Paraorchestra and the Army of Generals , along with a Ã¢â¬Åspectacular laser showÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ created by artist Chris Levine .
Other Bowie tributes will take the form of several high - profile DJ sets , including one by the English producer Danny Howells .
Despite GlastonburyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s enduring popularity , the festival , which began in 1970 at Worthy Farm , could move to an alternative site .
Its founder , Michael Eavis , revealed last week that he is discussing a possible move to Longleat in 2019 during GlastonburyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åfallow yearÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
However , some observers believe the deaths of stars like Bowie could signal the demise of the big British summer music festival .
According to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith , who has worked with most of the western worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest music stars Ã¢â¬ â from the Who to the Rolling Stones and Madonna Ã¢â¬ â the biggest problem is a lack of new bands to succeed the old ones .
Another sobering development is a warning from counter - terrorism officials who say fans at UK music festivals could be the target of the next major terrorist attack in Britain ."
2016-06-09,"David Bowie , Adele and Rio Ferdinand are among the famous past and present residents and students of south London celebrated in an exhibition opening on Friday at the National Portrait Gallery .
The portraits include Roots Manuva , whose first album was recorded in a community studio on the Angell Town estate , fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood , former soldier Johnson Beharry , who was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in Iraq , and the gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell .
They are displayed surrounding a new commission , a giant photograph and group portrait of 180 GCSE art students from St SaviourÃ¢â¬ â¢ s and St OlaveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s school in Southwark , created by the London - based Australian artist Simon Terrill .
The photoshoot began at dusk and ended after dark in March , and involved more than 200 people including local arts students , construction lights , a smoke machine Ã¢â¬ â and a DJ playing appropriate tracks Ã¢â¬ â to create the spectacular glowing effect .
When the music stopped the pupils held their poses while each long exposure shot , taken by a large format camera mounted on the roof of a nearby tower block , was captured .
The school is a Church of England comprehensive for girls founded in 1562 .
The resulting image is the latest in TerrillÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Crowd Theory series of large groups gathered in places significant to them .
Liz Smith , director of participation at the NPG , said the gallery was proud of the commission and the Creative Connections project .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn producing this exciting new work , the gallery is proud to have worked with artist Simon Terrill , St SaviourÃ¢â¬ â¢ s and St OlaveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in Southwark .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe gallery has ambitions for the project model to extend beyond London , and engage young people in researching and making new work about representations of self and locality.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The exhibition is free at the NPG and runs until 6 September ."
2016-06-10,"Thousands of music fans will be invited to wear masks of David Bowie at the Isle of Wight festival , the first of a series of tributes to the late singer at events around the UK this summer .
British festival season kicks into gear this weekend with Isle of Wight , Download , Meltdown and Field Day .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last festival appearance was at the Isle of Wight in 2004 .
He died in January after a battle with cancer .
The tribute on Saturday has been organised by Stand Up to Cancer , a joint fundraising campaign by Cancer Research UK and Channel 4 , which is the Isle of
Wight festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
official charity partner for 2016 .
The festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s chief , John Giddings , told the Daily Echo : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid was a true musical icon , an immense talent who as a performer was incredible .
His energy , creativity and passion were incomparable and I feel very lucky to have spent so many years working with him .
Ã¢â¬ÅHis set at the Isle of Wight festival in 2004 was one of the highlights of my career , and sadly his last UK festival show .
I was hoping heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d play this year so our tribute will be a very emotional moment for me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At Glastonbury , hundreds of tributes to Bowie , as well as Prince and MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Lemmy , will be staged .
It is thought that festivalgoers will be encouraged to perform a flashmob set to the Bowie classic Starman , and the Pyramid stage will be decorated with a giant metal lightning bolt in homage to his Aladdin Sane album sleeve .
Footage of BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s headline appearance on the Pyramid stage in 2000 will be broadcast around the site , and the Park stage will host an Ã¢â¬ÅintimateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ tribute to his Heroes LP .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere will be all sorts of things popping up all the time , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the festival organiser Emily Eavis told the Guardian recently .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt the moment
weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a few Prince visual tributes and a few late - night parties in Block 9 and various other places across the site .
With Bowie , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to put the [ Aladdin Sane ] flash on the Pyramid stage .
Obviously , with his relationship with the festival going back so far to 1971 , we really wanted to mark it as if it were his stage .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are also doing a Lemmy tribute on the Other stage , which is really good , but it has to remain a surprise because if I try to explain what weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re trying to make it look like , it wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound half as good as itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be.Ã¢â¬

The Who , Queen and Adam Lambert , Stereophonics and Faithless will headline this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢
s Isle of Wight festival .
The weather is forecast to be mostly dry with some showers .
Friday and Saturday will be a cloudy but dry , and Sunday will see a mix of sunshine and showers , according to the Met Office .
At Download , in Donington Park , Leicestershire , headliners will include Rammstein , Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden , and the weather will be a mixture of dry clouds and showers .
For Field Day and Meltdown in London , the weather is expected to be mainly cloudy on Saturday and rainy on Sunday .
Behind the joviality , security is expected to be ramped up at festivals after a senior counter - terrorism officer recently warned that music fans and nightclubbers could be the target of the next major terrorist attack in Britain .
Glastonbury festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s security director , Adrian Coombs , said : Ã¢â¬ÅThe Glastonbury festival thoroughly plans the event each year , where necessary with the support of the police , and puts in place all necessary measures to protect the public and maximise public safety.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Glastonbury ticket - holders were encouraged to register for a postal vote in the EU referendum , which takes place during the festival .
A spokesman said : Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve also encouraged all of our crew - which is thousands of people at this point Ã¢â¬ â to register to vote , going so far as to construct a booth at our main catering site , Goose Hall , where crew could pick up and drop off postal voting forms.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In an article this week , GlastonburyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s founder Michael Eavis urged people to vote to remain in the EU .
He highlighted five reasons why he was backing the remain campaign , including : Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re one of the few really successful economies in the world at the moment Ã¢â¬ â why change a winning streak?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Eavis added : Ã¢â¬ÅThe Iraq war is the worst foreign policy decision of the last 50 years .
Where was that decision made ?
In our very own parliament .
If only we had consulted with our friendly European neighbours , who were dead against the war .
Just think of all the horror that followed Ã¢â¬ â and is continuing to this day.Ã¢â¬

2016-06-12,"The death of Muhammad Ali a week ago was another blow , in a year which has already seen the passing of David Bowie , Victoria Wood and Prince , among other beloved celebrities .
A curious phenomenon that many people who have lost a loved one have experienced is the fleeting recognition of the deceased in a crowd .
Facial recognition is a highly developed skill with its own dedicated brain area .
When we look at someone , we use even the most detailed features in an attempt to identify them .
Seeing someone you recognise Ã¢â¬ â or think you recognise Ã¢â¬ â can provoke a strong emotional response .
Because this neural machinery is so strong , once a face has been remembered , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very difficult to forget it , even if the person died many years ago .
In fact , the emotional impact can hit even harder years later , when the erroneous facial recognition brings the past back with a jolt .
This is also why you can recognise people years after you met them , even if you can not remember for the life of you who they are Ã¢â¬ â and why we think strangers look like celebrities , whether theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re alive or dead .

2016-06-13,"Tony Visconti , David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime producer , has apologised for negative comments he made about AdeleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s voice .
Last week , the producer suggested that the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocals might have been digitally enhanced .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou turn the radio on and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fluff , you are listening to 90 % computerised voices , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Visconti told The Daily Star on 8 June .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe know Adele has a great voice but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s even questionable if that is actually her voice or how much has been manipulated .
We donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti Ã¢â¬ â who is currently promoting the new TV talent show Guitar Star , in which he hopes to find Ã¢â¬Åvirtuosos like Hendrix , Cobain and BowieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â has since told Billboard that his comments were not meant to be spiteful .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬
â¢ m sorry that what I said in regards to whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s being played on radio was misconstrued yet I can not apologise for something taken the wrong way ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf Adele has taken my comments as offensive that was certainly not my intent.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He added : Ã¢â¬ÅAdele has a great voice and it brings pleasure to millions.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Since his original comment , the story had already reached Adele herself .
During a gig at ParisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Accor Hotels Arena , the singer is captured stating : Ã¢â¬ÅSome dickhead tried to say that my voice was not me on record Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Dude , suck my dick.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-06-16,"Full details of GlastonburyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plans to commemorate David Bowie , Prince and Lemmy have been revealed , including sculptures in honour of each of them , a 50-piece orchestral performance and a DJ set .
The festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s co - organiser , Emily Eavis , had previously hinted that the event would honour the three stars , who died in the last six months , giving the 177,000 crowd a chance to both mourn and celebrate .
Eavis has commissioned the counter - culture sculptor Joe Rush , who has created artworks for the Glastonbury site for years , to build a giant Ziggy Stardust lightening bolt across the top of the Pyramid stage , where bands including Coldplay and Adele will perform .
It will be flanked by a giant set of silver wings and emblazoned , in the middle , with an open grey eye .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt felt important to capture BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very particular eye , which was such a part of his lookÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , said Rush .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut I also really liked the idea of Bowie looking out and watching over the whole festival .
And if we are going to have an eye in the pyramid , it should be
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
eye.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
To commemorate MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s frontman Lemmy , who finally performed at Glastonbury last year before his death in December , Rush has built a vast structure for the Other stage .
The sculpture will be a peace sign formed of spanners , adorned with an aluminium ace of spades , a v - twin engine and a vast set of shiny black ramÃ¢â¬ â¢ s horns .
In a fitting nod to PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s flamboyance , Rush has built a statue almost four metres tall for the Park area of the festival .
It will take the form of a giant glittery hand carrying a purple crown with a white dove flying from the top .
He said : Ã¢â¬ÅPeople do need to have these places to come to , especially for an artist who has really affected or shaped their life , and pay tribute .
Particularly at Glastonbury , where you have so many music fans gathered in one place , it feels important to give these artists the recognition of the fact that they are our heroes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
There will also be musical tributes to Bowie and Prince over the weekend , the most ambitious of which will take place at midnight on Saturday , when a 50-piece orchestra dressed entirely in white will perform Philip GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fourth symphony , which is based on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album Heroes .
It is the first time a classical act has headlined a stage and the performance will be accompanied by a laser light show created by Chris Levine .
Charles Hazlewood , who will conduct the orchestra , said he had wanted to create a tribute to Bowie that was not mawkish but instead in the Ã¢â¬Åspirit of the man
himselfÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , while not simply putting on a tribute band playing old Bowie covers .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie was a massive fan of GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s and said on many occasions that he was one of his most important influences , so this seemed perfect , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you look back to that amazing set that Bowie did in 2000 , the standalone moment was when he sang Heroes .
So thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s something so beautifully pertinent about bringing back not just the song , but the album re - imagined through Glass.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He said Glass was very excited about the performance .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is after all the other stages have fallen silent , so there will be a sense of a vigil , of a happening of a pilgrimage , of people flocking here to just absorb this moment , and I think it will be a really magical midnight experience , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hazelgrove said .
The Hot Chip frontman Alexis Taylor , will pay tribute to Prince by playing a DJ set dedicated to the singer at the Block 9 stage on Friday night .
Ã¢â¬ÅI like the idea of it being somewhere that amongst everything that goes on at Glastonbury , this can be a moment where people come together to celebrate that legacy of music , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Taylor said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI found it quite hard initially when he died to listen to Prince because when you feel sad in that way , you expect to listen to sad sorrowful music , but there isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t so much of that in Prince .
But I think this set is a decent enough time after the event to be in a more party frame of mind.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Taylor , a lifelong Prince fan , said his set would include some of his biggest tracks , such as Controversy , Raspberry Beret , Sign of the Times and Little Red Corvette , as well as obscurities such as an early demo of Irresistible Bitch and a track called Cloreen Bacon Skin .
Ã¢â¬ÅWith PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s catalogue being so full of life and spark and energy , it feel like a nice way to celebrate him .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very joyous music , very passionate music , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said ."
2016-06-25,"I first met David when I was in my mid - thirties and he was in his early 20s , just a kid out of art school turning from being a painter into being a composer .
We lived close to each other in New York .
There were periods when we saw each other a lot and other periods when we didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Ã¢â¬ â
I never knew exactly where he was or where he was going to be
and sometimes we didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see each other for years , but we were always in touch and talked about how things were going .
He was an extremely gifted and interesting person and musician .
We had both a friendship and a working relationship .
We did several concerts and projects together , and of course I wrote two symphonies based on his work , No 1 ( the Low symphony ) in 1992 and No 4 ( Heroes ) in 1996 .
David liked the idea that I was doing the symphonies .
And he was very pleased with them , as was Brian Eno .
They even had their pictures taken to feature alongside mine on the first edition of the Low symphony album cover .
Of the two works , David preferred
No 4 ( Heroes ) because he thought it was more original .
But I had to disagree with him : I thought No 1 ( Low ) was !
Soon after its composition he began using the Heroes symphony for his walk - in music for some of his concerts .
And , even more surprising , is that thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a version around in which he superimposed his voice singing Heroes on to the symphonic recording .
Somewhere in his archive thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that recording Ã¢â¬ â of David Bowie singing his own version of Heroes over my symphony .
It would be amazing to find it .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think I could name my favourite Bowie album , or track .
Changes ?
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know .
Like everybody else , I like the hits !
He and Brian had an amazing creative partnership .
I actually never knew who did what .
Both were so gifted in their ability to write lyrical music .
They told me though that they never worked together at the same time .
They worked in the same studio , but one of them had the day hours , the other the evening hours .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t even know how well they knew each other Ã¢â¬ â
I never actually saw them together !
But there was always a lot of mystery around David as to what was going on .
You never knew what he was up to .
No one told him what to do , and he did what he wanted .
Within days of his death there were performances of my two symphonies among many other tributes .
In fact I was kind of surprised there are so few full orchestrated versions of DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s compositions Ã¢â¬ â given what an admired and talented composer he was .
But I seem to have been the only person whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ever written symphonies based on his work .
The two symphonies were of course originally intended to be part of a trilogy , just as Bowie and EnoÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
Berlin albums are .
We talked , years ago , about doing the third symphony based on Lodger , and the idea has not totally disappeared .
The Glastonbury performance of Heroes on Saturday night was [ conductor ]
Charles HazlewoodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s idea .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m
just so sorry
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t be there myself .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one of those crazy scheduling things
Ã¢â¬ â
I wish I could be in two places at one time .
Although I confess IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not really much of a festival - goer myself .
I tend to end up seeing most performances from the backstage point of view Ã¢â¬ â sometimes I never get to see the front of theatres or halls .
But , rain or shine , it will be an event .
A huge one .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s such an honour that this music is the first classical work to headline Glastonbury .
Musical borders are melting away today .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve worked with all kinds of people , from Bowie , to Ravi Shankar , to Paul Simon , to griots from west Africa , and everything IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done has always expanded my own personal musical language and has always been enjoyable and interesting .
You donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t need to have been to a conservatoire to be a composer today .
You donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even necessarily need to be able to read or write music .
Things feel very open .
I like that .
As to what David would have made of the Glastonbury tribute , I really have no idea !
He might have showed up and not even told you he was coming , or he might have enjoyed it from afar but not come .
You never knew with David .
He was a master unto himself .

2016-07-07,"David Bowie absolutely hated the place while Kirsty MacColl hoped it might one day be blown up .
But the National Trust profoundly disagrees Ã¢â¬ â it wants people to love Croydon .
The organisation , best known as custodian of some of BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most beautiful country houses , is turning its gaze on to the 60s and 70s high rise office blocks of a London suburb that always seems to spark extreme opinions .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt has this rather insalubrious reputation of being some kind of suburban hell that Londoners should somehow avoid , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ admitted Joseph Watson , the London creative director of the trust .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut actually it is incredibly rich in history , heritage and green space and in our view it has a kind of weird beauty.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Watson is helping to organise tours of Croydon taking in architectural highlights such as NLA House ( now No 1 Croydon ) , sometimes known as the Ã¢â¬Ëthreepenny bitÃ¢â¬ â¢ ; the Corbusier - inspired Corinthian House ; and St GeorgeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s House , or the Nestle building .
It is , Watson said , about trying to understand why Croydon is how it is , what makes it so distinctive and why it is so cherished by many proud Croydonians .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe are not pretending it is everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cup of tea , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut we would make the case for wanting to understand somewhere like Croydon.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Croydon has not been greatly helped by its appearances in popular culture .
For an older generation the borough was the home of Terry and June in the 80s BBC sitcom with the couple harrumphing round the Whitgift shopping centre looking for each other in the opening titles .
More recently it was the dispiriting home of Mark and Jez in the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show , starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb .
Bowie was no fan , saying in a 1999 interview with Q magazine : Ã¢â¬ÅIt represented everything I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want in my life , everything I wanted to get away from .
I think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the most derogatory thing I can say about somebody or something :
Ã¢â¬ËGod , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so fucking Croydon!Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Meanwhile , MacColl once said of the suburb she grew up in that it was number five in the top 50 things she hated , hoping it would all be blown up one day .
On the other hand it has been described by its fans as Ã¢â¬ËSpace AgeÃ¢â¬ â¢ and a Ã¢â¬Ëmini - ManhattanÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
Watson said Croydon did not have as much grey concrete as some people imagined and there are many architecturally impressive and important buildings .
Not least the Fairfield Halls , which was modelled on its immediate forerunner Ã¢â¬ â the Royal Festival Hall , and was officially opened in 1962 .
The whole site is due to close for two years this month for a ÃÂ£30 m refurbishment , allowing the National Trust to offer a last - minute backstage tour .
Croydon , the trust argues , was one of the best examples of the post - war optimism that sought to build a better society .
Ambitious civic leaders wanted to create a third city in London , alongside Westminster and the City of London .
People on the tours will be able to go up the Amp House office block and hopefully see in the distance the building that effectively quashed those ambitions in the 1980s
Ã¢â¬
â
1 Canada Square on the Isle of Dogs .
The National Trust is turning to Croydon after its successful tours of LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s brutalist concrete buildings , places it argues should be cherished as much as CroydonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s towers .
Watson said : Ã¢â¬ÅConcrete has such a bad reputation that people always want to call them jungles and monstrosities and wastelands and busy themselves with trying to pull them down .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re just saying look , every era makes its mark on society architecturally and we have to try protect some of the best at least Ã¢â¬ â and Croydon clearly has some of the best .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs a society
we owe it to that era to protect those buildings .
It was not very long ago that we were busy pulling down some of the finest buildings from the Victorian era under the rubrick of Victorian monstrosities.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The project has been organised in conjunction with Croydon council .
Timothy Godfrey , council member for culture , said : Ã¢â¬ÅFor those of us born and bred in Croydon , we know the optimism and opportunity of the place , its ability to re - invent itselfand be welcoming to those who have moved here in each of its growth stages .
Other events will include a Routemaster tour of the borough and a screening of archive 1960s footage of Croydon .
Edge City :
Croydon , running from 15 to 24 July"
2016-07-08,"As the march of gentrification and greed transforms London Ã¢â¬ â as well as many of the UKÃ¢â¬ â¢ s other inner cities Ã¢â¬ â one great British institution that has fallen foul has been the nightlife business .
In London , the area that has suffered the most is Soho .
Once a naughty , massively inspiring little Petri dish from which the likes of David Bowie , the Sex Pistols , Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud emerged , it is being rapidly reshaped into something resembling a homogenised shopping mall .
One of the first institutions to fall foul of the evisceration of Soho was the Wag , the club Ollie OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Donnell and I founded in 1982 and which ran until 2001 .
When we began , Soho was really rather seedy and rundown , which was exactly what attracted the young , the groovy and the inventive .
The Wag Ã¢â¬ â a nightclub that catered , in the main , to a gang of non - conformist mavericks Ã¢â¬ â was thoroughly appropriate to that crowd .
Ollie and I started by packing out the Whisky a Go Go in Wardour Street every Saturday night with our own crowd , then the clubÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new leaseholders asked us to run it with them full time .
So we lowered the drinks and the door price ( which was possible because rents were fair back then ) , pulled in DJs who played underground music , and the place took off .
We were young and aware , so we knew what was happening and approached the running of the club with a zeal that at times dropped us in the proverbial .
In November 1982 , we hosted the first ever hip - hop club event in the UK ,
The Roxy Road Show Ã¢â¬
â featuring 25 artists who flew in from New York , including Afrika Bambaataa , Grand Wizard Theodore ( who invented scratching ) , Jazzy Jay and Fab 5 Freddy , rope skipping stars the Double Dutch Girls and legendary breakdancers the Rock Steady Crew .
It was complete and utter mayhem , but in a good way .
The club was absolutely packed when , at my behest , then unknown graffiti artist Futura 2000 did his live spray - can art on stage and more or less asphyxiated everyone .
We later made a name for ourselves by booking all the major rap acts Ã¢â¬ â De La Soul , Jungle Brothers , Queen Latifah , Eric B and Rakim , Kool Moe Dee , Grandmaster Flash , Doug E Fresh .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been said that we were responsible for breaking hip - hop in the UK but , for me , it made sense in every way : the acts had never played London before , and it was relatively cheap to bring them over .
All it took was two or three discounted flights and a couple of nights in a friendÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hotel in Bloomsbury .
Simple economics .
Because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been in a band it was my job to source , book and promote the live acts .
Sometimes they worked and other times they did not .
Even though we all knew of Shane MacGowanÃ¢â¬
â¢ s proclivities I booked Pogue Mahone just as they were starting off .
The third time they played , MacGowan was so drunk
I was surprised he could stand , never mind sing , but it made no difference because the show stopped after 20 minutes when he tried to hit bassist Cait OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Riordan over the head with his guitar .
Then there was the legendary jazz maestro Slim Gaillard , who sold out the club
but , rather in his cups , retired to the bar after two songs , fell asleep on it and woke up two hours later , his backing band and the crowd having long departed .
I turned down a Prince afterparty / jam session because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d already booked Lee Ã¢â¬ËScratchÃ¢â¬ â¢ Perry on the same night .
He cost us a packet , but the club was crammed so all was OK until Perry , somewhat chemically enhanced , sang the same song ( his new single ) 15 times and emptied the club before midnight .
We lost our shirts .
But there were bigger losses Ã¢â¬ â Bobby WomackÃ¢â¬ â¢ s show was cancelled an hour before it was due to start because of a bomb scare round the corner in Leicester Square ; Gil Scott HeronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gig was called off when he was arrested at Heathrow for possession of cocaine .
Both had sold out and we had to refund all ticket holders , leaving us with the cost of the flights and hotel rooms .
Of course , other acts were simply magnificent .
I recall the surprise on Georgie FameÃ¢â¬ â¢ s face as he looked out at the crowd of immaculate mods , dressed just as they would have when he played the Flamingo ( in the basement of the Whisky
a Go Go ) in 1962 .
James BrownÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backing band the JBs were gobsmacked that the crowd ( many in 70s kit ) knew all their numbers by heart .
New acts thrived , too :
Sade , Fine Young Cannibals , Curiosity Killed the Cat , the Pasadenas and Swing Out Sister were all signed after shows at the Wag .
The Wag was synonymous with what was happening on the street .
We played a huge role in kick - starting the acid house movement by hosting sets from Marshall Jefferson , Tony Humphries , Frankie Knuckles , Todd Terry and Masters at Work , among many others , while Paul Oakenfold , Pete Tong and Andy Weatherall established their reps at the Wag .
But it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just about music .
It was also about meeting people and showing off .
Diehard regular Jonathan Ross met his wife Jane Goldman at the Wag .
Designers such as John Galliano paraded their designs here ; Leigh Bowery strutted his magnificent stuff ; future Turner prize winners Tracey Emin and Grayson Perry were regulars ; Boy George , Joe Strummer and Neneh Cherry came every week for a little dance .
All the attention meant global superstars came to our little ramshackle venue ( with no VIP area ) for a look :
David Bowie ( who came a lot and filmed his Blue Jean video there ) , Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Prince , George Clinton , Stevie Wonder , Robert De Niro , Brad Pitt , Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier .
George Michael had a fight with our DJ Fat Tony and Grace Jones had to be physically restrained after laying out an irritating bloke with a single punch .
Some have said that at one point the Wag was the grooviest club on the planet , but I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tell .
I was too busy trying to fill a Tuesday night .
None had this would have happened had we not been in our mid-20s , not that different from most of our patrons , and brave ( or stupid ) enough to take chances and , most importantly , had the rent not been cheap enough for us to experiment .
Today , not only would I not be able to run a West End club , I wouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t even be able to hang out in Soho , because landlords and developers have priced the young and not - so - well - off out of inner London .
It has been suggested that London should follow Amsterdam , Paris , Zurich and Toulouse and appoint a night mayor to protect our after - dark businesses and the people who use them .
Certainly , unless something is done we will lose the talent that has traditionally risen through our night - time economy Ã¢â¬ â graphic designers , artists , DJs , entertainers writers , photographers and musicians of every kind who hone their skills and develop by working with clubs and promoters .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think its possible to overestimate just how important this is for any city or country , and that is why Amsterdam , Paris and Zurich are protecting their nightlife .
We have to follow suit before itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s too late .
Chris Sullivan presents The Wag Club is available now on Harmless Records ."
2016-07-09,"Back when rock music was deemed antisocial , and even traditional jazz bands were frowned upon , it cost just fourpence to gain entry to a place where the young were free to dance , drink and kiss .
The Rolling Stones , a teenage David Bowie , Rod Stewart , Eric Clapton , the Who and Pink Floyd all first found regular audiences in this hidden haven .
The venue was Eel Pie Island : a tiny enclave in the middle of the river Thames at Twickenham , which is now claiming its place in BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cultural history .
A museum dedicated to the islandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s past glory as the centre of a British R&amp;B boom is set to have a permanent home .
Curator Michele Whitby has been promised ÃÂ£8,000 from the London mayorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s office and now has until next month to raise another ÃÂ£4,000 on a crowdfunding site to see her scheme come to life .
Ã¢â¬ÅI want to run a museum just a stoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s throw from the island itself , in TwickenhamÃ¢â¬
â¢ s main street , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople describe Eel Pie Island as like nowhere else and so seven years ago I wrote a book about it .
Now I have a fantastic wealth of material to share.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Whitby , 49 , now lives on a boat moored to the island , but first arrived on its shores aged 21 , when she rented space for a photographic studio .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Stones had 15 dates here early in their career and were paid around ÃÂ£45 for a gig ; good money then , although you could not get tickets to see them for that now , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whitby .
Ã¢â¬ÅI made a montage of photographs of the band from 1963 and sent it to them .
It came back signed by them all Ã¢â¬Ëto Eel Pie IslandÃ¢â¬ â¢
.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Once known as Twickenham Ait , the island takes its current name from the snacks once sold to passing traders from its banks .
It was a leisure destination as early as the beginning of the 17th century and a map of 1635 marks a plot of land with Ã¢â¬Åhath bin A Boulding AlleyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Henry VIII is said to have used it for discreet courting .
With the construction of the grand , three - storey Eel Pie Island hotel in 1830 it became a popular holiday destination for the rest of London .
But its modern influence dates from the launch of the Eelpiland dance club in 1956 .
When an arched footbridge to the mainland was built a year later , clubbers paid fourpence admission and were wrist - stamped as they queued to join dancers in the ballroom adjoining the neglected hotel .
They were given a passport instead of a ticket , underlining the notion that different social rules prevailed .
The passport read : Ã¢â¬ÅWe request and require , in the name of His Excellency Prince Pan , all those whom it may concern to give the bearer of this passport any assistance he / she may require in his / her lawful business of jiving and generally cutting a rug .
Given under our hand this first day of November 1963
PAN Prince of Trads.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
For Whitby , and for older fans who saw the Stones or Eric Clapton play , Eelpiland is the birthplace of a youth movement , comparable to the Cavern Club in Liverpool , the Wigan Casino , the pubs of Canvey Island or the Hacienda in Manchester .
Ã¢â¬ÅFans used to have to get there by ferry before they built the bridge and even then there was very little residential accommodation here , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whitby .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was all boatyards .
They thought the police would find it more difficult to come over and so they were free to make more noise.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Last year Whitby put together artefacts and memorabilia for a pop - up museum , housed in two rooms in Twickenham library .
It also told the story of the remarkable Arthur Chisnall , the antiques dealer and philanthropist who set up the club .
He started by booking trad jazz stars , such as Acker Bilk and George Melly , at the weekends , but the bar and large , sprung dance floor also made it suitable for rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll gigs .
Chisnall , a pipe - smoking guru in tweed , booked visiting American blues stars such as Buddy Guy and HowlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ Wolf .
Ã¢â¬ÅArthur really was the centre of it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whitby .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was not a massive music fan , but was fascinated by young people and their problems in a genuine way .
A lot of people have told me that he changed their lives for the better.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The pop - up museum contained a recreation of ArthurÃ¢â¬ â¢ s living room in nearby Strawberry Hill , with his original desk .
In June 1961 , on the clubÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fifth birthday , he was interviewed by the News of the World .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis place started as a jazz club .
Now it is one of the biggest political discussion centres in this part of greater London .
There are 8,386 members .
The bands only play at weekends .
During the week the members jam the bar Ã¢â¬ Â¦ while discussing all sorts of serious topics .
We are not tied down to any one line of political thought , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
By the end of ChisnallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reign the club had also welcomed the Yardbirds , John MayallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bluesbreakers , the Tridents with Jeff Beck , and Long John Baldry and his Hoochie Coochie Men , featuring Rod Stewart .
In his 1998 autobiography , All the Rage , Ian McLagan , keyboard - player with the Small Faces and the Faces , recalled supporting the Stones at Eelpiland and first meeting Rod
Ã¢â¬ÅThe
ModÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Stewart , dressed up and Ã¢â¬Åon
the pullÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was one of the best places to hear blues bands at the weekends , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ McLagan wrote .
Chisnall lived on until 2006 , but lack of funds closed down his club in the late 1960s .
Threatened with demolition , it briefly reopened as Colonel BarefootÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Rock Garden , when Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd performed .
But eventually squatters and anarchists took over and the hotel was home to 100 hippies .
Ã¢â¬ÅOne particularly cold winter , squatters started cannibalising the building for firewood and in 1970 it was pretty much destroyed by fire , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whitby .
The coveted homes of the 1970s residential block Aquarius now stand on the site , surrounded by a small community of artists living and working in former boathouses .
The maverick inventor of the wind - up radio , Trevor Bayliss , is a proud local and would surely approve of ChisnallÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vision for the island : Ã¢â¬ÅYou must realise that what goes on here is the expression of the latent desire among the young to get away from mass media and regimentation ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said during EelpilandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heyday ."
2016-07-12,"Wander around Glasgow this summer and you can experience some quite extraordinary performances .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Tilda Swinton playing David Bowie , a Willy Wonka - style promenade through the TunnockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Teacakes factory and a re - enactment of Black Friday .
Want to see them ?
Well , they exist on posters dotted around the city , but are only brought to glorious life in the imagination of the viewer .
It makes us collaborators , and creates a space in which anything can happen These theatrical extravaganzas are part of the Imaginary festival , created by Andy Field and other artists and produced by Jackie Wylie , the former artistic director of the Arches , the sudden closure of which in 2015 was like a wrecking ball through the creativity of a city that always punched well above its weight in its number of artists and the scope of their influence internationally .
GlasgowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s artists are bloodied but unbowed .
The Imaginary festival is a glorious reminder of the need to keep fighting for what seems like the impossible .
It reflects GlasgowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s artistsÃ¢â¬ â¢ determination to keep the city which , ever since it was European Capital of Culture in 1990 , has been a fearless place full of possibilities for artists and audiences .
It is not an exaggeration to say that the effects of being European Capital of Culture are still felt .
The opening of the Imaginary festival coincided with the launch of ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
All Allowed , an exquisitely produced book edited by Deirdre Heddon and Dominic Johnson and published by the Live Art Development Agency .
It charts the life , work and performances of Adrian Howells , who died in 2014 .
Howells was an artist who worked in unexpected locations and was gifted with a delicate skill in audience interaction .
His performances were always full of infinite possibility , not least in making you confront your own self .
The book celebrates not just his pioneering approach to intimate and one - on - one performance but also his generosity as a performer and a collaborator , and the way his own mental health issues were intrinsic to his work .
It is , as Adrian himself would have said , Ã¢â¬Ågorge - arseÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
There are perceptive essays from Tim Crouch ( who worked with Howells on The Author ) , Jennifer Doyle , Marcia Farquhar , Rosana Cade and many others .
It is not just a celebration of an extraordinary body of work but also a handbook for those working in the tricky , ethically fraught area of intimate performance ; of how to negotiate the territory in order to explore the greatest of all possibilities and yet also ensure the safety of audiences and makers .
Towards the end of the book , there is moving account of a round table discussion in which Glasgow artists talk about the hole left behind by Adrian , how that hole canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be filled and yet how the community must move on , in the spirit that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åall
allowedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( which was AdrianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s motto ) , because thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the only way the possibilities can be sustained .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all the more true in the wake of the closure of the Arches .
The launch of the Adrian Howells Award for Intimate Performance provides an opportunity for a Scottish based artist to develop and present a new performance based project in Glasgow and London .
The award , and projects such as the Imaginary festival , remind us that the spirit of both the Arches and of Adrian Howells is alive and that GlasgowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s artists and producers are determined to create new programmes of work , make the space for a diverse community of artists to flourish , and ensure that Glasgow retains its national and international significance as a place where possibilities are turned into realities and there are no limits on the imagination ."
2016-07-14,"At 8 am on 11 January this year , Paul MorleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mobile phone rang next to his bed .
He had set a late alarm because heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been up until 5 am writing a BBC radio script about visiting art galleries , which mentioned David Bowie and which had been written to an early - hours soundtrack of Bowie songs .
On his voicemail he heard a young man briefly apologising in case he had not heard the news that Bowie had died : could he comment on the Today programme that morning ?
Once he had absorbed the initial shock of finding out that the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åcheering , on - going lifeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ had ended two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his 27th album , Blackstar , Morley decided to avoid answering his phone for the rest of the day .
It then became clear to him that Ã¢â¬Åthe only way I could begin to say what I wanted to say about David Bowie was to write a bookÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Anyone could have written a book solely comprising the memories , tributes , odes , affectionate jokes and straightforward obituaries of Bowie that emerged in a rush during that raw January week .
Morley says that , instead , he chose to write the only sort of book that he could have written about Bowie : part love letter , part biography , part autobiography , part theoretical framework for life .
For Morley , it appears that Ã¢â¬Åeveryone has their own BowieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Åeven Bowie himself was only a contributorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to the idea and the ideal that Bowie became .
The notion that there are lots of Bowies , and that he is a sort of human compass , pointing the way for misfits adrift and repressed in a world of conformity , comes most obviously from the fact that he changed his sound and his appearance repeatedly throughout the 1960s and 70s without diminishing the qualities that made him so magnetic to his fans .
But he is not just Aladdin Sane , or the Thin White Duke , or LabyrinthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Jareth : he is an Ã¢â¬Åinfinitely interpretableÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ cipher , Ã¢â¬Åa hypersensitive light entertainer who was amazingly also a socioÃ¢â¬âhistorical antenna , for some not their cold , bitter cup of tea at all , and for some a glorious almost saintly way of defining their difficult , lonely outsider - nessÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie infused pop music Ã¢â¬ â cheap music , as NoÃÂ«l Coward called it Ã¢â¬ â with artÃ¢â¬ â¢ s endless possibilities ; his first love was jazz and he spent his life reading books as though he needed them more than food .
Morley finds BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s socio - historical antenna significant Ã¢â¬ â he was both a product of his time and someone who made an artistic career out of anticipating what was to come next .
Born out of wedlock in 1947 into Ã¢â¬Åan anonymous working familyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , David Jones came from Brixton , moved to suburban Kent in the early 1950s , passed the 11Ã¢â¬âplus but chose to go to technical school instead of grammar school , and spent his teens making the best of two extraordinary strokes of luck .
The first was that his most inspiring teacher , Owen Frampton , was also his art teacher , who encouraged the idea that Ã¢â¬Åeducation could be about joy , and changeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and got his students to think about design and advertising as facets of art .
In effect , Bowie took this to mean that you could combine all three at once , using his own body as the design ; his teasing , opaque interview persona as the advertising ; and pop music as a mutable vessel for serious art .
Second , having decided at school that he wanted to become a jazz saxophonist ( on hearing this , the careers officer at Bromley Tech advised him to get an apprenticeship in a local harpÃ¢â¬âmaking factory ) , he looked up teachers in the phone book and found that Ronnie Ross Ã¢â¬ â sometime player with the Modern Jazz Quartet Ã¢â¬
â lived around the corner in Orpington .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s jazz training defined the incomparable precision - cum - imprecision of his music , which approximated an infinite number of existing styles and melodies , yet came out sounding like nothing , and no one , else .
Morley , an obsessive Bowie fan since first hearing him on John PeelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Radio 1 show in 1970 , gets to the heart of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢
s appeal by wearing his heart on his sleeve .
For someone who loves not just pop music but everything Ã¢â¬ â the artifice , social significance , glamour and dress codes
Ã¢â¬ â that goes with it
, Bowie remains an obvious exemplar of its possibilities .
The art critic Dan FoxÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recent book , Pretentiousness , defends the bravery of pretension , and the idea of overreaching , in culture : it makes the rest of us a bit more brave , or at least open to the idea that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s better to try hard and look silly than not to try at all .
This is exactly what Bowie did for millions of people , including Morley , a music critic whose writing Ã¢â¬ â going back to his days as the NMEÃ¢â¬ â¢ s resident cultural theorist in the late 1970s and 80s Ã¢â¬ â has attracted regular sneers of the PseudÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Corner variety , for daring to read depth into something that appears shallow .
When asked to advise the curators of the Victoria and Albert MuseumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s huge exhibition of Bowie artefacts in 2013 , MorleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s contribution was the Ã¢â¬Åconceptual kit / concrete poem / manifestoÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , David Bowie Is Ã¢â¬ Â¦ , which became the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s title .
Throughout this book , he lists the many various ways in which Bowie is , including the psychoanalytical Ã¢â¬ÅBowie is where we start fromÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie is always changing , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ my four - year - old son tells me when we play his records .
I start to say , Ã¢â¬ÅWell , he was always changingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and then realise thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not the point .
Bowie is new to my son and therefore still alive .
This is precisely MorleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s thesis , which he examines over 496 pages of clearly rushed , sometimes repetitive , but engaging writing .
Bowie will stay alive , and will continue to keep changing , for as long as we are able to listen to his music Ã¢â¬ â and for as long as we can look at pictures of him , reminisce and think about him .
Morley ends his moving paean by imagining Bowie , close to the end of his life , crouching in a cupboard as he films the video for his final single , Lazarus , in which Ã¢â¬ â it became clear Ã¢â¬ â
he told us he was dying .
In MorleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vision , Bowie sits in the dark , thinking about the life he has had , wondering if it can possibly get any darker in there , when Ã¢â¬Åa voice says I just wanted to say thank you .
Thank you for everything.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â¢ Lynsey HanleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s

2016-07-22,"A previously unreleased David Bowie album is set to be released .
The Gouster , recorded in 1974 , was BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s experiment in soul and funk , which later morphed into Young Americans , released in 1975 .
It will appear later this year in a box set ,
Who Can I Be Now ?
( 1974 - 1976 ) .
The release was announced via BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s official Facebook page , which also printed an excerpt from the sleeve notes , written by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime producer Tony Visconti .
Visconti wrote : Gouster was a word unfamiliar to me but David knew it as a type of dress code worn by African American teens in the 60s , in Chicago .
But in the context of the album its meaning was attitude , an attitude of pride and hipness .
Of all the songs we cut
, we were enamoured of the ones we chose for the album that portrayed this attitude .
David had a long infatuation with soul , as did I.
We were fans of the TV show Soul Train .
We werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Ã¢â¬Ëyoung , gifted and blackÃ¢â¬ â¢ but we sure as hell wanted to make a killer soul album , which was quite insane , but pioneers like the Righteous Brothers were there before us .
So The Gouster began with the outrageous , brand new , funkified version of DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s classic John , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m Only Dancing , a single he wrote and recorded in 1972 , only this time our version sounded like it was played live in a loft party in Harlem and he added ( Again ) to the title .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t the two - and - a - half - minute length of the original either .
We maxed out at virtually seven minutes !
With the time limitations of vinyl ( there was a big volume drop with more than 18 minutes a side ) , we could only fit two other long songs on side one ,
Somebody
Up There Likes Me and ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Gon na Be Me , both about six and a half minute songs .
We had hit the 20-minute mark .
Technically that worked because ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Gon
na Be Me had lots of quiet sections where the record groove could be safely made narrower and that would preserve the apparent loudness of side one .
Side two also hit the 20-minute mark , with Can You Hear Me saving the day with its quiet passages .
Forty minutes of glorious funk , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what it was and
thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how I thought it would be .
The Gouster was recorded in Philadelphia in August 1974 , and Visconti was ready to take the tapes back to London to mix , when Bowie met John Lennon in December 1974 .
Back home , Visconti forged ahead with the mix until he received a phone call .
He later recalled : Ã¢â¬ÅA week or so later I was in London mixing the album and I got a call from David .
Ã¢â¬ËEr , Tony .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know how to tell you this
but John and I wrote a song together
and we recorded and mixed it .
ItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s called Fame Ã¢â¬ Â¦ David apologised for not including me .
There wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t time left to send for me , because of the release date constraints .
For me , it wouldÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been the most wonderful experience of my recording career .

2016-07-25,"Following a well - received run in New York , Lazarus , a hallucinatory musical co - written by David Bowie and Enda Walsh , will land in London this autumn .
Lazarus is based on The Man Who Fell to Earth , the story of a humanoid alien left stranded and unable to die , after being driven from drought on his own planet .
The novel , by Walter Tevis , was first adapted into a film starring Bowie in 1976 Ã¢â¬ â this new stage version interpolates Bowie songs into a more impressionistic take on the material .
Dexter and Six Feet
Under actor Michael C Hall , who plays the central alien character Newton , will reprise the role alongside fellow original cast members Michael Esper and Sophia Anne Caruso .
The production is directed by Ivo van Hove , the Dutch tyro already known to London audiences for his visually striking takes on classics such as A View from the Bridge and Antigone .
Lazarus emerged suddenly in late 2015 , part of the burst of creativity at the end of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life that also included his album Blackstar Ã¢â¬ â songs from that album appear alongside the likes of Changes , Heroes and This Is Not America .
Critics praised the production , though they were also a little perplexed .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat they have created makes perilously little sense , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alexis Soloski , but Ã¢â¬ÅitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nearly impossible not to be persuaded and baffled and at least a little thrilledÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ben Brantley of the New York Times wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅListening to the characters talk , your response is likely to be either an irritated Ã¢â¬ÅOh , please , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ or a dumbfounded Ã¢â¬ËHuh?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ , but he added that the musical numbers were Ã¢â¬Åice - cold bolts of ecstasy [ that ] shoot like novas through the glamorous muddle and murkÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .

The London production opens on 25 October and runs until 21 January 2017 , at the Kings Cross Theatre .

2016-07-25,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Young Americans look is perhaps his most beloved sartorial creation .
Unlike Ziggy Stardust , it was less of a costume and more naturalistic , seemingly circling back to the blue - eyed David Jones who had duck - quiff hair , played saxophone and wanted to be the British Elvis .
Now , thanks to an archive release and the influence of Vetements on the high street , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s set to be a key menswear look for the summer .
Created during his Diamond Dogs tour ,
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
silhouette was almost triangular .
His skinny frame emphasised the width of his trousers and his caramel - orange quiff mullet .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s suit jackets sat ribboned around his arms with elevated shoulders , which perched like tiny mountain peaks , and his ties were fat and knotted like a babyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fist .
Like many pop stars ( Madonna and Maripol , FKA Twigs and Chola ) , Bowie took aesthetic elements from the underground .
In this case it was the Gouster look .
The singer had named a whole album Ã¢â¬ â set to be released soon Ã¢â¬ â after it .
As producer Tony Visconti explained : Ã¢â¬ÅGouster was a word unfamiliar to me but David knew it as a type of dress code worn by African American teens in the 60s , in Chicago.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The look was extravagant in its appearance , and width was a common feature .
Large brimmed hats , shirts , jackets with big collars and trousers with multiple pleats .
The shoes had pointed toes , brass buttons and suspender braces .
It was big , bold , edgy and contrasted with the conservative and wholesome Ivy look , which provided a rival sartorial contrast in Chicago .
The exaggerated , oversize aesthetic is very Summer 2016 .
The high street is catching up with Demna GvasaliaÃ¢â¬
â¢ s reframing of the male silhouette ( via Vetements and Balenciaga ) , but broad is very much in , with the width of T - shirts , shirts and smart trousers opening up like never before ."
2016-07-25,"Unreleased material , remastered versions and live recordings created during David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s American phase will be compiled in a new box set entitled
Who Can I Be Now ?
Centred around 1974 - 76 , it includes the previously announced unreleased Bowie album
The Gouster , recorded in 1974 , which found the star experimenting with the soul and funk that later became Young Americans .
According to Tony Visconti Ã¢â¬ â who mastered The Gouster Ã¢â¬ â the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s name came from a Ã¢â¬Åtype of dress code worn by African American teens in the 60s , in Chicago , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
but in the context of the album its meaning was Ã¢â¬Åan attitude of pride and hipness .
Of all the songs we cut
, we were enamoured of the ones we chose for the album that portrayed this attitude.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The box set also features Re : call 2 , which brings together the single edits and b - sides from this period .
An Australian edit of Diamond Dogs , previously only available in that country , will also appear .
Newly remastered versions of albums Diamond Dogs , Young Americans and Station to Station will also appear , as well as live albums David Live from 1974 and Live Nassau Coliseum Ã¢â¬ â¢ 76 .
This latest posthumous release follows 2015Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Five Years , which captured his musical phase between 1969 to 1973 , and can be purchased on 13-LP , 12-CD box set and digital download .
Aside from his musical output , the box set will come with a book displaying rare and unpublished photos of the star alongside famous press reviews and detailed notes about the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creation written by Visconti and Henry Maslin .
Who Can I Be Now ? is released on 23 September .
Full details of the tracklist can be found on the official David Bowie website ."
2016-07-25,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stage musical Lazarus , a sequel to The Man
Who Fell to Earth , is to open in London a year after its sold - out run in New York .
The showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s producers announced that it would open at KingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Cross Theatre in November and run until January 2017 , almost mirroring last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s run at the New York Theatre Workshop .
Lazarus was one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last projects , and he made his final public appearance , before his death in January , at the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opening last December .
Michael C Hall , best known as an affable serial killer in the TV show Dexter , will reprise his leading role as alien Thomas Newton , the character Bowie made famous in the 1976 Nicolas Roeg movie .
Written by Bowie and Enda Walsh , the show was well received by critics although the GuardianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Alexis Soloski said in her review : Ã¢â¬ÅIt will be many years before we see a jukebox musical as unapologetically weird as Lazarus.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Giving it four stars she praised the Ã¢â¬Ådedication and verveÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of the creative team and cast and concluded :
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nearly impossible not to be persuaded and baffled and at least a little thrilled.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the New York Times review Ben Brantley called it Ã¢â¬Ågreat - sounding , great - looking and mind - numbingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Lazarus , a sequel to Walter TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel , is directed by one of the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most in - demand directors , the Belgian Ivo van Hove who cancelled another major project in 2015 in order to be able to work on the Bowie show .
The show features Newton , an alien who arrived on Earth on a quest to send water to his doomed , dehydrated planet , now residing in an empty Manhattan penthouse , living off gin and Twinkies .
It features new songs written by Bowie but mostly numbers from his back catalogue , including Changes , Absolute Beginners and Heroes .
The New York run sold out within hours .
It begins previews in London on 25 October and runs until 22 January ."
2016-07-30,"Six months and three weeks after David Bowie died , musicians still feel compelled to give their tributes , to sing those songs that shaped their lives .
It was almost unsurprising when the Bowie prom was announced , promising Bowie with a twist Ã¢â¬ â but who really wants Bowie with a twist ?
Bowie was the twist : the wayward Bromley boy who turned himself into a peculiar pop art project , perfectly .
Bowie generally treated reverence with contempt , too : heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d probably have shivered at the idea of a night like tonight .
Before the gig , though , signs look promising .
Berlin - based conductor AndrÃ Â© de Ridder is the eveningÃ¢â¬ â¢ s curator and director , and has reworked music by other , younger wayward musicians like Deerhoof and Efterklang with his experimental collective , stargaze ( who are centre stage tonight ) .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
gig in front of the Reichstag was also one of de RidderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life - changing rock experiences , although that was the 1987 Glass Spider era , where bloated silliness outweighed Our DaveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more superlative stuff .
But de Ridder has also been thinking about Bowie the contemporary musician , goes the programme , and the legacy of his last album , Blackstar .
So when tonight starts with the band standing erect , and effects raging round the room that sound like mad birds or insects circling , hopes are high .
The next 20 minutes become a disappointing variation of a jukebox musical , however , with a fairly straight orchestral rendering of Warszawa from 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Low , and 1976Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Station to Station sung faithfully by Neil Hannon and Amanda Palmer .
Nothing new , unexpected or dynamic is brought to the mix .
This continues for much of the night .
The first welcome shock is the inclusion of This Is Not America ,
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1985 film track with the Pat Metheny Group Ã¢â¬
â although a new middle - eight rap by Elf Kid feels like progressiveness for progressivenessÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sake .
Other artists push things further , and better .
Anna Calvi delivers a brilliantly bombastic Lady Grinning Soul , oozing Scott Walker - style drama Ã¢â¬ â
sheÃ¢â¬
â¢ s the first singer tonight not to appear afraid of the material .
The Blue NileÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Paul Buchanan makes a rare and beautiful appearance , particularly on a stunningly vulnerable take on BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Everything Away .
Laura MvulaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocals also give guts and edge to Girl Loves Me , while Palmer and Marc AlmondÃ¢â¬ â¢ s singalongs through Heroes and Starman feel far too obvious , like funeral karaoke .
Most of the audience adore both , though , clapping wildly along .
Maybe this is the Bowie many fans crave .
Two other interpreters feel much more in tune with the spirit the maker of Blackstar left behind as the concert passes midnight .
Counter - tenor Phillippe JarousskyÃ¢â¬ â¢
s take on
Always Crashing
In The Same Car is sparse and challenging , reinventing the song entirely .
Then John Cale arrives , wearing an overcoat , scarf and a skirt .
In the hands of a Velvet Underground member who influenced Bowie in the first place , ValentineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Day becomes a dark , electronic elegy , Sorrow a buzzing , gothic anthem , and Space Oddity an excursion into trip - hop , lifted high by the House Gospel Choir .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
star burns the strongest here tonight , and the blackest , into the next day ."
2016-07-31,"Online spending on films , music and games in the UK has bounced back , thanks to Star Wars :
The Force Awakens and consumers buying the back catalogues of David Bowie and Prince .
More than a third of shoppers in the physical entertainment market bought a product with the online retailer Amazon in the 12 weeks to 3 June .
This helped the company to achieve its highest ever share of spending on DVDs , Blu - rays , CDs and games outside the Christmas period , according to Kantar Worldpanel .
Online sales of physical entertainment products stuttered during 2015 as the high street , led by HMV , made a fightback .
Consumers , however , have turned back to Amazon and other online sites because of the size of their catalogue as they look for classic songs and albums by Prince and David Bowie , who both died this year .
Prince sold more albums during the 12-week period than any artist apart from Adele .
Sales of CDs more than six months old grew by 9 % year on year , helped by Prince and Bowie .
No music titles , however , made it into the top 30 entertainment products for the quarter .
Following its box office success , the latest Star Wars movie was the bestselling title in the entertainment market , with 1.8 million shoppers picking up a copy of the DVD or Blu - ray .
Tesco was the big winner , taking nearly a third of all spending on the product .
TescoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s overall sales fell 0.5 % in the entertainment sector , meaning its market share dropped slightly to 15.2 % .
On the high street , HMVÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sales rose 2.3 % year on year , increasing its market share from 14 % to 16.3 % .
AmazonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sales rose 0.5 % , increasing its share of spending from 22.5 % to 23 % .
Fiona Keenan , KantarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s strategic insight director , said : Ã¢â¬ÅStar Wars :
The Force Awakens has become the biggest Blu - ray film title since Avatar over six years ago and there are signs it has helped get people back into the market Ã¢â¬ â encouraging , given the competition Blu - ray and DVDs face from digital streaming services such as Netflix .
Ã¢â¬ÅOnline spend across the industry has bounced back from declines over the past year and now accounts for over a third of spend Ã¢â¬ â
the highest it has been since this time in 2015 .
Ã¢â¬ÅHaving the availability of a wide back catalogue means online retailers are extremely well placed to cater to changes in consumer demand , as exemplified by the recent surge in sales of Bowie and Prince albums following the death of both iconic artists earlier this year.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-08-07,"When is a band T - shirt a piece of merchandise , and when is it part of a high - fashion capsule collection ?
The blurring of the lines has been brought jarringly to the fore with American department store Barneys elling T - shirts from punk band Black Flag for a whopping $ 250 ( ÃÂ£201 ) .
The Black Flag tee comes in brushed Japanese cotton cashmere and sits alongside similarly priced tops from David Bowie , Joy Division , Run DMC and more .
In terms of copyright , when a band logo is not trademarked , the designer has questionable legal claim over it .
The Black Flag logo was designed by Raymond Pettibon , and there have been various unresolved claims over the work ( not helped by the fact Pettibon is the brother of band founder Greg Ginn ) .
There have been similar wranglings around the Rolling Stones and the AC / DC logo ; Gerard Huerta , who designed the latterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s image in the 70s , is said to have received no royalties from it .
Rob OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Connor , creative director at Stylerouge , the people behind BlurÃ¢â¬ â¢ s logo , says : Ã¢â¬ÅYou are the intellectual property owner of the work , according to the 1988 Patent Act , until you sign that right away.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
But other things can get in the way : Ã¢â¬ÅThere might be nothing in writing to say you created it , or someone may have redesigned it slightly and then itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s credited to someone else .
Or an old manager or record company could have extended the copyright without asking ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Or you could be a friend of the band who just did them a favour .
Mark Wagstaff was asked by the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s manager to design a logo for 80s goth band Gaye Bykers on Acid .
Ã¢â¬ÅI designed the Purple Fluid Exchange logo for an extra tenner on top of the tenner I was getting to paint her flat , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he explains .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was no mention of copyright.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
As OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Connor says : Ã¢â¬ÅDecisions are made with goodwill , but when business comes into play , everything changes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The high price of the Barneys T - shirts reflects the fact that much band merchandise now exists firmly in the same rarefied space as high - fashion items .
Collabs are the new black Fashion labels have been collaborating with bands for years , but this year they are on an equal footing .
Kanye WestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s video for Wolves in collaboration with Balmain played as a high - end ad for the brand , while Rihanna has worked closely with Puma , Dior , Manolo Blahnik and Stance for her sliders , shades , boots and socks .
The golden age of tour merch Musicians such as BeyoncÃ Â© , Kanye West , Selena Gomez and Drake have all ushered in what MTV has called Ã¢â¬Åthe golden age of tour merchÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Musicians have also created clothing lines , from WestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Yeezy , BeyoncÃ
Â© Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Ivy Park to DrakeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OVO , with plenty of crossover between the catwalk and the merch stand .
As well as getting fashion designers involved ( the clothes for Justin BieberÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Purpose tour were overseen by Jerry Lorenzo from the Fear of God label ) , merch is getting more on trend :
GomezÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Revival tour stand featured sew - on patches , temporary tattoos and Ã¢â¬ÅathleisureÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ sports bras .
The pop - up promo
In 1994 , Prince opened the first pop - up clothes and merchandise shop in Camden , selling merchandise and clothes .
In 2012 , rap collective Odd Future opened shops all over the world featuring clothes from their Spongebob meets Jeremy Scott / Wolf Gang collection .
Now everyone Ã¢â¬ â most recently Drake and Rihanna Ã¢â¬ â has pop - up stores .

ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s done out of nostalgia Ã¢â¬ â not only for a bygone musical era , but also for the looser cuts and tailoring of those days a look that aligns with the oversized look that was all over the catwalks in the past few seasons ."
2016-08-21,"The BBC has sold the rights to theme tunes and music from hit shows including Idris ElbaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Luther , Doctor Who and Wolf Hall .
BMG , the music company with artists including David Bowie , Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Roger Waters , Keith Richards and Mick Jagger and Iron Maiden , has snapped up the potentially highly lucrative rights to more than 1,000 copyrights to theme tunes , background music and music cues in BBC shows .
BBC Worldwide , the commercial arm of the BBC , only looks to sell the music rights to shows once every five or so years when it has built a decent archive of music from more recent shows .
Under the terms of the deal , BMG has acquired the rights to theme tunes from hit BBC programmes including Luther , Mrs BrownÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Boys and Frozen Planet as well as background , or incidental , music from Doctor
Who and Wolf Hall .
The catalogue includes works by Bafta - nominated composers including Murray Gold , for Doctor
Who , Paul Englishby for Luther and Debbie Wiseman for Wolf Hall .
Alexi Cory - Smith , the executive vice - president of BMG UK , said : Ã¢â¬ÅIt is a real honour to be entrusted with these great BBC works .
Shows like Luther , Doctor Who and Mrs BrownÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Boys and many others in this catalogue are household names .
We are committed to providing them with similarly unrivalled service and transparency.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
While BMG will now have the right to exploit the music for commercial use by companies including advertisers , studios and ad agencies , the BBC will retain a tight rein on ensuring its assets are not exploited negatively .
BBC Worldwide has a similar brand protection in place in its deal with Immediate Media , which publishes its portfolio of magazines including Radio Times and Top Gear , with the corporation continuing to have brand oversight of its key assets .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re looking forward to working with BMG to ensure the value of these compositions continues to be properly and appropriately recognised , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Dominic Walker , the director of radio and music at BBC Worldwide .
BMG owns a range of music catalogues including Chrysalis , which includes artists such as Blondie , Yeah
Yeah Yeahs , Gossip and David Gray , and Virgin Music , which includes publishing rights for Tears for Fears , Take That , Robbie Williams , Nirvana , Duffy and Iggy Pop ."
2016-08-22,"When David Bowie lived in Berlin between late 1976 and 1978 , the late singer - songwriter once told Uncut magazine , what he learned to appreciate most about the city was that he could move around in Ã¢â¬Åvirtual anonymity Ã¢â¬ Â¦ For some reason , Berliners just didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t care.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Forty years after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s move there , and seven months after his death , Berliners have now done their best to show that they do care about his legacy after all .
On Monday , a throng of several hundred fans , high - profile politicians and former friends brought traffic to a standstill on the main road through west BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s SchÃÂ¶neberg district to witness the unveiling of a plaque commemorating the time Bowie lived there in a flatshare with Iggy Pop .
The Ã¢âÂ¬3,400 ( ÃÂ£2,900 ) plaque Ã¢â¬ â made of bone china and quoting the chorus of Berlin - inspired hit Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â had been signed off by the senate in spite of it usually requiring a five - year waiting period to make sure the deceased figure is really as historically significant as it seems at the time of death .
In BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s case , BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mayor , Michael MÃÂ¼ller , said , there had been no question over the British artistÃ¢â¬
â¢ s significance .
Bowie had played a key role in fostering BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åsense of being a city of culture , creativity and openness Ã¢â¬ Â¦
David Bowie belongs to Berlin , David Bowie belongs to us , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the Social Democrat politician said .
The only thing that still puzzled him , the mayor said , was BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s decision to seek out Berlin as a kind of rehab clinic , to help him kick his drug habit Ã¢â¬ â a counterintuitive move , given that the city had its own reputation for substance abuse in the 1970s .
Ã¢â¬ÅMaybe he didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know our city very well when he made that decision , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ MÃÂ¼ller said .
While Iggy Pop by his own description Ã¢â¬Åmoved to Berlin in rude health and left as a wreckÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , Bowie managed to convert the new - found anonymity for a phase of creative experimentation , resulting in the three albums often referred to as the Ã¢â¬ÅBerlin trilogyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â Low , Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Lodger , inspired by Berlin but recorded in Switzerland and the US .
Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , supposedly inspired by a young couple kissing against the backdrop of the Berlin Wall which Bowie had spied upon from a window at KreuzbergÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Hansa recording studio , ended up feeding back into the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own folklore .
When Bowie played Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ at an open - air concert on the western side of the wall in 1987 , thousands of East German fans reportedly sang along to the song on the other side of the barrier that divided the city between 1961 and 1989
Ã¢â¬ â
some say it even inspired a wave of dissident protests against the GDR regime .
Bowie had sought out the flat on Hauptstrasse 155 because of the areaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åbleak , anonymous , and culturally lostÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ character , according to his first wife , Angie , a feel the area retains .
Other than the new memorial , nothing gives away the cultural significance of the building now wedged between a tattoo parlour , a book store and a studio offering Ã¢â¬Åpsychotherapy and massagesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The plaqueÃ¢â¬ â¢ s manufacturers , KPM ( The Royal Porcelain Factory in Berlin ) , have confirmed that should it be stolen , it can be replaced within 24 hours , which may be construed by Bowie memorabilia collectors as an something of an invitation .
On Monday morning , as MÃÂ¼ller lifted a curtain to display the plaque and fans rushed forward to take selfies next to the memorial , a couple of uninterested passersby pushed through the throng on their way to the shops .
Evidently , some Berliners still donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t care .

2016-08-29,"As David Bowie might have sung : is there life on HD164595b ?
A Russian radio telescope scanning the skies has observed Ã¢â¬Åa strong signalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ from a nearby star , HD164595 , in the constellation Hercules .
The star is a scant 95 light years away and 99 % of the size of EarthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own sun .
It has at least one planet , HD164595b , which is about the size of Neptune and has a 40-day year .
Seth Shostak of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute ( Seti ) in Mountain View , California , told the Guardian he was shocked to have learned of the discovery only now
Ã¢â¬ â the readings from Russian radio telescope Ratan-600
, Shostak said , were taken a year ago .
Seti , a private organization , searches the skies for alien life and has been underwritten by US government divisions as diverse as Nasa and the Department of Energy .
Operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences ,
Ratan-600Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
primary area of focus is monitoring the sun , though it has contributed to SetiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work .
The news came to international attention on Saturday through Claudio Maccone of the University of Turin in Italy , who attended a talk by the scientists who recorded the signal on 15 May 2015 .
Maccone passed data from the presentation to the science and science - fiction writer Paul Gilster , who maintains a blog about interstellar exploration called Centauri Dreams .
Maccone sent the Guardian his proposed presentation for the International Academy of Astronautics 2016 meeting on the subject of the search for alien life , set for 27 September .
He will call for the permanent monitoring of HD164595 .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe power of the signal received is not unrealistic for type I civilizations , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he wrote .
The phrase Ã¢â¬Åtype
I civilizationÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ is a designation on the Kardashev scale , named for Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev developed in the 1960s and described in English in his 1985 paper On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations .
A type I civilization would be similar to the current development of technology on earth .
Ã¢â¬ÅCould it be an ET?Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
asked Shostak rhetorically .
Ã¢â¬ÅOf course , but [ Ratan-600 ] didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have a receiver that has any spectral resolution.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The receiver on the Russian radio telescope is very wide , which aids it in its primary mission of monitoring solar activity but also means that , like a terrestrial radio receiving a news station , rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll station and country station at the same time , it is difficult to discern which band is broadcasting at which frequency .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey have a receiver that would swallow a big chunk of the radio dial at once , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Shostak said .
Because the receiver covers such a big sweep of the radio dial , it is hard to tell if the signal comes from intelligent life .
If it is being broadcast across a large chunk of the radio spectrum , the noise is probably coming from a quasar or another source of stellar Ã¢â¬ÅnoiseÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ; if it is over a narrower band but very strong , it is likelier to be the product of intelligence .
Gilster said he was curious about the possibility that the signal could be caused by Ã¢â¬ÅmicrolensingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â a quirk of gravity that occurs when massive objects like stars or quasars are aligned behind another heavenly body .
Ã¢â¬ÅMy own thought is that this is very possibly a one - time signal , much like the famous WOW !
signal some years back , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Gilster said .
On 15 August 1977 , astronomer Jerry Ehman received a powerful radio signal from a group of stars called Chi Sagittarii ; he circled the surprising spot on the readout and wrote Ã¢â¬ÅWOW!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The signal never returned .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf it too doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t repeat
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Gilster , Ã¢â¬Åthen we wonÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know what it was , including the possibility of some kind of local signal whose source just hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been figured out.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Shostak said he wished he had been made aware of the signal earlier .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhy is it that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re hearing about this now because one of the guys gave a talk in Moscow a year
ago?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he asked .
Ã¢â¬ÅMacconeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
explanation is that the Russians are Ã¢â¬ËshyÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
[ But ] itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s generally accepted procedure in the Seti community if you find a signal that you think is interesting , you call up people in another observatory and say :
Ã¢â¬ËHey , hereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the position in the sky ,
Ã¢â¬ â¢ and you see what happens.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Gilster said his understanding was that the Russian team had spent the past year analyzing and confirming its data .
Shostak told the Guardian that SetiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own radio telescope was scanning the coordinates in question in search of the promising signal as of Sunday night .
That evening , though , everything was quiet .
The Russian radio telescope team and Maccone have been contacted for comment ."
2016-08-30,"This country , it has often been observed , seems to have provided a disproportionately enormous amount of entertainment that is hugely popular around the globe .
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s start , as the book does on its front cover ( the design referencing the back cover of Abbey Road ) , with the Beatles ; then there is the enduring popularity of Sherlock Holmes , Agatha Christie , Doctor Who , the Rolling Stones , James Bond , David Bowie , Alfred Hitchcock Ã¢â¬
Â¦
This is a tricky one , though .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a great premise , and I dived into , and splashed around in , this book gleefully at first .
Here were lucid and often amusing expositions on the work of Lennon and McCartney , Ian Fleming , JRR Tolkien , Christie ( although I skimmed through the bits on her rapidly : Sandbrook warns us that there are spoilers , ie murderers revealed , and I am right in the middle of The Murder at the Vicarage ) .
His exasperation at the gulf between LennonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cupidity and the lugubrious piety of Imagine is instructive and funny ; and the case he makes for Tolkien is plausible and instructive Ã¢â¬
â
I hadnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t picked up on the parallels between Gollum and Cain , for instance .
( Or , when dealing with the Harry Potter books , between Potter and TH WhiteÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Once and Future King . )
However , there is a problem with this book , and it is that Sandbrook , while an extremely engaging historian , seems to be operating to a simple agenda .
So while he inclines to the view that
Patrick McGoohanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1960s TV show The Prisoner was made up as it went along , and notices the way it portrays a kind of nightmare Butlins and expresses a yearning for individual freedom Ã¢â¬ â
he doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t quite join these dots , or say where he is going with it ( for example : exploring the love / hate relationship we have with our institutions ) .
We do not , by the end of the book , have any explanation as to why these islands are so good at popular culture .
There are also some mysterious inclusions .
Do we need a dozen pages on Billy Bunter ?
Or so much on John Braine ?
Or Flashman ?
Of course , any book that deals with popular British culture is going to have to take in the fact that two of our most popular artistes are Andrew Lloyd Webber and Elton John .
Sandbrook grasps these nettles bravely , paying particular attention to JohnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s courage in coming out , which possibly changed more attitudes in Britain than even BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s calculated flirtation with bisexuality and androgyny .
In his books on Britain in the 1950s and 60s , Sandbrook has covered some of this ground before .
But he doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t repeat himself , and his scope is wider than heretofore Ã¢â¬ â he notices , for instance , how ingrained Charles DickensÃ¢â¬ â¢
s influence is , still , in popular entertainment .
( And , at the other end of the timescale , salutes the success of Grand Theft Auto . )
But this started me thinking about something that was missing , contemporaneous with Dickens : surely a book calling itself The Great British Dream Factory that deals with the most popular and enduring national cultural artefacts and yet doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t mention the Alice books has fallen at a rather crucial hurdle .
After all , they are the spring of a powerful current of British surrealism , and the best indicator of how powerfully weird the British imagination can be .
One can only speculate as to the reasons for their omission .
So hereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s my speculation : Sandbrook doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like the books .
Nor do they fit into his theories , having little to do with class or ( anti-)intellectual snobbery .
( He likes poking fun at intellectuals . )
Well , nobody and nothing is perfect .
There are after all 550 pages before we get to the notes , on subjects about which everyone has opinions .
It would be impossible to please everyone .
But when Sandbrook is pleasing , he is very pleasing indeed ."
2016-08-31,"TVC 15 is David Bowie at his buoyant best .
Reportedly based on an Iggy Pop hallucination in which the proto - punk star believed the television set was swallowing his girlfriend , the boogie - woogie pop romp was BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s second single from Station to Station in the UK .
A 2010 mix of the track , by the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s original producer , Harry Maslin , is being made available for the first time on the
Who Can I Be Now ?
box set , which celebrates BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career from 1974 to 1976 .
It was reported at the time of Station to StationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s release that Bowie wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t satisfied with the original mix ; this updated version was an attempt to achieve the drier sound theyÃ¢â¬ â¢
d been aiming for while recording it in 1975 .
This version of the song , premiered below , has never been available before digitally or on CD or vinyl .

2016-08-31,"It was a concert which featured tape - recorded bird calls , one band member sawing logs , another throwing potatoes at a gong , a bubble machine causing havoc and a crew member dressed as an admiral throwing daffodils into the audience .
And it changed rock performance for ever , the Victoria and Albert Museum said on Wednesday as it announced details of its big spring 2017 exhibition : a retrospective of Pink Floyd .
The exhibition follows the global success of its David Bowie Is show and was a Ã¢â¬Ågreat fitÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for a museum so dedicated to art , design and performance , said curator Victoria Broackes .
She said the V&amp;A was uniquely placed to stage such a show , adding : Ã¢â¬ÅPink Floyd occupied a distinctive experimental space , consistently pushed artistic boundaries and produced some of the most iconic imagery in popular culture.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The exhibition will feature a laser light show and previously unseen concert footage as well as more than 350 objects and artefacts including instruments , handwritten lyrics , posters , architectural drawings and psychedelic prints .
Tech fans will also be delighted to hear it will have on display something called the Azimuth Co - ordinator , a custom - made quadrophonic speaker system and joysticks which Pink Floyd used to sweep prerecorded sound effects and instruments around a room .
The co - ordinator is already in the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collection and was first used at the concert featuring birds , potatoes and bubbles , held in May 1967 at the newly opened Queen Elizabeth Hall in London .
The gigÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 50th anniversary will coincide with the V&amp;A exhibition .
Billed as offering Ã¢â¬Åspace age relaxation for the climax of spring , electronic composition , colour and image projection , girls and Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the Games for May show was like nothing which had come before it .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs well as amazing their audience ,
their performance that day significantly raised expectations of live rock shows , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Broackes .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was a major turning point for the band and a major turning point for rock music in general.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
drummer , Nick Mason , said the show came at a time when all bands performed the same way , usually on a bill of three acts .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t suit us at all because nearly always we were blown off stage by these far more attractive bands who were actually rather better at playing than we were .
We needed our own space and to do it in our own way , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said It was game - changing , although trampled flowers on the floor and bubble stains on the seats ensured no rock band was invited back to the venue for some time .
The V&amp;A opened ticket sales and announced the exhibition by flying a giant inflatable pink pig near the museumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s entrance , a reference to the inflatable swine which once soared over Battersea power station and featured on the cover of Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1977 album Animals .
Fortunately there was no repeat of what happened 40 years ago when the pig broke free and was sighted by an alarmed airline pilot , leading to the cancellation of flights at Heathrow .
It finally landed at a farm in Kent .
The band were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett , Roger Waters , Richard Wright and Mason .
Barrett , who parted ways with Floyd in 1968 , died in 2006 and Wright died in 2008 .
The remaining members are collaborating for the V&amp;A show .
Mason said he was surprised he and remaining members were still doing things together after 50 years .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf you told me that we would still exist even four years after we started professionally
I would have been surprised .
Now I feel like something thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s owned by the National Trust.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He was a big fan of the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bowie exhibition and predicted big things for the Pink Floyd one .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think we are going to be able to do things that hopefully have never seen or heard before , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Mason .
The V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director , Martin Roth , a self - confessed Floyd fan , said the band were a Ã¢â¬Ågreat British success
storyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and recalled first suggesting working with them during a chance meeting with Mason five years ago .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe looked at me and said : Ã¢â¬ËOh Martin , we are about big sound , huge images and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not sure this works in a museum.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hopefully , the V&amp;A has proved itself more than capable , he added .
The exhibition will also mark the 50th anniversary of the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first single , Arnold Layne , a release which has been followed by more than 200 m record sales .
Unlike the Bowie show , there is no well - ordered archive for the V&amp;A to sift through , but Mason said many lofts were scrabbled through and more than enough personal material was found to include in the show .
Ã¢â¬ÅI did think weÃ¢â¬ â¢ d be short of material .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s turned out to be entirely incorrect .
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t tell you how much stuff wonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fit in , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½

2016-09-01,"Has the V&amp;A gone a veteran rock group too far ?
Will its Pink Floyd exhibition next year put the public into interstellar overdrive or leave us comfortably numb ?
This grand old Victorian museum has sensationally expanded its audiences and horizons in recent years with exhibitions dedicated to Kylie Minogue , David Bowie and Ã¢â¬ â opening on 10 September Ã¢â¬ â the great psychedelic rock age of the late 1960s .
While Kylie may be regarded as a camp fashion - pop detour , David Bowie Is ... proved a massive critical and cultural success , helping to generate a timely comeback for the star and enthusiasm from artists who count among ZiggyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most passionate admirers .
Bowie , in other words , had credibility as art Ã¢â¬ â heck , he was
BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Andy Warhol .
The music featured in this autumnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
You Say
You Want a Revolution ?
is similarly cool , not to mention steeped in artistic associations from WarholÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Factory
to AntonioniÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blow - Up .
But Pink Floyd ?
The monoliths of the concept album ?
The titans of grandiose stadium pomp ?
Is a Pink Floyd exhibition art ?
Is it even style ?
The FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most dedicated fans would have to admit that their cool phase and involvement in contemporary art ended when Syd Barrett left the group in 1968 .
The Lewis Carroll - tinted psychedelic whimsy of early songs such as Arnold Layne and See Emily Play soon gave way to the melancholy cod - philosophy of Roger WatersÃ¢â¬ â¢ lyrics , while the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s innovative 1960s light shows ( undoubtedly reflecting the experimental art of their time ) developed into ambitious but also massively tasteless visual gigantism involving flying pigs and marching hammers .
I was there .
I watched the wall being built brick by brick .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not
a Roger Waters lyric Ã¢â¬
â
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a genuine recollection of a concert .
In my early teens I adored Pink Floyd .
I collected their most obscure early singles , I lay in my room for hours listening to Wish You Were Here .
Punk ?
What was that ?
I was fascinated by this strangely intellectual Ã¢â¬ â or was it pseudo - intellectual ?
Ã¢â¬
â band whose music no living soul has ever tried to dance to .
It all ended when I saw them perform The Wall live at Earls Court in west London .
As a huge wall was built in front of the group , I started to feel more alienated than Roger Waters can ever have intended .
Surely live music should be more ... live ?
I went home and sought out some Bowie , Doors and Velvet Underground .
Yet somehow Pink Floyd have endured the stigma of their absolute unsexiness and unhipness .
They shine on , these crazy diamonds .
I was recently talking to two fellow art critics .
We were from three generations .
The eldest saw Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last ever gig with Syd Barrett in the 1960s ; I saw The Wall in the Thatcher era ; but the youngest turned out to be their keenest fan of all .
It is Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very lack of conventional style and their distance from youth culture Ã¢â¬ â at least since about 1973 Ã¢â¬ â that is fascinating .
They are beyond taste .
They may be a bizarre combination of Spinal Tap and Emile Durkheim , but there is something very honest about their odyssey of disillusion .
Listening to Wish
You Were Here made me dream of being a rock star because anything that promoted this depth of cynical despair had to be a profound experience .
Losing Barrett turned Pink Floyd from dreamy druggy jesters into tragically clear - eyed unpickers of the rock business .
Ã¢â¬ÅCome in here , dear boy , have a cigar , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ as one of the old singles I collected spits .
The vaster their success , the more bitterly they denounced the cold and inhuman world they discovered : Ã¢â¬ÅAnd I think I need a Lear jet.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Only Joy Division ever excelled them in misery .
But Pink Floyd are more lucid and eloquent than Joy Division .
Comfortably Numb is so monstrously direct it seems obscene
Ã¢â¬ â a classic that chills the blood whoever records it .
Does Roger WatersÃ¢â¬ â¢ terrifying vision of modern life come under the category of Ã¢â¬ÅartÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ?
Who knows Ã¢â¬ â

2016-09-05,"Celebrations to mark Freddie MercuryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70th birthday received a cosmic boost on Sunday night as Brian May , QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lead guitarist , announced that an asteroid nearly half a billion kilometres away had been named after the late singer .
In a move that links one of the most dazzling stars in history to one of the darker rocks in the solar system the International Astronomical Union confirmed that asteroid 17473 , a 3.5km - wide ball of black rubble on the other side of Mars , shall henceforth be known as Ã¢â¬ÅFreddiemercuryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
May , who has a PhD in astrophysics and an asteroid named after him already , revealed the name by video message to more than 1200 guests at the Ã¢â¬ÅFreddie for a DayÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ party at the Montreux Casino on Lake Geneva in Switzerland .
Behind the venue is the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former studio where Queen recorded a host of songs , from Under Pressure with David Bowie to Who Wants To Live Forever ?
Discovered in 1991 by the Belgian astronomer Henri Debehogne , the freshly - named asteroid swings around the sun at 20 km per second .
Its slightly elliptical orbit never comes closer than 350 million kilometres to Earth , meaning that the heavenly body called Freddiemercury poses no imminent danger to the planet .
The space rock reflects only one third of the sunlight that falls on it and at such distance can only be seen with a telescope .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like a cinder in space as many of these asteroids are
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said May. Ã¢â¬ÅYou need a pretty decent telescope to see it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just a dot of light but itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s a very special dot of light and
maybe one day weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll get there.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Chris Lintott , professor of astrophysics at Oxford and presenter of The Sky at Night said :
Ã¢â¬ÅI think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wonderful to name an asteroid after Freddie Mercury .
He joins a list including all the Beatles , Frank Zappa , Bowie and , weirdly , the band
Yes .
Pleasingly , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on a slightly eccentric orbit about the sun , just as the man himself was.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The list of famous names given to asteroids goes on and on .
Kurt Vonnegut , Vladimir Nabokov , Douglas Adams and Bruce Springsteen all have space rocks named after them , as do the characters Don Quixote , James Bond , Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson .
Another member of the asteroid club is Monica Grady , the Open University professor of planetary science , who lends her name to asteroid 4731 .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very appropriate that the King of Rock ( or Queen of rock ? ) is remembered this way , with his very own piece of rock memorabilia ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
FreddieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sister , Kashmira Cooke , was due to attend the Montreux party hosted by his former personal assistant and cook Peter Ã¢â¬ÅPhoebeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Freestone .
Guests were encouraged to wear yellow costumes for the night and dined on some of the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite dishes , including Louisianna chicken and onion tart .
Addressing the party , May thanked Joel Parker , astronomer and director at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , for almost single - handedly ensuring the asteroid was named after the Queen singer in time for the celebrations .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m honoured to have been part of getting the name officially recognised in time for FreddieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70th birthday , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Parker told the Guardian .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s wonderful that Brian May is also an astronomer , connecting the Earth - based Freddie to the cosmos - based Freddie.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Parker said that anyone who wanted to catch a glimpse of Freddiemercury would need a telescope as it is only one ten thousandth of the brightness that the naked eye can see in a dark sky .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not quite traveling at the speed of light , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Parker said .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut from an Earth perspective , this certainly has made a supersonic man out of him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-09-06,"You might be forgiven for heaving a sigh at the subject of the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢
s attempt to come up with a blockbuster pop culture follow - up
to 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
wildly successful David Bowie Is , an exhibition still touring the world three years on .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not that the late 1960s and their attendant counterculture represent an unfertile area for exploration .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢
d have a hard time arguing the era
didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t feature sufficient fantastic music , social upheaval and blue - sky fashion choices to support a major exhibition .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that the people involved have barely shut up about it since the decade ended .
Few generations are quite as wilfully self - mythologising as the baby boomers : theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve spent half a century talking their youth up as a nonpareil , you - had - to - be - there era of creativity , helpfully impressing upon future generations that nothing they could achieve in pop culture could quite hope to live up to it .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to imagine thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a sentient human being out there who hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t heard the eraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s story umpteen times already .
That said , the 60s can still prove a productive seam to mine , as evidenced by Jon SavageÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recent and brilliant book 1966 , an expertly researched bit of preconception - challenging that convincingly turned the orthodox view of a year held as popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s beatific annus mirabilis on its head .
It might have attained that status retrospectively and with good reason , Savage noted , but at the time , you could barely hear the latest Beatles single for the sound of carping voices moaning that pop was past its best and the hip new sound Ã¢â¬ â psychedelia Ã¢â¬ â was an indulgent embarrassment .
You Say You Want a Revolution is not an exhibition much interested in that kind of revisionism .
This is a show at which John LennonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wide - eyed paean to universal peace and love , Imagine , unironically plays as you leave .
Instead , it opts to retell the traditional version of events Ã¢â¬ â from Profumo to the OZ trial by way of Mary Quant , Ken Kesey , Pink Floyd and Sergeant Pepper Ã¢â¬ â via a kind of sensory bombardment .
The sheer volume of stuff the curators have assembled is pretty overwhelming in itself : everything from Twiggy - themed coathangers and CIA handbills that attempted to sow dissent among the ranks of Black Panther activists , to tape recordings of LSD users describing their experience ( Ã¢â¬ÅitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like looking at a Rorschach test and seeing crushed testicles , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ offers one , not perhaps the most compelling advert for the drugÃ¢â¬ â¢ s powers of enlightenment ) .
There are some hugely impressive videos .
On one wall , a projection of Bob Dylan appears to drop the signs he holds in the famous promotional film for Subterranean Homesick Blues at your feet .
A room carpeted with fake grass offers the opportunity to watch clips of the Woodstock festival on vast screens while recumbent on a bean bag .
As with David Bowie Is , your headphones blare out a soundtrack that automatically changes as you move between exhibits , but this time around , the collage of music and voices feels more deliberately chaotic and fragmented , as if to underline the dizzying pace at which events appeared to be moving during the years the exhibition covers .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s especially effective in the rooms that cover the eraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s social upheavals Ã¢â¬ â civil rights , gay rights , second - wave feminism , Vietnam , Paris 1968 Ã¢â¬ â and credit - led explosion in consumerism .
But for all the son et lumiÃÂ¨re wizardry and marquee - name exhibits
Ã¢â¬ â
John PeelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record collection , the actual uniforms The Beatles wore on the cover of Sergeant Pepper Ã¢â¬ â itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s the small details of the exhibition that feel the most striking .
The text accompanying a Barclaycard Ã¢â¬ â launched in the UK in 1966 Ã¢â¬ â adds , almost as an afterthought , that British women werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t offered credit cards in their own right until 1973 .
A telegram from Apple Records suggests Lennon was up for performing a solo set at Woodstock , but the festivalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s organisers mislaid it .
An advert for Ã¢â¬ÅmensÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wigs to cover long hair at job interviews suggests the existence of a canny breed of hippy , happy to let their freak flag fly only on Saturdays and Sundays and spend the rest of their week working for the eraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s perennial bugbear , The Man .
The exhibition ends with a game attempt to suggest the late 60s counterculture led to the rise of the green movement and of home computers and the internet .
The former seems inarguable , the latter questionable .
In fact , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a lot thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s debatable here
Ã¢â¬ â not least whether the costume Jane Fonda wore in Barbarella really belongs with the stuff about Germaine Greer and Angela Davis Ã¢â¬ â but
thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also a lot to enjoy .
Enough , in fact , that against the odds

2016-09-08,"Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Man
Who Fell to Earth is rereleased after 40 years and it looks more exotic , more preposterous , more fascinating than ever , like a hyper - evolved midnight movie in the manner of Roger Corman .
Roeg shows us some of his classic narrative dislocations and juxtapositions ; this has something of Stanley KubrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 2001 , but Roeg is genuinely uninhibited about sex in a way that Kubrick never was .
And of course there is an extraordinary sui generis central performance by David Bowie as the intergalactic visitor Thomas Newton Ã¢â¬ â his unselfconscious gentleness and vulnerability now look very moving and bizarrely authentic in a way that they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t in 1976 .
Is the movie a metaphor for immigration and innovation and a sclerotic corporate culture ?
Or is it perhaps a pop culture parable for the British music invasion ?
( I like to think that NewtonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s astronaut - ambitions inspired our own Richard Branson . )
Or is it simply about Bowie himself ?
The story unfolds in a daring sequence of narrative leaps .
Newton crash - lands in a small town where he is befriended by a hotel receptionist Mary Lou ( Candy Clark ) in whose presence this delicate stripling faints ; she has to carry him to his room Ã¢â¬ â an extraordinary sequence .
They become an item .
Newton quickly finds himself in New York , where his superior intelligence and knowledge allow him to create a world - beating energy and media company , which hires a disillusioned , lecherous chemistry professor Nathan Bryce ( Rip Torn ) , the only person in whom the increasingly reclusive Newton can confide .
Newton needs to establish utter mastery of EarthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s technology so that he use its water for his own drought - stricken planet .
But , far from being a sinister predator , Newton is a delicate victim , a Wildean holy child of poignant unworldliness , whose business is taken from him .
He stays young while everyone else gets old .

2016-09-08,"There is a great mystery at the heart of The Man
Who Fell to Earth , Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cult film : its soundtrack .
There is a persistent rumour that long - lost music for the film Ã¢â¬ â recorded by its star David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â sits somewhere in a vault .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only one problem :
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s soundtrack to The Man
Who Fell to Earth
doesnÃ¢â¬

The music that appears in the film Ã¢â¬ â released for the first time next month as part of a collectorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s edition by Studio Canal and a vinyl box set by Universal Ã¢â¬ â was written and produced by John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas .
The never - before - told story of its creation is almost as improbable as RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film .
Signed to both star in and compose an original soundtrack for the film , Bowie , then at the peak of his early fame , intended to record the music once shooting had completed , envisioning it as the follow - up to his album Young Americans .
But he began working instead on Station to Station , while deep into his cocaine and milk phase .
After three months , he had managed to complete only five or six tracks in a bizarre mishmash of styles Ã¢â¬ â from country rock to instrumentals on African thumb pianos and atonal electronic music .
The British arranger Paul Buckmaster worked on the demos with Bowie at his rented house in Bel Air , and at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood .
Although they had composed the music playing along to a videotape of the film , none of it was actually synched to the picture , rendering it almost unusable .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think [ Roeg ] just got these disparate pieces and probably said , Ã¢â¬ËWhat the hell is
this?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Buckmaster .
Finding himself without a soundtrack weeks from the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s planned premiere in March 1976 , Roeg turned to the Mamas and Papas songwriter .
PhillipsÃ¢â¬ â¢ third wife , Genevieve Waite ( a South African actor and model ) , had introduced him to Roeg in 1970 , when the director was in LA to work on Performance .
Four years later , the director came to see Phillips and Waite performing a musical - comedy double act at Reno Sweeney cabaret club in Greenwich Village .
Afterwards , he offered Waite the role of Mary Lou in The Man
Who Fell to Earth opposite Bowie Ã¢â¬
â the role that eventually went to Candy Clark .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe told John he wanted me to do it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she says .
But Phillips had other ideas .
He had written his own sci - fi themed rock musical for his wife to star in , called Space , which was about to go into production .
Ã¢â¬ÅJohn said , Ã¢â¬ËGenevieveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to be working on the Broadway show.Ã¢â¬ â¢
And he and Nic Roeg were so drunk they had this terrible fight and knocked over tables and stuff.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅThose kind of episodes with Nic were relatively Ã¢â¬
Â¦
I wouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t say frequent but they were not infrequent , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Graeme Clifford , who edited The Man
Who Fell to Earth .
Ã¢â¬ÅEverybody who knows Nic , at one point or another , has got into a rolling around on the floor fight with him .
If John Phillips had not had a fight with him , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d say , Ã¢â¬ËOh really?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The next time the pair met , Phillips was living in Malibu .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe went to Candy ClarkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s house ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said in an interview before his death in 2001 .
Ã¢â¬ÅNic was going with her at the time.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Roeg showed him a cut of the film on a small portable TV .
Ã¢â¬ÅI just loved the movie the moment I saw
it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He was unsure why Roeg was asking him to work on the soundtrack when Bowie was the obvious choice , but took the job anyway , aiming to create a Ã¢â¬Åreal American score with banjos and folk and rockÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Phillips Ã¢â¬ â whose career started in the late 1950s in a doo - wop / jazz vocal group called the Smoothies , before he founded , first , folk trio the Journeymen
, then the Mamas and the Papas Ã¢â¬ â was steeped in American roots music .
A musical chameleon like Bowie , he had moved effortlessly through a succession of styles , with a marked virtuosity , and had previously worked on soundtracks for Myra Breckinridge and Robert AltmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Brewster McCloud .
On arriving in London in 1976 , faced with putting together a score from scratch in an exceedingly short time , Phillips knew he needed Ã¢â¬Åsomeone who could really playÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
That person was Mick Taylor , erstwhile guitarist for the Rolling Stones , who he considered Ã¢â¬Åthe best guitar player in the worldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
They started work at Glebe Place , PhillipsÃ¢â¬ â¢ rented house in Chelsea .
One day , Phillips recalled , Ã¢â¬ÅKeith Richards walked in and thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Mick Taylor sitting there .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re playing guitar together.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
On seeing Taylor , Richards let out a scream .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey both froze.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
They hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seen each other since Taylor had walked out on the Stones just over a year earlier .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was a little testy , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Phillips said .
Richards and Taylor behaved Ã¢â¬Ålike dogs circlingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Keith broke the ice the only way he knew how : he grabbed a guitar and joined in .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe just played old country songs ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Phillips said .
Those would become the basis for the music Phillips recorded for the film , which included originals like Boys from the South , as well as spirited covers of Hank SnowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Rhumba Boogie and Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass BoysÃ¢â¬ â¢ Bluegrass Breakdown .
Ã¢â¬ÅSome of the music was very improvised , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Richard Goldblatt , one of the engineers who worked with Phillips .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe recordings were quite innovative.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Despite being under immense pressure to produce the music in a matter of weeks , Phillips continued to lead a busy and complicated life of narcotic and sexual excess .
After one session , he arrived back home around two in the morning .
Finding nobody there , he walked round to his friend Mick JaggerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s house on Cheyne Walk , looking for his wife .
Instead , he found Bianca Jagger and Liza MinnelliÃ¢â¬ â¢ s younger sister , Lorna Luft .
Genevieve wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t there and nor was Mick .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe all sat around , drank wine and got pissed , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Phillips .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was playing the guitar , singing some songs and stuff.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Eventually , Luft left and John and Bianca Ã¢â¬ â who had enjoyed a brief affair in 1970 , before she met and married
Jagger Ã¢â¬ â ended up in bed .
At some point close to dawn , they both fell asleep .
At the session the following morning , Phillips was a no - show .
The musicians and engineers all sat waiting .
Someone rang Glebe Place to find out where he was .
Waite took the call .
She went round to Cheyne Walk , figuring he might be there , talked the help into letting her in and was told he was in the bedroom
Ã¢â¬ â with Bianca .
Ã¢â¬ÅSo we were awakened around 10.30am , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Phillips said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was Genevieve , Ã¢â¬ËI know youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re in there , you two.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Oh God , here I am in MickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bed with MickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old lady .
My old ladyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s outside , banging on the door .
There were Nicaraguan maids running around , screaming in Nicaraguan .
Genevieve storms in the door and takes a swing at Bianca .
I sort of hold Genevieve back and take her out .
She just ran down the street .
I had to go to work.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The final session for the score took place in February , with the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s world premiere at Leicester Square in London now just three weeks away .
Phillips began to mix the tracks so they could be laid into the edit .
At that point , says Goldblatt , Ã¢â¬Åsuddenly , he started to go a little peculiarÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He could hear clicks and noises on the tape and , despite the engineerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s insistence that there was nothing there , insisted they do everything over .
But the problem persisted .
By the fourth or fifth day , things were pretty tense between them .
Then something snapped .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe lost it for some reason , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Goldblatt , who walked out of the session and returned the next morning to find heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been replaced by another engineer .
Goldblatt was later told that Ã¢â¬Åthe projectionist had gone into the toilets and all he could hear was somebody in the cubicle next to him sniffing Ã¢â¬ â big sniffsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The bathroom breaks Phillips had been taking , almost at the end of every take , suddenly made sense .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was doing unbelievable amounts of coke.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
So much , Goldblatt believes , that he was having auditory hallucinations .
Rafe McKenna , assistant engineer , recalls Roeg coming to the studio to have a Ã¢â¬Åserious discussion with Phillips about his behaviour .
Told him off , basically , and said stop pissing off the engineers and get it finished tonight.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The eleventh hour entreaty worked .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe music just came flying out of the studio and I stuck it in , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says editor Graeme Clifford .
Roeg declares himself happy with the music Phillips produced for the film .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt had a range of different qualities that I thought was rather interesting , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe really was an individual composer.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â¢

2016-09-08,"City of Glass , Paul AusterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s meta - detective novel about a thriller writer who finds himself playing sleuth , will be staged in Manchester and London next year in a new hi - tech adaptation .
It is the first theatre show originated by 59 Productions , whose projects have included the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony , the V&amp;A exhibition David Bowie Is and the sound - and - light spectacular Deep Time at this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Edinburgh international festival .
The book has been adapted by Duncan Macmillan , who says he first read it as a teenager and was Ã¢â¬Ådazzled by its formal innovation and sheer weight of ideas .
For such a short novella , it buzzes with thoughts about literature and authorship , about identity and time and death and faith , all within a mystery story that deconstructs itself as if itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been corrupted by a virus.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ City of Glass , published in 1985 , became part of AusterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
New York Trilogy , hailed as a sophisticated take on the genres of both crime and city fiction .
Auster himself appears as a character Ã¢â¬ â believed by the narrator to have Ã¢â¬Åbehaved badlyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ throughout the novel Ã¢â¬ â and it is stuffed with references to Cervantes and Edgar Allan Poe .
Although another version of City of Glass was performed off - Broadway earlier this year , in a show by Untitled Theater Company
No 61 , the American authorÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novels have been seldom adapted for stage or screen .
The look of 59 ProductionsÃ¢â¬ â¢ version has been inspired by a graphic novel based on City of Glass , by David Mazzucchelli and Paul Karasik .
Leo Warner , the founding director of 59 Productions , says the company has become used to Ã¢â¬Åcombining projection with architecture in a series of increasingly visible public commissions , designed to communicate grand narratives to audiences , sometimes in the hundreds of thousands .
Now we are bringing the same techniques and the same grand themes back inside the theatre , at a human scale , building a production in which text , performance , technology and design are developed and interwoven around a single , lonely human figure.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Macmillan says that WarnerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vision for the production uses Ã¢â¬Åtechnology that has , as far as IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m aware , never been used on stage before , and has meant that I can write stage directions that would otherwise be impossible to achieve .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really freeing as a writer .
Many of my stage directions start with the word Ã¢â¬ËimpossiblyÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
And then Leo reads it and says , Ã¢â¬ËGreat!Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ City of Glass is at Home in Manchester from 4 - 18 March 2017 and then at the Lyric Hammersmith in London , from 20 April-13 May.
An international tour will follow .
Next year marks AusterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70th birthday and the publication of his novel 4 3 2 1 ."

Lazarus Cast Album , out in October , will include interpretations of classics from the late pop starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career by the cast of his hit off - Broadway show Lazarus , as well as three of his final studio recordings .
The album Ã¢â¬ â released ahead of the 8 November UK opening of Lazarus at LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s King Cross theatre

2016-09-13,"During the protracted Ciccone - Ritchie custody battle a strange thing revealed itself : Rocco Ritchie was a style icon .
Now , when we say Ã¢â¬Åstyle iconÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , we donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t mean in the classic sense like , say , Steve McQueen or David Bowie .
No , we mean it in a slightly left - of - centre kind of way .
At the time of The Troubles , Ritchie Jr would appear in various paparazzi shots beaming in a full - on rainbow spectrum of skater clothes looking somewhere between Ã¢â¬ÅgoodÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬Åso bad itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s

There he was in a white hoodie under a two - tone lime / grey fleece from The North Face , in aubergine - coloured skater trousers with a lilac Palace fleece or dressed in wide - legged cut - off jeans with a black Palace top zipped up to his chin .
In fact , the athleisure label Palace , loved by hipsters and celebrities is a big part of RoccoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s look .

2016-09-14,"Critics sometimes talk of an artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Ålate styleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
last plays have a distinct flavour all their own , as do BeethovenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s late quartets , or Henry JamesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s densely fluid later novels .
To pick a more contemporary example , we can ponder both the continuities and the differences between early David Bowie and his last album Blackstar .
Edward Said has written well on this topic : how certain artists use a lifetimeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wisdom and technical maturity to do something both recognisably their own and also new , even contradictory , Ã¢â¬Åa form of exile from their own milieuÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Such thoughts are provoked by reading Christopher PriestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new novel , since Priest , now in his 70s , has moved into a potent late phase of his art .
He has always deployed unostentatious prose to tell elegantly complex stories about alienation and loss ; about twins , conjuration , displacement and strangeness .
His most recent fiction still does all this , but it feels somehow different : cooler , more austere , balancing his perennial fascination with mortality against a new sense of the possibilities of restitution .
Priest has been writing about his imaginary Dream Archipelago , a world of varied , unmappable islands in an endless sea , since the 1970s .
Back then the archipelago tended to feature in short stories , and the islands themselves had a sunny - skies , blue - seas Mediterranean flavour .
After a time writing novels set in our world , including The Prestige , which was well filmed by Christopher Nolan , Priest has returned to his islands with 2012Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Islanders and 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s The Adjacent .
And now The Gradual , in which the islands have a greyer , more northern vibe to them .
Alessandro Sussken is a brilliant musician and composer living in the iron - curtain - ish Republic of Glaund .
Glaund is fighting an Orwellian never - ending war with another island called Faiandland , and although all the actual fighting happens on a distant southern continent , the privations of war touch every aspect of island life .
SusskenÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
older brother is conscripted to fight , but SusskenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s burgeoning musical reputation means he instead joins a concert tour of the archipelago .
During his travels he discovers that time seems to slip in unpredictable ways from one island to the next .
A journey that lasts a few months for him corresponds to many years passing on Glaund .
When he returns home his parents have died , while his wife has given up on him and left .
During a second tour Sussken encounters certain Ã¢â¬ÅadeptsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ who promise they can eliminate this pernicious time slippage Ã¢â¬ â the Ã¢â¬ÅgradualÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ of the bookÃ¢â¬
â¢ s title Ã¢â¬ â by adding notches and lines to certain wand - like Ã¢â¬ÅstavesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ travellers must carry with them .
The adepts haunt the docks and unloading areas , and fleece travellers for large sums of money before leading them on bizarre walks or random car journeys to compensate for the Ã¢â¬Åtemporal detrimentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Anybody who has faced airport touts and hawkers will recognise the type ; but these adepts have something uncanny about them .
The paths they lead travellers on reminded me very much of TarkovskyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Stalker Ã¢â¬ â that baffling , brilliant film , which was surely an influence on this powerfully disorienting and equally brilliant novel .
Priest is straightforward about what happens to Sussken Ã¢â¬ â which islands he goes to in which order , which musical pieces he composes where Ã¢â¬ â but to summarise the plot would be pointless .
Most of this book is about the longueurs and petty frustrations of travel , of passport offices ( called , here , Ã¢â¬ÅShelterate officesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and jobsworth officials , of unsatisfactory hotels and cheap restaurants .
It captures all that very well .
But the plot is not Sussken travelling from place to place ; rather , it is the intermittencies of time itself , the way the slow drip of aging throws up sudden startlements overnight .
Into this basic experiential truth Priest works a series of meditations on memory and inspiration , on the relationship between place and art .
The Gradual is a time travel story , but one unlike any other I have read .
Most examples of time - travel science fiction embody a simple formal pattern , most commonly a loop or circle shape , occasionally a branching - tree structure .
The Gradual carefully constructs a much more filigree , intricate structure to embody its temporal slippage , and it is very much to PriestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s credit as a writer that this always feels coherent .
It is expressive of the way the complications of time are full of curlicues and baroque folds as well as larger branches and trunks : the way time fractalises at the same time as it sweeps us along its strong currents .
The result is amazing , haunting , eloquently baffling and clever .

2016-09-20,"The last time David Bowie visited Los Angeles he was in a state of Ã¢â¬Åpsychic terrorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and his artistic sensibility involved a humanoid alien , an exorcism , a musical masterpiece and cocaine Ã¢â¬ â lots of cocaine .
It was 1975 and Bowie was the Thin White Duke , a persona possibly only slightly madder than the musician himself at that time .
Despite keeping vampire hours and fearing that the swimming pool in his rented home was possessed by the devil BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eclectic talent manifested in the film The Man
Who Fell to Earth , in which he played an alien , and the album Station to Station , one of his best .
Four decades later the late rock star has returned and Americans can once again behold unfamiliar , eclectic British talent , except this time BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s role is that of collector , not creator , and the vibe is corporate , not spooky .
Dozens of paintings , sculptures and pieces of design from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s extensive art collection will go on display in LA on Tuesday , part of a global tour before SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s auctions the entire collection in London in November .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe think he would have really enjoyed it ,
the idea of bringing very British art objects to LA and New York
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Simon Hucker , the auction
houseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s senior specialist in modern and postwar British art .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe never lost touch with his Britishness.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Hucker spoke this week as workers put finishing touches to the exhibition in SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gallery on the 29th floor of a gleaming tower in Century City , just a few miles , but another world , from one inhabited by Bowie during a 10-month sojourn when he tootled around LA in a battered Volkswagen Beetle and subsisted on milk , peppers and drugs .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a really private collection , very intimate and personal .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quiet and meditative .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve picked artists that are quite new to an American audience , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hucker .
Americans who knew Bowie largely through the Duke , Ziggy Stardust , Aladdin Sane and other alter egos may glimpse a different man through Harold GilmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Interior ( Mrs Mounter ) , a subtle portrait of an English cleaning lady in a Tottenham Court Road room painted in 1917 .
It was one of about 400 pieces Bowie bought during a lifetime of collecting , quietly amassing a trove which includes names like Damian Hirst , Henry Moore and Frank Auerbach plus relatively obscure artists , including Africans and Americans but especially 20th century Brits .
Of AuerbachÃ¢â¬ â¢ s densely worked , almost sculptural paintings , Bowie once said : Ã¢â¬ÅMy God , yeah .
I want to sound like that looks.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A legendary rock star whose influence transcended music , fashion and sexuality , Bowie died in January , aged 69 , from cancer .
He was best known for more than 27 albums which produced a string of hits including Changes , Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes .
Less well known was his passion for art and design , which he studied at technical college .
He once confessed to buying art Ã¢â¬Åobsessively and addictivelyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie often bought through direct contact with the artists , visiting their studios .
He also served on the editorial board of the journal Modern Painters and participated in a famous art - world hoax by hosting a party at Jeff KoonsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Manhattan studio for the launch of a book on a fictional artist , Nat Tate , which fooled many guests .
A spokesman for BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s estate said in July that his family would keep some pieces of the collection with personal significance but , lacking space to keep it all , wished Ã¢â¬Åto give others the opportunity to appreciate Ã¢â¬ â and acquire Ã¢â¬ â the art and objects he so admiredÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In addition to LA SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s will display , some works in New York , Hong Kong and London before the three - day auction , which is estimated to fetch more than ÃÂ£10 m .
Ã¢â¬ÅEclectic , unscripted , understated :
David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
collection offers a unique insight into the personal world of one of the 20th centuryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest creative spirits , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Oliver Barker , the chairman of SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Europe .
Some Bowie fans , however , have lamented that the collection will be dispersed rather than kept and publicly displayed .
Hucker called that expensive and impractical and said the musician would likely have endorsed a big auction that would spotlight lesser known artists alongside famous names .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe really loved these British artists .
I think David was possibly frustrated that some ... were not as well known as the likes of Lucian Freud and David Hockney .
Having a Lanyon beside a Basquiat does Lanyon a great service.Ã¢â¬

The LA exhibition showcases the collectionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top lot , Jean - Michel BasquiatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Air Power , valued up to ÃÂ£3.5 m .
Bowie played Andy Warhol , whom he knew , in Julian SchnabelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1996 biopic of Basquiat .
The exhibition also shows AuerbachÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Head of Gerda Boehm , valued up to ÃÂ£500,000 and HirstÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Beautiful , hello , space - boy painting , valued up to ÃÂ£350,000 .
In a nod to tinseltown it also includes Patrick CaulfieldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Foyer , a 1973 portrait of a cinema entrance , valued up to ÃÂ£600,000 .
Alongside them hang more modestly priced works by Percy Wyndham Lewis , Kenneth Armitage , Romuald Hazoume , Johann Fischer and Sir Eduardo Paolozzi .
Some garishly coloured lamps , vases and a teapot Ã¢â¬ â Memphis Group works from the 1980s
Ã¢â¬ â are priced at a few hundred pounds each .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe were really careful to pick a selection that represents the texture of the collection , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hucker .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unusual and unpredictable , as youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d guess with Bowie .
It goes into strands , themes , an idea ; he collects not just the main players , he collects around the main players .
It proves heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really , really intelligent.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The pop star was a painter himself and sought to translate visual art into soundscapes , said the auctioneer .
Ã¢â¬ÅCollecting is a creative act .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s making connections.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Even so , lots were priced on the basis of the art , not their late owner , he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I was in an old ladyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s house with this material IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d die of excitement.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The two - day exhibition , which ends on Wednesday , is open to the public but SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clearly hopes deep - pocketed buyers will visit a gallery which overlooks the city that once seduced and tormented the boy from Bromley .
A famous scene in Cracked Actor , a BBC documentary , showed Bowie being driven through the desert near LA in a black limousine , gaunt and wired , comparing himself to a fly he said was floating in the milk carton he was sipping .
His biographer David Buckley said the singer was at that time Ã¢â¬Åin a state of psychic terrorÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie subsequently referred to the mid-70s as the darkest period of his life , a cry for help reflected in Station to Station , the album he recorded a few miles up the road from the SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gallery , before fleeing to Berlin .

Rolling Stone thought its Ã¢â¬Åobscure tangles of perversion , degradation , fear and self - pityÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ signalled the end of his career : Ã¢â¬ÅBowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last gasp.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
You donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have to agree with their assessment to understand why people might have thought the album represented a dead end .
Diamond Dogs was an album that pushed the style he had minted two years before on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars to its limit in every respect .
Perhaps it was hard to see how BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apocalyptic lyrical fantasies could get any more lurid and strange , how his brand of glam rock could sound any more dense and decadent and diseased than this , without tipping into the realms of self - parody .
As it turned out , Bowie was thinking something roughly similar himself .
What happened next was arguably his most audacious career move since telling Melody Maker he was gay .
He reappeared less than a year later , looking and sounding so different that , as one observer claimed , his new approach Ã¢â¬Åmight as well have been a completely different artistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
A 180-degree artistic turn is an incredibly tough stunt to pull at all , let alone with the aplomb that Bowie appeared to execute it .
Young Americans didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t signal a dip in commercial fortunes
Ã¢â¬
â
it finally made him a fully fledged mainstream star in the US .
Nor did it occasion a slackening of his influence .
Indeed , just how influential Young Americans was didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t become fully apparent for another decade , by which point hamfisted attempts to mimic its Ã¢â¬Åplastic soulÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ sound Ã¢â¬ â a white artist melding black funk with an art - pop sensibility , as heard on Fascination or Fame Ã¢â¬ â had , for better or worse , become mainstream popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dominant mode .
And Bowie made the transition seem effortless .
But as proved by Who Can I Be Now ?
Ã¢â¬ â
a lavish box set that traces his career from Diamond Dogs to 1976Ã¢â¬ â¢
s
masterpiece Station to Station , by way of David Live and the vastly superior Live Nassau Colosseum 1976
Ã¢â¬ â the shift was more convoluted and problematic than it appeared at the time .
Most attention has been drawn by the inclusion of The Gouster , a reconstruction of an early version of the album that became Young Americans .
The GousterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s appearance has proved controversial Ã¢â¬ â it features none of the unreleased tracks long rumoured to have formed part of the album , such as BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own version of
I Am a Laser , originally intended for soul trio the Astronettes and subsequently rewritten as Scream Like a Baby on 1980Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Scary Monsters , or the near - mythic Shilling the Rubes .
But then , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not in the album tracklisting handwritten by Bowie , nor the copious notes about mixing that the artist passed on to producer Tony Visconti .
What is there is still markedly different to Young Americans , despite sharing four of its tracks , albeit mostly in slightly different versions .
If you had to characterise what sets them apart , you could do worse than alight on their respective covers .
On the front of Young Americans , Bowie gazes at the camera like a matinee idol , confident and assured beneath the haircut that launched a thousand soulboy wedges .
On the front of The Gouster , his stare is uncertain and scared , his fingers clasped to his lips .
He looks like the man who wrote
Who Can I Be Now ? ,
The GousterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s defining track , a song ostensibly about the redemptive power of love that is clearly really
about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s uncertainty regarding fame and his ability to reinvent himself : Ã¢â¬ÅPlease help me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he sings , sounding anguished , before a chorus that sounds infinitely more like one of those triumphant - yet - elegiac ballads that glam rock artists were so adept at Ã¢â¬ â like Mott the HoopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Saturday Gigs or Diamond DogsÃ¢â¬ â¢ RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll With Me Ã¢â¬ â than the kind of contemporary soul music that Bowie had relocated to PhiladelphiaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Sigma Sound Studios to try and capture .
A similar sense of insecurity and ambiguity haunts ItÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
Gon na Be Me , clearly inspired by the stark , intense , gospel - infused soul that emerged from studios in AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deep south rather than the luscious , forward - thinking music released on Philadelphia International .
It starts out as a bit of serial seducerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s braggadocio Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅI balled another young girl last nightÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â and gets increasingly dark and troubled , emotions amplified by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s agonised , raw vocal .
Those two tracks set the emotional tone .
The songs The Gouster shares with Young Americans are the latter albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bleakest .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no room for anything as straightforwardly gorgeous as Win , or FameÃ¢â¬ â¢ s slick cynicism , or even the beatific message that lurks somewhere beneath BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s scenery - chewing performance of Across the Universe .
Instead , you get the corrupt demagogue portrayed on Somebody
Up There Likes Me
; the twitchy , agitated note - to - self that is
Right
( Ã¢â¬Ånever no turning back Ã¢â¬ Â¦ never been known to failÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) ; and Young Americans itself .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s easy to miss what a spectacularly grim lyric that song offers , buffeted as it is by carefree sax breaks and a joyous chorus , but it opens with a dismal sexual encounter that an apparently desperate woman accepts as her due ( Ã¢â¬Åheaven knows sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have taken anythingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and gets progressively less cheery from there : spousal abuse , political corruption , intimations of suicidal thoughts , a depiction of ageing as slow death and of emotional numbness that not even music can touch .
You somehow notice its tenor more as the penultimate track on The Gouster than as the opener of the album that bears its name .
Young Americans and Station to Station are albums that make you wonder how Bowie did it , given the state he was in , by all accounts , when he made them : almost nothing about them Ã¢â¬ â except perhaps the baffling lyrics of Station to StationÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
title track Ã¢â¬ â suggests their author was in the process of driving himself temporarily insane via cocaine and starvation .
The Gouster , on the other hand , sounds remarkably like an album made by a man on the verge of cracking up .
Even the allegedly carefree paean to the transcendence of the dancefloor , John IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m
Only Dancing ( Again ) has a manic intensity to it : Ã¢â¬ÅTrapped !
Charlie !
Dance on!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Bowie barks , tellingly , as the song abandons its verse / chorus structure halfway through in favour of a repetitious groove .
Perhaps thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why he binned The Gouster .
Bowie was , after all , an artist not much given to revealing himself in the way he apparently does on Who Can I Be Now ?
Ã¢â¬ â better to stoke the myth than tell the truth .
Or perhaps his reasons were more prosaic .
Ã¢â¬ÅI thought IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d better make a hit album to cement myself [ in America],Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said in 1976 , and Young Americans feels far more like one of those than The Gouster does :
Fame Ã¢â¬ â tight , imperious , catchy
Ã¢â¬ â was obviously more likely to be a huge hit single than the confused John IÃ¢â¬ â¢
m
Only Dancing ( Again ) .
In the end , he clearly knew exactly what he was doing .
The Gouster feels like eavesdropping on a moment when he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t so sure .
It makes for fascinating listening ."
2016-09-23,"SkeptaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s self - released album Konnichiwa is storming back towards the top 10 after winning the Mercury award last week .
According to the Official Charts Company , it has jumped 44 places after a 50 % spike in sales .
Konnichiwa beat the bookiesÃ¢â¬ â¢ favourite , Blackstar Ã¢â¬ â the final studio album from David Bowie Ã¢â¬
â and fellow grime
MC KanoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Made in the Manor to the ÃÂ£25,000 prize .
Watching Skepta , who was born Joseph Junior Adenuga and is 34 , accept the award sent chills through my body , especially after the Brit awards in February failed to recognise the contribution to music made by him and many other grime acts .
This weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Mobo nominations are further cause for celebration .
Grime was introduced to the awards for music of black origin as an individual category two years ago , so that acts no longer had to share a platform with hip - hop .
This year the judges are spoilt for choice across all genres .
For me , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not surprising a generation has fallen at SkeptaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s feet .
His bars resonate with me more than the words of any politician .
We millennials are a generation full of hustlers and DIYers .
SkeptaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work ethic mirrors this exactly
and he created Konnichiwa , an album full of the sounds of protest , independent of a record label .
A self - described activist , Skepta plans to use the prize money to help disadvantaged young people .
He has already started to build a recording studio on a Tottenham estate .
His Mercury win is a milestone for grime , which has somehow overcome the many hurdles placed in its way .
The music began in the early 2000s and was the local sound of east London .
Often misinterpreted as hip - hop , grime owes more to garage , jungle and reggae .
MCs form part of crews and speak in slang , often freestyling on the spot .
When they perform live , the crowdÃ¢â¬ â¢ s reception determines if they get a wheel up ( replay of the track from the beginning ) .
In its early days grime relied heavily on pirate radio stations such as Rinse where artists could say as they pleased with no filter .
Dizzee RascalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s legendary Boy in da Corner won the Mercury prize in 2003 and is hailed as the album that took grime mainstream .
Its popularity is still evident more than a decade later , as an online petition for him to perform it in its entirety means he will take to the stage next month .
But although grimeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s resurgence is largely a mythical concept , created by those who have jumped on the bandwagon since Drake signed the petition , it is true that grime is enjoying the most commercial success it has ever seen .
Last year , BBC Radio 1Xtra held a Grime Symphony in the Royal Albert Hall backed by an orchestra , with performances still racking up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube .
This summer
Boy Better Know , the grime crew founded by brothers JME and Skepta , headlined the Wireless festival , while Stormzy was well received at the traditionally rock - oriented Reading .
Key album drops this year , from the sceneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pioneers Skepta and Kano , were not only nominated for the Mercury , they managed to make it to the top 10 in the albums chart .
But less well - known artists still rely on smaller venues .
The recent closure of London nightclub Fabric is a huge loss as it was one of the few places that supported them .
While Eskimo Dance Ã¢â¬ â the influential rave and brainchild of grime godfather Wiley Ã¢â¬
â has toured the country , fans of the genre donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have the luxury of regular club nights they can attend .
The notorious form 696 used by police to assess risk is still a barrier not just for grime music but for other genres that have black roots .
It has been shown to target black music nights and is one hurdle grime is yet to overcome .
But I have no doubt it will .
Radio 1 boss Chris Price recently called grime BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åbig cultural exportÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
For a group of musicians that had so much standing in their way , and every reason to throw in the towel , grime artists have achieved so much .
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t wait to see what happens next ."
2016-09-25,"Billed as Ã¢â¬Åa gothic folktale in four - part harmonyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , cabaret outfit the Ruby Dolls reimagine Bluebeard with a little help from BeyoncÃ Â© , David Bowie , Amy Winehouse , Rage Against the Machine and their own songwriting skills .
Angela CarterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s famous feminist version is also very much to the fore in a 75-minute show that melds cabaret and storytelling to examine male coercion and violence and female agency , but always with a light touch .
This Bluebeard is never glimpsed , only heard speaking in increasingly sinister Fee - fi - fo - fum - style rhyming couplets that clearly set up the infantilised relationship with his new wife , a capable journalist who nonetheless yearns to be saved but ends up having to save herself .
There is something of the vampire in him in the way that he has survived his previous wives who hail from many different eras , and it neatly makes the point that these kinds of abusive relationship are not new and how women Ã¢â¬ â even modern women Ã¢â¬ â fall prey to them .
The fact that he is voiced by the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s male director offers jokey food for thought .
The singing , particularly the harmonising , is always hugely enjoyable but the storytelling is sometimes less certain , although there is something rather satisfying about the way that the murderous husband is felled by a female stereotype Ã¢â¬ â the singing siren who lures men to their deaths .

2016-09-27,"What the hell is wrong with this year ?
David Bowie has gone .
Prince has been taken far too soon .
NoMeansNo have split up .
Brexit looks set to wreak financial havoc on those British subjects least able to afford it .
America is sleepwalking into disaster with Donald Trump .
The Labour party seems damaged beyond immediate repair .
Terrifying sabre - rattling with Russia has begun over Syria Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Hold up .
Rewind a second there .
Who have split up ?
After 37 years , the defiantly underground ( AKA unpopular ) Canadian rock trio , NoMeansNo Ã¢â¬ â who mixed noise , jazz , funk , dubstep , heavy metal , hardcore , prog , free improvisation and avant - rock into their sound , while never really straying too far from their Ramones - worshipping roots Ã¢â¬ â have finally called it a day .
And now , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to explain ( via the means of list of 10 reasons ) why weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all a shower of shivering , narrow - shouldered bastards for letting this appalling calumny occur .
1 .
The River ( 1993 )
NoMeansNo were the greatest punk band ever .
And now theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re gone .
I hope youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all satisfied Ã¢â¬ â you bunch of massive whoppers .
And now that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve vented , we can proceed .
2 .
Ghosts ( 1991 )
NoMeansNo were formed as a duo in Victoria , Canada in 1979 by brothers John ( drums , vocals ) and Rob Wright ( bass , vocals ) .
They would expand to a trio with Andy Kerr and , later , Tom Holliston on guitars .
As well as following directly on from the likes of Canadian hardcore pioneers DOA , their earliest material shows the influence of such postpunk groups as Joy Division and new wave acts like Devo .
They continually raged against the constraints of onetwothreefour rock and embraced the supposed contradiction of being punks who were fans of prog .
Their stars aligned briefly in 1989 with the release of Wrong , their most popular album , which came out on Jello BiafraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Alternative Tentacles label .
While a fantastically intense document and must - own LP , it still really doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t showcase the band at full stretch lyrically or musically .
But in typical millennial , post - music style , their narrative has seen them reduced to the status of a one - album proposition .
Tired of always being asked to perform Wrong - in - its - entirety gigs and of the growing indifference to their later ( but still fantastic ) records , they have now called it a day .
But take a look at any of their albums or EPs and you will find gem after gem , such as this remorseless grinder from 0 + 2=1 , for example .
3 .
Big Dick ( 1989 )
On one level , NoMeansNo were essentially trying to map the outer limits of what it was possible for a punk rock rhythm section to do .
It was something that they were very good at . 4 .
Rags and Bones ( 1989 )
And of course , now that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got all of that stuff about Wrong off my chest , let me restate Ã¢â¬ â it is a fantastic album .
Rags and Bones is obviously the best face - melting song ever to explore existential crisis with a Moby - Dick reference .
And yes , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m including MastodonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blood and Thunder in that assessment .
5 .
Kill Everyone Now ( 1993 )
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just that Wrong isnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t as good as Why Do They Call Me Mr Happy ?
Ã¢â¬ â which is the high watermark of all western civilisation .
6 .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Catching Up ( live ) ( 1991 ) NoMeansNo were also one of the greatest live rock bands of all time .
You could have gone and watched them yourself .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not like they werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t constantly on tour for 37 years .
Luckily for my hyperbolic claims , they did leave behind some convincing evidence in this department in the shape of Live and Cuddly and Live in Warsaw .
7 .
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Stop Talking ( 1998 )
As always when it comes to lyrical content , you can just ignore it if you like .
NoMeansNo function just brilliantly as an exciting , whacked - out punk group with lots of gnarly sounding phrases to shout along with after a few beers if thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s your thing .
( IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not throwing shade
Ã¢â¬ â
this is how I came to the group initially . )
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just that lyrically
they were several cuts above most of their peers .
Punk is / was not short of very bright people , but in a genre where the minimum entry level is Poundland nihilism and angry sloganeering , few come close to Rob WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ability to illuminate subjects such as body horror , existential crisis , antinatalism , the equal failures of religion , democracy and liberal humanism , the oppressiveness of machismo and the absence of free will with such lucidity and breathtaking poetry .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more usual to see this kind of subject matter being discussed in the writing of John Gray , Michel Houellebecq and Eugene Thacker than in punk lyrics ; and WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s tactic of using Ã¢â¬ÅlowbrowÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , pop - cultural references to illuminate profound philosophical concepts is reminiscent of the writing of Kurt Vonnegut .
( 1995Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Worldhood of the World may not be the only punk album thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s directly inspired by the writing of Martin Heidegger but itÃ¢â¬ â¢
s the only one I can think of off the top of my head . )
Their choice of band name , an anti - date - rape slogan , was and remains at best deeply unpleasant , but I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t believe itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shock - for - shockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s - sake or misogynist in intention .
Instead , to me , it reflects an ongoing interest in the treachery of language itself .
You can hear them still railing against the problems of communication on I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Stop Talking , a minimalist pop - punk banger from Dance of the Headless Bourgeoisie , released two decades into their career .
The lyrics to this track Ã¢â¬ â and this applies to most of their songs Ã¢â¬ â really deserve to be read on their own .
8 .
Bitches Brew ( 2000 )
The brass balls of it .
Covering the title track of Miles DavisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most celebrated ( among heavy rock fans at least ) album , Bitches Brew .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an epic but doomy punk rock affair played live by a three - piece ( augmented by guests on Fender Rhodes and congas ) but still thrillingly analogous to the original .
As always with NMN , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a twist Ã¢â¬
â
the track has been reimagined as a piece of gritty American noir , with the dark , disturbing imagistic lyrics calling to mind Dashiell Hammett and James Ellroy .
Covering electric jazz fusion standards might not be everyoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s idea of fun , but Miles Davis was adored by all the smartest punk rockers from Henry Rollins to Penny Rimbaud .
I mean , just check Rated X from 1974 , which is practically the blueprint for Public Image LtdÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best albums .
9 .
Dark Ages (
ShackletonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
My Goal Beyond Mix ) ( 2012 )
Because he is a forward - thinking and phenomenal bass player , Rob WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s interest in dubstep over the last decade is easy enough to understand .
Despite temporarily overlooking the groupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest musical asset Ã¢â¬ â John WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drumming Ã¢â¬ â the Butchering the Sacred Cows EP from 2012 was a complete success and saw them go out , in terms of recorded output , on a high .
It works so well because the interest is clearly not a passing whim , as the well - judged assemblage of remixers Ã¢â¬ â Shackleton , Orphx , Miles and Deadbeat Ã¢â¬
â suggests .
Even if you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t own this EP , anyone who has seen NMN over recent years will know DeadbeatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Power and Glory mix of The River , as it was often a set opener .
I think
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fair to say that the reason for this late - stage departure was a mixture of genuine passion and gentle trolling of their own fans .
But of course , if you think of punk rock as being a certain kind of spirit or approach to art and life , rather than a restrictive set of codified genre rules , then this was a very punk rock thing to do indeed .
10 .
Cats , Sex and Nazis ( 1993 )
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t love this song because it baits the steadfastly mediocre Faith No More
( Ã¢â¬ÅWe care a lot!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a liar!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t love this song for its boozy , raging , lolloping riffs .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t love this song for its unsurpassed levels of balefulness , scorn , intransigence , intolerance and sarcasm .
I love this song because somehow it seems to nail everything that is wrong with the internet , despite being released in 1993 .
While probably talking about problems with the media in general Ã¢â¬ â the patronising but entirely provable idea that a lot of people are happy with the papers / TV as long as they are provided with fluffy animals , titillation and stories on political extremism
Ã¢â¬ â it really seems to have double the relevance now when you think about it .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhy do they call me Mr Happy?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ asks Rob Wright during the closing seconds of this song .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a rhetorical question .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s more than happy to tell you : Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s because IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m so Ã¢â¬ Â¦ fucking Ã¢â¬ Â¦ smart.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Too true , sir , too true .
But NoMeansNo were perhaps ultimately too smart for their own good as well , unfortunately ."

2016-10-02,"We are sitting beneath a huge window in the corner of Michael ClarkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s east London rehearsal space , amid exercise balls , yoga mats and discarded trainers , and as the late - summer light fades , our conversation turns to David Bowie , whose music has been a constant throughout the dancerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was so shocked by his death , really shocked , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Clark , quietly .
Ã¢â¬ÅI kept thinking of that moment when he put his arm around Mick Ronson
[ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guitarist ] on Top of the Pops all those years ago in the 70s and how it triggered this huge sense of relief in me as a boy .
It was the only physical contact I had seen men do apart from punching each other .
It seems ridiculous now that a small gesture like that could be so meaningful , but , for me , it was .
It planted in me the idea that there was another way.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Clark has pursued that other way ever since , often using BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs in his performances : a forthcoming week - long residency at the Barbican in London , entitled to a simple , rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollÃ¢â¬ Â¦ song , will culminate in a new piece choreographed to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s valedictory song
Blackstar from his final album of the same name .
It will be preceded by two piano pieces by Erik Satie (
Ogives 1 - 4 and Prelude Ã¢â¬ â FÃÂªte donnÃ
Â©
e par des chevaliers normands en lÃ¢â¬ â¢ honneur dÃ¢â¬ â¢ une jeune demoiselle ) and an interpretation of Patti SmithÃ¢â¬ â¢ s incantatory Land .
The performance will also include a short cameo by Clark himself dancing to Pug - Nosed Face , the mocking song Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬Ålittle fat man who sold his soulÃ¢â¬
ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â that Bowie sings to Ricky GervaisÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
Andy Millman during his guest appearance on Extras .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhy
not?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Clark , who , at 54 , and despite receiving the approval of the establishment in the form of a CBE , continues to dance to his own wilfully offbeat tune both on stage and off .
He remains a mercurial and almost waif - like presence , whose performances attract audiences not normally drawn to contemporary dance even though his live appearances are now tantalisingly fleeting .
Despite his reputation as a punkish provocateur and iconoclast as well as his own self - destructive behaviour , the Michael Clark Dance Company is now 32 years old , an achievement that , one senses , surprises its founder as much as the rest of us .
Ã¢â¬ÅI never really had a plan , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he says , Ã¢â¬Åexcept to express myself as purely as possible.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the intervening years , he has survived several financial crises , a dalliance with heroin , a protracted addiction to methadone , and an attendant disappearance from the public eye in the mid 1990s during which he lived back home in Aberdeen with his mother and drifted into alcoholism Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ d start drinking every day at 11 in the morning to stop the shakes.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Today , he looks as frail as ever , but his eventful life is now etched on that once beatific face .
In person , dressed in tracksuit and trainers , his head shaven , he looks tired and is soft - spoken , given to somewhat tangential trains of thought .
He is remarkably open throughout , even when talking about his addiction , and seems free of the egotism that often attends the naturally gifted .
One can see almost immediately why he has gathered such an extended support system Ã¢â¬ â loyal dancers , artists , musicians , gallerists Ã¢â¬ â around him : he exudes an effortless charisma that seems to be enhanced rather than undercut by his apparent fragility .
Supporters include the artist Sarah Lucas , the gallerist Sadie Coles , who hosted an art auction in 2006 to keep his company afloat , Jarvis Cocker , and the film - maker Sophie Fiennes .
Ã¢â¬ÅMichael is one of the most charismatic people I know and he has the charm of the devil , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Fiennes , who met Clark when they both worked on Peter GreenawayÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
1991 film ProsperoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Books ( he played Caliban ) and subsequently directed the documentary The Late Michael Clark for the BBC in 2000 ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut he is a fragile soul and also very particular to the point of obsessive in terms of what he creates .
People recognise that and try to help him get to the place where he can creatively deliver his best , but also to help him survive .
With Michael , the fragility and the perfectionism go together ; you can not separate one from the other.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
With this in mind , I ask Clark if he has found getting older particularly difficult Ã¢â¬ â the often uneasy transition from dancer to choreographer means that he now entrusts his ideas to a company comprising , as he mentions twice , performers half his age .
Ã¢â¬ÅI still make work on my own body first , as I always have ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI can only understand it from the inside .
For that , I have to dance and , of course , like everything else , it gets more difficult as you get older .
I work every day , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m impatient .
I still donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t warm up properly so , right now , I have a twinge in my back from yesterday .
But , yes , a lot of ballerinas , like footballers , become depressed when they stop and become alcoholics , but hopefully I got that all out of the way when I was younger.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Now that he no longer uses friends who are non - dancers Ã¢â¬ â they have aged , too , or , as in the case of his most famous collaborator , Leigh Bowery , died young Ã¢â¬ â has his choreography become more formal and rigorous as a result ?
He mulls this over for a few moments .
Ã¢â¬ÅYeah , it has .
I say that with a bit of regret in my voice , but I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t mean to .
Right now , the dancers need to have a particular kind of ability to do the work I am choreographing .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just
how itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s developed.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Does that mean he has embraced a kind of late maturity as an artist ?
Another pause .
Ã¢â¬ÅProbably , yes .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not in a position any more to employ people just because I want to .
The world has changed and dancers have changed .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very tough financially .
It has been made very hard for people purely to be in it for love .
But , even though IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not working with my friends , and the people I have around me are much younger , I still have an old - fashioned belief that if I make something for somebody , I want them to own it too .
As time passes , I want them to feel protective towards it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In the early 1980s , when , in pop cultural terms , the fertile experimentalism of post - punk was giving way to the excesses of new romanticism
, Michael Clark emerged as if fully formed to create an aesthetic that drew on the discordant energy of the former and the gender - bending flamboyance of the latter .
His talent was undeniable , his spirit transgressive and his self - belief seemingly unshakable .
The youngest of five siblings , he had begun dancing , aged four , by gatecrashing his older sisterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Scottish dancing lessons in rural Aberdeenshire .
Ã¢â¬ÅFrom the start , dancing was always an escape from normality for me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says now ,
Ã¢â¬Åand
I took to it even though , at the very start , I found it very boring Ã¢â¬ â holding on to a chair and doing the same thing over and over .
I somehow stuck at it while the few other boys would come and go .
I also saw it as a way of getting to the city , which , even as a child , is where I wanted to be.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In 1975 he was spotted by talent scouts from London , and given a place at the Royal Ballet School in Richmond , London .
It was a dramatic and not altogether easy transition .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt was all very rigorous and serious .
They
x - ray your wrists to see how tall you are going to be and do various tests to make sure you are loose and relatively symmetrical .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ d get me out to do Scottish dances at the Royal Albert Hall , which was fine as I knew all that stuff , but I was two years behind everyone else in terms of the ballet .
Culturally , I felt very different and not just because I was Scottish.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Was it the discipline he found hard to take ?
Ã¢â¬ÅNo , I thrived on it , but the whole thing seemed so constricting somehow , so I was glad of punk .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d bunk off school to see the bands , but Ã¢â¬ â and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not being big - headed here
Ã¢â¬
â they couldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t throw me out because I was the best .
I had to find a way of bringing together what I had learned with all this other stuff that was much more exciting to me Ã¢â¬ â punk and post - punk .
People think I arrived from nowhere
but it actually took some time for things to come together.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
To the dismay of his teachers , he stubbornly resisted the overtures of the Royal Ballet Company , opting to join the more experimental Ballet Rambert before forming his own company in 1982 , aged just 21 .
When his hybrid vision finally coalesced to the abrasive music of post - punk groups like Wire and the Fall , the Michael Clark Company became one of the most provocative and exciting pop - cultural happenings of the 1980s , with works like No Fire Escape in Hell
and I Am Curious , Orange Ã¢â¬ â performed at SadlerÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
Wells with the Fall on stage and Leigh Bowery cavorting among the trained dancers
Ã¢â¬ â drawing a young , hip audience with little or no interest in contemporary dance .
If Clark annoyed the purists with his antics Ã¢â¬ â bum - displaying costumes by young designers such as BodyMap , giant dildos as props
Ã¢â¬ â his dancing was of a calibre that could not be easily dismissed .
Ã¢â¬ÅMichael was extremely rigorous , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Fiennes , who watched him rehearse and perform at close range .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe press tended to home in on his provocations , but he worked hard on his ideas and his choreography , though he knew from very early on that the dance world would limit him .
His conceptual grasp of aesthetics outstripped the ambition of contemporary dance .
He was drawing on Merce Cunningham , John Cage , David Bowie , Yvonne Rainer and the whole post - punk idea of the outsider , whether that was Mark E Smith of the Fall or Leigh Bowery .
It all came together in his head and in his dancing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
For a time , Michael Clark was feted as the enfant terrible of dance , commissioned by , among others , Rudolf Nureyev , with whom he became friends .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was very flirtatious and he was someone who was used to getting his way all the time .
It was interesting because he was obviously gay
but he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t out , but he was in a way because everybody knew .
I remember I got chucked out of his apartment by one of his chefs for snogging someone .
It was not the done thing at all.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At another of NureyevÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dinner parties , he met Dame Margot Fonteyn and Jacqueline Onassis Ã¢â¬
â
Ã¢â¬ÅShe was very dignified , but good fun .
She spoke to one of my friends on the phone when I asked her to
and she let me try on her coat.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
All three , he notes , were dead within a year of the dinner party .
Sophie Fiennes believes that ClarkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s subsequent slide into addiction was precipitated not by his partying , but by the pressures of keeping the Michael Clark Company a viable concern .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was under immense pressure after the huge success of his early performances , He had to keep the entire company afloat and , as we now know , he was not temperamentally suited to that kind of organisational responsibility .
I think he just wanted more mental space .
I remember he once said : Ã¢â¬ËI thought if I take heroin , all these other things will just fade away.Ã¢â¬ â¢
It was almost thought out.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Clark refers to his addiction as his Ã¢â¬Åwilderness yearsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , which is not altogether true given that he managed to dance while on heroin at least for a short while .
He is remarkably open about the drug , its attraction and its lingering grip on the psyche Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅI have to be constantly mindful that it is stronger than meÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â and , blessedly , is not one of those reformed users whose eyes light up when they talk about the drug .
With hindsight , can he cast any light on why he did it ?
Ã¢â¬ÅWell , some people say that they felt they werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t whole until they took it , that it makes them function in a way they could never have done before .
I wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t like that .
I was doing fine without it .
I did it relatively late , which is probably not a bad thing .
I had the memory of functioning well without it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He pauses for a moment as if deep in thought .
Ã¢â¬ÅI have to be careful here , but people conveniently donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t mention how great it makes you feel at the start .
But , then , you are chasing that first hit and you have got to get the amount just right .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a full - time job just getting it , and everything else comes second to that.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And so it was with his dancing .
At some point in the late 1980s , having dabbled for a time , the impressionable young artist who naively believed that to dance to Heroin by the Velvet Underground you had to actually be on heroin , soon found himself as strung out and desperate as the protagonist of Lou ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s song .
Ã¢â¬ÅHis trajectory seems almost unbelievable until you look at his work and realise it is all about telling his own story , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says his friend Sadie Coles .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhether dancing to Heroin or the gender - bending stuff with Leigh Bowery or even StravinskyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Rite of Spring , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all autobiographical in some way .
Michael is serially honest as a person and , like most artists , he can be complicated and dysfunctional and test your patience to the limit , but , as a performer , all that makes for an authenticity and an edge in the work .
Plus , I do think that dance , in its purity and its rigour , is quite self - punishing , almost sadomasochistic .
In a way , you are bound to fail in the constant seeking of perfection through pushing the body .
His work and , to a degree , his life , contains that anxiety.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Things reached a nadir of sorts for Clark in the mid-90s , when , suffering from a nagging knee injury and attendant loss of self - confidence , and depressed by the death of his friend Leigh Bowery on New YearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Eve 1994 , he fled back home to Scotland to live with his mother .
So began a four - year disappearance Ã¢â¬ â the real wilderness years Ã¢â¬ â in which the myth of Michael Clark grew .
How on earth did he pass the time for four years in the village of Cairnbulg , Aberdeenshire ?
He laughs , then falls serious .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen
I eventually came off methadone , which was a prolonged and hard process , I moved to alcohol .
They start drinking there at nine in the morning which definitely didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t help.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Does he believe that he has an addictive personality ?
Ã¢â¬ÅI guess so .
In my case , all the evidence would point to that.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
What he doesnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t mention as a possible precipitating factor in all of this is the suicide of his father , which occurred when Clark was 18 years old .
Clark senior was a complex man by all accounts : a farmer who longed to be an accountant , a heavy drinker , a gambler who ran up huge debts and , on a good day , the life and soul of the party .
Ã¢â¬ÅI found him exciting to be around as a child though IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure some expert would say that he was not a good role model .
He was very entertaining , larger than life , funny and unpredictable .
A bit like Leigh Bowery , funnily enough.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He lapses into a prolonged silence .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was the younger son and I was very angry when he killed himself , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , finally ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut I think he saw enough to know I had potential.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Is he still angry about it ?
Ã¢â¬ÅNo , not really .
It was , in many ways , a very aggressive act and it had a lot of repercussions , people still blaming themselves and each other 20 years later .
But , no .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not angry about it now .
Sad , yes , but not angry .
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ClarkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
creative resurrection began when he reconnected with his old Royal Ballet School teacher , Richard Glasstone , in the early 2000s , and began taking lessons again .
His comeback work was mischievously titled Before and After : The Fall and it was followed , beginning in 2005 , by a creative residency at the Barbican , during which he has created three interpretations of Stravinsky ballets and a piece for the 2009 Edinburgh festival called Thank
You , Man , for which Bowie was the inspiration .
Now comes to a simple , rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollÃ¢â¬ Â¦ song .
Michael Clark may have mellowed , but he remains predictably unpredictable .
He also remains close to his mother , Bessie , who is now is her 80s and appears to some degree to share her sonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s punkish attitude
Ã¢â¬ â she appeared in MmmÃ¢â¬ Â¦ in 1992 and was topless on stage in O in 1994 .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt does sometimes cross my mind that I could be one of those gay men who canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t live without their mothers , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt seems to be a classic thing Ã¢â¬ â Alexander McQueen , Billy MacKenzie
[ singer with post - punk group the Associates ] , both committed suicide after their mother died .
I was afraid for a moment that I was going to be one , too .
I spoke to my mum about it
and she said , Ã¢â¬ËIÃ¢â¬ â¢
d rather you didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do that .
It would mean I hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t done a very good job as a mother.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Does he still dislike dance , the medium that has made him what he is ?
Ã¢â¬ÅWell , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t go and see it , so that kind of answers the question .
In the past , I would go to see Merce Cunningham , but I struggled even with that .
I found it a bit dry .
The codes of behaviour are so bizarre and ritualised .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a strange medium , really , because ultimately you canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t abstract the body , which is what they are trying to do .
You put two people together and they have to interact and embrace .
The body is not an abstract thing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Does he have any regrets ?
Ã¢â¬ÅNo .
Not really .
I miss the old , wild days of squatting , dole money and freedom , but theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re gone .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t regret not joining the Royal Ballet , as that would just be silly and sad.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He thinks about the question some more , looking like his older , younger self in the fading light .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat I want to do , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , finally , Ã¢â¬Åis to appreciate the good things that are happening to me .
I have to step back and remind myself that what is happening is exactly what I wanted to happen and not take that for granted .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an amazing life I have , really , even if everything does get more difficult as you get older .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s tough , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m lucky : IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m still doing what I always wanted to do.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The Michael Clark Dance Company : to a simple rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ rollÃ¢â¬ Â¦ song is at the Barbican , London EC1 , from Thursday to 15 October at the Lowry , Salford , on 19 October"
2016-10-04,"Nine months have passed since David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , but his last collaborator , Donny McCaslin , still has to pause when he talks about it .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so much emotion , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ McCaslin says , the words catching in his throat .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
devastating.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
McCaslin speaks about his experience with Bowie sitting in 55 Bar , the micro Greenwich Village jazz club where Bowie first heard the musician perform back in 2014 .
Shortly after seeing that show , Bowie chose McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band to back him on his final album , the acclaimed , jazz - fusion leaning Blackstar .
McCaslin vividly remembers the night Bowie came to the club to check him out .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was definitely nervous ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the saxophonist said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI glanced up and saw where he was sitting .
I just tried to keep myself grounded and not think about it .
But the pressure was on.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Even so , McCaslin says his band Ã¢â¬Åwere going for it .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a watered - down version of what we do .
Afterwards Bowie said :
Ã¢â¬ËWow , that was really loud!Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Clearly , he liked it that way , because a few days later , Bowie emailed the musician to ask if his band would work with him on what would be his last release , an album that turned out to be one of his most adventurous .
The experience of creating music with Bowie proved so deep , and its aftermath so jarring , that McCaslin decided to turn his new album , Beyond Now , out 14 October , into a tribute .
It includes several transformative covers of Bowie songs , including Warszawa from Low , and A Small Plot of Land from Outside , along with a song McCaslin wrote inspired by a piece Bowie left off Blackstar .
( That track , plus two other cuts that didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t make that release , will come out on 21 October on the cast album from the musical Bowie wrote in his last year , Lazarus ) .
McCaslin knew his Bowie salute had to be special .
Ã¢â¬ÅI wanted the depth of my experience with him , and the impact on my life , to be reflected , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was digging deep on every take to get the gravitas I felt it should have.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At the same time ,
Beyond Now shows growth in McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own sound .
The 40-year - old musician , born in northern California , has released a dozen albums , dating back to 1998 .
His father was a musician , a vibraphonist , whose band McCaslin performed with at the age of 12 .
By high school , McCaslin had a group of his own , one accomplished enough to play the Monterey jazz festival .
His early albums mined acoustic jazz , but on 2010Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Perpetual Motion he sifted in elements of electronica .
Ã¢â¬ÅI had started listening to albums by Squarepusher , Skrillex , Boards of Canada , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s this vibe with electronica , this busy rhythmic activity .
The framework of it speaks to me.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The new sound brought McCaslin fresh acclaim .
In the last few years , he has been nominated for three Grammys .
Two of those nominations came from contributions he made to recordings by Maria Schneider , an acclaimed jazz composer and band leader who , over the years , earned BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s respect and friendship .
It was she who suggested Bowie use McCaslin on a recording in 2014 , the fierce song Sue
( or In a Season of Crime ) , which Bowie later released as a limited - edition single , and which later turned up on Blackstar .
The next month , Schneider brought Bowie down to see what McCaslin could do live at 55 Bar , sealing his interest .
In early 2015 , formal work on Blackstar began , with longtime Bowie ally Tony Visconti acting as producer .
Ã¢â¬ÅWorking with DonnyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band in the studio was a dream , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Visconti .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat I like about Donny and his musicians is that they are very cultured jazz musicians but young enough to embrace the extremes of pop and rock .
They are Ã¢â¬Ëone - takeÃ¢â¬ â¢ players .
There are no mistakes , just expert playing.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At the time , McCaslin had limited knowledge of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s full catalogue of songs .
While he calls LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance Ã¢â¬Åthe soundtrack of my youthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , he knew few of his other hits or deep album tracks .
To prepare for Blackstar , McCaslin started to check them out , but Bowie quickly dissuaded him .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe sent me an email saying , essentially , Ã¢â¬ËThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old stuff .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m into different things now , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ McCaslin said .
Ã¢â¬ÅAt age 68 , Bowie was moving forward.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
For Blackstar , that meant giving McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band nearly free rein .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe set the tone from the beginning , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the saxophonist said .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe told us : Ã¢â¬ËWhatever you hear , I want you to go with it.Ã¢â¬
â¢
He said Ã¢â¬ËgreatÃ¢â¬ â¢ to everything.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At the same time , McCaslin couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tell anyone outside of his immediate family about the project .
Bowie had the band sign non - disclosure agreements , the better to keep the album a secret until he was ready to release it .
At the same time , Bowie was aware he had cancer , which was an even more closely guarded secret .
McCaslin politely demurs when asked if he knew the star was sick during the recording process .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was so private , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI want to honor his wishes that we not talk about it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
At the time , McCaslin wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even sure the music he cut with Bowie would come out or , if it did , how much of his bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s efforts would make the ultimate cut .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t until late last fall , when a British journalist asked to interview the musician for a story about a new Bowie album , that he found out about its impending release and heard its final form .
On 8 January , Blackstar finally appeared .
Two days later came news of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death and , suddenly , everyone wanted to talk to McCaslin .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t prepped , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know what to say.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He gave a few interviews , talking only about the music .
Then , journalists started to get nosier about the details of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s illness and demise , and McCaslin shut down .
He also began to fully experience his grief .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had this amazing connection , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said ,
Ã¢â¬Åand then he was gone.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Part of the healing process involved channeling his feelings into the music on his new album .
Besides the Bowie influence , McCaslin drew again on electronica , covering songs by Mutemath and Deadmau5 .
The music also shows the influence of 70s fusion , a style which McCaslin calls Ã¢â¬Åpart of the musical DNA I grew up withÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
Two weeks after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band paid tribute to him at The Village Vanguard by performing his moody , 70s song Warszawa .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere was so much grief ; we talked about the best way to pay tribute , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat song has a sense of wonder to me .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s such a beautiful melody .
It felt cathartic to play it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
McCaslin says the experience of working with Bowie the year before brought a new intimacy to all the players in his group .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt got us to a deeper level of expression , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
When discussing the fact that his band will forever be linked with Bowie , McCaslin chokes up again .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor me to be associated with him is really special , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think that negates anything IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done prior , or what comes in the future .
Ã¢â¬ÅWith this album , I feel like IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done what I needed to do , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅNow I can start thinking about whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s next.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-10-05,"Ã¢â¬ÅThe David Bowie of standup , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ comedian Nish Kumar recently called Josie Long Ã¢â¬ â because she reinvents her act with every new show .
Or almost every show , it turns out .
Something Better , her first solo set since 2014 , treads familiar ground for Long , as it traces the emotional experience of being leftwing in a rightwing age .
The show makes a decent fist of being comical , and positive , about Brexit and the tribulations of the Labour party .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not
LongÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fault
sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s had to cover this territory before , nor that the intensifying gloom of British politics seems finally to be overwhelming her once - boundless optimism .
The plan , says Long , had been to create an upbeat set to counter the grim trajectory of our post-2010 politics .
And then the EU referendum happened , the result of which glowers over her show .
It made her realise , she says , that she lives in a lefty bubble .
The jokes about not excluding leave voters from her work
Ã¢â¬ â all those Ã¢â¬Ånice mums and dadsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , as she calls them through gritted teeth , whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve sabotaged Britain Ã¢â¬ â seem to come from a place of real soul - searching .
And theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re often funny : Ã¢â¬ÅI know IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a broad demographic ; some of you may be Green party voters.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a more personal set than Bridget ChristieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s Because You Demanded It , standupÃ¢â¬ â¢ s strongest statement on Brexit .
Christie focused on the politics ; Long weaves the EU vote into her wider narrative of bruised confidence as , aged 34 , she sees life refuse to pan out as expected .
She wishes she could be 26 in perpetuity : an innocent age before men at barbecues routinely warned her about falling off a fertility cliff .
Home ownership in her beloved but fast - changing London seems more distant than ever .
SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s newly single ; sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s discovered the joy of necklaces .
But Brexit dominates .
The showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spine is an anecdote about an encounter on a train in the days following the referendum .
Long is a ball of misanthropic fury , quick to judge the fellow passenger with the Ã¢â¬ÅBrexity
airÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But the stranger Ã¢â¬ â and the routine Ã¢â¬ â is here to subvert LongÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stereotypes .
Among all this , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a droll line about the EU vote teaching ( some ) Tories
what itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like to be leftwing :
correct but on the losing side , subject to the opinion of the obviously wrong - headed .
A later routine riffs on how Brexit made LongÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dreams come true Ã¢â¬ â CameronÃ¢â¬ â¢ s disgrace , a female PM Ã¢â¬ â but not remotely in the way sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ d wanted .
( SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s conspicuously silent on the accusation that Jeremy Corbyn , whom she supports , let down the remain cause . )
As all that implies , LongÃ¢â¬ â¢ s humour here is of the gallows variety .
Yes , she ends with a clarion call to keep the faith , stay activist , not wallow in despair .
Important things to say , but not terribly cheering Ã¢â¬ â for the first time
, one senses Long needs the inspiration as much as we do .
In Something Better she tries to fire up her optimism , with only partial success .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s studded with excellent moments , but the overall effect is as plaintive as it is funny .

2016-10-11,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s art collection was tasteful .
Disappointingly tasteful .
As SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s announces the full list of art owned by the late great pop star , to be auctioned in November , it is hard to stifle a yawn .
Where are the vulgar pop art provocations ?
Where is the camp outrage , the punk iconoclasm ?
And whereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Andy Warhol ?
You wonÃ¢â¬
â¢ t find much in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collection that connects in any striking or interesting way with his music , videos , performances or personae .
One exception is his small but impressive collection of paintings by Jean - Michel Basquiat .
Bowie played Warhol in Julian SchnabelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film of BasquiatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life , so thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a connection there ; he owned a Schnabel , too .
But otherwise the art of avant - garde New York is notable by its absence .
Bowie payed homage to Warhol in his 1971 song Andy Warhol .
He also produced Lou ReedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , which is steeped in WarholÃ¢â¬ â¢ s world .
Yet Warhol and other pop artists are in very , very short supply in the SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s auction .
Instead , it seems Bowie was obsessed with British 20th - century art by some very unglamorous artists .
If his paintings by Ivon Hitchens , Winifred Nicholson , Peter Lanyon , Graham Sutherland and their ilk ( with their vaguely modernist reinterpretations of the British landscape tradition ) remind me of anything in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s oeuvre , it is surely his appearance in the film of The Snowman .
Like the snowy dream version of Britain in that Christmas classic , a lot of the art in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collection wallows in melancholy nostalgic idylls of Englishness , albeit with the lightest dusting of abstraction .
Visionary and apocalyptic this art is not .
If you took BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collection on the whole and put it in a museum , youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have the kind of gallery that gets three visitors on a rainy weekday afternoon to look sadly at the Henry Moore and the Bernard Leach pots .
One of the most expensive lots in the auction is his Moore sculpture , with a high price also anticipated for his Stanley Spencer painting .
Who will buy them ?
Most likely enthusiasts for 20th - century British art , which is for some reason fashionable at the moment , even though so much of it is a dull 10th - rate imitation of Picasso .
There are only a few ceramics by Picasso himself .
There are more substantial works by Marcel Duchamp , and here at least you can see an artistic ancestor of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own art of self - invention , for Duchamp was perhaps the first modern artist to play with identity when he adopted the female persona Rrose Selavy Ã¢â¬
â pronouced Ã¢â¬Åeros , cÃ¢â¬ â¢ est la vieÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
So if you want something to help understand Bowie , bid for Duchamp .
Yet alongside cool furniture itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s serious , sombre British art that dominates .
Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff meant much more to him than younger British artists .
He had some Hirsts , but they seem perfunctory , and the rest of the YBA generation are represented sparsely , even though they were all keen Bowie fans .
A lot of people would say that shows good taste .
And no doubt it does .
But surely Bowie knew that good taste is a killer ?
I prefer to think of him needing an axe to break the ice , a junkie hitting an all time low , than pacing around in slippers admiring his tedious art by Victor Pasmore .
Bowie the collector is his most perplexing persona of all Ã¢â¬ â a repressed art snob ."
2016-10-13,"This is the powerful left - field New York jazz band that played on David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar , fronted by saxophonist Donny McCaslin , whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s due at the London jazz festival on 15 Nov. Though McCaslin is a sought - after improvising jazz saxist with a rugged post - Coltrane sound , his dedication to Bowie represents that niche of rock and hip - hop - influenced jazz that is rooted in the accumulation of repeated hooks against rhythm - section crescendos of rising heat .
McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plaintively curt motifs and split notes pitched against buffeting synth - chords and Mark GuilianaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s polyrhythmic drumming sets the agenda on Shake Loose .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
A Small Plot of Land is sung by New York experimenter Jeff Taylor with something of the composerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ferocious grace .
McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
fine ballad Glory has a compelling song - hook soulfulness .
And Bowie and Brian EnoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s desolate Warszawa well suits
McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s quavering , Coltrane - lament sound with Giuliana in Elvin Jones mode .
Such repetition - based and anthemic music can pall for some jazzers , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nonetheless a formidable set with a darkly seductive power ."
2016-10-14,"Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got a handful of songs to sing /
To sting your soul , to fuck you over , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ sings
David Bowie on Killing a Little Time , one of three new songs on the album of his stage musical Lazarus .
Now thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a lyric to conjure with .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so playfully , poignantly appropriate for one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very last recordings that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to resist the idea that he is addressing us directly ; that itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a morbid showbusiness flourish from a dying man .
But is that all there is to a Bowie song ?
Bowie was never one for straightforward autobiography .
His lyrics , even from a song as beloved as Life on Mars ? , contain confounding twists and pockets of mystery .
You can have a lot of fun guessing what they mean
but you can never fully explain them .
Before he died in January , Blackstar seemed to be yet another of his slippery , enigmatic creations , so it felt a little disappointing to see its array of possible meanings reduced , upon his passing , to a deathbed address .
Confirmation bias led listeners to literalise any line that was remotely death - related and downplay the rest .
The theory that this was a calculated farewell was alluring and not without foundation
but it was suspiciously neat ,
given what we know about his art .
The Lazarus material really is the last word .
Here are the final three songs recorded by a titanic artist whose death triggered a volcano of grief , so how could we not comb them for clues ?
But they are also components of a long - dreamt - of musical about Thomas Jerome Newton , The Man Who Fell to Earth .
Of course , Bowie seemed to mindmeld with Walter TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creation at one psychologically fraught point in the mid-70s Ã¢â¬ â the covers for Station to Station and Low both used stills from Nicolas RoegÃ¢â¬ â¢ s movie ; cocaine has a way of making one identify with an emotionally numb alien far from home Ã¢â¬ â but still , there was , and is , a difference between the singer and the character .
These songs were written for actors to sing , so interpret with caution .
They are by no means offcuts .
Posthumous material often resembles a scrawny cigarette , scraped together using strands of tobacco from the butts in the ashtray .
But these songs are as fully realised as anything on Blackstar .
Indeed , they were recorded at the same time , with the same band and producer , and give the same impression that Bowie was on one last hot streak .
Each one has its own flavour .
When I Met You is the kind of briskly anthemic , self - quoting rock that Bowie delivered on his 2013 comeback album
The Next Day , climbing a ladder of chords to a stirring chorus , until a swarm of overlapping backing vocals knocks it sideways , giving it a stranger , more chaotic quality .
Killing a Little Time has the same neurotic momentum as Sue ( Or in a Season of Crime ) and a touch of OutsideÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1990s industrial clamour , pitching BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sinisterly theatrical vocal into shrieking , churning jazz - rock .
Mark GuilianaÃ¢â¬ â¢
s astonishing , tentacular drumming alone confirms that BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last band , led by saxophonist Donny McCaslin , was one of his best , capable of anything .
Bowie sounds like a man coming apart Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m falling , man / IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m choking , man / IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m fading , manÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬
â
but it feels like Newton talking .
Bowie is just the cracked actor .
The best of the three , No Plan , is also the one most likely to inspire literal readings .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an exquisitely lush , star - speckled torch song , which refracts the late - in - life stocktaking of Piaf or Sinatra through the stasis and fatalism of Talking HeadsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Heaven .
Ã¢â¬ÅAll the things that are my life / All my moves , my beliefs , my designs / Me alone
, nothing to regret / This is no place
but here I am /
This is not quite yet , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie croons .
Taken alone , it would be a hell of a swansong ( Ã¢â¬ÅAm I nowhere now?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) but play it beside the feverish discontent of Killing a Little Time
and it loses its soothing finality .
Again , these are numbers from a musical .
They might feel movingly true at times but theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re stories , from a master storyteller .
For a fan , these three songs reignite that January sadness , but they also underline what Blackstar implied , which is that Bowie wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t winding down but racing as fast as his health allowed through a final burst of creativity that was cut short too soon .
And they provide a more ambiguous finale to a consistently surprising career .
If you retrospectively found closure in Blackstar , then youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll discover a more open ending here : loose threads to unravel that suspicious neatness .
Their artistic vitality will , as promised , sting your soul .
It will fuck you over ."
2016-10-21,"After Michael C Hall had been cast in Lazarus , the musical inspired by The Man
Who Fell to Earth , he found himself performing one of David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs to the man himself .
Battling nerves , he got through to the final verse to find an approving Bowie supplying backing vocals .
Ã¢â¬ÅOK , this is it ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Hall realised .
Ã¢â¬ÅI have nothing left to fear.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie died weeks after the show opened in New York .
Now , Hall is bringing Lazarus , which features new songs and classic tracks spanning BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , to London .
Watch him perform the showÃ¢â¬ â¢

title number ( also featured on the valedictory album Blackstar ) in this performance at LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Arts Club .
Lazarus , co - written by Bowie and Enda Walsh , and directed by Ivo van Hove , begins previews at the new Kings Cross theatre , London , on 25 October .
The Lazarus cast album is out now ."
2016-10-22,"An album featuring the last studio recordings made by David Bowie goes on sale this week , almost five decades after his first , eponymous , album hit the shelves in 1967 .
The Lazarus cast album , which is being released ahead of the opening of the stage show of the same name at LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Kings Cross Theatre next month , features three new Bowie songs :
No Plan , Killing a Little Time and
When I Met You .
These final recordings mark the last chapter in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s extraordinary creative output , which Ã¢â¬ â not counting this latest release Ã¢â¬ â included 27 studio albums , almost 60 music videos , 38 acting credits ( including cameos and one appearance in a video game ) and 14 tours , as well as involvement in 30 other artistsÃ¢â¬ â¢ recordings ( as a performer and producer ) and 14 guest appearances in video albums , including Live Aid and the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for Aids Awareness .
But even a list as long as this can not claim to be a comprehensive account of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work : not included here , for example , are his many paintings ."
2016-10-23,"An off - Broadway sequel to The Man
Who Fell to Earth that opened last December and will shortly arrive in London , Lazarus is by any other name a David Bowie jukebox musical .
This cast recording was made the day his death was announced , which imbues the performances with a certain poignancy .
But while Michael C Hall , Sophia Anne Caruso et al turn in perfectly reasonable renditions of an hourÃ¢â¬ â¢ s worth of material from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s back catalogue , their takes on Changes , Heroes and Life on Mars ? were always going to pale in comparison to the originals .
Of most interest , then , are the three previously unreleased songs performed by Bowie himself , recorded at the same time as the Blackstar sessions , which are tucked away on the second CD ( the cast versions are on the first CD ) .
Killing a Little Time , with its skronking brass and open - to - interpretation lyrical references to Ã¢â¬ÅfallingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬ÅchokingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , is jarring but excellent ; No Plan is more contemplative ( think Where Are We Now ? ) , while When I Met You rides in on a 90s alt - rock bassline before building to an oddly restless chorus .
Further proof , were it needed , that Bowie could make startling music right until the end ."
2016-11-01,"It is unquestionably diverse : a deceptively gentle Winifred Nicholson landscape of St Ives
harbour , a small tropical fish preserved in formaldehyde by Damien Hirst , lots of colourful postmodern Memphis furniture and Ã¢â¬
â for reasons that may never be fully known Ã¢â¬ â a Tintoretto altarpiece .
The artworks and other items , around 400 in number , were all once owned by the late David Bowie , and will be sold by SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in three auctions later this month .
Until then there is an unprecedented 10 days of free public display , including an all - night session on Friday .
There will also be weekend talks from people who knew Bowie and are familiar with his tastes and passions , including the playwright Enda Walsh and the novelist William Boyd .
Visitors will see a varied collection , but look closer and there are many common threads , said Beth Greenacre , the curator of
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s art collection from 2000 .
She said many of the artists Bowie collected were ones who challenged the past and its established orthodoxies , who were intent on creating a new language .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe allowed us to look at the world in a new way and the artists he collected are absolutely doing that , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she said .
Modern British art is well represented , with works by Peter Lanyon , Ivon Hitchens , Leon Kossoff , David Bomberg and Harold Gilman .
Simon Hucker , SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s senior specialist in modern and postwar British art , said Bowie was drawn to artists with whom he had a connection Ã¢â¬ â often outsiders trying to break with the past .
Bowie , a child of 1950s London , was also interested in where he was from .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt comes back to him being really interested in who he was , the culture he grew up in , the world of his parents , the world of his childhoodÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hicker . Ã¢â¬ÅHe was a passionate Brit.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Kate Chertavian was a young art consultant who worked for Bowie in the 1990s .
She recalls seeing the other side of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s flamboyant stage persona Ã¢â¬ â the Ã¢â¬Åquiet , intellectual , curious , nerdÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ side .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was deeply invested and would spend a long time reading about the pieces in his collection , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was a man buried in his books , we met a lot and my memories of him are spectacles , double espresso and a pile of books .
Ã¢â¬ÅHis first question to you always used to be Ã¢â¬Ëwhat are you reading?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ Â¦ and
then heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d steal the book!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The exhibition , across eight of the auction houseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s galleries , shows BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s love of narrative and stories .
This passion may explain the inclusion of a 450-year - old altarpiece by Tintoretto and his studio .
It shows an angel warning Saint Catherine of Alexandria , a virtuous virgin queen , of her impending martyrdom .
Hucker said although Bowie was hugely knowledgable about art history , his choices were largely a Ã¢â¬Ågut reactionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The exhibition also shines a light on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s love of the colourful .
Around 100 items from postmodern furniture designer Ettore SottsassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Memphis studio , from vases to sideboards , will go on sale .
Some of those items have an estimated sale price of as low ÃÂ£300 , although Hucker stressed that the values had been made based on the the works in isolation , not accounting for their former owner .
The highest estimate has been given to a 1984 Jean - Michel Basquiat painting , Air Power , which Bowie bought in 1995 , a year before portraying Andy Warhol in the Julian Schnabel biopic of Basquiat .
It is predicted to fetch between ÃÂ£2.5m - ÃÂ£3.5 m .
There are three Damien Hirst works , including a tiny fish in formaldehyde , which was a gift from the artist .
A spin painting that Hirst made with Bowie Ã¢â¬ â Beautiful , hallo , space - boy painting Ã¢â¬ â is estimated at ÃÂ£250,000-ÃÂ£350,000 .

2016-11-04,"Previously unheard vocals from David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
final release , Lazarus , and never before seen archive footage of the star will be aired for the first time in a BBC2 documentary covering the last five years of his life .
David Bowie :
The Last Five Years will revolve around the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final projects Ã¢â¬ â his last two albums , The Next Day and Blackstar , and musical Lazarus , which recently transferred from Broadway to London .
Bowie died on 10 January this year , two days after BlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s surprise release .
The documentary will be broadcast in January as part of a series of programmes to coincide with what would have been his 70th birthday .
BBC4 will broadcast rarely seen Bowie performances from its archive , Martin Kemp will present a show dedicated to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Life on Mars , and 6Music will host a Ã¢â¬Ålistening partyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for the publicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite Bowie album and a tribute show .
In The Last Five Years , producer Tony Visconti , who worked with Bowie over a period of more than four decades , describes how the singer recorded Lazarus .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe would stand in front of the mic and for the four or five minutes he was singing he would pour his heart out , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI could see through the window he was really feeling it .
The audio picked up his breathing , it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that he was out of breath , he was hyperventilating in a way , getting his energy up to sing this.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Created by Francis Whately , who produced and directed 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
David Bowie : Five Years
, the film promises unprecedented access to the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s closest collaborators and friends .
It will also visit New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 55 bar where Bowie met the jazz quartet who would become his backing band on Blackstar , and interview the director and cast of Lazarus .
Whatley said : Ã¢â¬ÅI always hoped that I would make another film about Bowie as we were only able to scratch the surface in the first film , but I just didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t expect it to be this soon .
Ã¢â¬ÅHowever , looking at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s extraordinary creativity during the last five years of his life has allowed me to re - examine his lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work and move beyond the simplistic view that his career was simply predicated on change Ã¢â¬
â
Bowie the chameleon Ã¢â¬
Â¦ Ã¢â¬Ëch

changesÃ¢â¬ â¢ etc .
Instead , I would like to show how the changes were often superficial , but the core themes in his work were entirely consistent Ã¢â¬ â alienation , mortality and fame.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Adam Barker , channelexecutive for BBC2 and BBC4 , said : Ã¢â¬ÅBBC2 is thrilled to have commissioned this unique documentary chronicling the most recent achievements of one of the most significant figures in the history of music.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2016-11-04,"RCA had decided to release Life on Mars as a single .
David called me Ã¢â¬ â if he wanted me to make a video , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d call me one or two nights before Ã¢â¬ â and said we needed to get another video together .
He liked to do them , and so did I Ã¢â¬ â not that there was any budget .
I somehow got hold of a completely white studio and that dictated the concept Ã¢â¬ â it was as simple as that .
We showed up around noon , because none of us liked to start too early .
As a cameraman , I had the guy who had shot the John , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m Only Dancing video the year before , on stage at the Rainbow theatre .
I was second cameraman .
David looked amazing in his blue suit Ã¢â¬
â
it was made by his mate Freddie Burretti , who made the Ziggy costume .
Pierre Laroche , who also worked on the Aladdin Sane cover , did the great makeup .
And there we were Ã¢â¬ â
we just shot for no more than five hours , and then I had a couple of days to do an edit .
We never had time to discuss any concept .
And David never asked me to change anything .
He was a very positive person to work with , very encouraging Ã¢â¬ â
he had the ability to get people to do great things for him .
He took direction very well .
He was willing to do whatever you wanted him to do .
I never found him resistant in any way , and he brought his charisma to the table .
If he wanted to work with someone , he would let them get on with it .
He would ask : Ã¢â¬ÅWhat do you want me to do ,
Mick?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And then he would do his thing .
It was never like pulling teeth with David , it was like pulling gems .
I had an amazing subject and an amazing song
Ã¢â¬ â
this was the song that had turned me on to David Ã¢â¬
â
so what else did I need ?
David never looked like this at any other time .
He never wore that suit again , never had that makeup on again .
He never looked more amazing Ã¢â¬ â like a space doll .
When his videos got inducted into the Museum of Modern Art in New York , this was the one that everyone stood for Ã¢â¬ â there were no distractions , no dancing girls , just David .
At the time it was hardly seen at all , and it gathered some serious moss .
In the late 90s , David gave me the copyrights for the four videos I had made for him , because I had never been paid for them Ã¢â¬ â not that I had looked for any money .
So when Parlophone contacted me about re - editing it I said : absolutely .
I had a little gem
and I wanted to polish it into a state where it was absolutely perfect .
I had the black and white segments , and when I came across that very last bit after the music stopped , I thought it was a little gift , so I made it into an epilogue .
People like the original video , but I think this version takes it to another level .
The scenes really add a new flavour for it .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m really happy with it , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m interested to see what the fans make of it .
David Bowie Legacy is released 11 November on Parlophone ."
2016-11-06,"Ivo van Hove is everywhere : his production of Lazarus Ã¢â¬ â
David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s swansong musical , which in New York sold out within hours of tickets being available at the box office , has arrived in London .
Van
HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s production of Hedda Gabler , starring Ruth Wilson , is to be a highlight of the National
TheatreÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new season .
He is bringing several pieces to the Barbican with his theatre company , Toneelgroep Amsterdam , including a double bill based on Ingmar Bergman films , a reprise of his Roman Tragedies and an adaptation of ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s film Obsession which will star Jude Law .
Multitasking must be second nature , I think , as I catch sight of him , striding into LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Jerwood Space , in perfect time for our meeting .
Dressed in a navy , double - breasted overcoat , Van Hove is , at 58 , tall , lean and clean - shaven with a non - experimental look .
Ask the unenlightened to imagine what his career might be and no one would guess avant - garde theatre director .
He could pass as the lawyer he once intended to become .
Born in Heist - op - den - Berg , in rural Belgium , he now lives in Amsterdam .
His company travels the world and his productions excite rave notices , occasional dissenters , strong opinions .
All his shows Ã¢â¬ â including Juliet BinocheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Antigone , Scenes from a Marriage , A View from the Bridge ( for which he won an Olivier for best director ) Ã¢â¬ â are designed by his partner ( in life and work ) of more than 30 years , Jan Versweyveld .
They share a daring , immaculate , less - is - more style : subtraction is their way of laying drama bare .
Sometimes literally Ã¢â¬ â their legendary 1998 Streetcar involved full - frontal nudity and was organised around a claw - footed bathtub .
Van
HoveÃ¢â¬
â¢ s decision about where we are to sit in the empty cafe is swift .
An unimportant decision yet there is no mistaking the reflexes of an autocrat Ã¢â¬ â
he is every inch a director .
Accompanying this impression , I have a suspicion that he expects , at any moment , to be irritated .
When answering questions , he has a long - suffering air , as if one were about to throw dust in his eyes or otherwise impede the progress of his day .
He is at his most likable when he hesitates , seeming to dig deeper , as if waiting for a truth to be revealed .
How much was David Bowie involved in your production of Lazarus ?
He was very involved : it was his life - long dream to put on what he called Ã¢â¬Åa play with my musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He got in touch with the producer Robert Fox Ã¢â¬ â who was an old friend of his Ã¢â¬ â and then the writer Enda Walsh spent a few days with him in New York talking about the story [ a sequel to Walter TevisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s novel The Man
Who Fell to Earth ] .
David made a selection of 60 - 70 songs .
Then they told Robert : Ã¢â¬ÅNow we need a director.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
They did not want a conventional director or a big Broadway musical , they wanted something innovative and Robert Fox said : Ã¢â¬ÅI have Ivo here.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
What was Bowie like to work with ?
One thinks of him as a theatre in himselfÃ¢â¬
Â¦
Not at all Ã¢â¬ â
he was a very quiet man .
A real English gentleman , a serious artist .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve always been a fan
[ Van Hove used BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s song
The Motel for his Angels in America ] .
After Bowie became sick , we had a camera installed during workshops , so he could follow .
Every day , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d call me to say : Ã¢â¬ÅWow , this is greatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , or : Ã¢â¬ÅI think you should think about thisÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And what was a happy surprise was that he never used his power , he was collaborative .
He had strong but constructive opinions .
Perhaps it was good for him in his last months to be working on such a project ?
It is clear from his album Blackstar that it was a creative period .
He wanted these things [ play and album ] to happen , they were very important to him .
You must miss him .
Does the musical now feel like a homage ?
I do miss him .
It is clear .
But listen , I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to pretend we were friends .
I never was at his home .
And the show has not become a homage , that was never my intention .
But I do think the show will make even more sense now than it ever has .
That is interesting because Lazarus was described in the Guardian as Ã¢â¬ÅthrillingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
but Ã¢â¬ÅincomprehensibleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ?
Is there anything you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t understand about it yourself ?
There is nothing I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t understand .
I immediately got the sense of it as an existentialist play about a man who is living dead , in eternal mourning for the love of his life , wondering how to make sense of it all .
It was not so distant from Bergman who , although totally different from Bowie , is also asking about existence .
The last line of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album Blackstar is : Ã¢â¬ÅI canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t give everything away.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Do you worry about giving your all and about giving too much away ?
I give it all as Bowie gave it all Ã¢â¬ â in a masked way .
I have called my productions masked autobiographies .
They say something about how I feel , what I am afraid of , what I am hoping for Ã¢â¬ â utopia , lost paradises Ã¢â¬ â that is what my productions are about .
So this is a very personal production
but I can not give it all away .
You are known for your extremely physical , challenging , hands - on direction .
Yet you seem aloof Ã¢â¬ â reserved .
Do you change when you go into the rehearsal room ?
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m the same person .
Listen , how to say this ?
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve just come from a Skype meeting , planning next season , and was behaving differently from the way IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m behaving with you now .
And when I go into a rehearsal room , my philosophy is that once you close the door , everything is allowed because you are living in an imaginary world .
You are playing Ã¢â¬
â
yet it is serious .
A play needs to entertain but also do more , it must go deeper .
In that room , every fantasy is allowed .
Exploration is what good actors are interested in , they donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to spend their lives in their comfort zone .
You trained as a lawyer .
What made you jump tracks ?
The seed was planted when I was young .
When I was 11 , I was sent to an old - fashioned Belgian boarding school of 800 boys .
On Wednesday afternoons , there were no lessons .
There were beautiful football fields but
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t choose to play in them .
You were allowed to go into the small town for the girls , which I also did not do .
Impulsively , I joined a theatre group .
There was no reason to choose theatre in that I did not come from an artistic background
Ã¢â¬ â my father was a pharmacist , my mother a housewife .
I made a choice , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know why Ã¢â¬ â that is the miracle of life .
And I very quickly discovered the warmth of theatre .
At boarding school , it was all walls
Ã¢â¬
â you couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t get out .
Boarding school was a world within a world and this theatre group was a world within that world , within the big world outside .
I discovered the warmth of creating something together that no one else knew about .
And then , at the end of the school term , we put on our production and got applause for it .
But it was not the applause that interested me so much as the secrecy and warmth .
Does your working marriage with your set designer , Jan Versweyveld , ever get too close for comfort ?
No Ã¢â¬ â although we have our ups and downs .
I can illustrate this with a story .
Dora van der Groen , the most famous of Belgian actresses Ã¢â¬ â our equivalent to Sarah Bernhardt Ã¢â¬ â was in love with one of my first productions , Agatha , by Marguerite Duras .
We became friends .
She said : Ã¢â¬ÅIvo , between you and theatre it is a very good marriage.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The bad times should not destroy the good .
He and I are good at enjoying the good times and not allowing ourselves to be crushed by the bad .
We are together in stress but also in joy .
You have been called by the New York Times critic Ben Brantley a Ã¢â¬Åmaximalist
minimalistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â
does he have that right ?
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t improve on that .
Is being faithful to a text important ?
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know what Ã¢â¬Åbeing faithful to a textÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ means .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not one truth .
As a director or actor , you have to give an interpretation of a line .
I get 10 different people to say Ã¢â¬ÅI love
youÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â three words , an objective truth Ã¢â¬
â and yet each time it is spoken
it is different .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m known for my preparation .
For actors , this is not a threat , it is freedom .
I like to create the world in which the text will blossom best .
You directed Hedda Gabler in 2004 and won an Obie .
Why return to it ?
I like sometimes to revisit .
This National Theatre production will be conceptually the same but have a London flavour .
Ruth [ Wilson ] and I have been talking about Hedda .
What is brilliant is that Ibsen , writing over a century ago , saw so clearly .
Hedda is a frustrated housewife but different from Nora in A DollÃ¢â¬ â¢ s House .
Nora becomes clear in her choices , Hedda remains enigmatic .
Ruth and I have to answer the Ã¢â¬ÅwhyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ but not reveal it .
And we have found something which I could show you from the text but will not do soÃ¢â¬
Â¦
What are the advantages of being artistic director of your own theatre company ?
How do you cope with crazy overload ?
I sleep seven hours a night .
I call the group , which regularly visits the Barbican , my laboratory on a large scale .
I have 21 fully employed actors and we play all over the world in Dutch Ã¢â¬
â often four hours with subtitles , and people stay .
We can make a difference in the world , actors are still celebrated .
Your range of work seems eclectic :
Shakespeare , Sophocles , Arthur Miller , Tony Kushner , E Annie ProulxÃ¢â¬ Â¦ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not eclectic .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m interested in two basic things .
Our existence , as in Lazarus .
Why are we here ?
Can we make sense of it ?
We could commit suicide .
Why donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t we ?
And then I am interested in politics but only in the Greek way Ã¢â¬ â polis meaning society .
After 9/11 , it became more important to deal with huge texts .
Kings of War involved thinking about leadership , the issue of this and the next decades .
In the US , they are lost ... something really has to change .
You are about to direct Jude Law in Obsession .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re used to plays being turned into film , what are the challenges of going in the opposite direction ?
It is two different languages .
I made movies [ Thuisfront for Dutch TV and Amsterdam in 2009 ] .
With movies , every day is the premiere .
In a movie , you are god of creation and , at the end , make the edit .
I still remember an off day after which I assumed the work would be unusable .
It turned into the best scene in the film .
That could never happen in the theatre .
Turning film into theatre is a huge challenge
Ã¢â¬ â
it is like being the first ever director of Hamlet .
I have to establish a theatrical world , a world premiere .
I do it because movies have an extremity IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve rarely found in theatre .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m doing Obsession with three English and three English - speaking Dutch actors .
I wanted Jude Law , who was shooting in Rome .
When we met , I impulsively thought of Obsession .
And it was immediately clear he wanted to work with me .
He read Obsession and really liked it
Ã¢â¬
â
it is visceral ...
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve had audiences at the edges of the stage and even mingling with actors .
Is the relationship with audiences something you think a lot about ?
Some people say theatre will not survive the 21st century , I say it will be the art form .
Why ?
Because it is live .
It is a world of magic , so - called .
Theatre is a venue and we can do whatever we want in it .
If you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to take risks , donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be in the theatre .
The same , perhaps , is true of life .

2016-11-08,"How to describe this feted New York import by David Bowie and Enda Walsh ?
Ã¢â¬ÅMusicalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ seems inadequate .
It is part sci - fi story , part rock concert , part video installation , part study in alienation .
But , while the separate ingredients are fascinating to watch in Ivo van
HoveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s kaleidoscopic production , I rarely felt moved .
The impulse behind the show came from Bowie himself who wanted to explore further the character of Thomas Newton , the extraterrestrial he played in the 1976 Nicolas Roeg movie The Man Who Fell to Earth .
Now , suffocatingly rich and living a life of alcoholic seclusion in New York , the hero might best be described as Thomas the tanked alien .
He pines for a lost earthly love , Mary Lou , is covertly worshipped by his assistant , Elly , and is visited by an ethereal character known simply as Girl who offers him the prospect of building a rocket to return to his native planet .
Many New York critics , on the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s debut last December , professed to be bewildered by the plot .
I took it to be an exploration of the existential angst that pervades BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music : this is the story of a man never wholly at ease in himself or his surroundings .
It was also shrewd of Bowie to engage Walsh to write the book because , in plays such as Ballyturk and The Walworth Farce , the Irish dramatist has shown a hypnotised fascination with characters who create fantasy worlds to allay their solitude .
WalshÃ¢â¬ â¢ s script is also stuffed with literary clues .
Thomas quotes HamletÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅIn that sleep of death what dreams may comeÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , suggesting he identifies with the Danish prince torn between two worlds , and it is no accident that the ghostly Girl is called Marley , like ScroogeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s revenant partner in A Christmas Carol .
The ingredients are all there , but do they add up to a memorable show ?
Yes and no .
The big draw is clearly the Bowie score .
Of the 17 songs some are old , some new and , at best , they extend the dramatic situation .
When Amy Lennox Ã¢â¬ â the main newcomer to the cast and outstanding as Elly Ã¢â¬ â sings the 1971 song Changes , it seems a logical expression of her urge to transform herself into the lost Mary - Lou .
At other times , as when the whey - faced Sophia Anne Caruso as Girl sings Life on Mars ? , I felt the number , which is surely about earthbound ennui , is less strictly relevant to the character .
But Bowie buffs will be delighted to hear so many songs very well played by an onstage band situated behind a clear acrylic screen .
Van Hove , his long - term designer Jan Versweyveld and the video designer
Tal Yarden have created an engrossing spectacle .
The deliberate plainness of the surround is offset by the profusion of images that pour from a central screen depicting everything from the neon sickness of urban America to the Berlin background of
Where Are We Now ?
At one point a character even emerges from the screen to become a peripatetic hologram .
I also admired Michael C Hall , who conveys the desperation of the lonely , time - suspended Thomas and Michael Esper , who lends Valentine , a serial killer symbolising EarthÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dark forces , a saturnine vigour .
Yet , for all the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s skill , I found myself more impressed by the visual sophistication than emotionally engaged by the story : only when Lennox sang of her divided self and when Hall gazed wistfully at the lost delights of earthly love was I moved .
Of course , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great to hear the Bowie songs and his death lends the show a patina of melancholy .
But , watching this spectacular study of a pained outsiderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s search for peace , I too felt a sense of alienation .

2016-11-10,"The deaths of Prince and David Bowie , whose musical Lazarus opened in London this week , were reminders of how theatrical the greatest rock stars can be .
Yet there remains a gulf between the worlds of theatre and modern music ( by which I mean pop , guitar bands , hip - hop , electronic sounds : anything that inhabits grassroots gig or club spaces rather than classical concert halls ) .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s beginning to change with the rise of theatre presented as a gigs , such as Weekend Rockstars , and works such as the crazed J - pop explosion Miss Revolutionary Idol Berserker at Lift festival .
But the crossover between these two worlds can be fraught and unpredictable .
This summer , RÃÂ³isÃÂ­n Murphy gave the first contemporary live music performance at ShakespeareÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Globe in London .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s maybe symbolic that the Globe announced its parting of ways with artistic director Emma Rice shortly after its production of Imogen , which reimagined Cymbeline with grime beats .
As someone who works with and writes about modern musicians , from the pop heartland to the experimental fringes , I was asked to help in programming the All the Right Notes season for Camden PeopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s theatre .
They had theatre pieces with musical elements , and wanted me to bring in musicians with a theatrical edge .
It was thrilling to think about Ã¢â¬ â and quickly I found a grime veteran willing to perform his work as spoken word ( Flowdan ) and a rave provocateur with whom I can reconstruct 5 am chillout room conversations ( Andy Blake ) .
But the process made me realise how little I know about theatre , its mechanics and its culture .
Then I became aware that both sides were baffled by each other .
Even some of the sharpest , most out - there minds in the theatre world seemed to have a hang - up that music was fundamentally Ã¢â¬ÅcoolerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ than theatre .
As writer - performer Rachel Mars , whose Our Carnal Hearts forms part of the CPT season , puts it : Ã¢â¬ÅTheatre is a very nerdy world , not very rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll , really.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When I spoke to friends in the music world , the general impression of theatre tended towards total ignorance or a sense that it was all highbrow and , as such , intimidating .
When pressed on the differences , Mars says : Ã¢â¬ÅGigs are about quite an ecstatic experience , losing yourself along with a crowd of people Ã¢â¬ â which usually means a constant stream of music .
It doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t always work so well when that is interrupted by dialogue or anything else that isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t expected by the audience.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Our Carnal Hearts , written with the composer Louise Mothersole , is built around Ã¢â¬Åsacred harpÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ singing from the southern US states : Ã¢â¬ÅitÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about the deeply seductive and manipulative act of communal singingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and leads the audience into Ã¢â¬Åsome really quite horrid
thingsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Matt Regan concurs that the live music circuit is not always receptive to alterations in the usual formats .
A working classical musician , but also a singer - songwriter , inspired in part by Sufjan StevensÃ¢â¬ â¢ s performances , he began to want to Ã¢â¬Åbe identified as something other than a front - personÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and to perform Ã¢â¬Åweird gigsÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ using narration , lighting and staging
that go beyond the standard performance format .
Ã¢â¬ÅSometimes it worked , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut mostly , gig audiences were just baffled if the music stopped and
I started talking about something cryptic.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A friend who worked at the Tron theatre in Glasgow persuaded him that he should try his show in a theatre space rather than the standard gig venues heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been using .
Immediately his Ã¢â¬Åweird gigsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ became the theatre piece cum song cycle Greater Belfast , and he found himself Ã¢â¬Åmore welcomed than I could imagineÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ by the theatre world .
Regan says the theatre offers Ã¢â¬Åfar , far more freedom to create what you wantÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ than the music circuit .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd being pragmatic , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he adds , Ã¢â¬Åmore security , too .
Where the best I could see happening with the gig circuit was essentially a life touring small venues , with theatre , once youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re established a bit , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the possibility of funding , of residencies , of building up a proper little team around your production .
When I think of how I can maintain working as a creative person , this seems a better route.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Nwando Ebizie had her feet in live music and theatre before she created The Passion of Lady Vendredi .
In the show , Ebizie plays Ã¢â¬Åa voodoo priestess from a parallel dimensionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and she also has a convincing rock star persona , splicing equal parts Poly Styrene , Grace Jones and MIA .
It has been well - received in theatres and gig / club spaces : its punky energy is more than enough to keep crowds on their feet , and Lady Vendredi as rock star stands up on the five - track EP she has released of the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs .
However , when I ask if sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ever been tempted to build Lady VendrediÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career Ã¢â¬ â make albums , tour properly on the gig circuit Ã¢â¬
â she is horrified .
Ã¢â¬ÅNo !
That would be absurd!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she gasps .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
mean , I could do it , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d go mad Ã¢â¬
Â¦
We had to tone down the rhythms and stuff in the show , just for the sake of my own wellbeing.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ SheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s agog at the ability of music stars
, be they Axl Rose or Kanye West , to inhabit the same inflated persona their whole lives .
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know how they manage it
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI suppose the money helps.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
She thinks that theatre is doctrinal in insisting on the primacy of narrative over other elements : Ã¢â¬ÅEuropean theatre at least , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ she says , Ã¢â¬Åis hung up on the text .
It uses music , of course , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s pretty unusual to let it be as central as the words and visuals , to be completely integrated in the way you might find in some other cultures.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true that theatre and modern music have distinct infrastructures , rituals , social functions and written or unwritten rules of conduct that in many cases serve to keep them separate .
But a more positive way to look at the gap between them is as a wide - open space of possibility .
Rock , pop and soul have existed for maybe 60 years , hip - hop and disco for 40 , electronica and rave for less than that : all are still maturing , still have many of their mechanisms unexamined or little understood , and all have deep and fundamental human experiences at their heart .
Beyond the jukebox musical , beyond the concept album , beyond the rock star changing costumes between songs , there are untold dramatic ideas still to be explored in the hinterland .

2016-11-11,"The first items from David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s personal art collection were sold at auction in London on Thursday , fetching more than ÃÂ£24 m .
A 1984 Jean - Michel Basquiat painting , titled Air Power , was the most expensive of the night , selling for nearly ÃÂ£7.1 m including premium Ã¢â¬ â double the pre - sale upper estimate of ÃÂ£3.5 m .
Another Basquiat work , Untitled , sold for nearly ÃÂ£2.4 m , more than three times its ÃÂ£700,000 upper estimate .
The only work by Bowie himself to go on sale in this first batch was Beautiful , Hallo , Space - boy Painting , an allusion to the astronaut character Major Tom , a recurring presence in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs .
The painting , which he produced with Damien Hirst , sold for ÃÂ£785,000 .
The auction hall in SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s London offices was packed for Thursday nightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sale , the first of three that SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s said will offer about 400 lots from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s personal collection .
At one point the audience was held in suspense as bidding for Air Power reached ÃÂ£5.5 m and a phone bidder said he needed to call his wife before deciding whether to go any higher .
The anonymous bidder went to ÃÂ£5.8 m but was unsuccessful .
The first two sales at SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , including ThursdayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 47-lot sale and a day sale on Friday , focus on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s modern and contemporary art pieces .
The third , which will also be on Friday , will include pieces by the designer Ettore Sottsass and other members of ItalyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Memphis group .
The second most expensive work was Frank AuerbachÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Head of Gerda Boehm , which fetched almost ÃÂ£3.8 m Ã¢â¬ â about ÃÂ£3.3 m more than was expected .
Speaking to the New York Times in 1998 about his admiration for Auerbach , Bowie said : Ã¢â¬ÅI think there are some mornings that if we hit each other a certain way Ã¢â¬ â myself and a portrait by Auerbach Ã¢â¬ â the work can magnify the kind of depression IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going through .
It will give spiritual weight to my angst.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The proceeds of the sale will go to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s estate , which together with SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s spent several months putting the auction together , a spokeswoman for the auction house told Agence France - Presse . Ã¢â¬ÅDavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s art collection was fuelled by personal interest and compiled out of passion .
He always sought and encouraged loans from the collection and enjoyed sharing the works in his custody , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said a spokesperson for the estate .
Ã¢â¬ÅThough his family are keeping certain pieces of particular personal significance , it is now time to give others the opportunity to appreciate Ã¢â¬ â and acquire Ã¢â¬ â the art and objects he
so admired.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie , who died from cancer aged 69 in January , was an avid art collector and used to go to auctions , before buying more discreetly .
He also served on the editorial board of the magazine Modern Painters during the 1990s .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe would interview artists that he thought were good , but on the whole he was very private about his art collecting , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Simon Hucker , senior specialist in modern and post - war British art at SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , speaking before the auction ."
2016-11-11,"Another giant of music has gone and his fans are in mourning .
There were hints that Leonard Cohen would not live much longer , but in a year that has already taken away Prince , David Bowie and George Martin , his death Ã¢â¬ â announced via a Facebook post on Thursday Ã¢â¬ â still came as a shock .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet , songwriter and artist , Leonard Cohen has passed away .
We have lost one of musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most revered and prolific visionaries , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the post said .
Twitter was soon awash in tributes from singers , writers , poets and public figures mourning the loss of a musical giant .
The Canadian prime minister , Justin Trudeau , sent out two tweets , first in French and then in English .
Ã¢â¬ÅNo other artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music felt or sounded like Leonard CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
Yet his work resonated across generations ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Trudeau wrote .
Ã¢â¬ÅCanada and the world will miss him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Trudeau then quoted from one of CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s best - known songs , Hallelujah ( 1984 ) , which took the artist five years to write and has been covered by hundreds of artists Ã¢â¬ â including , most famously , Jeff Buckley .
Musicians across all genres , from hip - hop to pop to rock , tweeted out their condolences , including Ben Folds , Peter Hook from Joy Division and New Order , KD Lang , Slash , Lily Allen and Bette Midler .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnother magical voice stilled , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote Midler .
Cohen alluded to his own death in a recent and wide - ranging interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick , in which he talked about his unfinished poems and lyrics .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe big change is the proximity to death , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅI am a tidy kind of guy .
I like to tie up the strings if I can .
If I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s OK .
But my natural thrust is to finish things that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve begun .
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll be able to finish those songs ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he continued .
Ã¢â¬ÅMaybe , who knows ?
And maybe IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll get a second wind ,
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know .
But I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t dare attach myself to a spiritual strategy .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t dare do that .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got some work to do .
Take care of business .
I am ready to die .
I hope itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not too uncomfortable .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s about it for me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The New Yorker has published the audio of that interview online .
Some of the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biggest artist count Cohen among their influences .
He was a songwriting peer and friend of Bob Dylan , who told the New Yorker : Ã¢â¬ÅWhen people talk about Leonard , they fail to mention his melodies , which to me , along with his lyrics , are his greatest genius ...
As far as I know , no one else comes close to this in modern music.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Speaking in Los Angeles this month at a Q&amp;A session for his most recent album , You Want
It Darker , Cohen returned the favour , speaking of DylanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recent Nobel Prize win : Ã¢â¬ÅTo me , [ the award ] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Kurt Cobain was also affected by the writing of Cohen ; in NirvanaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Pennyroyal Tea , from the album
In Utero , he sung : Ã¢â¬ÅGive me Leonard Cohen afterworld , so I can sigh eternally.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In an interview with MTV in 1995 , the year after CobainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s suicide , Cohen revealed the band had attended a performance of his in Seattle in 1993 .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬
â¢ m sorry
I couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have spoken to the young man , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere are always alternatives , and I might have been able to lay something on him .
Or maybe not.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Cohen was also a poet and author , whose 1966 novel Beautiful Losers was praised by the Boston Globe upon release :
Ã¢â¬ÅJames Joyce is not dead .
He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Writing for the Guardian in 2008 , Alex Larman said Cohen the poet deserved as much appreciation as Cohen the songwriter .
Ã¢â¬ÅCohen would still be highly thought of if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never written a song in his life but had stuck to writing his wry , ironic , tender verse , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he wrote .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs
CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical career acquired momentum , many of his collections were either compilations of earlier poems or collections of lyrics .
Nevertheless , the writing elevates Cohen into that rare pantheon
where a musicianÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lyrics are actually poetry.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first album , released in 1967 , contained classic songs including Suzanne , Sisters of Mercy and So Long , Marianne , written for his muse and lover Marianne Ihlen , who died in July this year .
Before she died , Cohen wrote Marianne an email , which has since gone viral .
Ã¢â¬ÅWell Marianne , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart
and I think I will follow you very soon
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ the email read .
Ã¢â¬ÅKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand , I think you can reach mine ...
Goodbye old friend .
Endless love , see you down the road.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Cohen was appointed Companion of the Order of Canada in 2002
Ã¢â¬ â the countryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s highest honour .
In a statement at the time , the governer general praised him as a Ã¢â¬ÅCanadian iconÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ whose Ã¢â¬Åcontinued popularity confirms his status as a ... venerated dean of the pop culture movementÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
His manager , Robert Kory , wrote in a statement :
Ã¢â¬ÅUnmatched in his creativity , insight and crippling candour , Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed .
I was blessed to call him a friend , and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand , was a privilege and great gift .
He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight , inspiration and healing for generations to come.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Writers too were mourning the loss , including Gary Shteyngart , who quoted from CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s song Everybody Knows .
Lin - Manuel Miranda , the creator of hit Broadway musical Hamilton , tweeted lyrics from Suzanne .
Many pointed out the auspicious timing of CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , in the same week the United States surprised many by electing Donald Trump .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe got out just in time , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said podcaster and comedian Marc Maron .
Canadian comedian and actor Mark Critch had a similar take : Ã¢â¬ÅLeonard knew when to leave a party.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅI donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think this week could get any worse , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote actor Molly Ringwald .
Rob Lowe tweeted : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve experienced the loss of many legends , but never have I seen so many works quoted in their passing.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Actor Russell Crowe thanked him for Ã¢â¬Åthe quiet nights , the reflection , the perspective , the wry smiles and the truthÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and burlesque star , model and entrepreneur Dita von Teese said he had Ã¢â¬Åthe most sensual male voice of all timeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
New Zealand artist Bic Runga , who opened for Leonard Cohen during a 2010 tour , posted a photo of her meeting Ã¢â¬Åone of my heroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬

A previous version incorrectly said Leonard Cohen died a day after Donald TrumpÃ¢â¬ â¢ s election ."
2016-11-23,"For many people 2016 , which brought the planet Brexit , the Donald Trump election victory , the deaths of Prince , David Bowie and Leonard Cohen and the brief union that was Twiddleswift , has not been the greatest of years .
In fact , the year has become so maligned that Twitter is now awash with scores of posts listing the strange and terrible things that the last 11 months can be compared to .
Among the suggested metaphors for 2016 are a boy being knocked over by an uncooperative wheelie bin , two bald eagles stuck in a drain and the death of Courage , the Thanksgiving turkey pardoned by Barack Obama in 2009 .
Here , we collate some of the most poignant :
In this one , a crab rips its own arm off .
And here , a polar bear pats a dog - and then eats it .
In more animal news , two moose were found frozen in a lake , locked in combat .
2017 - you have a lot to live up to ."
2016-11-29,"Bookended by the death of David Bowie and the election of a KKK - endorsed braggart to leader of the free world , this was a year of terrible things .
Terrible things , however , call for a particular kind of expression
and so it was that the open letter returned with a vengeance .
This year , women in particular claimed a form previously more associated with sanctimonious venting than with paradigm shifting and the results were sometimes extraordinary .
The most radical piece of writing I read ( and reread ) this year was the letter written by the young woman to Brock Turner , her attacker in the Stanford sexual assault case .
This was nothing less than a reckoning Ã¢â¬ â a mind and heart grappling with not just what had happened to her , but what humanity itself might mean when a stranger could rape an unconscious woman behind a dumpster .
It is a testament to the strength of her words , to their steady and furious eloquence , that it no longer feels appropriate to refer to the 23-year - old author as a Ã¢â¬ÅvictimÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Whether she intended to or not , she transcended victimhood .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou took away my worth , my privacy , my energy , my time , my safety , my intimacy , my confidence , my own voice , until today.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In recent months , it has seemed more urgent than ever for women to speak up and refuse to have their voices taken away .
When , for example , the most experienced Democratic presidential candidate of all time is shouted over by her reality - TV - star male opponent , the abstract notion of the female voice being heard takes on a dire cast .
Yet , as the confessional first - person - essay industry becomes saturated , female self - exposure no longer seems unassailably and inherently radical .
The well - worn feminist axiom that the personal is political should , as with any soundbite , invite our scrutiny .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vital that we talk about sexual assault , for example , but a womanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s account of a terrible thing that happened to her is by no means automatically meaningful .
When a confessional piece commodifies a personÃ¢â¬ â¢
s trauma purely in service of clicks and traffic , the abasement isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t hers so much as our own .
The term Ã¢â¬ÅletterÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ may not safeguard against this , but it does , with the weight of its literary past , help summon a greater civility , gravity and sincerity .
Those are not necessarily qualities associated with 21st - century celebrity .
Jennifer Aniston , RenÃ Â© e Zellweger , Emma Watson , Jennifer Lawrence , Mila Kunis and Rose McGowan are among the famous actors to have written open letters this year , and any trend that reaches such a celebrity critical mass is easy to deride , particularly when its visible champions are wealthy white women .
A black transgender woman living in rural poverty needs equal pay legislation far more urgently than a multi - millionaire movie star , but if words from Jennifer Lawrence help that happen , so be it .
By definition , an open letter seeks to move outwards and many have transcended personal grievance into something that serves a wider awakening .
AnistonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , for example , ends by reminding us of our agency : Ã¢â¬Åcultural standards [ ... ] are a collective acceptance , a subconscious agreement .
We are in charge of our agreement.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
And these letters are also changing the nature of celebrity .
First , they allow a famous person to deliver her message independently , untempered by the subjectivity of journalists like me .
Whether the result is floundering in confusion or brilliantly argued , the effect is the same : they humanise women we too readily idolise or demonise .
( When it comes to female celebrity , those two impulses are trickily interwoven . )
Second , they might cause us to reappraise what we value in these women .
Aniston is among those featured in Porter magazineÃ¢â¬ â¢ s end - of - year special , which features 50 women celebrated not just for their achievements , but for Ã¢â¬Åhaving a positive impact on othersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Fittingly , the issue includes four open letters that explicitly aspire to the universal .
Serena Williams addresses hers Ã¢â¬ÅTo all incredible women who strive for excellenceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ( right ) ; Simone Biles begins with Ã¢â¬ÅDear teenage girls everywhereÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ; Sharon Horgan writes to Ã¢â¬ÅAll the men IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve known and lovedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ; and Amber Heard , who has accused her ex - husband Johnny Depp of domestic abuse in the face of his denials , writes to , Ã¢â¬ÅMy silent sisters everywhereÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
PorterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s editor Lucy Yeomans says : Ã¢â¬ÅLike the best correspondence , these are heartfelt and personal , but also speak to us all .
A good letter
canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just be a sentiment
Ã¢â¬ â
it has to be really artfully expressed and the ones that strike a chord are authentic .
Maybe , then , the rise of the open letter means weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re more likely to celebrate people who have wisdom , people who have something to say.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no bad thing , but it is curious that we have come to expect actors , women whose very job it is to pretend to be other people , to be agents of political conviction .
As Jia Tolentino wrote last month , Ã¢â¬ÅAn essential burden of womanhood remains that of being required , by everyone , to signify too much.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
With high - profile women , this makes for a Ã¢â¬Åheated veneration that canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t yet be entirely separated from hateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and this heat and hate is visible in the coverage surrounding open letters .
After Rose McGowan wrote to the movie industry urging it to stop working with known sexual predators and described the experience of red - carpet cameras panning up and down her body as feeling like Ã¢â¬Åvisual rapeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , the Daily Mail reported on it by printing plenty of photos of her on said red carpet .
One image was captioned :
Ã¢â¬ÅMcGowanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s activism is a far cry from years earlier when McGowan made headlines for wearing a sheer metal dress [ Ã¢â¬
Â¦ ]Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ , as if a certain kind of dress disqualified a woman from making any statement about gender equality .
As if only women who covered their bodies should have any right to speak about them .
Sometimes , though , the cute and earnest futility of open letters can just be cringingly funny .
Girls actor Allison Williams recently shared an open letter to her friend Lena DunhamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s endometriosis .
Ã¢â¬ÅDear Endometriosis : screw you , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ it began , as if the disease were a pesky cartoon character who would receive this message , emit the word Ã¢â¬ÅEek!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ in a speech bubble , then turn on tail and run .
DunhamÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fruitlessly anthropomorphised endometriosis would find good company within the series in McSweeneyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s literary journal , which lightly lampoons the delusions of the form .
The intended recipients of Ã¢â¬ÅOpen Letters to People Or Entities who Are Unlikely to RespondÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ include Ã¢â¬Åmy sonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recorderÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
( Ã¢â¬ÅWe have sacrificed livers full of mid - week Pinot trying to drown out the distress you generateÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
The frustrations of inanimate objects are , of course , in a different strata to the experience of the young woman who wrote to Turner .
Hers was the power of words in its purest , most direct form Ã¢â¬ â a virality based not on shock , but on awe .
Even the vice - president was impelled to respond .
Joe Biden chose to write her an open letter of his own : Ã¢â¬ÅIt must have been wrenching Ã¢â¬ â to relive what he did to you all over again .
But you did it anyway , in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else .
Your bravery is breathtaking.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
When so much is at stake , we choose words wisely , reminding ourselves that real power isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t about shouting the loudest , but speaking the clearest truths .

2016-12-08,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
closest collaborators are to mark the first anniversary of his death and what would have been his 70th birthday with a series of gigs featuring Ã¢â¬ÅBowie people playing Bowie music Bowie styleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
A London show at the Brixton Academy on 8 January , his birthday , was previously announced Ã¢â¬ â and has long since sold out .
Now Bowie band members Mike Garson , Adrian Belew , Earl Slick , Gail Ann Dorsey , Sterling Campbell , Zacahary Alford , Holly Palmer and Emm Gryner , joined by a host of other musicians , will also play in New York , Los Angeles , Sydney and Tokyo .
The statement announcing the shows noted : Ã¢â¬ÅIndividually these former Bowie band members performed , wrote and recorded together with David through several decades including the 1973Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Ziggy Stardust tour , the Diamond Dogs tour , Isolar II ( Heroes ) tour , to the hugely successful Serious Moonlight tour , the Sound and Vision greatest hits tour to Glastonbury 2000 , Heathen , his final A Reality Tour and many of them appeared on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s triumphant comeback album , The Next Day.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The London show Ã¢â¬ â compered by Gary Oldman Ã¢â¬ â will be followed by shows at Terminal 5 in New York ( 10 January ) , the Wiltern in Los Angeles ( 25 January ) , Sydney Opera House ( 29 January ) and Tokyo Dome City Hall ( 2 February ) .
Garson , Slick , Campbell and Dorsey were in the band that backed Lorde at the acclaimed Bowie tribute at the Brits earlier this year .
On that occasion , they were joined by Gerry Leonard and Catherine Russell , who will also appear at the Brixton Academy concert ."
2016-12-08,"As this miserable year comes to a close I have finally found a way to deal with Donald TrumpÃ¢â¬ â¢ s victory in the US presidential election .
And , while weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re at it , the Brexit vote .
And the deaths of Prince , David Bowie , Alan Rickman , Victoria Wood , Leonard Cohen and the rest .
I know what youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re thinking : something which deals with this cloudburst of apocalyptically framed headlines , bombshells and all round calamity must be strong juju indeed .
And it is .
Brace yourselves .
Here it comes : itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a tub of HaÃÂ¤gen - Dazs salted caramel ice - cream .
DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be surprised ; it was always bound to be something serious .
As they say on the BBC , other brands are available .
And other flavours for that matter .
This , my friends , is my magic cure - all for 2016 : comfort eating .
Lots of it .
Lock the doors , switch off the phone , clear a space on the sofa and pull off the lid .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s time .
Often , comfort eating gets a bad press .
In 2013 it was added to the US Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the bible for psychiatrists , as a condition in need of treatment .
Then again , theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve managed to pathologise almost everything .
The manual also includes histrionic personality disorder ( what the rest of us call being a total drama queen ) and dependent personality disorder ( being needy ) so we shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t worry that they want to get us on the couch for our comfort food habits .
I suppose I should acknowledge that for some people bingeing can be a problem .
Then again , some people become alcoholics .
That doesnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t mean
the rest of us canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t extol the virtues of getting pissed occasionally .
( Another reasonable way to deal with the news , but with irritating side effects .
I long ago realised I hate hangovers more than I like being drunk . )
Comfort eating is a broad church .
I have specified ice - cream , because eating it is an all - consuming process .
It takes hard spoon work to get at .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the hit of cold in the mouth and only then does the flavour come through .
Finally you are soothed by the sensation of melted cream slipping down your throat .
And then it starts all over again .
Your comfort food may be something other : it may be instant noodles weaponised with extra dollops of sriracha sauce ; perhaps itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a whole tube of Pringles ( although not the special edition mint and chocolate ones ; IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m trying to help you feel better here , not encourage a perversion ) .
When we reach for comfort food we are going in search of the simplest version of ourselves , the small child that remains within us ; the one who was nurtured by the food cooked for us by those whose love we trusted .
We yearn to be the child who was protected from knowing about ( let alone understanding ) exactly what was going on in the world .
Wanting to be that child again , wanting not to know , is a rational response to the headlines .
For that reason comfort foods are always the simplest propositions : a blunt hit of sugar or fat or chilli to overwhelm the senses and silence the voices in our heads telling us that too many of the good ones die young , or that the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going to hell in a handcart .
This , then , is how I shall celebrate the passing of a dismal year .
Not with reflection and deep thought .
Not with news overload and anxiety .
But with a spoon in one hand and a tub in the other .
Join me ."
2016-12-14,"To say that David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album was coloured by his death two days after its release , and the revelation that he recorded it beneath the terminal shadow of cancer , would be an understatement .
It was flooded by it .
Few albums have ever been subjected to so much exegesis so quickly .
Was the central image , coming from the author of Starman and multiple ruminations on stardom , an act of self - erasure ?
Were the lyrics of Lazarus ( Ã¢â¬ÅLook up here , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heavenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) not just a reference to the lead character in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s confounding stage musical , an alien trapped in a Manhattan purgatory between life and death , but a loaded farewell ?
And what about those allusions to Elvis , Aleister Crowley , cosmology and the villa of Ormen ?
What did it all mean ?
One thing is certain .
Regardless of the circumstances or the rune - reading , Blackstar ranks among BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very best albums .
Blackstar is a self - contained world .
Despite drawing inspiration from recent albums by DÃ¢â¬ â¢ Angelo and Kendrick Lamar , and featuring percussion from LCD SoundsystemÃ¢â¬ â¢ s James Murphy , it never strains to be of - the - moment like his 90s albums Outside and Earthling .
Nor does it reference BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s past as blatantly as his 2013 comeback
The Next Day .
Instead , he struck out for the fringes , the dark corners , the shadowlands , looking for one last new way to be David Bowie Ã¢â¬ â one final incandescent flare of creativity .
Bowie was always a consummate collaborator who sought out great players to facilitate each transition .
Saxophonist Donny McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
forward - thinking jazz band , especially the extraordinary drummer Mark Guiliana , enabled him to go in several directions at once .
The song Blackstar opens like a black mass , with an incense - whiff of dread , fades into the gloaming , re - emerges as a torch song , twists into a funk chant and loops back to the first section with twice the power .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s as commandingly ambitious a composition as Station to Station , the title track of the album with which Blackstar shares the most DNA .
Like Station to Station , Blackstar is an inky labyrinth of human cruelty and frailty shot through with moments of grace and transcendence , and obsessed with different kinds of transformation .
And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s another record on which each song carves out its own unique space , with no room for repetitions or redundancies .
Even BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s voice never does the same thing twice .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s haunted , wired , seductive , menacing , mischievous , kind : a final multifaceted performance from popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great actor .
There is panic and brutality in the surly nadsat paranoia of Girl Loves Me ; the murderous sexual jealousy of febrile drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass psychodrama Sue
( Or in a Season of Crime ) ; and the cackling vulgarity of Ã¢â¬ â¢
Tis Pity
She Was a Whore , a century - hopping fable of sex and violence .
Then there are songs of liberation and transmogrification .
On Lazarus , death becomes a kind of freedom .
Dollar Days is an expatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s farewell to Ã¢â¬Åthe English evergreensÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and a plea for more time .
I CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ t
Give Everything Away pivots on the titleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
poignant double meaning : a refusal to explain himself and a reluctance to let go .
The wistful harmonica nods to A New Career in a New Town from Low , while McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s saxophone , often an agent of chaos , becomes a means of elevation , sending the record spiraling into the sky , out of view .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
know something is very wrong ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie sings on the final track , and indeed it was , but then he was always fascinated by lives wrenched out of joint .
And long before he was ill , he was preoccupied with death : the looming darkness that makes the light so much brighter .
In 2002 , Interview magazine editor Ingrid Sischy asked Bowie what he felt the point of art was .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a head - spinning dichotomy Ã¢â¬ â of the lust for life against the finality of everything
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he replied .
Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s those two things raging against each other , you know ?
And that produces these moments that feel like real truth
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
That is the entire story , right there .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s it .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no more to be said.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Blackstar says it beautifully ."

2016-12-18,"For at least a decade , the arts have reliably made headlines in this country .
From David Bowie at the Victoria and Albert Museum and MatisseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cutouts at Tate Modern , Leonardo at the National Gallery , to the queues outside the Vikings exhibition at the British Museum , or the scarce tickets for One Man , Two Guvnors at the National Theatre , Britain has enjoyed a long and happy phase in which , energised by lottery funds , the popularity of even highbrow art forms has seen them leap from the feature pages into the news .
And behind this success a team of unfashionably white , middle - aged men have been working away .
Now , as we get ready to Ã¢â¬Åring out the oldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ at the end of the year , it is certainly true to say Ã¢â¬Åthe old order changethÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ in our cultural realm .
Perhaps sensing the winds of change , a succession of the distinguished artistic directors responsible for this golden era have either left , or are about to leave , their posts .
Martin Roth , the German director of the V&amp;A , has packed up after a series of extraordinarily popular exhibitions , including shows on Alexander McQueen and Bowie , staged over five years ; Sir Nicholas Serota , the man who helped transform public interest in contemporary art , is soon to step down after nearly 30 years at the Tate ; and Kasper Holten , the Dane who shook up audiences with adventurous productions during his five years as director of opera at Covent GardenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s opera house , is off at the end of March .
These departures come soon after Sir Nicholas Penny ( the second of three Sir Nicks in this departing Ã¢â¬Åold guardÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) left the National Gallery in 2015 , and Sir Nicholas Hytner bowed out at the National Theatre after a long period of unprecedented popularity , with hit productions such as War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night - Time .
In the past 12 months the revered Neil MacGregor has also been replaced at the head of the British Museum , following an illustrious 13-year reign .
So a period of relative stability and collaboration ends .
The arts world is stepping into the unknown , as together these men operated as a formidable political lobby .
Some might welcome a general shakeup next year , but for those who appreciate the huge shift in attitudes to BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creative industries , reflected in a largely successful campaign to protect them from government cuts , the outlook is less rosy .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe have had an amazing generation of artistic leaders in the UK , including the likes of the Nicks Serota and Hytner , and with people like Peter Bazalgette from the world of business playing an important role at the Arts Council of England , too , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Harriet Finney , deputy chief executive of the Creative Industries Federation , a national membership organisation .
Speaking this weekend , she raised doubts about the potentially diminishing appeal of LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s national arts institutions for talent from abroad .
Ã¢â¬ÅBritain has long been a magnet for people who are the best in their field from all over the world , and the departure of some of them this year amid rumbles of discontent over Britain becoming less international in outlook would be worrying , were it to become a trend ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
she said .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe will have to show that fears of the country turning inward are misplaced.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
This Christmas , after the loss of this fairly stable group , the countryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cultural status looks vulnerable .
Each of their former national institutions is in receipt of a large , endangered public grant , and as directors they liaised regularly rather than seeing each other as rivals .
It was a task that became increasingly vital as Tory arts ministers and chancellors questioned the need to support them .
At the time , Sir Tony Hall , now director - general of the BBC , was still running the Royal Opera House , and a series of meetings was set up to co - ordinate plans to combat funding cuts and then to shape the 2012 Cultural Olympiad that would accompany the London games .
This joint work indirectly helped deliver unexpected triumphs , such as the British MuseumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 100 Objects or the National TheatreÃ¢â¬ â¢ s acclaimed musical London Road : events that could not have been imagined without state subsidy .
And that sense of community continued , even as some of the personnel changed .
So the question is , can the next leaders of these celebrated cultural establishments present such a united front , while also producing work that delights and stretches their audiences ?
Predictably , this has been a frenzied time for job applications .
With so many key vacancies on offer , the keenest of candidates have had to choose which prize to set their sights on .
Female applicants from all over the world are being encouraged to storm these British citadels .
Male dominance is , after all , not just a British problem .
In 2015 the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 12 most popular art museums were all led by men .
Ã¢â¬ÅOne of the big challenges is finding the next generation to reflect the country at large Ã¢â¬ â women , BAME , people of all socioeconomic backgrounds , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Finney .
Ã¢â¬ÅSocial mobility is a massive issue .
If we want to make sure that culture in this country is accessible to everyone and is produced by the widest range of talents possible , we need to have an education system that gives all young people routes
in.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
At a farewell lunch at Tate Modern last Tuesday , Serota joked that he might decide to stay on .
In fact , his new appointment , taking over from Bazalgette as the chairman of Arts Council England , starts in the new year .
When Serota first took control of LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Tate Gallery in 1988 , it had just one venue , on Millbank .
Tate Liverpool opened later that year .
His application for the role had consisted of a seven - year plan that hinted heavily at his expansionist hopes .
Last year 4.7 million visitors came to shows at Tate Modern , the millennial art venue he set up inside the old Bankside power station on the edge of the Thames .
It is now the most popular modern art gallery in the world and is run , under Serota , by its first female director , Frances Morris .
Ã¢â¬ÅOne of the great advantages of Bankside was that it seemed that there would be room to develop in future , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Serota told the Art Newspaper .
Sure enough , this summer it opened a ÃÂ£260 m extension inside the old Switch House , managing it just before all the freshly desirable land around Tate was bought up .
Rumours about who will succeed Serota as overall Tate commandant have focused on Maria Balshaw , director of ManchesterÃ¢â¬ â¢ s cluster of Whitworth Galleries , although a fortnight ago at the Turner prize supper
she said she was tired of all the speculation .
Other contenders include Sheena Wagstaff , in charge of modern and contemporary art at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Metropolitan Museum of Art , and Nicholas Cullinan , head of the National Portrait Gallery .
Over in Kensington , under Roth the V&amp;A drew in a hugely creditable 3.4 million visitors last year .
Its most visited show ever was the 21-week run of the McQueen extravaganza .
While 300,000 people went to its Bowie exhibition in 2013 , 493,000 people came to its tribute to the late fashion designer .
For the showÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final two weekends the museum opened throughout the night for the first time , to meet demand .
The German director had come to Kensington from jobs at two leading Dresden museums and he replaced Sir Mark Jones , who had led the V&amp;A since 2001 .
Roth has since aired his fears over Brexit and about the future of the V&amp;A in an isolated Britain .
In July he said planning for the future felt Ã¢â¬Ålike skiing in very thick fogÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Luke Syson , the winsome Brit currently running the department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Met , has been talked of as RothÃ¢â¬ â¢ s successor , but picking a woman for the job would also be smart .
As Sonnet Stanfill , a female curator at the V&amp;A , recently pointed out , there is disproportionately bad representation of women at the top of the museum , given that about 75 % of its curators are women .
Over at the Royal Opera House , the chance to choose a woman has sailed by .
In September the board decided to scare the traditionalists by appointing 37-year - old Oliver Mears to succeed Holten in the opera worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most prestigious British job .
Mears comes to Covent Garden from the much smaller Northern Ireland Opera and starts work in March .
He is opposed to Ã¢â¬ÅbarriersÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ between audiences and singers , and so dislikes period costume and even the sacred original - language performance .
Ã¢â¬ÅAs soon as you put people in period costume
it becomes about escapism and something else , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he has said , adding : Ã¢â¬ÅAs soon as you sing in English , one of those barriers is down .
I think particularly in comedy , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s really important that people can understand the humour as its happening rather than looking up at surtitles.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Mears is rumoured to have been recently turned down for a similar role at the English National Opera , which lost artistic director John Berry in the summer of last year after two decades of service .
BerryÃ¢â¬ â¢ s position at the Coliseum was filled this summer by Daniel Kramer , a 39-year - old American .
Despite losing MacGregor , the British Museum had another hit show this year with Sunken Cities .
It remains BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top attraction , with 6.8 million visitors last year .
Similarly , the National Theatre is still thriving following the departure of Hytner in March 2015 .
Now run by Rufus Norris , the Hytner legacy continues to play a big financial role .
Both The Curious IncidentÃ¢â¬ Â¦ and War Horse are still in production , either in the West End or on tour .
Arts commentator Jan Dalley noted earlier this year that the conventional image of the director of an august arts institution as a staid Ã¢â¬ÅkeeperÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ of treasures and antiquities has long gone .
Where once they were appointed for their scholarship , now they are required to be strategists , fundraisers and entertainers too .
Serota , the member of this retiring old guard with the greatest experience , will not , of course , be disappearing .
As the chairman of Arts Council England , he will need his famous persuasive powers and poker - faced stance .
Caricatured in the Spectator as a Bond villain stroking a PVC Jeff Koons pussycat , to some in the arts world he embodies the hollow showmanship of the modern age .
To others , his mastery of strategy and attention to detail are their best hope as a newly austere funding chill blows in this January ."

Below are some of the records that came up again and again in your suggestions , along with your mini reviews and justifications for picking them .
Blackstar , David Bowie WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re not claiming thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s anything scientific about this roundup , or of the whole body of your contributions , but one thing was clear Ã¢â¬ â David Bowie received by far the most nominations .
HereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what some of you said about Blackstar :
While it might appear an obvious or even maudlin choice given its critical acclaim and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s untimely death , Blackstar is an extraordinary piece of work .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an art installation that forces a total reevaluation of how music is released and listened to .
The electro - soaked jazz tone , the premonition in the lyrics and the constantly revealing vinyl cover , in a world of disposal streams of music , make this more than a collection of legacy tunes Ã¢â¬ â it defines everything Bowie .
It will watch over us all for decades .
David Hodgson , Harrogate ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
funny , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
sad , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sexy , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a farewell to old friends and an introduction to new .
Tony Wood , London
This would have been one of the most musically and lyrically arresting albums of the year even if BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death within days of its release had not brought a whole new dimension to the work , a whole new register of resonances to his very last lyrics , written in the knowledge that he was terminally ill .
Bowie transformed his life into a work of art and did the same with his death .
A true pioneer until the very end .
Chris Hughes , Cambridge A difficult choice between two goodbyes .
Bowie and Leonard CohenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s leaving framed the year for me .
Both left huge life legacies and also knowing farewell notes .
In the end , forced to a choice , I have gone for BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
majestic Blackstar for its typically Bowie yet entirely new , alien soundscape and often opaque lyricism .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m still wondering what half of it is about , lyrically and musically Ã¢â¬ â and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s meant as praise .

Many of you were in agreement with Guardian musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite when asked for yours .
The songs of Lemonade are fantastic in and of themselves Ã¢â¬ â but the film and spoken word of the visual album make it soar .
I would class it as one of the top three concept albums ever .
Joanne Cook , Canada A Moon Shaped Pool , Radiohead Radiohead made number 10 in the Guardian music rundown Ã¢â¬ â and in your responses were mentioned more than any other artist bar Bowie .
The most accessible and melodic Radiohead album in years .
A true return to form including the quite stunning Decks Dark and the haunting True Love Waits .
A reminder of how significant this band is .
Jonny Marshall , Leigh on Sea
A brilliant and haunting record that describes Radiohead at their best .
Maybe they donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t deliver a rock opera like Paranoid Android anymore or a Stanley Kubrick - esque track like Idioteque , but songs like Daydreaming and Identikit deliver the same magic that only Radiohead can bring .

The ObserverÃ¢â¬ â¢ s review at the time called this a Ã¢â¬Åraw document of griefÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â and it had a powerful effect on many readers .
Whether it would have had the same emotional impact had I been unaware that CaveÃ¢â¬ â¢ s son died while the album was being recorded
, I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t say , but no other album has ever moved me in the same way before .
It was around about halfway through the song I Need You , near the end of the album , that it finally broke me Ã¢â¬
â
it almost sounds like a guttural cry of pain , like Nick Cave was on the verge of tears throughout .
Chances are IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll never listen to Skeleton Tree again , but it will stick with me forever .
A masterpiece .
Chris , Bristol
In the age of inauthenticity , Skeleton Tree is a beautiful , simple testimony to the rudiments of what is to be alive , in all itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heartbreak and hope , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve listened everyday for weeks .
Ian Seddon , Wigan Hopelessness , Anohni Hopelessness is a fitting title for a year that has shocked the world to its core and an album that has stuck with me throughout .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lyrics reflect the state of the world , from drone strikes to execution , climate crises to surveillance .
But through the bleakness and negativity there is hope ; in hopelessness , AnohniÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songs invoke empathy in the listener .
Hopelessness is a call to action that unites us in its despair .

Here , a review Ã¢â¬ â one of many for the band Ã¢â¬ â that speaks for itself .
Death can often make you reassess an artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s body of work , making you cherish it a whole lot more .
However , I truly believe even without the tragic circumstances surrounding this album it would still be high on my list for album of the year .
The songs are incredibly catchy and show how fun indie pop can be when done right .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s impossible to remove the tragic context from your mind , which adds a bittersweet element to the joyful nature of the songs , but IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m thankful for the great pop songs they left rather than the ones we have lost .
Luca Van Dresh , Brighton 22 , A Million , Bon Iver Experimentalism abounds here , and many of you were impressed enough during the albumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s short running time to give Justin Vernon your vote .
When I read the reviews of this album I was expecting something really obtuse .
When I heard it , it was 30-odd short minutes of pure syrupy vocal harmonic bliss .
Lots of rising major 7ths and 9ths , sliced up saxophones and glitching pianos , it sounds like an early morning run on the beach , the sun cracking through the edge of the sky .
Bren Collins , Liverpool
Even if they ( /he ) were off their usual far - sighted creativity , Bon Iver still produce the most interesting music around today .
Not afraid to experiment , to distort , to wrong - foot ; the brilliance of this album is evident from the opening bars .
There is not a trite idea or note on this collection of songs Ã¢â¬ â the only disappointment is that it is too short .
Joff Curtoys , York
The Colour in Anything
, James Blake Readers making the case for BlakeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s third album might have been disappointed to see it at only number 29 on the Guardian list .
A bold move away from the winning formula of Overgrown , this album really gets under your skin , and the more I listen to it the more I hear its beauty and depth .
My favourite track keeps changing Ã¢â¬ â today it is Choose me , tomorrow it could be I
Hope
My Life Ã¢â¬âas
all are so strong .
Blake is ahead of his peers with his unique sound , amazing vocals and depth of emotion , and there are some great guest vocals , particularly Justin Vernon on I
Need A Forest Fire .
Lizzie Reake , West Sussex Night Driver , Busted Finally Ã¢â¬ â though this hasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been an exhaustive list of your suggestions of course Ã¢â¬

it turns out a lot of Busted fans who found our callout really liked the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s return .
I have been a fan of Busted since they first emerged onto the music scene over 14 years ago .
Like most of their fans , I was heartbroken when they decided to split in 2005 and never imagined they would ever reunite , let alone create a third album .
The album is completely different to BustedÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old sound , yet I think I prefer it .
Night Driver will be on my playlist for years to come .

2016-12-22,"In summer 1984 , Iain Harvey was in LondonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Charlotte Mews , behind the offices of the animation company TVC .
He was wondering how , in four years , he had gone from being finance director at publisher Hamish Hamilton and being interested in doing something with a remaindered childrenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book , to being a film producer about to see David Bowie , his teenage pop hero , in his movie .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhen he came , he was so modest and unshowy , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ recalls Harvey .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember him talking about his Brixton days , quite naturally , when IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d said about seeing him at Brixton in the 70s .
He was an absolute gem.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A man with ice - blond hair walks into an unlit , gloomy attic , snow falling outside , dusty memories in his mind .
He kneels down by a rocking - horse and tells us of his childhood , of holidays by the seaside , of winters returning home , of being around the fire , and of making snowmen .
Ã¢â¬ÅOne year , I made a really big snowman , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Bowie , pulling a blue scarf out of a drawer ; it is dotted with snowmen , green - hatted and coal - eyed .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe got me this scarf .
You see , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says tenderly , Ã¢â¬Åhe was a real snowman.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
For millions of us , Christmas TV wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be the same without the animated adaptation of Raymond BriggsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
The Snowman , made in 1982 .
For those of us who remember BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s introduction , where he frames himself as the boy who made and loved and lost a special friend , this dreamlike detail of the season takes on new poignancy now .
Scour the Bowie books , however , and details of how he got involved prove hard to find .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not that he shied away from kidsÃ¢â¬ â¢ projects .
He was a father before fame really hit , and he narrated ProkofievÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Peter and the Wolf in 1977 , saying he did it for his son , Duncan Jones .
Nine years later , he introduced a generation of kids to frightwigs and latex in Jim HensonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Labyrinth .
But The Snowman came during an odd period in BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creative life , when grownup film roles were taking him into darker , stranger places , while his 1983 album , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , and the Serious Moonlight Tour , took him to his international commercial peak .
Several members of The Snowman team remember Bowie well , though .
His section was not part of the original film , which began with Briggs introducing his story to viewers .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s involvement came after the public had already seen and fallen in love with the film .
The story of The Snowman , like BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s , is surprisingly slow - burning .
First published in 1978 , it sold well initially , but a second print run stalled .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe had a basement of 50,000 books , basically , until the film came out , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Harvey , then at Hamish Hamilton , before he became executive producer of the film version .
Producer John Coates , of TVC , took out an option on the book for a year in 1980 , making an animated storyboard of it only when the year was nearly out .
In March 1982 , new TV network Channel 4 offered to fund the film , which was broadcast on Boxing Day that year , beginning with Briggs walking through a snowy field near his rural Sussex home , the opening that was used for the first two years .
In January 1983 , The Snowman was nominated for the Oscar for best animated short film , but it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t win .
The growing popularity of home video pushed its appeal , though , and US networks became interested .
However , they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t understand the appeal of BriggsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s introduction .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe
didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t realise that in the US programmes were sponsored , and to be sponsored you needed a big name ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Harvey says .
Then along came Bowie .
Bowie first met a Snowman team member during its production in 1982 : its soundtrack composer , Howard Blake , was simultaneously musical director of The Hunger , Tony ScottÃ¢â¬ â¢ s erotic vampire thriller , in which Bowie starred .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t imagine two different films , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Blake says , laughing .
He was having daily lunches with Bowie at the White Elephant in Mayfair , preparing him for his mimed cello scenes in The Hunger , where they Ã¢â¬Åmust have talked about the Snowman projectÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bowie was already a fan of BriggsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nuclear war fable from that year , When the Wind Blows , which TVC also had in development .
By early 1984 , BlakeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Snowman soundtrack was starting to sell well , driven by the song Walking in the Air .
The US label CBS was also involved in the effort to take The Snowman to America .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople such as Laurence Olivier and Julie Andrews were being suggested [ for a new introduction ] , but the Americans were going , it must be a rock star , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Blake says .
Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ËLike Mick Jagger?Ã¢â¬ â¢
I remember saying .
And they were all , Ã¢â¬ËThat would be great!Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Blake talked to Coates about Bowie ; the singer had already got in touch with Coates offering his services for When the Wind Blows .
Harvey also had a connection to Bowie through Jeremy Isaacs , producer of the prisoner - of - war drama Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence , in which Bowie starred in 1983 .
Ã¢â¬ÅJeremy said we should push our luck , although we were fairly nervous to do it , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Harvey remembers .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt quickly became clear Bowie was happy to do it.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The script for the new introduction span off from BriggsÃ¢â¬ â¢ s original , which talked about a snowy day full of Ã¢â¬Ålight and silenceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Harvey doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t remember who adapted it for the film , but he thinks part of it might have been improvised .
Briggs was also on - set on the day , not minding that his introduction was being superseded ; he admits now that the story about a snowy day inspiring the book Ã¢â¬Åwas total rubbish , of courseÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He never saw the results of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , but he has warm memories of meeting him .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
remember us all lining up to shake his hand like he was the Queen , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Briggs says .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe was wearing these amazing pink shoes , and his face was wonderful to look at Ã¢â¬
â those different - coloured eyes .
A charming bloke.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie shook BriggsÃ¢â¬ â¢
s hand firmly and said he liked his work
; two years later , he contributed the title track to the film version of When the Wind Blows , releasing it as a single in June 1986
( he had intended to do the whole soundtrack , but under pressure from EMI to focus on the follow - up to 1984Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Tonight , he had to withdraw ) .
Snowman storyboard artist Joanna Harrison also animated Bowie for the video to the single ; she had been at TVCÃ¢â¬ â¢ s offices in London when Bowie came in to film .
She was responsible for the chunk of The Snowman set in the North Pole , in which Father Christmas adds the name James to the tag on the present the boy receives there .
It was the name of HarrisonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s then - boyfriend , who became , and still is , her husband .
In summer 1984 , they were dating .
Ã¢â¬ÅJames was a huge Bowie fan , and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d taken his copy of Station to Station along to be signed , with a big , black felt - tipped pen .
We were all hanging out in reception , desperately overexcited.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
But then BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s security arrived ; only the top TVC team were allowed in .
This was especially unfair , Harrison felt , as she had contributed something important to the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s scene : the hand - stitched green hats and coal eyes on the machine - knitted snowmen dotting BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s blue scarf .
There had actually been two scarves , she says .
Ã¢â¬ÅBernard Cribbins got the other [ he recorded the audiobook ] , but he left his in the back of a taxi .
We heard that Bowie gave his to his son.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Another dreamlike detail remains with Harrison , too .
On returning to work the day after filming , she discovered that Bowie had , after all , signed JamesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s copy of Station to Station with her felt - tip .
After BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , the couple dug it out , recalling a dusty old memory .
In the great array of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work , a short introduction to a 26-minute animation isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t one of the key pieces .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hardly Ziggy Stardust or Low .
But it is proof of his willingness to work on the unlikeliest of projects , and the sprinkling of magic he could bring to them .
It would have been easy for the massive star to overshadow The Snowman , but that wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t what happened .
Instead , Harvey remembers a man Ã¢â¬Åclever enough and modest enough not to take The Snowman away from what it was , which was this perfect little film , this timeless momentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Snowman is being shown on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 4.45pm ."
2016-12-22,"The year 2016 took Prince , David Bowie , Professor Snape and most of our sanity .
But it has given us this video of a giant panda trying and failing to kill a snowman .
Da Mao , a giant panda at the Toronto Zoo , faced off against a curiously bi - global snowman that his zookeepers constructed for his Ã¢â¬ÅenrichmentÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , in a video viewed more than half a million times .
After initially clawing at the snowmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s torso , the panda mounted the frozen structure and perched triumphantly on its head , before promptly losing his balance , falling , and being conked in the face by the snowmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s head as it fell to the ground .
The giant herbivorous mammal made several subsequent attempts to scale the decapitated snowman , but repeatedly tumbled , displaying both perseverance and flexibility as he somersaulted on to the snow - covered ground .
Da Mao is one of a pair of pandas that arrived in Toronto ( via FedEx ) from China as part of a conservation breeding program .
Two panda cubs , Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue , were born to Da Mao and Er Shun in October 2015 .
Though Da MaoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s showdown with the snowman may have ended in frustration , the panda will probably have the last laugh .
The panda , you see , is all of us , and the snowman is the year 2016 .
We keep trying to make the best of things , and we keep getting bopped on the head by wreckage .
But we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past , remembering that climate change is on our side in this one , terrible metaphor : rain is forecast for Toronto in the coming days ."
2016-12-27,"The deaths of musicians and actors may not be what future generations chiefly remember about 2016 but they did have an extraordinary impact at the time .
Tens of millions of people were strangely and strongly moved by the deaths of David Bowie , Prince , Leonard Cohen , and now George Michael and Star Wars actor Carrie Fisher .
These artists were mourned all across the peaceful parts of the world by strangers who felt an intimate connection with the dead ; who felt that the artist had been Ã¢â¬Åkilling me softly with his songÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , and that his voice was truer and clearer than their own when it came to expressing dreams and hopes .
Something is going on here , which canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be dismissed as vacuous sentimentality .
There may not , in fact , have been an unusual number of celebrity deaths this year , but they seem to have been much more salient than before .
Part of this must be the result of the growing reach and responsiveness of digital media .
Technology makes it possible to observe and react to a distant readership almost as accurately and immediately as an actor can respond to their audience in a theatre .
Sudden emotional impulses are amplified with astonishing speed across the internet just as they can be in a crowd .
Each apparently solitary smartphone user is really sharing other peopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s emotion as well as their own .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not just emotions that are shared in this way .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s memories as well .
The generations of middle - aged people along with all their children and grandchildren have experienced a kind of collectivisation of childhood .
This was a historic shift .
Before the mass media , childhood memories were shared among very small groups , and anchored to particular places .
But for the last 60 years , children in the west , and increasingly elsewhere , have grown up in front of televisions , and many of the most vivid characters of their childhood and adolescence were actors or singers .
The entertainment industry has largely replaced religious ritual in many lives , and has itself grown more ritualised , and even religious , in the process .
The success of the Star Wars franchise shows how astonishingly profitable the development can be .
It is still true today that dementia sufferers can be roused from their nightmares by carols and perhaps hymns remembered from their childhood when almost everything else has gone , but soon it will be the theme tunes of their childhoodÃ¢â¬ â¢ s films that call them back to life that way .
This huge change has provoked its own backlash .
Attacks on celebrity culture are now a staple of satirists , and there is a great deal to satirise and mock Ã¢â¬ â but that is true of all money - making forms of religion .
The relationships that people have with the celebrities who inhabit their imagination express profound longings , and help to fulfil them too .
Otherwise they would not survive .
Some might say that imaginary friends are cultivated at the expense of real ones , and that the contemplation of such things as George MichaelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s astonishing acts of private generosity is no substitute for actually giving yourself to a food bank or visiting granny in her nursing home .
But this is a counsel of perfection .
We are not made to care equally for everyone Ã¢â¬ â and as a matter of simple fact , we donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
We arenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t creatures of unlimited compassion , or of entirely rational calculation .
However , the alternative to rational calculation is not sloppy emotion but imagination , which shapes emotion into drama .
That is what the lives of celebrities provide , quite as much as their work , and that is part of why they are mourned .
They collaborate with their audience to make engrossing worlds that neither party quite comprehends , but both know they need .
Although this may be one of the things replacing traditional religion , it only works because it does not seem Ã¢â¬ÅreligiousÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , moralistic , or cut off from the world around it .
It sanctifies , or makes vivid and valuable , the ordinary things of life .
If that were all celebrity culture does , it would be far less powerful .
Consolation and even joy can come from many places in life .
What has made these deaths so important to so many people is that they provide an occasion for grief as well .
The performance in which the musician and their fans are caught up is ultimately one of tragedy .
There is loss and grief in every life , and the death of a beloved singer provides a chance to express this sorrow in gestures more powerful than words could be .
In the end , they give us their deaths quite as much as their works , and that is why they are so passionately mourned .

2016-12-31,"Sydney celebrated the end of 2016 with 120 tonnes of fireworks and a tribute to three of the yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most high - profile celebrity deaths .
David Bowie , Prince , and Gene Wilder were celebrated in the 12-minute midnight display , which also drew inspiration from a 3D paper sculpture of the city that recreated Sydney landmarks with native flowers .
Thousands of rockets were launched from seven barges on the harbour , and 2,400 special lighting effects were used , with the Sydney harbour bridge itself turned into a Ã¢â¬Åpyrotechnic focal pointÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The City of Sydney was prepared for crowds of up to 1.5 million on the foreshore or watching from boats in the harbour , making it one of the largest fireworks displays in the world .
An additional one billion people were expected to watch from home via live broadcasts on television and social media .
According to research done for the City of Sydney , up to 46 % of spectators on the harbour travel from overseas to see the event , which is worth $ 130 m to the economy in New South Wales .
SydneyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lord mayor , Clover Moore , said the theme recognised the number of entertainment icons lost in 2016 and the close relationship that Bowie , in particular , had with the city .
Ã¢â¬ÅSydney is especially significant for David Bowie , who called Elizabeth Bay home for a decade from the early 80s , filming music videos and recording an album here , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Moore said .
Ã¢â¬ÅPrince performed in Australia many times and his Sydney opera house concert was one of his last .
And I know children and adults everywhere will delight in the colourful Willy Wonka moment during the midnight fireworks.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Fireworks director Fortunato Foti , who has been responsible for the cityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s New YearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Eve fireworks since 1997 , said this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s show had required them to develop new techniques to deliver new effects .
The more recent deaths of Carrie Fisher , George Michael and Debbie Reynolds occurred after the program was finalised , the organisers said .
In Melbourne , 13.5 tonnes of fireworks were detonated over an 8sq km area , lighting up the entire city .
Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said the display was designed to be visible from anywhere in the city .
The display cost $ 3 m , of which $ 2.5 m was spent on security .
About 500,000 people were expected to head into the city to hear live music at four different sites .
Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re always a bit nervous , as I say every year , you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t often throw a party for 500,000 of your best friends , but when they come over you better be ready and we are ,

2017-01-06,"David Bowie only discovered his cancer was terminal three months before he died , according to a documentary marking the anniversary of the superstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
The film , David Bowie : The Last Five Years Ã¢â¬ â due to air on BBC2 on Saturday night , a day before what would have been the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70th birthday Ã¢â¬ â reveals that Bowie discovered his treatment was to be stopped while he was filming the music video for his final single , Lazarus .
Bowie died on 10 January 2016 , days after turning 69 and the release of his 25th studio album , Blackstar , having kept his illness a secret from the world .
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid said : Ã¢â¬ËI just want to make it a simple performance videoÃ¢â¬ â¢ ,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Johan Renck who directed the video , which features Bowie singing lines such as Ã¢â¬ÅLook up here , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m in heavenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ from a hospital bed .
He insists the common interpretation of the video Ã¢â¬ â that the singer was hinting that he was on his deathbed Ã¢â¬
â is wrong , because he came up with the concept a week before Bowie received his final diagnosis .
Ã¢â¬ÅI immediately said Ã¢â¬Ëthe song is called Lazarus , you should be in the bedÃ¢â¬ â¢ ,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Renck .
Ã¢â¬ÅTo me it had to do with the biblical aspect of it ...
it had nothing to do with him being ill .
Ã¢â¬ÅI found out later that , the week we were shooting , it was when he was told it was over , they were ending treatments and that his illness had won , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Renck .
Yet even then , Bowie had not given up hope of surviving his cancer and was still keen to make new work just weeks before he died , according to Ivo Van Hove , who directed BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical , Lazarus .
In the programme he recalls one of the last exchanges the pair had , after the play made its debut in New York in 2015 .
Describing how they sat chatting backstage , despite Bowie being noticeably weakened by his illness , Van Hove said : Ã¢â¬ÅHe got through the night .
I really am convinced that he was fighting death
and he wanted to continue and continue .
Afterwards we were sitting behind stage and he said Ã¢â¬ËletÃ¢â¬ â¢ s start a second one now , the sequel to LazarusÃ¢â¬ â¢
.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The new documentary is the work of Francis Whately , and continues a narrative from his previous Bowie documentary for the BBC , David Bowie : Five Years , which was first broadcast in 2013 and focused on five of the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most significant years between 1971 and 1983 .
As part of a series of programmes this month , BBC4 will broadcast rarely seen Bowie performances from its archive , Martin Kemp will present a show dedicated to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Life on Mars , and 6Music will host a Ã¢â¬Ålistening partyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for the publicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s favourite Bowie album , and a tribute show .
The latest Whately documentary looks in depth at the making of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
surprise 2013 album ,
The Next Day , his 2016 jazz - infused album Blackstar , which was released days before he died , and his first stage musical , Lazarus .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis period hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t been explored by anybody so it was very interesting territory , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Whately told the Guardian .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn some ways he seems to have worked harder in that period than at almost any other time , except the beginning of the 1970s when he was producing Ziggy Stardust , Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
death came as a shock to the world .
He had only shared news of his illness with those closest to him , and those collaborators who needed to know for professional reasons , such as Lazarus producer Robert Fox and his long - time friend and collaborator Tony Visconti , who both also appear in the documentary .
Whately emphasised how much energy Bowie had thrown into his final three projects , particularly Blackstar and Lazarus , right up until his death .
Ã¢â¬ÅOften he would go and record in the studio and then go and watch the rehearsals for Lazarus in the evening , or talk about the play in the morning , go to the studio , and then come back .
It was quite an extraordinary workload , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whately .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think everyone would like me to say he was turning up to the studio to record Blackstar
and he was terribly ill , but
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think he was .
There are musicians in the Blackstar band who didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t even know .
We all now know he was ill , we know he was undergoing treatment , but it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seem to have had an effect at all on his output.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Was he a man who took on these multiple projects because he sensed his time was running out ?
Ã¢â¬ÅWe just donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whately .
The documentary also explores BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s increasingly uncomfortable relationship with fame , which he had embraced at the beginning of his career as a means to gain creative freedom , but in later years he came to loathe .
After a heart attack in 2003 , he took himself almost entirely out of the public eye .
Whately says Bowie would have liked to have moved back to London , but stayed in New York for the relative anonymity it allowed him .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t find it strange he kept his illness so private , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whately .
Ã¢â¬ÅHeÃ¢â¬ â¢ d had his life picked over for 40 years and he thought he had said everything he wanted to say , there was nothing more.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Whately describes as Ã¢â¬ÅsimplisticÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
the narrative adopted by the media after Bowie died , that Blackstar was the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deliberate parting gift to fans .
Ã¢â¬ÅI still donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know if he started making Blackstar before he knew he was ill , or after , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅPeople are so desperate for Blackstar to be this parting gift that Bowie made for the world when he knew he was dying
but I think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s simplistic to think that .
There is more ambiguity there than people want to acknowledge .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think he knew he was going to die .
Ã¢â¬ÅHowever , he must have known there was a chance he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going to recover , so , to do an album with a certain amount of ambiguity in it , is Bowie playing the cat and mouse game that he always played.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Whately
and Bowie had known each other for almost two decades , having worked together on a short film at the beginning of WhatelyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s career , and the pair regularly kept in touch over email .
It was an exchange mainly of book and film recommendations , everything from Pulitzer - prize winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz to the 1973 BBC documentary series The Ascent of Man .
Whately said Bowie would consume a book a day .
Ã¢â¬ÅI remember him once emailing me about American female soccer , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Whately .
Ã¢â¬ÅWho would have thought that David Bowie was a female soccer fan ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just not what you expect
but it speaks to the man , that there was clearly nothing he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t willing to learn about.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He added :
Ã¢â¬ÅThe David Bowie that I knew in my limited way was incredibly courteous , was incredibly polite , well informed , utterly charming .
But I would question anyone who said they really knew him .
I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t think anyone knew him.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Out of respect for the privacy that Bowie valued so highly , Whately did not interview any of his family members and the film focuses on his musical , not his personal , life .
However , he said he hoped that he had captured BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s warm personality , and the particular pride the singer had in realising a lifelong dream to stage a musical in New York .
Michael C Hall , who played the lead role in the play , said BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s satisfaction had been evident .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe last thing I remember David saying to me , after the hugs and the smiles after that opening night performance , was : Ã¢â¬ËI think it went well tonight , donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t you?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Ã¢â¬Â¢ David Bowie :

2017-01-09,"A new David Bowie EP has been released to mark what would have been the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 70th birthday .
The No Plan EP includes Lazarus , which appeared on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album Blackstar , as well as songs written for the musical Lazarus : No Plan , Killing a Little Time and When I Met You .
They are believed to be BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final recordings , completed around the time of the Blackstar sessions .

2017-01-10,"Where are we now , a year after BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s untimely death ?
No sooner had he succumbed to cancer than critics were rushing back to Blackstar , the album he had released two days earlier ( on his 69th birthday ) , looking for hidden messages pertaining to his fate :
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m dying to push their backs against the grain /
And fool them all again and again , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he sang on Dollar Days .
You could go deeper still : a blackstar is the name for a cancer lesion , and also gave its name to a rare song by Elvis Presley , one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great obsessions .
In the wake of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , the impulse to treat Blackstar like a puzzle to be solved was understandable yet seemed to defeat the point of his luminous , liminal final statement .
Twelve months on , however , his collaborators have revealed a wealth of tantalising new information about BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s plans for the future , while his legacy has twisted into various fascinating shapes .
HereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s what weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve learned in our first year without Bowie .
He found out that he had cancer in summer 2014 When he entered New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Magic Shop studios to record Blackstar in January 2015 , Bowie had been battling cancer for six months .
Subsequently , he kept recording sessions short Ã¢â¬ â typically working from 11 am to 4 pm
Ã¢â¬ â and often turned up fresh from chemo , with no eyebrows or hair , as producer Tony Visconti told Rolling Stone , placing the band in the tiny cohort of people who were aware of his illness .
Not even Brian Eno knew : a week prior to his death , Bowie sent his longtime collaborator an email that was Ã¢â¬Åas funny as always , and as surreal , looping through word games and allusions and the usual stuff we did , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Eno said in a statement to the BBC .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt ended with this sentence : Ã¢â¬ËThank you for our good times , brian .
they will never rot.Ã¢â¬ â¢
And it was signed Ã¢â¬ËDawnÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
I realise now he was saying goodbye.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
There was more to the Blackstar artwork than we initially thought Bowie also imbued the artwork for Blackstar with intimations of mortality , says design collaborator Jonathan Barnbrook .
Originally , the black star image was one of the graphics mooted to obscure the Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ cover for the artwork of his 2013 album , The Next Day .
Instead it reappeared as they were conceiving the Blackstar artwork .
( Incidentally , Barnbrook revealed on Twitter that he and Bowie had conspired to present the copy of Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ that they used for The Next Day to BarnbrookÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wife on their wedding day .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s inscribed : Ã¢â¬ÅTo Jonathan and Anil ,
Well we can be heroes for ever ,
what do you say?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
) Ã¢â¬ÅThis was a man who was facing his own mortality , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Barnbrook told Dezeen .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe Blackstar symbol , [ Ã¢Ë â¦ ] , rather than writing Ã¢â¬ËBlackstarÃ¢â¬ â¢ , has a sort of finality , a darkness , a simplicity , which is a representation of the music .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s subsided a bit now , but a lot of people said it was a bullshit cover when it came out , that it took five minutes to design .
But I think there is a misunderstanding about the simplicity .
The idea of mortality is in there , and of course the idea of a black hole sucking in everything , the big bang , the start of the universe , if there is an end of the universe .
These are things that relate to mortality.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The vinyl sleeve is die - cut , exposing the record .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe fact that you can see the record as a physical thing that degrades , it gets scratched as soon as it comes into being , that is a comment on mortality too
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Barnbrook , who called Bowie the artist responsible for bringing art - school thinking into the mainstream .
Bowie didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know the cancer was terminal until three months before he died The video for Lazarus Ã¢â¬
â in which a blindfolded Bowie flails in a hospital bed
Ã¢â¬ â was posthumously interpreted as a literal deathbed scene .
But , as director Johan Renck explained in the BBC documentary , David Bowie :
The Last Five Years , he came up with the concept for the video a week before doctors told Bowie that they were ending treatment after a period of remission .
His intention was to die as discreetly as he had spent the final years of his life Ã¢â¬ â in which , the writer William Boyd revealed , he would often walk around New York holding a Greek - language newspaper , so that people thought he was just some Greek bloke who bore an uncanny resemblance to David Bowie .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe wanted to slip away , almost like a phantom , so that it would not Ã¢â¬ â at least in the run - up Ã¢â¬
â become a reality show , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ an anonymous friend told the Guardian .
Ultimately , he was privately cremated in New York , requested that his ashes be scattered Ã¢â¬Åin accordance with the Buddhist ritualsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in Bali , and left his $ 100 m estate to his wife and two children , Duncan and Lexi Ã¢â¬ â along with $ 2 m and shares in a mysterious non - existent company called Opossum Inc to his personal assistant , Coco Schwab , who worked with him for 42 years .
As one fan pointed out , a possum has Ã¢â¬Åa propensity to play dead when he doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to deal with a situation confronting him .
Intriguing!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The diagnosis gave him a sense of urgency about his work While Bowie was working on Blackstar , he was also realising a lifelong dream to produce his own musical .
Mime artist and early collaborator Lindsay Kemp revealed that , around the turn of the 70s , he had mooted the idea of bringing Charles KingsleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s The Water Babies to the stage .
( Kemp also revealed that Bowie had refused to play Puss in Boots in the Musselburgh Christmas panto . )
In 1974 , Bowie told William Burroughs that he was turning George OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1984 into a television production , though the project was eventually nixed by OrwellÃ¢â¬ â¢ s widow and executor of his estate , Sonia Brownell .
In the early 2000s , he started work on a musical production that would revolve around aliens , the poet Emma Lazarus , a mariachi band , and a Ã¢â¬Åstockpile of unknown , unrecorded Bob Dylan songs , which had been discovered after Dylan died , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ wrote novelist Michael Cunningham , the primary collaborator on the project , which trailed off in 2004 after Bowie suffered a heart attack .
Although the material wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t directly reprised , the aliens and the allusion to the figure of Jesus raised from the dead reappeared in Lazarus , the musical he brought to New York .
( It opened posthumously in London . )
The musicalÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director , Ivo Van Hove , said that Bowie called it Ã¢â¬Åthe saddest piece he had ever worked onÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ .
Bowie frequently attended Lazarus rehearsals
He reportedly maintained a quiet presence , writing notes in pencil .
For occasions when he wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t well enough to come to the studio , a camera was installed so he could watch from home .
Ã¢â¬ÅEvery day heÃ¢â¬
â¢ d call me to say , Ã¢â¬ËWow , this is greatÃ¢â¬ â¢ , or , Ã¢â¬ËI think you should think about thisÃ¢â¬ â¢ ,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Van Hove .
Ã¢â¬ÅA happy surprise was that he never used his power , he was collaborative .
He had strong but constructive opinions.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Blackstar and Lazarus werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t intended as his final statements Despite his diagnosis , Bowie was intent on making more work .
A week before he died , he called Tony Visconti and said he wanted to make the follow - up to Blackstar , and that he had already recorded five demos .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was thrilled , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti told Rolling Stone .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd I thought , and he thought , that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d have a few months , at least .
Obviously if heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s excited about doing his next album , he must have had a few more months.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
There were other projects , too : he envisioned a sequel to Lazarus , Van Hove told the BBC , and had wanted to revamp Outside , the last album he worked on with Eno .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe both liked that album a lot and felt it had fallen through the cracks , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Eno .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe talked about revisiting it , taking it somewhere new .
I was looking forward to that.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
His archives are open On the box set
Who Can I Be Now ?
( 1974 - 1976 ) , we finally got long - rumoured album
The Gouster , the precursor to Young Americans and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s attempt at making Ã¢â¬Åa killer soul albumÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , according to Visconti .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also Ã¢â¬Åa long list of unscheduled musical releases that Bowie planned before he died ,
Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ a source told Newsweek .
And in addition to those five aforementioned demos Ã¢â¬ â which Visconti has said might make up the second disc of a Blackstar deluxe edition
Ã¢â¬ â there are still more outtakes from the record .
We just heard Lazarus , No Plan , Killing a Little Time and
When I Met You on the No Plan EP , released on what would have been his 70th birthday , but there were Ã¢â¬Å15 or 16Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ songs recorded for that album .
Seven from Blackstar plus four from No Plan means there are potentially five to come , though BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s assiduous fans have tracked more .
Tim Lefebvre , who played bass on Blackstar , has said that When Things Go Bad harks back to both Station to Station and Hunky Dory ( which sounds a bit improbable , to be honest ) .
Keyboardist Jason Lindner told French Rolling Stone about a song called Russian Black Man of Moscow , which references the Romantic poet , playwright and novelist Alexander Pushkin .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also Blaze , Somewhere , and Wistful , which is said to be a piano ballad .
Lefebvre also spilled another tantalising titbit in a roundtable with fellow Bowie players Gail Ann Dorsey and Mark Plati on American radio station WFUV : Bowie had written a duet for Lorde , though only Bowie ever recorded his vocals , according to Blackstar bandleader Donny McCaslin .
He was the only artist who could knock Adele off the top spot Blackstar briefly ended 25Ã¢â¬ â¢ s seven - week run , and became BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 10th album to top the UK charts ( and his first US Number 1 ) .
Several more Bowie albums entered the charts that week :
Nothing Has Changed :
The Very Best Of ( Number 5 ) , The Best Of 1969 - 1974 ( 11 ) , Hunky Dory ( 14 ) , The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust ( 17 ) ,

BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
global Spotify streams increased by 2,822 % , with Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ proving the most popular song .
( Hunky Dory seemed to be his most popular album , going by its streaming jump , a BBC 6Music listener vote , and , er , former prime minister David Cameron . )
Online retailers thanked Bowie ( and Prince ) for increasing spending in the 12-week period preceding June 3 , though Michael Jackson topped ForbesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s list of top - earning dead celebrities for the fourth year straight , with Bowie coming in at number 11 .
( No word on whether the lock of his hair that sold for $ 18,750 was included in their sums . )
He inspired some great tributes With the EU referendum looming , violent divisions played out across newspaper front pages in January 2016 .
But , just for one day ( sorry ) , they were united in their praise of Bowie .
In Berlin , it usually takes five years for a notable dead person to be commemorated with a plaque , but mayor Michael MÃÂ¼ller waived the rule for Bowie , who lived in the city between 1976 and 1978 , saying he played a key role in fostering BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬Åsense of being a city of culture , creativity and openness Ã¢â¬ Â¦
David Bowie belongs to Berlin , David Bowie belongs to us.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Belgian astronomers also registered a constellation in his name : seven stars in the shape of a lightning bolt close to Mars .
And former REM frontman Michael Stipe said that performing in two Bowie tributes led him to realise that he wanted to work in music again .
Of the numerous musical tributes in his name , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fair to say that only LordeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s take on Life on Mars ?
at the Brit awards , backed with many of his original players , did him any justice .
The New Zealand artist had met Bowie at a party honouring the actor Tilda Swinton , at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Museum of Modern Art , where he said her music was like Ã¢â¬Ålistening to tomorrowÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Lorde paid tribute to him on Facebook , crediting him for making her proud of Ã¢â¬Åmy spiky strangeness , because he had been proud of his.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In a Periscope Q&amp;A , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime pianist Mike Garson said that Bowie felt Lorde was Ã¢â¬Åthe future of music , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ and that she was chosen for the Brits tribute because BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s family and management Ã¢â¬Åwanted to bring the next generation inÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And some not so good ones There was Lady GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
hammy Grammys medley ( produced by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former collaborator Nile Rodgers ) , a fairly ineffective laser show set to Philip GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅHeroesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ symphony at Glastonbury , and a ropey BBC Prom .
If that wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t punishment enough , StingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new album will also pay tribute to the late star , along with Prince , MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lemmy , and Alan Rickman .
The Weeknd named his bloated new album Starboy as a tribute , and Bowie emojis were introduced .
He wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t shy about shooting down potential collaborators Including Coldplay
( Ã¢â¬ÅItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a very good song , is it?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ) , the Foo FightersÃ¢â¬ â¢ Dave Grohl ( Ã¢â¬ÅThanks ,
but I think IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m gon na sit this one outÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) and Red Hot Chili Peppers ( Ã¢â¬ÅHe said no to us like , two or three timesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
He had voracious artistic tastes Before his art collection was sold off at SothebyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in November , the works went on display to the public : a glorious mishmash of postmodern Italian design , the bucolic St Ives school , Jean Michel Basquiat , Damian Hirst and Peter Lanyon .
The first round sold for ÃÂ£24 m , the second for ÃÂ£8.5 m .
Did he predict the rise of Donald Trump ?
Bowie was good at predictions : he released his own ISP years before the internet became mainstream , foresaw its cultural impact , and conceptualised iTunes .
But music critic Simon Reynolds , author of Shock and Awe : Glam Rock and Its Legacy , spotted more grim parallels between AmericaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s president - elect and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mid-1970s predictions of a Ã¢â¬Åstrong leaderÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ who would
Ã¢â¬Åsweep
throughÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ the western world with Ã¢â¬Åa rightwing , totally dictatorial tyrannyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
On a happier note ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been rewarding to gain a deeper understanding of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mindset and motives towards the end of his life .
But sometimes nothingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s as good as trivia .
Like how Peter Jackson begged him to audition for Lord of the Rings .
That he was set to appear in this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Twin Peaks reboot , reprising his role as agent Phillip Jeffries from the 1992 spinoff film Fire Walk With Me .
He was due to become a grandfather : Duncan Jones and his wife Rodene Ronquillo welcomed baby Stenton David Jones in July .
And brilliantly , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime guitarist Carlos Alomar revealed that the only person ever to intimidate Bowie was Tina Turner , when she came to record 1984Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Tonight .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe said , Ã¢â¬ËWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re going to go out for dinner and youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve got to come!Ã¢â¬ â¢
I said , Ã¢â¬ËSheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Tina Turner ,
sheÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not going to bite you !
Get some man balls.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2017-01-11,"Music producer Tony Visconti has paid tribute to David Bowie on the first anniversary of the death of the Ã¢â¬Åmaster of rock and roll reinventionÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In a personal post entitled The Worst Next Day , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longtime collaborator described his grief , and recounted the moment at which he found out about the rock starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death on 10 January 2016 .
Ã¢â¬ÅLooking back a year
I realise I was so fortunate I was with my band when the news broke , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Visconti said .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I was on my own I would have been totally devastated , totally.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Visconti had known of BowieÃ¢â¬
â¢ s illness for a year but had signed an NDA vowing that he would not reveal details about the recording of Blackstar .
Ã¢â¬ÅI was sound asleep in a hotel room in Toronto when my phone lit up around 2 am with texts every second , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe messages were more or less the same thing Ã¢â¬ â
Ã¢â¬ËDavid
Bowie has diedÃ¢â¬ â¢ , something I had been dreading for a year .
Strangely , I said to myself , Ã¢â¬ËOh GodÃ¢â¬ â¢ and fell back to sleep
( Holy Holy [ ViscontiÃ¢â¬ â¢
s
Bowie tribute supergroup ] had played an exhausting show the night before ) .
My roommate , saxophonist Terry Edwards , woke me up gently around 7 am whispering , Ã¢â¬ÅTony , something terrible has happened.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
A few minutes later Woody Woodmansey came into the room and tried to console me .
My band , Holy Holy , hadnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t any idea
David was terminally ill.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
He said that he had Ã¢â¬Åbeen through every stage of grief in the past 365 days , including angerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and added that he talks to Bowie Ã¢â¬Åin my head all the timeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Describing the process of making Blackstar , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album which describes visions of the afterlife and morality , saying that it Ã¢â¬ÅwasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a haphazard affair , we knew every minute we were making something akin to constructing a Gothic cathedral.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Visconti concluded : Ã¢â¬ÅWe are fortunate to have lived in the same time as him .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve seen him , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve heard him sing and speak , weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve hugged him ,
weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve worshipped him and we are constantly reminded of him daily .
He was a legend in his lifetime and he will be a legend until the end of time .
But he was my friend too .
I miss him dearly.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2017-01-12,"The most popular David Bowie album since the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death on 10 January 2016 is Blackstar , according to the latest figures from the Official Charts Company .
The compilers of the UK charts have put together top 10s for both BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s album sales and singles sales over the last year , with Heroes topping the singles sales list .
Since his death , BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s albums have managed combined sales of around 1.62 m Ã¢â¬ â including physical sales , downloads and streaming equivalents Ã¢â¬ â while his singles have managed 1.87 m combined sales .
Heroes alone has been streamed 8.83 m times since his death , and downloaded 50,000 times .
It achieved its highest chart position of No 12 after his death .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not surprising
Blackstar should be the most popular Bowie album of the last year .
It was released , to glowing reviews , on 8 January , just two days before he died , leading fans to treat it almost as a puzzle offering clues about his life and work .
However , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s perhaps more telling that the next three albums on the Official Charts CompanyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s list were all compilations
Ã¢â¬ â Best of Bowie , Nothing Has Changed :
The Very Best Of and Legacy .
Only after them do his other original albums feature , with the list dominated by his 70s classics .
Blackstar proved to be the best selling album on vinyl in the UK in 2016 , with 54,000 copies .
It was the sixth best selling album across all formats .
The list of bestselling songs is comprehensively dominated by older material .
Lazarus Ã¢â¬ â which appears on Blackstar , and also gave its name to the Bowie musical that opened in New York in 2015 and in London last year Ã¢â¬ â features at No 9 , but the second newest song in the top 10 is 1983Ã¢â¬ â¢ s

Ashes to Ashes"
2017-01-18,"Those unacquainted with the lyrics to David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Life on Mars might mistakenly assume this one - man show to be a travelogue .
Instead , it follows Martin , a bullied , isolated teenager with mental health issues , who lives with his alcoholic mother in a Northamptonshire town .
Only his twin obsessions with the Bowie - loving father who abandoned him , and the Thin White Duke himself , keep him going .
On his 18th birthday , his mother gives him a letter from his dad Ã¢â¬ â which leads Martin on an odyssey through London in the footsteps of both his father and Bowie .
Is Martin on a treasure hunt or merely a wild goose chase ?
The ending is sufficiently oblique that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not entirely sure .
Written and directed by Adrian Berry , and performed by Alex Walton , this is an oddity , but is at times oddly compelling .
The pleasures along the way include tantalising snippets ( but not nearly enough ) of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music , and some sharply observed scenes , including one in an ailing Croydon karaoke bar , once the Greyhound pub where Bowie performed live in 1972 .
There are undernourished and sometimes over - laboured themes here about creativity and the different forms it might take , including perhaps fandom .
But this lament for the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s misfits is given real clout by Walton , who plays a range of characters with impressive conviction but makes Martin so touchingly believable that you want to reach out a helping hand to stop him falling .

2017-01-22,"Best known for his Disintegration Loops series of albums from the early 00s , New York - based avant - garde composer William Basinski sculpts samples , drones and feedback loops into soundscapes rich in melancholic atmosphere .
The two tracks on his 23rd album include a eulogy to David Bowie , For David Robert Jones , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rather less literal than Lady GagaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Grammys tribute and all the more powerful for it .
Its eerily distorted saxophone , a nod to Low , takes six minutes to surface , but then takes centre stage , a mournful motif subtly evolving over the next quarter of an hour .
The multilayered title track , meanwhile , is a less immediate drone , but proves hypnotic well within its 17-minute timeframe ."
2017-01-22,"The American composer Philip Glass , 80 this month , has been one of the dominant , boundary - crossing influences of the past half century .
He first won a worldwide following in the 1970s with Koyaanisqatsi , Einstein on the Beach and Satyagraha , and has collaborated with Allen Ginsberg , Robert Wilson , Doris Lessing , Martin Scorsese , Ravi Shankar , David Bowie , Paul Simon and many more .
GlassÃ¢â¬ â¢ s birthday will be marked with a production by Scottish Opera of his opera The Trial and a Philip Glass at 80 weekend at the Barbican .
It seems that no one Ã¢â¬ â not you , or Steve Reich , or John Adams Ã¢â¬
â likes being called a minimalist .
What do we call you if not that ?
LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s talk about this .
The problem is no one is doing minimalism now .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music we wrote in the 1970s .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s over 30 years out of date .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a crazy idea to use a description made up by journalists and editors to cover all kinds of music .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more confusing than descriptive .
What do I really do ?
Listen to me .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve written 26 operas , 20 ballets , I donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know how many film scores .
I write theatre music .
I write concert and symphonies too .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m working on a new film score right now .
Then IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll start a new stage piece .
My problem is people donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t believe I write symphonies .
But IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m premiering Symphony
No 11 in a couple of weeks .
These are all different forms of music .
Maybe I do too many things .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the description that sticks : Philip Glass , the great American minimalistÃ¢â¬ Â¦
If people called me an American opera composer it would have the virtue of being what I actually do .
This is reality .
God forbid we should be accurate .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not making this stuff up .
Would it be easier to say IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m an Icelandic composer who writes serial music ?
Would that be helpful ?
[ Silence , then laughter . ]
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a theatre composer .
A lot of people want to hear my music of the 1970s and 1980s .
And do you know what I do ?
I play it .
I talk to Paul Simon or anyone like that and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the same .
I say , Ã¢â¬Åwhat do you play live , Paul?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
and he says Ã¢â¬ÅI play my new songs
and I play my hitsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
And itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s true .
If you go to hear Paul Simon , you want to hear Bridge Over Troubled Water .
The new work , by the way , is beautiful , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not why you buy the ticket .
You want to hear the old ones .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the same for me when I play with my ensemble [ the Philip Glass Ensemble ] .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been together 40 years .
We play the familiar stuff , the highlights .
So youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re saying , then , you playÃ¢â¬ Â¦ minimalism !
Well , yes , I admit I am part of the confusion .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve reworked a piece from 1971 .
And , guess what , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s minimalist !
OK OK OK , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m just as bad as the journalists [ more laughs ] .
Growing up in Baltimore , Maryland , you stoked your own musical curiosity by listening to unsold stock in your fatherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s record store .
Was there one really striking discovery ?
Not one , though I listened to everything Ã¢â¬ â what we called Ã¢â¬ÅhillbillyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Buddy Holly and R&amp;B , as well as Beethoven quartets and things that were quite modern then Ã¢â¬ â Shostakovich and BartÃÂ³k .
But as far as records in the shop were concerned , there was always lots of contemporary music Ã¢â¬ â Charles Ives , the great American composer .
And the Second Viennese school Ã¢â¬ â Berg , Webern and , to a lesser extent , Schoenberg .
I sent off for his book on basic harmony Ã¢â¬
â couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t find it in the Baltimore bookstores Ã¢â¬ â and followed it to the letter .
It was very traditional !
But look , I was devouring a whole range of repertoire at that stage .
I was studying music at the Peabody Institute .
As a nine- or 10-year - old
I was taking part in Bach masses in church performances .
At high school they wanted to put on shows , so what did they do ?
Gilbert and Sullivan !
I played flute in the orchestra .
I got to understand how theatre works : the musicians in the pit , the timing , the getting singers on and off stage .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not a bad way to learn your craft .
It gave me a good solid background .
When , years later , I came to write opera , I felt comfortable about all that .
You went off to the University of Chicago , prodigiously early at 15 , then to the Juilliard school in New York .
But the big break was when you went to Europe .
YouÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve said you had two angels sitting on your shoulder , your two great teachers , Nadia Boulanger and Ravi Shankar .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve always said one taught through fear , one through love .
Nadia Boulanger was the great guru in Paris .
She was tremendously fierce .
She taught me Bach , Beethoven , Mozart Ã¢â¬ â every tool of western art music Ã¢â¬ â with an iron rod .
It was , in essence , about understanding technique .
Then there was Ravi Shankar , a master of Indian concert music .
I met him in 1964 .
So I had two of the greatest exponents of different traditions at the same time .
I was about 25 and Ravi was almost 20 years older .
I was like a student .
I stayed close to him for a long time .
We collaborated .
I spoke with him just days before he died .
Your long immersion in Indian music and philosophy , trying to go beyond cultural tourism , has shaped your outlook , practical and aestheticÃ¢â¬ Â¦ That time in India , which included long stays as well as many shorter ones , visiting frequently from the late 60s until 2001 , opened a door to the world of global music .
Until then IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been immersed in European art music .
In Kerala I encountered kathakali , the classical Indian dance theatre which had an influence on my own operas , such as Satyagraha .
Back then , hearing anything beyond western music wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t easy .
You couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t find records , except a few specialist discs of music collected by anthropologists .
If you wanted to hear Balinese music you pretty much had to go to Bali .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to believe that now .
Do you feel you have done what you set out to achieve as a young man ?
Or does it only make sense now , looking back ?
I decided early on I wouldnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t be a music teacher or an academic .
So as soon as I got back from my studies in Europe in 1967 I formed my ensemble Ã¢â¬ â seven musicians playing keyboards and a variety of woodwinds , amplified and fed through a mixerÃ¢â¬
Â¦ I felt I had no choice but to be a performer .
By then my flute playing had dropped off but IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d sharpened up my keyboard skills .
The point of the ensemble was to play the music IÃ¢â¬ â¢
d written .
We rehearsed in my house , we played my music !
That was the deal .
( We did make exceptions and play other stuff , when we rehearsed elsewhere . )
And I could sense the response of the audience .
Those audiences were tiny at first of course .
Sometimes just 20 or so people .
And then we got more successful , but it was a long , long time before we made any money .
That took another 10 or 15 years .
Einstein on the Beach was a massive hit in 1976 yet you still had to drive a taxi and work as a plumber .
Yes , after Einstein on the Beach
I went back to driving a New York cab .
I didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t mind that .
It was interesting work .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have an agent .
I ran all the business side of it and the box office myself .
I enjoyed it .
I grew up in the music business .
I was happy to do it .
But it took at lot of time and work .
In 1979 when we did our first Carnegie Hall concert we had to pay for it , and sell the tickets !
Eventually I formed a publishing company and had people doing it for me .
I didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do it for them !
Have the old divisions between musical styles Ã¢â¬ â
a source of surprisingly bitter contention in the last decades of the 20th century Ã¢â¬ â now healed ?
Do people now accept your chosen path of tonal harmony , melody , repetitive structures ?
No no no
no no .
Those divisions never healed .
Those people just died !
The people who donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want you donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t change their minds .
You outlive them , if youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re lucky .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all dead now , the older guys .
The battle was never won or lost .
The army just went away .
What can I tell you ?
IsnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t that the truth ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s biology .
Nothing more than that .
TheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve just gone
awayÃ¢â¬
Â¦
and we carry on playing .

The lineup :
Rob Flynn ( vocals , production ) and Ian Booth ( bass ) , with help live from Chris Ã¢â¬ÅChipÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Phillips ( guitar / keys / percussion ) , Alex Baron ( ditto ) and Thom Pettit ( drums ) .
The background : Talking of powerful men indulging in questionable , even dangerous , political posturing Ã¢â¬ Â¦ remember that strange moment in May 1976 when David Bowie rode into Victoria station in an open - topped Mercedes and raised his arm in what appeared to be a Nazi salute ?
Rob FlynnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s granddad , then working at BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s label RCA in the A&amp;R department , was there : you can see him , in that iconic image of the procession , standing at one corner of the limo .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also there , somewhere , in the background in the famous shot of Bowie at Marc BolanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s funeral the following year .
Flynn loves Bowie and channels this era when he sings , even if his voice has more of the boyish blankness of Bernard Sumner with some of Dave GahanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s darkly cherubic croon .
Similarly , the brooding and buoyant electronic dance music that he makes as ÃËslÃÂ¸ PÃÂ¥rks , with bassist Ian Booth , is born out of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sojourn in Berlin , even if it actually has more in common with BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 80s progeny .
We can hear New Order , Depeche Mode , OMD Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Listeners attuned to more recent developments have drawn comparisons with Metronomy , Blood Orange and Hot Chip .
Ã¢â¬ÅI think itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an era when synth music really had soul , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Flynn says of the 80s , explaining how ÃËslÃÂ¸ PÃÂ¥rksÃ¢â¬ â¢ doleful disco comes about .
Ã¢â¬ÅI listen to a lot of slow , sad music but whenever I try to make music like that myself it ends up like a party tune , even if did start in a dark place.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Some dismiss the 80s as a period of ra - ra - skirted escapist entertainment when really it was a golden age of lugubrious pop electronica .
It was a time of cold war tension and living under the shadow of a nuclear threat .
Ring any bells ?
Ã¢â¬ÅI
never thought of our music as representative of our time politically , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Flynn ,
Ã¢â¬Åbut maybe
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the perfect breeding ground for it.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Heavy on reverb and slapback delay
Ã¢â¬ â though he points out that the latter was employed extensively at Sun Studios on Elvis PresleyÃ¢â¬
â¢ s earliest recordings Ã¢â¬ â ÃËslÃÂ¸ PÃÂ¥rks make their fantastically forlorn music in FlynnÃ¢â¬ â¢ s home studio in Worthing .
They use synth bass , keyboards and layered harmonies as the background to their explorations of relationship problems and the alienating effects of social media .
On The Night , over a propulsive bassline , Flynn sings , Ã¢â¬ÅWe donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have forever , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ as he waits for the phone to ring Ã¢â¬ â moments of tedium and quotidian banality given dramatic heft by the melodies and rhythms .
Their first single , Twin ( picked up by French label KitsunÃ Â© for inclusion on their New Faces II compilation ) compared love to being in a coma and was about the way we create false versions of ourselves online .
Ã¢â¬ÅTheyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re like digital twins
Ã¢â¬
â theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re what we want to be , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
On their newest song , Like a Stone , the intention was to create something Ã¢â¬Ånice and bright and summeryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ about Ã¢â¬Ådoing stupid stuff and growing from it and becoming a better personÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Inevitably , it sounds like exquisitely tortured breakup music .
Recent track Fiction is like a smash hit that never was from that episode of Black Mirror set in a fictional 80s , San Junipero .
Or you could imagine its nightclub shadows and urban disquiet in a scene from Grand Theft Auto where your avatar careens around listening to 80s pop .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe love that game .
Soundtracking GTA is our dream , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says , before snapping us out of our retro reverie with some common sense .
Ã¢â¬ÅSecond , of course , to being written about in the Guardian.Ã¢â¬

The buzz : Ã¢â¬ÅThis is what Metronomy should have kept sounding like.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½

2017-01-26,"David Bowie is to be commemorated with a full set of 10 postage stamps from the Royal Mail .
The stamps , which go into circulation from 14 March , commemorate six Bowie album covers as well as four of his tours .
Explaining the decision for the tribute to Bowie , Philip Parker of Royal Mail said : Ã¢â¬ÅFor five decades David Bowie was at the forefront of contemporary culture , and has influenced successive generations of musicians , artists , designers and writers .
Royal MailÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stamp issue celebrates this unique figure and some of his many celebrated personas.Ã¢â¬

The Royal Mail has paid tribute to musicians before , and last summer it published a 10-stamp Pink Floyd set , which also featured six album covers and four performances .
The Bowie album covers featured are Hunky Dory , Aladdin Sane , Heroes , LetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dance , Earthling and Blackstar .
The tours marked are the 1973 Ziggy Stardust tour , the 1978 Stage tour , the 1983 Serious Moonlight tour , and the 2004 Reality tour .
You can pre - order various presentation packs of the stamps from the Royal Mail now ."
2017-01-26,"The composer and conductor Pierre Boulez died in January last year , aged 90 .
He was the first of many great musicians to die in 2016 but his name was rarely mentioned in the end - of - year roundups , simply because he didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have the public prominence of David Bowie , Leonard Cohen or Prince .
Nonetheless , Boulez changed the concept of music Ã¢â¬ â the very idea of what it is Ã¢â¬ â far more than those who are more publicly mourned .
He completely transformed the rules of composition , and his work challenged preconceptions in postwar Europe just as it does today .
He began his musical revolution in 1943 , when he was 25 , and went to Paris to study with the godfather of the European avant - garde , Olivier Messiaen .
When his studies were over , he needed a job .
Fortunately he was a skilled player of the ondes martenot , an early electronic instrument that sounds like a lamenting robot .
He got work as a jobbing musician performing with theatre companies and in cabaret .
He was a regular at the Folies BergÃÂ¨re and thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one fantastic story about an appearance where he was lowered on a glittering platform from the ceiling , Liberace - style .
But he cut his serious , professional teeth with the Renaud - Barrault theatre company , who performed Greek plays , Shakespeare and other classics .
He began in the pit band , playing the ondes martenot , but soon became the companyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical director , arranging and conducting popular classics and theatre music .
In his spare time , he composed Structures Book 1 , Polyphonie X and Le Marteau sans MaÃ Â® tre , wrapped in a blanket in his tiny , two - room garret that was without heating or running water .
The French government funded several tours of South America by the Renaud - Barrault company and in 1950 , 1954 and 1956 Boulez went with them .
It wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t what he really wanted to do ; he wanted to be an avant - garde composer , but he needed to earn a living .
Letters that Boulez wrote at the time of his South American journeys have recently been unearthed by Edward Campbell of Aberdeen University .
They tell of his frustrations at having to work in the theatre .
He refers to Ã¢â¬Å Ã¢â¬ Â¦ insipid and unimportant musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and Ã¢â¬Åtiresome incidental noisesÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
But the indigenous music of South America was a different matter , especially when , in Brazil in 1950 , he witnessed the magical rituals of CandomblÃ Â© , a religion with twin roots in Roman Catholicism and African Vodou .
The theatre companyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director , Jean - Louis Barrault , described one ceremony they attended : Ã¢â¬ÅThe singing became more intense .
The audience began to get caught up in it .
Suddenly one of the choir singers was electrocuted by the medium .
Like a wounded man he bent forward and moved inside the circle.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Speaking with the scholar Peter OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Hagan in 2013 about the impact South American music had on his work , Boulez said : Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬ Â¦ I used the music of CandomblÃ Â© , because it was mainly percussion , very impressive Ã¢â¬ Â¦
[ In Peru ] I liked the songs and the sound between the harp , flute and piccolo Ã¢â¬ â that was really something .
I took it [ into ] Pli Selon Pli , where there are four piccolos and three harps.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
So , Boulez , the doyen of 1950s serialism , was taken by the sounds of Peruvian folk music and bewitched by the frenetic drumming of frenzied , spiritual rituals .
His music is often considered a cold , detached juggling of mathematical tables , but in fact pieces such as Le Marteau sans MaÃ Â® tre and Pli selon Pli are infused with the powerful sonic magic he experienced in South America .
And that isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t all .
In 1956 in Caracas , he conducted a symphony orchestra for the very first time .
He achieved international fame and acclaim as a conductor , perhaps more than as a composer , but his orchestral conducting career began not in Paris but in Venezuela , well away from the attentions of the cosmopolitan music scene .
In a letter home , he wrote : Ã¢â¬ÅTo be honest , I feared the test of the large orchestra Ã¢â¬ Â¦ IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve done it
and I pulled it off without doing any harm.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Here was one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century , initially full of self - doubt , celebrating the fact that he could actually conduct a large symphony orchestra , having previously only conducted small ensembles .
It must have been like driving a juggernaut having previously nipped around in a two - seater .
Surprisingly , the early career of the last great modernist composer and celebrated conductor was boosted , not in the salons and concert halls of Paris , but at the edges of the rainforest in a country far removed from the European avant - garde , where some of the most radical music of modern times became possessed by native ritual magic .

2017-01-31,"Haddon Hall was the sprawling Victorian villa in Beckenham , south London , where David Bowie lived with his wife Angie and an assortment of musicians from 1969 until 1972 .
The couple rented a ground - floor flat for ÃÂ£7 a week Ã¢â¬ â the Spiders from Mars were , I think , sequestered around an upstairs landing Ã¢â¬ â and in one of its cavernous rooms , their ceilings painted silver , Angie cut DavidÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hair and stitched the first Ziggy outfit .
If youÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve ever wondered about this semi - mythical place , long since demolished to make way for another block of flats , I recommend the swirling dreamscape that is Haddon Hall :
When David Invented Bowie .
Its author , the Tunisian - born French cartoonist Nejib , puts BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lost house centre stage , David and Angie having fallen instantly in love with its discreet decrepitude , its towers and mouldings and preposterously long corridors .
In his hands , it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t only bear witness to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s self - creation .
It is also his doting narrator , a shiver of delight passing along its roof beams when the couple tell the estate agent they would indeed like to move in .
A lot of what follows will be familiar to Bowie fans , major and minor .
Here , just as youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d expect , is our hero making friends with Marc Bolan , falling out with Tony Visconti , and being patronised half to death by John Lennon ( even as he boasts of having had dinner with Stockhausen and Nabokov , Lennon canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t help droning on about his and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shared Ã¢â¬ÅproleÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ backgrounds ) .
Syd Barrett also has a walk - on part .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not all rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll .
The undemonstrative Bowie parents appear , stiff figures who seem to belong not just to another generation , but to another century ; and so does his much - loved half - brother , Terry , who had schizophrenia .
Terry also finds sanctuary at the hall for a time , Bowie having liberated him from Cane Hill , a south London psychiatric hospital that began its life as a Victorian asylum .
( The gothic can be sinister as well as welcoming . )
What a dazzling book this is .
Nejib is wonderfully alive to the influences on Bowie in this crucial period , from the final illness of his father , John , to Stanley KubrickÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1971 film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange ( leaving the cinema after seeing it , the still struggling Bowie suddenly sees what he should be : a rock star Ã¢â¬ÅwhoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all destruction and the futureÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
Even the weather plays its part , British rain being , according to Nejib , the single greatest spur to the creativity of its people .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s his narrative economy that I really admire , his deft handling of flashbacks , the series of satirical Ã¢â¬ÅintermezzosÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ with which he punctuates his text .
As for his drawings , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nothing sepia here .
Resisting the temptation to deploy a palette that resembles the colours of faded Polaroids , he runs instead with an energetic brightness : garish shades that reflect not only the velveteen decadence of glam , but the ( hold - your - breath ) sense that something quite astonishing is about to happen .

2017-02-05,"On the grey January morning when the news reached the world that David Bowie had died , the poets Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts were on the top floor of House of Fraser in Bournemouth , watching a hot air balloon far below fail to take off .
Did this strike them as a good metaphor for the unwieldy project that is their second book together ?
( The first , Edgelands , was about the wild places on our doorsteps . )
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not sure that it did .
Ã¢â¬ÅJudging by the logo and the lurid colours , we reckon itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s some kind of health promotion , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ they write almost Pooterishly of its deflated bulk , after which Ã¢â¬ â poetic impulses and wishful thinking overtaking them at last Ã¢â¬
â
they insist that the town , which smells of a sea that today will remain out of sight , Ã¢â¬Åfeels like the very edge of EnglandÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Bournemouth , as glimpsed from a department store cafeteria : in their eyes Ã¢â¬Åa good place to come if you want to vanishÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Farley and Symmons Roberts are on the trail of Rosemary Tonks , who used to come to this cafe in the days when this branch of House of Fraser was known as Dingles .
Tonks , who died in 2014 at the age of 85 , is more famous now for her repudiation of fame than for the two collections of poetry ( and six novels )
she published in the 60s and early 70s , books that made her the toast of literary London .
In 1979 , she moved to Bournemouth , where she had an aunt , and promptly proceeded to obliterate her old self .
Though divorced , she began using her married name , Lightband .
The manuscript of a novel she had written was burned , along with an inherited collection of priceless Chinese artefacts she had once regarded as a source of inspiration .
Henceforth , she read only the Bible .
To those whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ d known her up in the metropolis , she might as well have been dead .
In the town where she lived in such wilful obscurity , Farley and Symmons Roberts , as is their habit , meet up with a literary tour guide : in this case , Neil Astley , the founder of Bloodaxe Books and TonksÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last editor ( a job which , naturally , he was only able to perform after her death ) .
They then take in the sights , or what passes for them , visiting an estate agent who sold a house for her Ã¢â¬ â when she was alive , dust hung in swags from the ceilings , Ã¢â¬Ålike Spanish
mossÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ Ã¢â¬ â and the current owner of the property , who shows them
pre - renovation photographs in which ghostly paths may be seen on the grey - powdered carpets .
What this achieves , however , isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t clear , for as they note themselves : Ã¢â¬ÅPeople do bow outÃ¢â¬ Â¦
They feel trapped , go to work one day on their usual commuter train , then surface 10 years later running a bar on a Thai beach.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ TonksÃ¢â¬ â¢ s disappearance , moreover , isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a romantic thing : it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t take you closer to the poems , which might as well have been written by another woman altogether ; and while the reclusion of , say , the white - robed Emily Dickinson has only bolstered her reputation , TonksÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fundamentalist Christianity , appearing as it did rather late in the faithless 20th century , is uncomfortable : ugly rather than delicate , unforgiving rather than merely sequestered .
Deaths of the Poets consists of dozens of episodes like this : oddly desultory days out in which the authors try to make sense of their subjectsÃ¢â¬ â¢ lives and work by looking ( or not , in some cases , for they are strangely squeamish ) at places associated with their deaths .
At first sight , this impulse seems a good one : the connection between poetry and mortality is abidingly powerful , something for which we must blame the Romantics .
But as Farley and Symmons Roberts are well aware , it is twisted , too .
As many great poets have died from old age as have committed suicide too young .
What , then , does death have to do with the work ?
Yes , it shadows Ã¢â¬ â to take obvious examples
Ã¢â¬ â the poems of both Sylvia Plath and Philip Larkin , but while she took her life at 30 , he died of cancer in hospital at 63 .
Larkin , of course , puts another spoke in the authorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ wheel , having been famously suspicious of our cultureÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mythologising of the poet .
Why , he wondered , shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t he have a day job ?
Why , more to the point , should insanity be considered an indicator of quality ?
Dickinson , for one , was at her best , Larkin thought , when she was Ã¢â¬Åat her least odd , her most controlledÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Farley and Symmons Roberts begin with Thomas Chatterton , dead in his garret at 17 , having swallowed arsenic , by paying a somewhat unenlightening visit to his childhood home , now marooned on a Bristol roundabout .
This leads them , in turn , to Dylan Thomas , John Berryman and Plath , a trio connected , silkily , by self - destruction .
After this , though , things get a bit diffuse .
Here is Thom Gunn , killed in his 70s by hedonism rather than misery ; and here , too , are Stevie Smith and David Jones , fragile perhaps , but also tough enough to live long and productive lives
( she died at 68 , he at 78 ) .
Frank OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Hara went far too young , at 40 , but it was a Fire Island beach jeep that did for him .
WH Auden copped it from heart failure at 66 , but this was no mean achievement , given his talent for smoking .
What do any of them have in common , save for their art ?
What , moreover , are the authors up to ?
Are they pilgrims , biographers , or simply two blokes off on a jaunt ?
The combination of literary biography and what we might call , for brevityÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sake , psycho - geography seems to me , potentially , a bewitching one Ã¢â¬ â particularly when practised by two brilliant , northern poets .
But on the page , it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t work at all , and not only because their narrative is so lacking in clarity and vision , so badly in want of a thesis .
There are problems of process , too .
Oh , but they will hop around .
Just as I was settling into an account of AudenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last days in Austria , we were suddenly in Northern Ireland , thinking about Seamus Heaney ; no sooner had I begun to get intrigued by John Riley , who was murdered in Leeds in 1978 , than they were telling me about a Chinese poet , Xu Lizhi .
The authors write in the first person plural , a royal Ã¢â¬ÅweÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ that makes it seem as if the book was written by committee , the reader never knowing quite what they think .
Is this Ã¢â¬ â the need to compromise Ã¢â¬ â why they sometimes fall back on banalities ?
Or were they fazed by the fact that all of these poets have been written about more deeply elsewhere ?
Either way , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to forgive them when , to take just one example , they describe David Jones as Ã¢â¬Ånothing if not complicatedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
It makes you wonder what all the long train journeys and turbulent flights were really for .

2017-02-23,"Grime is still a problem for the Brits
There was no grime winner , despite Kano and Skepta being nominated for best album
( they were unfortunate to be up against David Bowie in the year following his passing ) .
More shaming was that neither Skepta nor Stormzy could win the breakthrough act award , but were beaten by RagÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Bone Man , a white artist melding black styles .
And the post - watershed broadcast of SkeptaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Shutdown Ã¢â¬ â in which a good portion of the songÃ¢â¬ â¢ s audio was muted , though not the reading out of the complaint about the grime takeover of KanyeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Brits appearance in 2015 Ã¢â¬ â was ruined so thoroughly as to be an embarrassment .
Presenter Romesh RanganathanÃ¢â¬
â¢ s gag Ã¢â¬ â that heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d been invited because the organisers had heard he listened to grime and wanted to make amends for last year Ã¢â¬ â rang sadly true .
Matters were compounded when A Tribe Called QuestÃ¢â¬ â¢ s win in the best international group category Ã¢â¬ â a genuinely surprising victory
Ã¢â¬ â was brushed away in seconds after DrakeÃ¢â¬ â¢
s win was announced .
It made the Brits look as if black music was an afterthought .
The George Michael tribute was almost perfectly judged No industry bigwigs ; no talking heads on his artistry .
Instead , his oldest friends and colleagues , Andrew Ridgeley , Pepsi DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman spoke movingly of their memories of the young George and his determination and delightfulness .
The moment when first Pepsi and then Shirlie broke down was almost unbearable , and RidgeleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s conclusion was perfectly dignified : Ã¢â¬ÅI loved him , and in turn we , and you , were loved.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
What followed was less perfect .
Chris Martin is clearly a very decent man , and Coldplay are unfairly scoffed at .
But he was simply not a good enough singer for A Different Corner , one of MichaelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s very best songs , and the moment where the pair were technologically shoehorned into a duet was a bit buttock clenching .
A change is as good as a rest Ant and Dec are , as we are constantly told , consummate TV presenters .
But the thought of them presenting their 329th consecutive Brits was a little wearying .
The original plan to have Michael BublÃ Â© present this year fell through because his son has liver cancer , and he felt Ã¢â¬ â rightly
Ã¢â¬ â that being with his family took precedence over being with the great , the good and the gruesome of the British music industry .
And while Dermot OÃ¢â¬ â¢ Leary Ã¢â¬ â whose middle names are Safe , Pair , Of and Hands Ã¢â¬ â and Emma Willis didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t exactly radiate chemistry , is was nice to be without the sometimes irritating faux self - deprecation and so - bad - theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re - good - no - actually - theyÃ¢â¬ â¢ re - just - bad gags of Ant and Dec.
Of course , the hyperbole gets on oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nerves
Ã¢â¬ â everything has to be incredible
, brilliant , fantastic Ã¢â¬ â
but there was enough sobriety not to make it cloy .
That said , opinion was divided in the Guardian office as to which of the pair was holding it together .
There wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t a lot of politics
You might have thought that at this point in time , some musicians might have something to say about the state of the world .
But , no .
For the most part there was the usual cavalcade of thanking label bosses , managers , parents and Ã¢â¬Åeveryone who believed in meÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Matty Healy of the 1975 , a man who Ã¢â¬ â thankfully Ã¢â¬ â
canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see a platform without taking to it , told viewers that was now the time not to be silent : artists are told Ã¢â¬Åstay in your lane when it comes to social issues , but if you have a platform Ã¢â¬ â donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t do thatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Mind you
, had Anohni won the British female solo artist award , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
a fighting chance her speech would have covered all the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political woes and lasted three hours .
The 1975 showed some daring IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve been championing this band for a few years now Ã¢â¬ â doubtless to your irritation Ã¢â¬
â
so it was the rare Brits win
I was pleased about .
More to the point , though , was that their performance was what you might hope for from an awards show Ã¢â¬ â especially in the televised iteration , where the damning criticism they have received was flashed up on the screen Ã¢â¬ â PRETENTIOUS , ANNOYING , BUBBLEGUM MANUFACTURERS Ã¢â¬ â in a similar way to how it appeared in their video for the song they performed on Wednesday night , The Sound .
They will always be a divisive group , but they are not afraid to provoke , and that is at least part of popÃ¢â¬ â¢ s job .
2016 was musicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s saddest year It would have been easy for the Brits to have mentioned just the names of the biggest stars to have died in 2016 , but the montage of names that flashed up was a reminder of the depth of music losses , and it was wonderful to see even those who would have despised and despaired of this industry
bunfight acknowledged for their contribution .
This will be the only time the names of Alan Vega and Vi Subversa will be mentioned at the Brits .
And how wonderful Ã¢â¬ â if that is the right word
Ã¢â¬ â that they could be brought , fleetingly , to the attention of the wider world ."
2017-03-02,"David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retiring of his alter ego Ziggy Stardust at the Hammersmith Apollo in 1973 was one of those lightbulb moments , allowing Bowie to segue seamlessly into his Thin White Duke era , and expanding the horizons of what pop stars could and couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do .
The documentarian DA Pennebaker was present with a crew to capture the event for posterity , either through dumb luck or premeditation
( Pennebaker swears it is the former ) , and the result is this concert film , rereleased into cinemas this week for a single - night show .
Unlike PennebakerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
seminal 1976 Dylan film DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Look Back , whose freewheeling behind - the - scenes footage revolutionised music doc filmmaking , this focuses almost exclusively on the performance , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s sometimes to the filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s detriment : poor stage lighting means that proceedings are caked in an indistinct fuzz .
Still , PennebakerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s workaround Ã¢â¬ â tightly focusing on Bowie at the expense of wider stage
shots Ã¢â¬ â provides an intimate look at a performer in full flight , and the moment where Bowie announces that this is Ã¢â¬Åthe last show that weÃ¢â¬ â¢ ll ever doÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , to the screams and groans of the audience ( most of whom assumed it was he , not Ziggy , who was retiring ) remains utterly bracing ."
2017-03-09,"English National Opera has recruited the record producer and music director of La La Land Marius de Vries as creative consultant to help develop projects away from traditional opera .
The company said De Vries , who has written and produced for artists including Madonna , David Bowie , Rufus Wainwright , Massive Attack and Annie Lennox , would contribute to projects Ã¢â¬Åcombining and colliding opera with popular music and electronic musicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The appointment appears to demonstrate the intention of ENOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s new artistic director , Daniel Kramer , to shake things up at a company which has had more than its share of troubles in recent years .
ENO said it was about bringing its work Ã¢â¬Åto an audience that may never have considered engaging with opera beforeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
Kramer said : Ã¢â¬ÅAlongside ENOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more traditional productions , it is vital that we continue to push the boundaries of opera and explore the different routes that this most wonderful art form may take in the future.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He said a series of projects would collide opera with music from many different genres .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe [ De Vries ] brings with him an exceptional level of expertise across the music , film and broadcast industries , and I look forward to sharing the fruits of this collaboration with you in due course.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Kramer and De Vries , who is providing his services on a pro bono basis , worked together in 2013 on a doomed $ 36 m King Kong mega - musical .
De Vries said : Ã¢â¬ÅI am thrilled to be reconnecting my creative relationship with the inspirational and visionary Daniel Kramer , honoured to be welcomed into the ENO family , and beyond excited to be helping to develop and nurture new projects and collaborations informed by the ENOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s long tradition of adventure and innovation , at the same time reaching out to whole new audiences.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
De Vries has a long and impressive musical CV .
As well as producing pop artists , he was music director on Baz LuhrmannÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Moulin Rouge and co - wrote the soundtrack and score for Romeo + Juliet , another Luhrmann film .
More recently he was music director and music producer on La La Land .
His appointment will be welcomed by people who believe ENO needs to be more daring , but may alarm traditional opera - goers .
The choice of Kramer Ã¢â¬ â who has never run an opera house Ã¢â¬ â as artistic director was a surprise and was seen by many as the last shake of the dice for a company which seemed almost permanently embattled .
It followed numerous resignations and rancour which contributed to ENOÃ¢â¬ â¢ s removal from Arts Council EnglandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s national portfolio of organisations given regular funding .
Kramer has passionate supporters but vocal detractors .
The Australian tenor and ENO regular Stuart Skelton said last month Kramer was the wrong man for the job .
He told the Bachtrack website : Ã¢â¬ÅNot only is he not experienced but the only times heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s been in something genuinely large scale , it fell over.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Kramer is due to announce his first season as artistic director in April ."
2017-03-10,"The David Bowie vaults are gradually being opened up , with two new releases of unreleased material to emerge next month .
The bad news , though , is that both are limited editions for the 10th anniversary of Record Store Day on 22 April .
Cracked Actor ( Live in Los Angeles 1974 ) is a three - album set recorded on the Philly Dogs Tour in September 1974 , some material from which appeared in the famous BBC documentary Cracked Actor .
The full show appears across five sides of vinyl , with the sixth featuring an etching of Bowie .
The album differs from the Ã¢â¬ÅofficialÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ 1974 Bowie live album , David Live : there is a different band , including backing singer Luther Vandross , and a setlist that includes material recorded for The Gouster , which was finally released last year as part of the
Who Can I Be Now ?
box set .
The other album is Bowpromo , which was originally a promo album from 1971 , pressed in tiny quantities .
The original disc featured seven songs by Bowie and five by Dana Gillespie , but the reissue features only the Bowie tracks , with new sleeve notes and Bowie prints .
Bowpromo is largely comprised of alternate versions of songs that would later appear on Hunky Dory , as well as a version of It AinÃ¢â¬ â¢ t Easy , which would eventually appear on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .

2017-03-16,"Enrico Pieranunzi may have quietly accompanied the fragile trumpet romantic Chet Baker , but anyone whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s heard the great Italian pianist live knows how electrifying he can be when the brakes are off .
New Spring , recorded live at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Village Vanguard , catches that , and its temperature is raised to scalding point by an equally uninhibited Donny McCaslin , the saxophonist from
David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Blackstar band .
Pieranunzi can echo Bill Evans , Herbie Hancock and McCoy Tyner , but the contemporary insights of McCaslin and drummer Clarence Penn reforge those methods as if they were new .
The anthemic Tyner feel of Amsterdam Avenue is sharpened by McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s melancholy squeals and staccato figures , while the title track , with its swerving sax theme and contrastingly prancing countermelody , invites some of the venerable leaderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most youthfully muscular improv .
McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mix of eerily slurred intonation and explosive accents give the ballad episodes a caustic edge , and Pieranunzi veers between old - school swing embroidery and Hancockian drive on I Hear a Rhapsody .
New Spring is an old - wine - in - new - bottles set that could hardly have been better named ."
2017-03-23,"What a great top 10 singles from the Official Charts Company .
A leading solo artist at No 1 , a great British group at No 2 , Radio 2 favourites at three , three hot young acts , one veteran band propelled there by fanbase sales , one beloved pop institution , and one proper wildcard .
Admittedly , thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s nine , and the 10th song is by the bloke whoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at No 1 , but never mind , because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s David Bowie rather than Ed Sheeran , and this is a chart that paints a picture of pop in the UK that those who grew up watching Top of the Pops would recognise .
That chart Ã¢â¬ â with Bowie joined by Depeche Mode
, Take That , London Grammar ,
RagÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Bone Man , Deep Purple , Ed Sheeran , Blondie and Cigarettes
After Sex ( the wildcard ) Ã¢â¬ â is the physical chart , the one calculated by the old rules .
The one where each of your sales was calculated by the fiendish method of counting the number of physical manifestations of an artistÃ¢â¬ â¢ s music that had been bought : the records , CDs , cassettes and anything else you can think of .
No downloads , no complicated formula involving streams and their equivalence to sales .
Even if you ignore physical sales , and look only at downloads , then the simple fact that music is being sold creates a markedly different list to the official singles chart .
Yes , Ed SheeranÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Shape of You and Galway Girl are Nos 1 and 2 , and heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s at No 6 with Castle on the Hill .
But thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s also room for Chainsmokers and Coldplay , Martin Jensen , Katy Perry , Steps ,
RagÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Bone Man , Anne Marie , and Zedd and Alessia Cara .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more like a Radio 1 playlist than the singles chart , but it has the virtue of variety .
The vinyl singles chart is different again , with London Grammar at No 1 , and top 10 placings for Slime ( a reissue of a single by someone who was in punk also - rans Johnny Moped ) , Buzzcocks ( their 1977 EP Spiral Scratch ) , hard rock supergroup Chickenfoot , as well as two singles that have been on the charts for just over and just under a year respectively , by Bon Iver and the 1975 .
The three charts IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve just looked at and the official singles chart ( where Ed Sheeran still has nine of the top 10 ) all paint different pictures of British musical taste .
None are perfect ; each are skewed in their different ways .
The charts that tabulate physical purchases reflect the impulses of often older buyers , for whom ownership of any music remains important , and of loyal fanbases who feel the need to possess everything their favourites release ( hence the 1975Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Medicine being on the vinyl chart for 41 weeks ) .
It needs to be said , though , that for all the physical chartÃ¢â¬ â¢ s variety and apparent ill health , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a tiny segment of the market .
A really tiny segment .
In fact , physical sales account for just 0.03 % of the UK singles market , according to the Official Charts Company , with streaming now much the dominant method of consumption .
The way singles have changed is illustrated by figures from the BPI , which show that between 2013 and 2015 , the average weekly streams for a No 1 single rose from 749,350 to 2,604,800 .
Maybe the problem lies not so much with the charts as with those of us who still cling to the notion that the charts somehow matter , that they are a snapshot of British music .
We are past the days where there can be one single picture that encapsulates the national taste ( and even when it seemed possible , that picture was prone to manipulation ) .
If the internet , as has often been argued , has fractured consensus and created niches in which particular tastes could thrive , unseen by the outside world , then the modern charts in their varying forms also capture niches , albeit niches defined by their mode of consumption .
And so the official singles chart no longer captures what people are most willing to part with money for , but what is being most listened to .
The downloads chart now is the one for people who are willing to spend money .
The physical chart the one for people who need to own , and the vinyl chart is the one for fetishists .
Perhaps charts have become alienating to some because the webÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Balkanisation of music means people , more than ever , want and expect to see their own tastes , attitudes and behaviours reflected back to them .
The official singles chart does not do that , therefore it is failing .
But maybe , in the other charts , you can find something that reflects your own musical life more closely .
When people mourn the passing of the charts as a part of our national cultural life , it is not really the charts they are mourning .
Instead , I suspect , its the passing of the days when they felt on top of the culture , when they didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t look down a list of names and admit to not having heard of most of them , or pronounce the ones they had heard of boring , tuneless , shallow and vapid .
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just what their parents probably did as well , of course , but then their parents likely didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t continue to obsess over pop music long into adulthood .
The unhappiness about the Ed Sheeran charts , then , is about confronting oneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own sense of self , and its relationship to music .
My advice ?
Spare yourself the grief .
Ignore the official singles chart .
Just look at the physical one instead Ã¢â¬ â itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s much more fun .
WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s that ?
Max Richter in at No 18 ?
Jlin rising 56 places to No 37 ?
And that great staple of the charts , a charity record , breaking the Top 40 ?
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a chart I can get behind ."
2017-03-26,"Contrary to the lamentations of Ryan GoslingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Sebastian in La La Land , jazz is enjoying a surprising moment in the sun .
Few would have predicted that the most acclaimed albums of the past two years would be partnerships with forward - thinking jazz musicians .
On last yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Blackstar , the versatility and dynamism of Donny McCaslinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s band enabled David Bowie to make one last leap into the unknown .
On Kendrick LamarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s To Pimp a Butterfly before that , jazz was a means of connecting hip - hop to the ferment of the 1970s .
LamarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s chief lieutenant was Stephen Bruner , the Los Angeles bass player who calls himself Thundercat .
Bruner is the son of Motown session drummer Ronald Bruner Sr and the brother of Ronald Bruner Jr , who has played drums for Prince and Stevie Wonder .
He joined the veteran thrash metal band Suicidal Tendencies as a teenager , moving on to session work for the likes of Erykah Badu and Flying Lotus .
His undulating solo albums blend jazz fusion , soul , hip - hop and yacht - rock with an eccentric sense of humour and a hazy sense of loss .
Drunk , his latest , features Lamar and Wiz Khalifa as well as Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins : an index of both his breadth and his clout .
The album pushes his melancholy falsetto to the fore while his bass functions as the bubbling river that carries the songs along .
His live shows are something else entirely .
The river bursts its banks and runs wild .
When Bruner was playing in Snoop DoggÃ¢â¬ â¢ s backing band , his fellow musicians would scold him : Ã¢â¬ÅCan you make your bass sound like more of a bass?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He can play a straight bassline in the same way that El BulliÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ferran AdriÃ could make you a sandwich : it would be exceptional , but it wouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be the best use of his talents .
Bruner , a jovial , thickset 32-year - old with a nose ring and a bouquet of short dreadlocks , would rather make his six - string bass do the work of a lead guitar or synthesiser , sprinting up and down the fretboard until it speaks in tongues .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so preternaturally gifted that he can do this with his eyes closed , and indeed he does .
Playing on this level has a similar effect to a magic trick or a gravity - taunting gymnastics routine
Ã¢â¬
â
it scarcely seems possible .
His bandmates are no slouches either .
Keyboardist Dennis Hamm alternates between synthesiser and Fender Rhodes with quicksilver grace while drummer Justin Brown frequently attains the manic velocity of drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass .
Communicating with nods and grins , they never play the same setlist twice .
It goes without saying that jazz fusionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical pyrotechnics are an acquired taste .
Looking around the small , packed venue you can see both the passionate head - nodding of aficionados and the antsiness of those who are rather keen for Bruner to return to the stoned groove of the album .
The contrastÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the thing .
The trio regularly send a song spiralling frantically into the cosmos before landing safely at a leisurely hip - hop tempo .
Crowd members clap and cheer like passengers applauding the pilot after a plane has touched down .
It works because BrunerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s songwriting is warm and relatable .
Many of his songs allude to closing your eyes , turning off and letting go but these states often hint darkly at oblivion , in the form of alcoholism or death .
3AM is a yacht - rocking description of insomnia ; DUI a plaintive evocation of the weariness of heavy drinking .
Even Oh Sheit , ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s X , a disco jam that sets GorillaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s twin glitterballs spinning , tackles the messy side of hedonism , recounting a New YearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Eve party spun out of control by too much ecstasy .
Them Changes , BrunerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most infectious song , opens with the striking instruction : Ã¢â¬ÅNobody move ,
thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s blood on the floor/
And I canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t find my heartÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , but his voice makes even the most profound sadness sweet .
Unlike those virtuosos who emphasise technique rather than effect and advertise their intensity with a great deal of earnest face - scrunching , Bruner is a charmingly amiable presence , so delighted by playing that he frequently bursts out laughing .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a lovely moment during Lone Wolf and Cub when someone in the front row shouts out something that amuses him and he giggles and waves at her without breaking stride .
Then heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s off again , rocking back and forth , shutting his eyes and beaming serenely as he makes his instrument perform yet another miracle ."
2017-03-30,"If youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re still mourning David Bowie , and want something to remember him by , then thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s one unique piece of Bowie memorabilia
you might be interested in .
The only drawback ?
It will cost you the thick end of $ 6.5 m .
The item in question is David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old three - bedroom apartment in New York , in which he lived from 1992 to 2002 with his second wife , Iman .
It is being sold through the real estate firm Corcoran for $ 6.495 m .
It should be said , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a fairly splendid setup , located in the famous Essex House apartment block on Central Park South .
The living room of apartment 915 has panoramic views of the park , Ã¢â¬Åand opens into a stately walnut - panelled office that also faces Central Park Ã¢â¬ â the perfect place from which to close the next big deal , write the next bestselling novel or make into a third bedroomÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , according to the listing .
The apartment also comes with a Yamaha piano that belonged to Bowie , but which he evidently did not feel the need to remove when he left the property .
Or perhaps the removers took one look at a grand piano and refused to take it down nine floors .
When Bowie and Iman lived in the apartment , they reportedly had a panic room installed .
That has since been converted back into a master bedroom , removing the opportunity for Bowie obsessives to recreate the cocaine - and - paranoia years from the safety of a sealed box .
The couple left the apartment to move downtown , to a property in SoHo that Bowie had bought in 1999 .
The listing for the Essex House apartment reads : Calling all Central Park and music lovers !
Make beautiful music in this elegant , Central Park - facing condominium home that includes a pristine Yamaha piano that was David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s !
This tremendous home offers a gracious limestone entry foyer and generously proportioned rooms with incredible storage space .
Large picture windows frame a clear and direct view of the incomparable Central Park .
Look on to the perfect landscape , enjoy the serenity of the trees , flanked by the historic and commanding buildings Ã¢â¬ â the view is not to be missed .
The grand - scaled living room measures 28 feet wide and opens into a stately walnut - panelled office that also faces Central Park - the perfect place from which to close the next big deal , write the next bestselling novel or make into a third bedroom .
The pass - through kitchen is newly renovated and features top of the line appliances .
There are two master - sized bedrooms , with beautifully crafted en - suite baths made of custom marble , porcelain and limestone .

2017-04-08,"One DirectionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Harry StylesÃ¢â¬ â¢ s debut solo single , Sign of the Times , is being hailed as a momentous art - pop culture moment - thingie , because it doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t sound like something youÃ¢â¬ â¢ d expect from a boy band member
andÃ¢â¬ Â¦
Well , that seems to be about it .
SOTT has been likened to David Bowie , but in truth itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a bewildering , bellicose dirge that mistakes Ã¢â¬Åfar too longÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ for Ã¢â¬ÅepicÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ and sounds a bit like Snow Patrol shared one tiny spliff between them listening to Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Dark Side of the Moon .

Call me old fashioned , but , if just being a boy band member , and releasing an overlong song , gets you hailed as a counterculture genius , then something has gone very wrong with the counterculture and maybe even with boy bands .
Please be clear , I bear Styles no malice Ã¢â¬ â in fact , as a spiteful past - it former music journalist , my ear trumpet will be earnestly cocked , awaiting the solo album .
However , Bowie , or even Bowie - esque , Harry most definitely is not ."
2017-04-10,"German avant - rock innovators Can may have influenced some big - time fans Ã¢â¬ â from David Bowie and John Lydon to Joy Division Ã¢â¬ â but as their biographer Rob Young has noted , theirs was Ã¢â¬Åan anarchic democracy and everyone who joined it had sacrificed another , surer path to be thereÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Barbican and Goethe InstituteÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 50th anniversary gig reflected their eclecticism by presenting the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Can founder / composer Irmin Schmidt alongside a freely jamming band led by longtime fan Thurston Moore Ã¢â¬ â and it was a warmly ambitious accolade , even if the originatorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ mix of anarchic democracy and the liberating monotony of classic krautrockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s machine - mimicking grooves was a hard balance to catch .
The 79-year - old Schmidt opened the show with the LSO to perform his symphony Can Dialog ( co - written with Gregor Schwellenbach ) , and 2008 ballet suite La Fermosa .
Can Dialog wove classics including Halleluwah and Sing Swan Song into percussively spiky minimalism , and densely layered orchestral structures , sometimes echoing SchmidtÃ¢â¬ â¢ s former teachers Karlheinz Stockhausen and GyÃÂ¶rgy Ligeti in music of sonically fascinating , if rather inchoate , glimpses .
After an interval foyer screening of a mostly inaudible 1972 Can live show , Moore then led an octet including CanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first vocal - ranter Malcolm Mooney .
Landmark tracks such as Outside My Door emerged from percussion whispers and glowing electronica into thunderous double - drums grooving ; a sly Hammond vamp introduced
She Brings the Rain ;
Yoo Doo Right was an ecstatic group jam .
The soundscape was fittingly rich , though the setÃ¢â¬ â¢ s intended drummer Ã¢â¬ â Can legend Jaki Liebezeit , who died in January Ã¢â¬ â was sorely missed ."

2017-04-14,"A follow - up to Labyrinth , the 1980s musical fantasy film that starred the late David Bowie as a villainous Goblin King , is in the works .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , film - maker Fede Alvarez will write and direct the film , while Lisa Henson , daughter of the original filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director Jim Henson , will produce .
Released in 1986 , Labyrinth starred Jennifer Connelly as Sarah , a teenager who has to journey through a magical realm to free her brother after he is kidnapped by BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Goblin King Jareth .
Along the way , Sarah encounters a number of puppet creatures , produced by special effects company Jim HensonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Creature Shop .
The film was a notable box - office flop at the time of release but has since gained a large cult following ; a Labyrinth - themed masquerade ball is held each year in Los Angeles .
A possible remake of the film has been long been rumoured .
Last year , Guardians of the Galaxy screenwriter Nicole Perlman denied that she was working on a new version of the film , after reports of a reboot surfaced in the weeks following BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death .
Perlman expressed anger at the implication that she would seek to profit from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death , describing the timing of the reports as Ã¢â¬Ålike a punch in the gutÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
The Hollywood Reporter article suggests that the new Labyrinth film would be a continuation of the previous filmÃ¢â¬ â¢ s story , rather than a reboot or remake .

ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s unclear whether he eventually went through with the operation , though he appears to have begun taking opioids to control his pain .
His ex - wife , Mayte Garcia , also suggests the death of his infant son , Boy Gregory , drove him towards pills .
Days before his death , PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s staff had contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld , a Californian specialist in pain - medication addiction .
Kornfeld was unable to see Prince personally , but sent his son , Andrew , in his place .
Andrew was among PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retinue when they discovered his body in a lift at Paisley Park , and itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s his voice audible on the 911 call recording .
Nobody is really sure how he got the drugs that killed him .
Doctors ruled that Prince died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl , a synthetic painkiller about 50 times stronger than heroin .
Over the past year many of his friends and colleagues admitted the singer had a prescription drug problem .
However , investigators were unable to track down any prescriptions made out for Prince .
His bodyguard Kirk Johnson appears to have been prescribed another opioid , oxycodone , on PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s behalf .
Investigators also found numerous painkilling pills , including some that tested positive for fentanyl , at the singerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s home , though they have yet to conclude how he came by the drugs that led to his death .
Local police say fentanyl was rarely found on the black market in Minneapolis , though illegally produced fentanyl , manufactured in Asia and packaged to look like prescription opioids , has been seized in the US .
Prince didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t have a smartphone , and may have been a victim of phone hacking .
As part of the investigations into his death , police sought to search PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mobile phone records .
However , according to a warrant application issued to Google , Prince had stopped carrying a phone since he believed his phone had been hacked .
Instead , he preferred to communicate via email and landlines .
He had a pretty cool pseudonym .
Police looking into the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s death came across a briefcase belonging to a Ã¢â¬ÅPeter BravestrongÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , which they now believe was PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s assumed name when travelling .
They also requested access to three associated emails : peterbravestrong@gmail.com , mistag3@gmail.com and paisleyparkafterdark@gmail.com .
Nobody has found PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s will and nobody really knows how much his estate is worth .
A local judge has ruled that Prince died intestate , which means the starÃ¢â¬ â¢ s younger sister , Tyka Nelson , may inherit much of his wealth , alongside his five half - siblings .
According to probate court records , Prince owned around $ 25 m ( ÃÂ£19.5 m ) in real estate , including , among other items , the detached suburban house featured in the Purple Rain video ; as well as 67 10-ounce gold bars worth a little under $ 840,000 , 10 cars , three motorbikes , $ 110,000 in four bank accounts and a tour bus .
However , administrators are finding it harder to place a figure on his intangible assets , such as copyrights to unreleased music , or name and likeness rights .
Current estimates run between $ 200 - 300 m .
Despite the judgeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ruling , Garcia believes the star did draw up a will , but may have destroyed it .
Meanwhile , plenty of less credible claimants have come forward , including one woman who says the CIA covered up her marriage to the singer .
PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ashes are stored in an urn made by the same company that made LemmyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s .
The star was cremated following a low - key ceremony costing just $ 1,645 , but his final resting place is a little more snazzy .
His family commissioned the celebrity urn manufacturers Foreverence to create an urn in the shape of Paisley Park .
This 3D - printed , 14 in x 14 in crystal - encrusted box currently forms part of the Paisley Park tour ; PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s ashes are sealed in the modelÃ¢â¬ â¢ s front column .
Though the urn is among ForeverenceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more notable creations , it is not the first time the firm has worked for the stars .
It also supplied bespoke urns for MotÃÂ¶rheadÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Lemmy , Stone Temple PilotsÃ¢â¬ â¢ Scott Weiland and DevoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Bob Casale .
There is more music coming Ã¢â¬
Â¦ Warner Bros renewed its contact with Prince in 2014 , and plans to release a remastered version of Purple Rain , as well as two discs of new music and two complete concert films , on 9 June .
Some of these recordings will be new versions of old tunes but others , including the Purple Rain outtake , Electric Intercourse , and FatherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Song , which Prince wrote with his dad John Nelson , are unheard .
Ã¢â¬
Â¦ though maybe not just yet .
Lawyers acting on behalf of the artist have prevented George Ian Boxill , a sound engineer who once worked with Prince , from releasing a six - song EP featuring material recorded between 2006 and 2008 .
The collection , entitled Deliverance , has been pulled from iTunes and streaming services .
Even without this new material , Prince was the bestselling artist of 2016 .
According to Billboard , Prince sold 7.7 m units last year , outstripping his closest rival , Adele , by more than 5 m .
His biggest sellers were The Very Best of Prince , Purple Rain and 1999 .
Prince led a happier , more normal life than you might expect .
Though he may have shunned publicity and cultivated an air of mystery , his final days appear to have been sunnier than we might imagine .
The previous Saturday he had dropped into Electric Fetus , his local CD shop Ã¢â¬ â
it was Record Store Day Ã¢â¬ â to buy albums by Stevie Wonder , Joni Mitchell and Santana , as well as discs by the 80s synth pop band
Missing Persons , the gospel singers the Swan Silvertones , and the soul group the Chambers Brothers .
Fans also managed to shoot mobile phone footage of him cycling around the car park of his local mall that weekend .
Meanwhile , the 32-year - old vocalist Judith Hill , perhaps PrinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s last protege , recalled how the singer loved animated movies such as Zootopia , often beat her at table tennis and could cook a mean omelette .
Surely this is how we should remember him : as a half - decent chef and amateur cyclist , as well as perhaps the greatest pop star of the 20th century .

2017-05-09,"Virtually the first thing the visitor to Their Mortal Remains sees is a quote from the late John Peel regarding Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s legendary anonymity : Ã¢â¬ÅThey could have joined the audience at one of their own gigs without being recognised.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
On the face of it , that should preclude Pink Floyd as a band on which to base a V&amp;A exhibition in the blockbusting vein of 2013Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
David Bowie Is , 250 m albums sold or not .
Then again , as the exhibition makes clear , few bands in rock history have ever been as creative in their attempts to distract attention from themselves .
In truth , a certain anonymity seems to have clung to Pink Floyd from the start , even when they were fronted by Syd Barrett , a man as photogenic and pop - star pretty as he was talented : an early cover feature on the band in Town magazine doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t feature them on the cover at all , opting instead for a female model with the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s psychedelic light show projected over her face .
Nevertheless , they endured a brief moment of old - fashioned pop stardom in the summer of 1967 , replete with appearances on Top of the Pops and in the teen magazines ( Ã¢â¬ÅSyd is 5 foot 11 inches tall , with black hair and green eyes Ã¢â¬ â the mystery man of the group and a gypsy at heartÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ ) .
By all accounts Ã¢â¬ â including the testimonies from bandmates and friends featured in a heartbreaking exhibition video
Ã¢â¬ â
it was an experience that seemed to wreak almost as much havoc on BarrettÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fragile psyche as the vast quantities of LSD he consumed , hastening his decline .
After BarrettÃ¢â¬ â¢ s irrevocable descent into mental illness , a combination of survivorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ guilt , English reticence and bloody - mindedness forged in the aftermath of their frontmanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s departure Ã¢â¬ â when almost everyone , including their own managers , appeared to give Pink Floyd up as a lost cause Ã¢â¬ â seemed to drive the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s retreat from the limelight .
BarrettÃ¢â¬ â¢ s replacement , guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour , had all the right ingredients for rock god status except the character : for all his brilliance as a guitarist , he seemed even more reserved than his new bandmates .
Pink Floyd never appeared on one of their own album covers again after 1969Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Ummagumma , and seem to have spent almost as much time devising ways of diverting their audienceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s gaze as they did making music .
A groundbreaking quadrophonic sound system built at their behest got almost equal billing on their gig posters , although Their Mortal Remains reveals that the grandly titled Azimuth Co - ordinator looked suspiciously like something knocked together in someoneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s shed .
At one show , a roadie was obliged to appear on stage dressed as a Tar Monster , complete with a penis fashioned from a washing - up liquid bottle that squirted black fluid over the front rows .
The 1972 tour on which they debuted a nascent version of The Dark Side of the Moon was promoted in the press with a photo of the band with their backs to the camera .
Come and see us live , but donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t look at us : that seemed to be the message .
Their masterstroke came with The Dark Side of the MoonÃ¢â¬ â¢
s release the following year .
Early 70s rock was filled with striking images , from BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lightning flash makeup to Led ZeppelinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mystical Zoso symbols , but few had quite the same lasting impact as the refracting prism design that Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s longstanding visual team Hipgnosis came up with for that
albumÃ¢â¬
â¢ s cover .
An entire room of the exhibition is devoted to it , and rightly so .
In cynical modern parlance , it was a brilliantly simple piece of corporate branding ; 44 years on , it remains the image that first springs to most peopleÃ¢â¬
â¢ s minds when the name Pink Floyd is mentioned Ã¢â¬ â although HipgnosisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s designs for their subsequent albums were scarcely less iconic :
the photograph of two businessmen shaking hands , one in flames , for 1975Ã¢â¬ â¢
s
Wish You Were Here ; the shot of a giant inflatable pig floating above Battersea power station for 1977Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Animals , a giant neon replica of which fills another of the exhibitionÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rooms .
The Dark Side of the Moon made Pink Floyd global superstars , but the bigger they got , the more Pink Floyd themselves seemed to recede .
A 1974 tour programme attempts to elicit information on the band members via a questionnaire , to no avail : Ã¢â¬ÅPersonal likes : Ã¢â¬ËNot much.Ã¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ËToo personalÃ¢â¬ â¢
.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
On stage , they were dwarfed first by a giant circular screen showing specially commissioned films , then by enormous inflatables and vast parachutes in the shape of sheep .
By the time of 1979Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
The Wall , they were sending other musicians on stage in their place , wearing rubber life - masks based on their faces , and performing behind 40 feet of cardboard bricks onto which Gerald Scarfe cartoons were projected .
Their Mortal Remains makes an intriguing attempt to link their ever - more complex stage designs with Roger Waters , drummer Nick Mason and keyboard player Richard WrightÃ¢â¬ â¢ s background as architecture students , although others at the time took what you might describe as their elaborate reticence for haughtiness and pomposity : one wall of the exhibition is devoted to their one - time labelmates the Sex Pistols , with Johnny RottenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
I HATE PINK FLOYD T - shirt at its heart .
WatersÃ¢â¬ â¢ acrimonious mid-80s departure from the band is tactfully skirted around , although keen students of Pink FloydÃ¢â¬ â¢ s endless icy , passive - aggressive internal struggles might note with interest the glaring disparity in space afforded WatersÃ¢â¬ â¢ last album with the band , The Final Cut , and their first without him , 1987Ã¢â¬ â¢ s A Momentary Lapse of Reason .
The latter gets a whole room , which seems less a reflection on its contents Ã¢â¬ â curiously more dated - sounding now than the music they made in 1967 or 1973 Ã¢â¬ â than on the vast , box office - busting tour it spawned , which tellingly saw Pink Floyd reprising not just their greatest hits , but their most famous visual effects .
To the evident fury of Waters , who considered himself the bandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s creative genius , it didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t seem to matter to audiences whether he was there or not , as long as it sounded like Pink Floyd and an inflatable pig floated over the crowd : such is the downside of carefully cultivated anonymity .
Or perhaps it did matter .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s something touching about the way Their Mortal Remains concludes not with The Endless River Ã¢â¬ â the largely instrumental album Gilmour and Mason constructed in tribute to Richard Wright , who died in 2008 Ã¢â¬ â but with footage of the quartetÃ¢â¬ â¢ s solitary reunion , at Live 8 in 2005 .
Their performance ends with a slightly uneasy group hug , which one band member has to be visibly coerced into joining : Pink Floyd were awkward in the spotlight until the last .
The Pink Floyd Exhibition : Their Mortal Remains is at the Victoria and Albert Museum , London , from 13 May to 1 October"
2017-05-16,"Forty years since his death , Elvis PresleyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s image remains one of the most iconic in music history .
The same can not be said for his songs , however : according to a snap YouGov poll of 2,034 British adults , a hefty 29 % of 18- to 24-year - olds said they had never listened to an Elvis song , with none of this age group listening to him daily and only 8 % listening monthly .
Asked what they thought of other veteran stars , about twice as many said they liked the Beatles ( 23 % ) and David Bowie ( 25 % )
Ã¢â¬Åa
lotÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ compared with the King ( 12 % ) .
Even if thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s evidence of dwindling reverence among millennials , the YouGov data clearly shows ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s popularity among older generations .
Despite this , with the value of rare Elvis merchandise in freefall , his Graceland estate will be acutely aware of the financial repercussions of failing to connect with younger audiences , even as the 40th anniversary of his death approaches .
ThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
no denying Elvis maintains posthumous popularity :
Spotify reveals he achieved 382 m streams in 2016 .
Yet compare this to other deceased stars such as Bowie ( who clocked in at more than 600 m ) , Michael Jackson ( also more than 600 m ) , or the long - disbanded Beatles ( 1.3bn ) , and these numbers look less impressive .
Elvis has fallen to the status of Ã¢â¬Ånovelty actÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , according to David Hesmondhalgh , an author and professor of music at the University of Leeds , who says that any musician whose image transcends their music will ultimately fade away : Ã¢â¬ÅIf you ask a small child about Elvis , the fact he died on a toilet through overeating or wore a silly suit is all that registers .
The music has become far less important than the caricature .
His image has been cheapened.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅAny fat bloke can throw on an Elvis costume and sing stupidly down the pub for ÃÂ£100,Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ agrees Lee Arthur , the founder of A1 Star Tributes , a firm that brands itself as EuropeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s top tribute act agency .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t know about America , but itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
really damaged demand over here.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Elvis tribute acts were once big business , but with so many cheap knock - offs , Arthur says punters are now more interested in Gary Barlow and Michael BublÃ
Â© lookalikes .
The agency has 10 Ã¢â¬ÅprofessionalÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Elvis impersonators on its books , who will belt out a pitch - perfect Hound Dog and pose in wedding photos with your nana for ÃÂ£450 .
Arthur , however , says he can charge at least double that for his Michael Jackson impersonators .
Ã¢â¬ÅWith MJ , the audience can have more of a dance and a singalong.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s golden period was arguably between 1956 and 1960 , when his televised Ã¢â¬Åsnake hipÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ dance routines induced a trance - like euphoria among American teenagers .
During this period , he dominated the charts , clocking up 12 No 1s .
This dominance came before the emergence of the concept album in the mid-60s , when LPs such as Rubber Soul and Pet Sounds would evolve the idea of modern pop music .
Ã¢â¬ÅElvis was an excellent singles artist , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ explains Hesmondhalgh .
Ã¢â¬ÅHe emerges before the formation of rock culture as we know it , so the mythology of the original rock album was lost on Elvis .
He doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t have anything near a Sgt Pepper for young people to connect through.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ William Kaufman , professor of American literature and culture at the University of Central Lancashire , says ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s image suffered from allegations of racism and cultural appropriation .
In 1989 , Chuck D used Public EnemyÃ¢â¬ â¢ s political anthem Fight the Power to rap : Ã¢â¬ÅElvis was a hero to most /
But he never meant shit to me /
Straight up racist , the sucker was / Simple and plain , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ as Flavour Flav punctuates his verse with the ad - lib : Ã¢â¬ÅMuthafuck him and John Wayne!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s an insult that has endured .
Ã¢â¬ÅYou could say the Beatles ripped off Chuck Berry or the Rolling Stones ripped off HowlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ Wolf , but those allegations havenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t stuck around like the ones that have dogged Elvis , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Kaufman .
Ã¢â¬ÅHound
Dog was written by two white guys , yet Elvis is visibly still accused of having Ã¢â¬ËwhitenedÃ¢â¬ â¢ black culture.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
By the time Elvis attempted a comeback in the 70s , music had moved on .
Looking back on footage of these performances , Elvis appears out of breath , bloated and his awkward banter with bandmates feels like the antithesis to rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s emerging post - Vietnam counterculture .
Led Zeppelin it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t .
During one of his later shows , Elvis angrily calls out critics for calling him Ã¢â¬Åstrung outÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ on heroin .
Ã¢â¬ÅIf
I find the individual who said that about me , IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m going to break your neck ,
you son of a bitch , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he barks , to almost sarcastic applause .
Ã¢â¬ÅI will pull your goddamn tongue
out!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ÅFor the Hawaii comeback show , Elvis looked great , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Kaufman .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut too much of those late shows starred an Elvis who was prepared to parody himself and let old women throw underwear at him .
The rawness had gone .
With TV sets , those images left a lasting impression.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Kaufman adds that ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s early death prevented him from reinventing his image , in the manner of Johnny CashÃ¢â¬ â¢ s darker late work with the producer Rick Rubin .
Over recent years there have been various embarrassing attempts to repackage the Elvis brand , the low point being a hologram duet with Celine Dion .
But dig deeper through the Elvis catalogue and there are undeniable gems waiting to be rediscovered .
From Elvis in Memphis ( 1969 ) marked his return to non - movie soundtracks , with songs such as In the Ghetto retaining their gritty sense of social realism nearly 50 years later .
During this period , a more mature Presley effortlessly tackled gospel , soul , country and pop , and was backed by such faultless studio musicians as bass guitarist Jerry Scheff , who was later pinched by the Doors to stamp his mark all over their blues masterpiece LA Woman .
Pointing to Father John Misty , whose ironic Elton John - esque sound has made it acceptable for hipsters to pick up represses of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road , Hesmondhalgh says we shouldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t write Elvis off just yet .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhile
I canÃ¢â¬
â¢ t see black culture ever embracing Elvis , there is certainly the potential for a hipster - led revival .
In the era of Trump , the idea of Elvis as an absurd camp figure could also work well , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he adds .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut equally , maybe we should just accept that ElvisÃ¢â¬ â¢ s moment has passed.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2017-05-17,"David Bowie was the most popular recording artist in the UK last year , with fans flocking to buy and listen to his music following his death .
Bowie , who died two days after his 69th birthday in January 2016 having just released his latest album Blackstar , beat perennial chart - toppers Adele and Canadian artist Drake .
The equivalent of more than 1.6 m Bowie albums were bought or streamed in the UK last year , led by purchases of Blackstar , which also helped drive vinyl record sales to a 25-year high .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere is always a huge amount of interest when a legendary artist dies so the upturn in sales will partly be down to that , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Boyd Hilton , entertainment editor at Heat magazine .
Ã¢â¬ÅBowie suddenly got loads more airplay and the Blackstar album , videos and artwork were so extraordinary anyway that they captured the publicÃ¢â¬ â¢ s imagination even more than a regular new Bowie album might.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Bowie easily outstripped Adele who ranked second , selling 1.1 m music albums - 40 % fewer - and Drake who ranked third , with 1.09 m albums sold .
Bowie clocked up 1.65 m album equivalent sales , a measurement developed by UK music industry body the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) that combines physical and digital sales of CDs and albums as well as streams in to a single figure to give the overall sales popularity of an artist .
One thousand streams of a track , or 10 downloads , are equivalent to one album sale .
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s success - which also saw signficant sales of the Best of Bowie and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars - was driven by almost 1.5 m physical and digital albums sales , 510,000 tracks downloaded and 127 m streamed .
The passing of Bowie and Prince last year fuelled a huge surge in physical and digital purchases and streams of their greatest hits and back catalogues , which the BPI estimates at equivalent to almost 2 m albums combined .
Ã¢â¬ÅThere has also been an undoubted resurgence in pop and rock nostalgia , you can see it in things like the increase in vinyl sales , perhaps due to the homogeneity of so much of the mainstream music scene , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hilton .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis has meant a perfect storm of interest in the great man [ Bowie ] and his music.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Earlier this year
the IFPI , the international music industry body , said that Bowie was the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s number two bestselling recording artist in 2016 , behind Drake .
Ã¢â¬ÅIn the old model that meant selling cartloads of greatest hits albums , in the streaming era that translates into phenomena such as David Bowie and Prince dominating streaming charts
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said music analyst Mark Mulligan .
The BPI , which released its annual yearbook All About Music on Thursday , also analysed the 10,000 most - streamed tracks last year and found that 53 % of the music favoured by music fans was more than two years old .
It also appears that albums are rapidly becoming something only older people are listening to on digital services , with more than three - quarters of streams of music coming from albums released before 2014 .
Ã¢â¬ÅIt is interesting to see that 77.2 % of album streams are pre-2014 which suggests itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s only the oldies that are using streaming to listen to albums , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Mulligan .
Ã¢â¬ÅWhat streaming is doing is redefining what is considered [ back ] catalogue .
For the instant Ã¢â¬ËI want it now generationÃ¢â¬ â¢ tracks from just three years ago are now considered catalogue .
Whether they have appetite for anything more than 10 years old is less clear .
The early signs are that this decade is far enough back for most streamers.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2017-05-18,"After a night drinking cheap Riesling and beer with soldiers , David Bowie is unsurprisingly in bed fast asleep , unaware that his friend Geoff MacCormack is photographing him on the Trans - Siberian railway .
The poignant image is one of six signed photographs to be auctioned at an entertainment memorabilia sale at Bonhams in Knightsbridge , central London .
They were all taken by MacCormack , a friend and travelling companion of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in the 1970s .
The two were on the train from Vladivostok to Moscow after the Japan leg of his Ziggy Stardust tour in 1973 .
Bowie was there partly due to his acute fear of flying , but also because he wanted to see the Soviet Union .
MacCormack described the soldiers with fondness : Ã¢â¬ÅThey were friendly and inquisitive as to what life was like in the west .
In this image , you can just make out the bleak Siberian landscape through the window.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
All the photographs were taken informally by MacCormack , not as a professional photographer but as a friend .
Another taken on the same journey shows Bowie posing as any tourist would , hands on hips in front of the train .
Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢
d only just acquired a Nikkormat , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said MacCormack .
Ã¢â¬ÅI
didnÃ¢â¬
â¢ t really know the camera at the time , and I pride myself on having got the composition right .
Ã¢â¬ÅI love that , although David clearly strikes a pose , the image still seems unguarded and natural .
David later reciprocated by taking one of me in exactly the same spot .
Believe me , mine is better!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
A third photograph was taken on the set of the 1976 Nicolas Roeg - directed film The Man Who Fell to Earth and shows a copper - haired Bowie in a white T - shirt stretching his arms in the air .
The photographs show Bowie at his most relaxed and were all signed by the musician not long before his death in 2016 .
MacCormack said Bowie loved the images .
Ã¢â¬ÅFor me , these images Ã¢â¬ Â¦ almost feel as if they belong in a family album .
They capture the sense of two mates Ã¢â¬ â one of whom just happened to have become a rock star Ã¢â¬ â having the time of their lives.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
There is a strong market for Bowie memorabilia and the newly revealed photographs offer , Bonhams said , Ã¢â¬Åa rare and honest glimpse into the then life of arguably the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most influential
artistÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
They come with estimates of between ÃÂ£2,000-ÃÂ£3,000 each and will be on display in London from 25 June before the auction on 28 June .
Also on view , although not for sale , will be a 10-minute film of the train journey to Moscow for the May Day parade which was shot by Bowie himself and has never been shown before ."
2017-05-29,"Spoiler alert :
this blog is for people watching American Gods on Starz in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK .
DonÃ¢â¬ â¢ t read on unless you have watched episode five .
Somewhere in America
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Mr WorldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s world and weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re just living in it .
Late stage capitalism made flesh ( or made weird digital blocks that can remould themselves into whatever they like , even masturbation faces ) , Mr World is the big bad of American Gods .
And this week he revealed himself to our heroes in a prelude to the battle between gods old and new that is coming soon , and just before the new season of Game of Thrones .
Mr World is played by Crispin Glover , a man who will forever be remembered as Biff TannenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s noogie partner .
In his remarkably well - preserved body , the 53-year - old still conveys the weediness of George McFly which makes him all the more compellingly creepy as a baddie .
Mr World couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t do anything physically to hurt his opponents , so he must have something truly awful going on in his mind ...
As far as we can tell , Mr World and his fellow new gods , the fabulously horrible Media and the infuriating Technical Boy , are currently ruling the roost .
They control the attention of the world .
But they are worried that at any moment the Old Gods might rise again and rekindle some of that Ã¢â¬ÅbeliefÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ stuff in a distracted but cynical people .
The Old Gods are led by Wednesday , also known as Odin or Grimnir or Widow Twankey ( going by Ian McShaneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s more colourful facial expressions this week ) .
In order to arrange a meeting with Wednesday and Shadow Moon , Mr World adopts the most convenient approach possible and grasses them up to the police for their robbery in Chicago .
They then descend on the cop shop where the pair are detained , kill everyone inside and sit down for a nice chat .
Face to face with Wednesday and Shadow , the new gods offer first an apology then a deal .
Technical Boy says sorry for lynching Shadow Ã¢â¬ â Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re in a weird place racially in this country right now and I donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t want to add to that climate of hatredÃ¢â¬ ï¿½
Ã¢â¬ â
then Mr World offers Ã¢â¬Ånot a truce , but a mergerÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
So no war then , great !
But hold on a minute , you donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t pull the wool
over OdinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eye that easily .
Wednesday listens to the spiel but smells weakness .
HeÃ¢â¬
â¢ s got Shadow on board for the fight , Anansi too after the god of black injustice heard about the lynching , and
thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s old nicotine fingers Czernobog too .
Ã¢â¬ÅInside
every oyster thereÃ¢â¬

, thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he retorts .
Interestingly though WednesdayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rejection of Mr World doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t provoke a fight but a rejoinder .
If Wednesday thinks heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so good , if he thinks the belief given by the Old Gods is better than the distraction inspired by the new , Ã¢â¬Åwhy not try giving it to them?Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ says Mr World .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a good line , as Mr World himself acknowledges , and cuts right to WednesdayÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vulnerability .
And with that , the baddies leave the building .

Personally I think it only right and proper that Shadow rejected Laura MoonÃ¢â¬
â¢ s
invitation to once again be her puppy .
Our hero spends much of this episode shaking his head in disbelief .
But he is sure of one thing though ; his wife canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t just come back from the dead and make like her adultery is forgotten .
Shadow leaves Laura in his motel room , sunk in a bath trying to keep her decomposing flesh warm .
We understand that it is the lucky coin which has reanimated her , but
itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Shadow that brings her back to life ( when they kiss , the fire she sees licking round ShadowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s body also lights up her heart ) .
Even now , therefore , when Laura seems to have appointed herself as ShadowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s protector , we canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be sure she isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t acting from selfish reasons .
Good , makes things more interesting .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve come to the decision that IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m not that interested in Mad Sweeney .
HeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s just too vulgar .
The overgrown leprechaun also shows up at the motel on the hunt for his coin and starts shouting abuse at Laura , who promptly smacks him in the face and breaks his finger ( itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not the best assault of the week though Ã¢â¬ â
that goes to MediaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s digital kiss , the one she blows at Technical Boy and pops him several times in the jaw ) .
Laura then refuses to return the coin to Sweeney , having correctly surmised that he can not take it from her .
As was pointed out in the comments a couple of weeks back , and was originally missed by me , Sweeney is not having the best of luck without his coin .
Soon after his altercation with Laura he is detained for assaulting her corpse and ends the episode trying to escape from a cop car and jagging his balls on a broken window .
Sound and vision
This weekÃ¢â¬ â¢ s audiovisual pyrotechnics include Mr WorldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s masturbation face , MediaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s kiss , and then her reinvention as first Ziggy Stardust then Marilyn Monroe ( the Bowie Ã¢â¬Åoh ohhhsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to accompany the former were a particularly nice touch ) .
The most impressive bit of all however was the prologue , which told the tale of Ã¢â¬ â please forgive my transcription
Ã¢â¬
â Ã¢â¬ÅNannu NinniÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ , an Old God of prehistoric Siberia .
We watch as NannuÃ¢â¬ â¢ s people cross into America , only to be confronted and co - opted by a Native American tribe .
At this point Nannu Ninni goes the way of many Gods and dies , forgotten .
Coloured icy blue , the scene is reminiscent of action north of the wall in GoT. Except itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all performed by puppets ( or CGI versions thereof ) .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure some of you will know precisely which animators created this wonderful vignette
, I confess I do not , but it was another brave , creative move by Bryan Fuller .
Divine lines
Ã¢â¬ÅYou know what they say about grief .

Ã¢â¬ÅYouÃ¢â¬ â¢ re a rugged individualist and that simply doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t work any more .
Brands , sure , are a useful heuristic but ultimately everything is all systems interlaced , a single product manufactured by a single company for a single market.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Mr World giving it full Zizek .
Some questions for you Ã¢â¬Â¢
This coin Ã¢â¬ â is it a Viking one from the very opening scene of the series ?
Ã¢â¬Â¢ If LauraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s flesh falls off , as predicted by Sweeney , will she be any more dead than she is now ?
Would it not still be her coin ?
Ã¢â¬Â¢
Who is that wood baddy who appears in the cop shop and starts grabbing at Shadow ?
Ã¢â¬Â¢ WhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s in LauraÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Ã¢â¬ÅJane DoeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ bag ?
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s not evidence KRG 13 is it ?"
2017-06-14,"With the obvious exception of the Beatles , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s hard to think of many acts who have had such influence on popular culture as Kraftwerk .
The German electronic pioneers have left their fingerprints on genres from electropop to Detroit techno to hip - hop and EDM .
Artists from New Order to Madonna have sampled them ; David Bowie named his song V2-Schneider after one of the founder members , and Coldplay had a whopping hit using one of their melodies .
Today , the way most of our pop music sounds and is made owes much to KraftwerkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1970s ideal of a marriage of humanity and machine .
Meanwhile , the technological world Kraftwerk envisaged is around us .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mind - boggling to think they were singing about Computer Love Ã¢â¬
â the idea of lonely souls finding each other via electronic communications Ã¢â¬ â decades before we even had the world wide web , never mind internet dating .
How improbable all this must have seemed in 1975 , when they appeared on the TV science programme
TomorrowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s World looking like accountants chuckling at some secret but hilarious in - joke , playing silver foil pads with electronic knitting needles .
However , they were so far ahead that in recent decades the big problem has been what to do now that everyone else is catching up .
Thus , in the absence of a new studio album since 2003 , KraftwerkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s innovation currently is in terms of presentation .
Their biggest UK tour in 25 years is promoting 3-D :
The Catalogue , an eight - album box set of live concerts with 3D visuals performed in contemporary art galleries .
The Philharmonic Hall is more of a classical / pop venue , but this show is as much a visual art presentation as a gig .
Each audience member is given a pair of 3D glasses , and a succession of images , from home computers to showers of musical notes , hurtle from the stage .
During the opener , Numbers , someone actually ducks , fearful of losing their head to a flying figure 7 .
With the four band members squeezed into neoprene / LED body suits , playing neon - lit consoles , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s so removed from the regular pop experience that watching it feels like being a child taken to the cinema for the first time .
There are squeals of delight during Spacelab , when a 3D craft is first pictured flying over Liverpool and then actually Ã¢â¬ÅlandsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ right outside the venue .
The 1974 hit Autobahn Ã¢â¬ â a Germanic answer to the Beach Boys Ã¢â¬ â time travels between nostalgic images of old - fashioned motoring , complete with empty roads , and a looming utopia of driverless cars .
When a vintage Volkswagen Beetle Ã¢â¬ÅdrivesÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ from the screen over the audience
, one poor chap is so overcome that he stands and raises his arms to the ceiling , as if worshipping a deity .
KraftwerkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s oeuvre has always been such dry , wry eulogies to technology , with a quaint , elegiac , almost nostalgic quality , but their ageing songs now undergo constant evolution .
This two - hour odyssey sees songs extended , reworked and given new funky sections .
Later material , in particular , is rebooted with such ear - battering sub - bass that large sections of the gig feel like a futurist rave .
Some tunes take on meanings they never had on release : 1981Ã¢â¬ â¢ s Computer World seems to have anticipated the sinister power of big data ;
1976Ã¢â¬ â¢ s
Radioactivity , originally an ode to radio waves and radiation , has become a hymn for the victims of nuclear disasters , from Sellafield to Chernobyl to Fukushima .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s eerily moving when Ralf
HÃÂ¼tter sings part of it in Japanese .
Their 1982 hit The Model is delivered virtually as it was recorded , presumably because there is no need to tamper with pop perfection .
Throughout , the four human musicians stare at their gadgetry so impassively they could be watching Coronation Street on the sly .
However , a couple of brief but telling musical malfunctions give short shrift to any suspicions that everything is pre - programmed .
Ã¢â¬ÅAll right!Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ sniggers
HÃÂ¼tter , his face registering a rare grin .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis was a failure of electricity.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The ageless , cycling - trim 70-year - old is now the sole surviving member from the 70s lineup .
When all the musicians are replaced by lifesize , moving android replicas for The Robots , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a taster of an idea they first mooted back then :
that when they are all gone , the machines will perform the music .
But until that happens , KraftwerkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s intrinsic humanity seems more striking as the world becomes more computerised and remote .
HÃÂ¼tter sings the shimmering Neon Lights so beautifully , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s as if he is humbled by the power of nocturnal urban cathode rays for the first time .
And he is palpably touched by the crowdÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rapturous ovation for his lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work .
When he strides forward and touches his heart , he seems to recognise something that has been implicit all along : the core of the man - machine is an emotional soul .

2017-06-15,"David Bowie has been honoured with a commemorative blue plaque outside the Soho studios where he recorded Hunky Dory and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars .
The plaque is one of 47 being installed around he country as part of BBC Music Day , which pays tribute to those who have shaped BritainÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musical landscape .
Bowie , who died of cancer in January last year , has been honoured with three plaques : in Soho , central London ; Maidstone , Kent ; and Hull .
The BBC Radio London presenter Robert Elms described Bowie as Ã¢â¬Åone of our most shining sonsÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ , and said it was fitting Ã¢â¬Åthat we should honour him here in Soho , the centre of our creative worldÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
SohoÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Trident Studios shut its doors in 1981 , after recording some of the biggest names in music .
The Bee Gees , the Rolling Stones , Queen , Lou Reed and Frank Zappa were among those who graced the hallowed studios ; The Beatles recorded Hey Jude there in 1968 .
The Soho plaque was one of three unveiled on Thursday in places considered pivotal to BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s life and career .
The Royal Star Hotel Ã¢â¬ â now
the Royal Star Arcade Ã¢â¬ â in Maidstone , Kent , where Bowie regularly played as part of his early band the Manish Boys , was given a blue plaque , as was HullÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Paragon station , in honour of the Spiders from Mars ,
BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s influential backing band , who hail from the city .
The Trident Studios plaque was unveiled by Billy Bragg , and BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lifelong friend , painter and designer George Underwood .
Bragg said : Ã¢â¬ÅDavid Bowie was the greatest of the London boys that came out of the 60s .
In 1971 he turned into something strange and curious - Ziggy Stardust .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s great to commemorate this spot with a blue plaque , so that everyone who loves these records can gaze up in wonder at Trident Studios.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ Underwood said : Ã¢â¬ÅI remember going in and out of Trident Studios when David was recording , as he often liked company in the studio .
Knowing David he would be pleased about the plaque but he would also make a witty remark about it .
IÃ¢â¬ â¢ m sure heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d be very chuffed.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
In Hull , the task fell to Spiders from Mars drummer Mick Ã¢â¬ÅWoodyÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ Woodmansey , who said he was Ã¢â¬Åso
proudÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to be unveiling the plaque in this yearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s City of Culture .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe only downside is that Mick and Trevor couldnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t be standing here with me , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
he said of his fellow bandmates .
Ã¢â¬ÅWe set off from Paragon station on lots of trips .
I first met Mick here in 1968 , I think it was .
We hit it off , we formed a band , and Ã¢â¬ Â¦
Bowie was smart enough to pick three lads from Hull to help him create whatÃ¢â¬ â¢
s become one of his most iconic periods of music.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"

The male vocalists sing from ParkerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s point of view :

An unexpected triumph ."
2017-07-08,"Earl Slick played guitar on stage for David Bowie , on and off for 40 years , so he has some insight into the psychology of being a sideman Ã¢â¬ â a professional musician in the service of a big ego .
Ã¢â¬ÅMost of the time weÃ¢â¬ â¢ re invisible , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he says .
Ã¢â¬ÅGhosts at the top table.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Slick took an unusual leading role in RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ Roll Guns for Hire :
The Story of the Sideman ( BBC4 ) , exploring what it takes Ã¢â¬ â and what it means Ã¢â¬ â to have a career based on facilitating someone elseÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vision .
Even in this he was overshadowed , as big names offered their perfect sidemanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s job description .
Ã¢â¬ÅThe better you are at your job , the less people will notice you , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Keith Richards .
Ã¢â¬ÅAnd thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the whole point.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In fact , all of the Rolling Stones turned out to heap measured praise on Bernard Fowler , their long - serving back - up singer , arranger and person in charge of remembering how all the songs go .
The Stones seem utterly reliant on him .
We were also introduced to Wendy and Lisa of Prince and the Revolution fame ; Crystal Taliefero , who played just about everything for Billy Joel ; and legendary Stax guitarist Steve Cropper , whose co - writing credits on a string of hits make him a rare creature Ã¢â¬ â a sideman with a pension .
Sidefolk , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s clear , have to put up with a lot of nonsense .
Rock stars seem terribly keen on summoning people in circumstances shrouded in mystery : youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re told to go to the airport without being informed of your destination , and you end up in a studio in London , where Mick Jagger walks in and says heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s looking forward to working with you .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s like auditioning for Dr Evil .
At 90 minutes , this was too long by half an hour
Ã¢â¬

we spent a lot of time learning what they were up to these days
Ã¢â¬ â
but it was still a frank and fascinating glimpse into an overlooked profession .

That would make a brilliant part two ."
2017-07-11,"LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy has said that David Bowie convinced him to re - form the band after they split up in 2011 .
Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC 6 Music , Murphy , who played percussion on BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final album Blackstar , said : Ã¢â¬ÅI spent a good amount of time with David Bowie , and I was talking about getting the band back together .
He said , Ã¢â¬ËDoes it make you uncomfortable?Ã¢â¬ â¢
I said Ã¢â¬ËYeahÃ¢â¬ â¢ , and he said , Ã¢â¬ËGood Ã¢â¬ â it should .
You should be uncomfortableÃ¢â¬ â¢ Ã¢â¬ Â¦ David was always making himself uncomfortable.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
Despite an emphatic goodbye involving a documentary film and a show at New YorkÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Madison Square Garden , LCD Soundsystem have indeed since re - formed , releasing two new songs this year ahead of an album in September .
Murphy also recently said in an interview with Annie Mac on Radio 1 that he had been earmarked by Tony Visconti as a co - producer on Blackstar but turned the role down .
Ã¢â¬ÅI played a little percussion .
I was supposed to do a lot more , but I got overwhelmed Ã¢â¬ Â¦
It takes a different kind of person than me to walk into that room and be like ,
I belong here , I should definitely insert myself in this relationship because they just canÃ¢â¬ â¢ t manage to make a record without me.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½"
2017-07-13,"David Bowie and Queen recorded a whole batch of songs that have never been released , according to a former roadie .
The tantalising prospect of a hidden cache of recordings by such huge rock stars has been revealed by Peter Hince , who was head of QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s road crew when the band and Bowie collaborated on their hit song , Under Pressure , in 1981 .
He has disclosed that there was Ã¢â¬Åother material Queen recorded with Bowie that never got releasedÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He was in the studio with them when they performed and recorded it .
The revelation will be published in a forthcoming book on Bowie by Neil Cossar , a music historian .
In one passage , Hince recalls : Ã¢â¬ÅThey Ã¢â¬ Â¦ performed some original songs they did together and also covers .
They were just jamming in the studio and it all got recorded Ã¢â¬
â
All the Young Dudes , All the Way from Memphis and various rock classics.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Speaking to the Guardian on Wednesday , Hince said there was no question that the recordings exist .
Bowie died of cancer last year aged 69 and QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s lead singer , Freddie Mercury , died in 1991 aged 45 , barely 24 hours after he confirmed he had Aids .
Hince said of the unreleased recordings : Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s stuff with Freddie and David singing together
Ã¢â¬ â
proper full - length rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll tracks Ã¢â¬ Â¦ Raw , but good.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s estate and QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s management declined to comment , but HinceÃ¢â¬ â¢ s recollections are given credence by a throwaway remark made by QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s guitarist , Brian May , last month .
In an interview with Mojo to promote his new book , Queen in 3-D , May recalled how Ã¢â¬ÅFreddie and David locked hornsÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ while recording Under Pressure , but that such things happen in a studio .
Ã¢â¬ÅSparks fly and thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s why it turned out so great.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
He added : Ã¢â¬ÅNot all of what we did in those sessions has ever come to light , so thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a thought.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
The recording sessions took place at QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s
Mountain Studios in Montreux , Switzerland , near BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s home in Vevey .
Hince said QueenÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drummer , Roger Taylor , as one of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s greatest fans had invited the singer over and that when he arrived , there was clearly Ã¢â¬Åmutual admirationÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
They began making music together , he recalled .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey just started knocking things around .
They did cover versions [ and ] a few of their own things
Ã¢â¬
Â¦
They came back the next day and then recorded what eventually became Under Pressure
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
Ã¢â¬ÅBut there were other things recorded during that period , which were never finished or mixed .
David did vocals on some of the other tracks which ended up not being used .
So somewhere there is an archive.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The material goes beyond their Cool Cat recording , which originally featured BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s vocals , he added : Ã¢â¬ÅI was in the studio with them .
It was all quite spontaneous .
It was one of those rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll moments .
They were just fooling around and played each other songs .
Certainly , there were other tracks recorded with Queen and Bowie , and Freddie singing , which were never released .
Pretty raw , but original material definitely .
They were just incredibly spontaneous , good musicians .
Ã¢â¬ÅI can categorically say I know that there were complete tracks , not mixed tracks , but fully formed songs that were done .
Does it belong to the David Bowie estate or to Queen ?
ThatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s probably part of the reason these things have never come to light.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
Hince knew Bowie well , having worked as one of his roadies Ã¢â¬Åin the Ziggy and Diamond Dogs daysÃ¢â¬
ï¿½ :
Ã¢â¬ÅDavid and Freddie were totally different people .
David was quite quiet .
He would never scream and shout if things went wrong .
He never played the prima donna .
Privately , Freddie was quite quiet .
But if things werenÃ¢â¬ â¢ t going his way , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ d let you know in no uncertain terms.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
In 1986 , after more than a decade as head of their road crew , Hince left Queen to pursue his other passion , photography .
Asked whether he was aware of unreleased recordings until now , Cossar said : Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬ â¢ m a music historian and IÃ¢â¬ â¢ d never heard that story before.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ CossarÃ¢â¬ â¢ s book , David Bowie :
I Was There , featuring recollections of the starÃ¢â¬ â¢

Almeida theatre , N1 , 23 July 2 Nina :
A Story About Me and Nina Simone Created by Josette Bushell - Mingo ,
this deeply personal and searingly angry one - woman show takes the life and songs of singer and activist Nina Simone and asks pressing questions about why change is happening so slowly and whether it is possible to use your voice to start a revolution .
Bushell - Mingo is certainly using hers and this challenging piece of theatre quite rightly doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t shirk the big questions , including how we got to a point where we have to say that Black Lives Matter .

Icke includes Bob Dylan and Laura Marling on the soundtrack but this isnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t simply a cool , contemporary reading of the play ; rather , it is an evening of unhurried substance .
Snap up tickets up while you can because Scott once again proves he is one of the most mesmerising stage actors we have .

2017-07-23,"Named after David BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s final masterpiece , Black Star gelato combines chestnut ice - cream with dark chocolate ganache and a finish of cream flavoured with the smoke of a Cuban cigar .
It is the creation of young Italian chef Ã¢â¬ â and Bowie superfan Ã¢â¬ â Angelika Kaswalder , and sold in her ice - cream parlour Cuore di Vetro on Max - Beer - Strasse in BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Mitte district .
A scoop costs Ã¢âÂ¬1.60 , a small price for conceptual art in a cone .
Kaswalder considers herself an artisan .
Her gelato range is made fresh each day depending on what fruit and other ingredients are in season .
She can be seen at work through the glass wall of the kitchen , or Ã¢â¬ÅlaboratoryÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ as she calls it .
Co - owner Guido Dorigo , who has the finest goth hairdo this side of 1985 , is out front on scooping duty .
The parlour is famed for its pistachio flavour , last year voted the best ice - cream in the German capital .
Those wishing to pay homage to Bowie ( in the city where he made some of his greatest music ) but who donÃ¢â¬ â¢ t fancy the taste of cigar smoke might prefer White Duke Ã¢â¬ â Sicilian almond topped with organic peach jam .
Also available is mint chocolate
8ÃÂ½ , named for Federico FelliniÃ¢â¬ â¢ s 1963 film , but with a cheeky nod to After Eights .
Cuore di Vetro , which puts on live music and art shows in an upstairs room , is a favourite hang - out for BerlinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s musicians , including confrontational industrial band EinstÃÂ¼rzende Neubauten .
They may seem unlikely ice - cream devotees , but apparently after a hard day bashing out rhythms on instruments made from scrap metal , a scoop of vegan chocolate eis is just the thing ."
2017-07-23,"If you called up central casting and asked for the archetypal hedonistic drug - guzzling 1970s music photographer , the chances are you would get someone who looked a lot like Mick Rock .
All attenuated , gangly limbs , anarchic hair and perma - grafted sunglasses , this is the man who , through his celebrated shots of David Bowie , Iggy Pop , Lou Reed , Syd Barrett , Queen and Debbie
Harry Ã¢â¬ â
the list seems endless Ã¢â¬ â just about single - handedly shaped the visual history of the music of the 70s and 80s .
But whatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s astonishing is not so much the sheer volume of RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s work and his Zelig - like ability to pop up on the periphery of every happening scene in the 70s ; itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s how much he remembers , despite a narcotics consumption that turned his body into a chemical disaster area to rival Bhopal .
The strengths of this immensely entertaining debut documentary feature by Barney Clay are twofold .
First , through stylised visuals Ã¢â¬ â a huge lightbox is a striking central motif Ã¢â¬ â the film pays tribute to the heightened drama of RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s photography .
Second , apart from a few taped backstage conversations with Bowie and Reed , RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s is the only voice we hear .
This approach , employed so effectively in Noah Baumbach and Jake PaltrowÃ¢â¬ â¢ s De Palma , cuts through the platitudinous waffle of talking heads and straight to the meat of story .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a technique that only works when the central voice is fluid and distinctive but , fortunately , Rock is a terrific subject .
While De Palma approached his anecdotes like a maniac with a hammer , RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s laconic drawl drifts like smoke .
He combines poetry , the profane and the prosaic to delicious effect .
One moment heÃ¢â¬

name - dropping Rimbaud and delivering lines such as : Ã¢â¬ÅPhotography wandered idly into my life.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
The next , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s deploying quaint Britishisms such as Ã¢â¬Åwhoopsadaisy!Ã¢â¬
ï¿½ ( his response to combining LSD with kundalini yoga ) and describing Iggy Pop as a Ã¢â¬Åfucking iguanaÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
RockÃ¢â¬ â¢ s wildest years Ã¢â¬ â both the man and the music Ã¢â¬ â swirl together into a psychedelic maelstrom of pills , pictures and brilliantly creative swearing ."
2017-08-14,"David Lynch has paid tribute to David Bowie in his drama series Twin Peaks , dedicating the most recent episode to the late singer .
Bowie briefly appeared in Twin Peaks :
Fire Walk With Me , the 1992 film prequel to the cult TV series , as the dapper - suited , mentally fraught FBI agent Phillip Jeffries .
According to Harry Goaz , who plays Andy Brennan , Bowie was due to appear in the current series of the show , but didnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t film his scenes before his death .
Lynch nevertheless included him in the latest episode , using Fire Walk With Me footage in a dream sequence .
The appearance puts Bowie in the company of numerous other musical guest stars in the current series , including Moby , Nine Inch Nails , Sky Ferreira and Hudson Mohawke ."
2017-08-14,"As a contemporary of David Bowie at Bromley technical high school , I read Hanif KureishiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s article with interest ( Review , 12 August ) .
Possibly it was a Ã¢â¬ÅshitholeÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ in KureishiÃ¢â¬ â¢ s time , 10 years after Bowie , but it wasnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t in ours ; not a great school , but more than adequate judged by the standards of the time .
The claim that all the teachers were incompetent with the exception of the art master is stupid .
Some were hopeless , some OK and a few inspirational Ã¢â¬ â pretty normal in those days .
As for the implication that it was a sink school for the working and lower - middle classes is inaccurate , it was a bastion of suburban bourgeoisie when Bowie was there .

traducing of BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s secondary education does a disservice to a model that allowed children who had not gained entry to a grammar school at 11 to progress to a university education if they so desired .

2017-08-14,"Spoiler alert :
this blog is for Twin Peaks viewers who have seen episode 14 of The Return , showing on Showtime on the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK .
Do not read on unless you have watched .
Ã¢â¬ËWeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re like the dreamer who dreams and then lives inside the dream .
But who is the dreamer?Ã¢â¬ â¢
It was always too much to dream that David Bowie had reprised his role as the FBIÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Phillip Jeffries before his death Ã¢â¬ â and that all involved had managed to keep a lid on it .
Instead , Twin Peaks acknowledged his absence in the most tasteful way possible , using archive footage from Fire Walk With Me in GordonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s dream sequence .
It was bittersweet , making us miss
Bowie all the more , but of course it offered no answers .
This was the week the show indulged the reality of its narratives being all over the place more than ever .
Stories , dreams , tall tales , memories and the misremembered Ã¢â¬ Â¦ what , Lynch and Frost ask amid this collection of unreliable narrators , is really the difference ?
So Lynch toys with us by having Director Gordon ( himself ) resort to solving cases via his dreams about screen siren Monica Bellucci ( herself ) .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s becoming less and less clear who can be taken at their word Ã¢â¬
â
but while you could hardly accuse part 14 of clarity , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s no slouch when it comes to revelations .
Most significant is the discovery that Diane and Jayne - E are half - sisters , with little love lost .
Laura DernÃ¢â¬ â¢ s FBI veteran has been painted so on - the - nose disreputable , all cigarettes and builderÃ¢â¬ â¢ s mouth , that she was always going to end up one of the most virtuous individuals in this whole business , now serving as a direct counterpoint to Naomi WattsÃ¢â¬ â¢ manipulative Stepford Wife .
HereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the thing .
In one sense , thereÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a hell of a lot going on this week .
People are starting to cotton on to the reality of two Coopers , secrets of Blue Rose are coming to the surface , the Giant is named as the Fireman , the vortex returns and Sarah Palmer bites a manÃ¢â¬ â¢ s face off .
But at the same time , itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s those on the fringes who dominate .
Andy from the sheriffÃ¢â¬ â¢ s office had hardly been one of lifeÃ¢â¬ â¢ s winners , yet here he is , chosen by the Fireman for a trip to his realm and gifted a recap of the entire Twin Peaks mythology before emerging back in the forest somehow wiser , somehow instinctively knowing how to protect the eyeless lady .
And yet Ã¢â¬
Â¦ if Andy was not a character you would have predicted to be pivotal , spending so long with British Freddie telling the tall tale of the green glove to James Hurley was even more unlikely .
Until you realise , whatever the FiremanÃ¢â¬ â¢ s motives , heÃ¢â¬ â¢ s all about the little guy .
In a world so corrupted , this controlling hand seems preoccupied with the innocent .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ re all stories in the end .
And some peopleÃ¢â¬ â¢ s are bigger than they realise .
Ã¢â¬ËWhatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s your motherÃ¢â¬ â¢ s name?Ã¢â¬ â¢ Speaking of those on the periphery , we close once again at the Roadhouse with more people we donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know talking about other people we donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t know .
This last interaction , between TinaÃ¢â¬ â¢ s daughter and David LynchÃ¢â¬ â¢ s actual wife Emily Stofle , is notable not least because itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the only allusion to whateverÃ¢â¬ â¢ s going on with Audrey and whatever happened to Billy Ã¢â¬ â apparently scaling a six - foot fence to get away from somebody .
Bringing back a character that iconic then just forgetting her would be more cause for criticism for a show with less characters to juggle .
WeÃ¢â¬ â¢ ve all now surely given up thinking theyÃ¢â¬
â¢ ll ever tie this up in four hours .
But perhaps thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s the point .
Twin Peaks should have tied up the moment
Laura PalmerÃ¢â¬ â¢
s murder was solved , and yet here these people still are , in their different ways still governed by that terrible event .
Because life doesnÃ¢â¬ â¢ t tie up either .
In that sense , Twin Peaks is possibly the most true - to - life show on television .
Peaks and troughs Ã¢â¬Â¢ Gordon Cole moment of the week ?
The hearing aid , obviously the hearing aid .
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Talking of the small moments that make this show sing Ã¢â¬ â the Las Vegas FBI chief losing it with his clueless colleague was basically everything .

2017-08-30,"The Pink Floyd exhibition is on track to becoming the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s most visited music show , outdoing even David Bowie .
The gallery announced on Wednesday that ticket demand was so great that it would extend the exhibition by two weeks and fully expected it to exceed the visitor figures for Bowie .
The Bowie retrospective , staged in 2013 , three years before his death , attracted 311,000 visitors .
Pink Floyd :
Their Mortal Remains has already reached the 300,000 mark and will now close on 15 October .
It tells the story of a band that rewrote the rules of rock music performance and repeatedly pushed artistic boundaries , but whose members were always somewhat reluctant rock stars .
The V&amp;A curator Victoria Broackes , who also worked on the Bowie show , said the exhibition had been a Ã¢â¬Åmassive collaboration between the V&amp;A and Pink Floyd Ã¢â¬ Â¦ the band members , particularly Nick Mason , but notably the creative individuals , designers and architects they have worked with over many years .
Ã¢â¬ÅThat combination of authentic staging , amazing sound , rockÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ roll spectacle and the V&amp;A has really shone through in the success of the exhibition and the popularity with not just fans , but with a diverse audience of all ages.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Blockbusting exhibitions exploring rock and pop have become an important part of what the V&amp;A does since the success of a Kylie Minogue show in 2007 .
Some have sniffily accused the gallery of dumbing down .
The V&amp;A argues that performance and music are a key part of what the institution is and has always been .
Broackes said : Ã¢â¬ÅThe fusion of music , theatre , design and performance which the band excelled at throughout their entire career makes them ideal for an exhibition at the V&amp;A.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ Pink Floyd may well beat the Bowie numbers at the V&amp;A in London but it will have to go some way to beat the global success of the Bowie show , which has toured venues across the world and attracted in excess of 1.5 million visitors .
That makes it the most visited show in the V&amp;AÃ¢â¬ â¢ s history .
The most visited exhibition at the V&amp;A in London remains a retrospective of the work of the fashion designer Alexander McQueen , which attracted a remarkable 480,000 visitors over its 21-week run in 2015 .
After that it is Art Deco , which attracted 359,000 in 2003 , and wedding dresses in 2014 , which had 316,000 visitors ."
2017-08-31,"ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s rare to find a club - ready rapper who cites Joy Division and David Bowie as influences , but then , Vince Staples is a rare kind of rapper .
With a prolific release schedule that has seen the 23-year - old Californian release six wildly disparate album - length projects in the space of five years ( two of which were produced by long - time Kanye West collaborator No ID ) , Staples has deliberately emulated BowieÃ¢â¬ â¢ s habit of reinvention by refusing to make anything close to the same record twice .
The result is back - to - back albums that have Ã¢â¬ â for better or worse Ã¢â¬ â relentlessly pushed forward , wilfully switching between weird , sluggish guitars , dancefloor electronica and glistening hip - hop .
Tonight , for a rowdy , hyped - up London crowd , Staples forgets the deviations and delivers the hits .
ItÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a gloriously no - frills set .
Silhouetted against a washed - out orange - red screen
Ã¢â¬ â one of his few concessions to production Ã¢â¬
â
he carries an hour - long show single - handed .
Predominantly drawing on his two most accessible works , the Def Jam albums released in 2015 and 2017 , Staples brings a mix of euphoria and cynicism that has the youthful crowd in a state of near - permanent mosh pit .
His scope is displayed in the opening track , the deceptive party anthem Party People , which flicks from faux - dumb choruses of :
Ã¢â¬ÅParty people I like to see you danceÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ to bleak verses that note : Ã¢â¬ÅI see black cats on the daytime news /
With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue.Ã¢â¬
ï¿½
This is Staples to a T ; good - time couplets parroted from the lexicon of old skool hip - hop undercut by jagged bursts of racial reality .
On the stage , Staples matches this dichotomy with a physicality that burns hot and cold ; flinging his limbs out and leaping the stage like a gleeful , vindictive sprite , before standing limp , vulnerable and alone in the blank glare of the lights .
Tracks from current record Big Fish Theory prove to be hugely popular , their skittering drumÃ¢â¬ â¢ nÃ¢â¬ â¢ bass clearly indebted to 90s UK rave .
In particular , the clacking two - step of Crabs in the Bucket manages to sound like Mike Skinner reconfigured for Hollywood .
But itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on cuts drawn from the booming rap of his earlier work that Staples really delivers . Ã¢â¬ÅFight between my conscience / and the skin thatÃ¢â¬ â¢ s on my body , man , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he agonises on Lift Me Up as the set draws to a close .
Ã¢â¬ÅI need to fight the power / but I need that new Ferrari , man.Ã¢â¬ ï¿½
If the moshing crowd are phased by this contradiction between materialism and conscience they donÃ¢â¬
â¢ t show it for a moment .
Staples surveys them , his body a momentary comma of mournful calm , before he flings himself back into the party ."
2017-09-03,"Pattering in the footsteps of David Bowie and Pink Floyd , the Bear of Very Little Brain is heading for the Victoria and Albert museum ( V&amp;A ) to star in its first exhibition celebrating the most famous bear in literary history , Winnie - the - Pooh .
The museum has been on a roll , with record visitor numbers for the giant rock music exhibitions , but Winnie - the - Pooh : Exploring a Classic will be the first in the main museum targeted at families with young children .
It will have playful settings by Tom Piper , the designer whose torrent of red ceramic poppies brought crowds to the Tower of London in the centenary year of the first world war .
The exhibition will be the largest to date on the bear and his friends from the 100 Aker Wood , and will bring together loans from other collections including a Winnie - the - Pooh tea service presented to the young Princess Elizabeth , coming from the Royal Collection , original illustrations , letters , photographs , manuscripts , and the museumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s own delicate pencil sketches by EH Shepard for the beloved characters , which are so fragile they have not been exhibited for 40 years .
There will of course also be hunny from very distinguished bees Ã¢â¬ â from the hives on the roof of the museum .
The museumÃ¢â¬ â¢ s director , Tristram Hunt , said the V&amp;A , which houses
the worldÃ¢â¬ â¢ s largest collection of Shepard drawings , was the perfect home for the exhibition .
Ã¢â¬ÅThis is our first exhibition specifically for younger families and we look forward to welcoming another generation into AA MilneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s magical , intimate , joyous world , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said .
The museum will look at the links between MilneÃ¢â¬ â¢ s characters and the real world , most famously his own son , Christopher Robin , whose life was haunted by his alter ego .
In adult life he recalled that he hated the girlish clothes and long hair his mother kept him in , that he learned to box to cope with bullying at school , and that his father Ã¢â¬ â apart from the stories Ã¢â¬ â was Ã¢â¬Ånot good with childrenÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
He died in 1996 .
Winnie - the - Pooh was inspired by bedtime stories about Christopher RobinÃ¢â¬
â¢ s bear Edward , and Shepard studied the toys and the trees in Ashdown Forest near their home to create his enduring images .
When We Were Very Young , a collection of poems , came out in 1924 soon after Christopher RobinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s fourth birthday : the initial edition was 5,000 copies , but it had to be rapidly reprinted as 44,000 copies sold in the first eight weeks .
Winnie - the - Pooh followed in 1926 .
Together with the second book of poems and The House at Pooh Corner , the books have since sold millions of copies in every language including Latin and Esperanto .
The exhibition will also feature many objects drawn from 90 years of merchandising , including toys and games , ceramics and textiles , and from the Walt Disney animations that almost overshadowed the originals .
Many self - help books have appeared inspired by the bearÃ¢â¬ â¢ s apparently simple approach to life : one aphorism , captured in a Shepard illustration in the museum collection , is Ã¢â¬ÅWhen you go after honey with a balloon , the great thing is not to let the bees know youÃ¢â¬ â¢ re comingÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
In one poll the public voted Winnie - the - Pooh the greatest philosopher of all time , and the 19th anniversary of his creation was marked with a talking Ã¢â¬ÅThotful SpotÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ bench installed at sites including the real wood and near the statue of Confucius at KingÃ¢â¬ â¢ s College London .
Milne , already a successful playwright , first met Shepard when they were both working on Punch magazine .
The origins of their most successful joint creation lay in the teddy bear bought from Harrods by his parents for Christopher RobinÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first birthday , but the final version of ShepardÃ¢â¬ â¢ s drawings looked more like his own sonÃ¢â¬ â¢ s bear , a Steiff teddy called Growler .
The name Winnie - the - Pooh ( always hyphenated ) was inspired by Winnie , a bear at London zoo that fascinated the child , and the setting for the stories came when in 1925 the Milnes bought a large house , Cotchford Farm , on the edge of the 500 acres of Ashford Forest .
The house has a bleaker fascination for a very different group of fans : it was later the home of Brian Jones , a founder member of the Rolling Stones , who drowned in the swimming pool there in 1969 .

2017-09-11,"LCD Soundsystem have reached the top of the US charts for the first time with their new record American Dream .
The cult New York act , who blend literate , self - reflexive lyrics with disco pulses , announced their retirement in 2011 with a show at Madison Square Gardens .
They reformed this year , partly inspired by David Bowie , who told frontman James Murphy that he should embrace his discomfort over getting the band back together .
The No 1 record comes a decade on from Murphy attempting to score a No 1 with their second album Sound of Silver .
He asked fans to buy the album in the first week of release , so as to send it to No 1 Ã¢â¬ â in the end , the 15,000 copies sold in the first week were only enough to send it to No 46 .

2017-09-19,"The Roundhouse in north London could be called a place that has seen it all .
It was the venue for the DoorsÃ¢â¬ â¢ first London concert in 1968 , concerts for David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix and a Spiral Tribe rave in 1991 .
But , last night , there was something different :
Tommy HilfigerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s first London fashion show for 20 years .
It ensured London fashion week finished with a bang Ã¢â¬ â thanks to Gigi Hadid .
Hadid , with her 37.5 m Instagram followers , was the superstar guest that Ã¢â¬ â were this a rock concert Ã¢â¬ â would provoke the screams from the crowd when she opened the show .

s
choice of the Roundhouse as a venue recalls the 66-year - old US designerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s early experiences of seeking inspiration in the British capital .
Ã¢â¬ÅI started to come to London when I was a teen because I wanted to explore the whole lifestyle
and I was obsessed with fashion
, Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ he said this week .
He found flair in British bands of the period Ã¢â¬ â naming the Beatles , Led Zeppelin , the Who , Eric Clapton and Small Faces as influences .
Ã¢â¬ÅThey had a sense of style that was very different to anyone else , Ã¢â¬ ï¿½ said Hilfiger .
Subtitled Tommy
Now : Rock Circus , the theme was Ã¢â¬ â to use an appropriate term
Ã¢â¬ â turned up to 11 : guests walked through the backstage entrance of the 1,700 capacity venue , flanked by roadie cases .
The audience was A list : it included Lewis Hamilton , Neymar and Sir Philip Green .
The after party featured circus performers and a turn from the Chainsmokers , the band that music journalists love to hate but have ability to take on the might of Ed Sheeran in the top 10 .
This was part living breathing advertising campaign , part shop window , part concert ,
part movie Ã¢â¬ â
it was streamed live online .
While the clothes were something of a footnote to this extravaganza , they fitted in the theme too .
With heavy metal style logos , hoodies and biker jackets , they looked like merchandise for a rock show .
The show featured the designerÃ¢â¬ â¢ s collaboration with Hadid along with the main collection .
Other pieces included preppy checks , over the knee socks , oversized T - shirts and track suits .
The colour palette was unmistakably American : red , white and blue reigned supreme .
The collection was available immediately after the show Ã¢â¬ â explaining why there were also beanies and padded jackets included .
Hilfiger is a proponent of the so - called See Now Buy Now model , when clothes can be bought effectively off the runway .
Last season , the jeans wore by Hadid sold out before the show finished .
As well as finding them on the website this time around , consumers can buy on social media channels Ã¢â¬ â with a Ã¢â¬Ëclick - to - buyÃ¢â¬ â¢ function on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Snapchat , allowing customers to Ã¢â¬ËsnapshopÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
Hilfiger was an early adopter of social media in fashion .
Through live streaming , he opens out the experience of a show - once a behind - closed - doors world - to consumers .
A caption on the brandÃ¢â¬ â¢ s Instagram advertising the livestream as Ã¢â¬ÅTHE event of the seasonÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ read Ã¢â¬Åwe saved you a seatÃ¢â¬ ï¿½ .
This strategy works .
Tommy Hilfiger sales are up 7 % in 2016 with sales of around ÃÂ£636 m in the second quarter .
The brand was bought by Phillips - Van Heusen in 2010 , who also own Calvin Klein , for ÃÂ£1.95bn .
Hilfiger remained in place as Ã¢â¬Ëprincipal designer and visionaryÃ¢â¬ â¢ .
After this show , you might say itÃ¢â¬ â¢ s a worthy title ."
