2006-11-12,"Her supporters are confident , the French right wing are convinced she will be the woman to beat and pundits are already talking about the dawn of a new era .
But , as Segolene Royal prepares for the final days of campaigning before the 220,000 members of the French Socialist party vote to decide their candidate for next year 's presidential elections , it is increasingly clear that the fight will go right to the wire and could result in a major upset .
The elections on Thursday pit 53-year - old Royal , who has led polls throughout the summer , against Dominique Strauss - Kahn , a former Finance Minister , and Laurent Fabius , a former Prime Minister .
One poll due to be published today will show Royal only a couple of percentage points ahead of her rivals .
Newspapers are suddenly exercising a new prudence , after weeks of predicting a crushing victory for Royal . '
[ Relying on the polls ] puts us on shifting , uncertain , unreliable and unpredictable terrain , ' said Dominique de Montvalon , editor of Le Parisien .
The key issue is whether Royal can garner more than half the votes cast on Thursday and thus avoid a run - off which could see a dangerous deal between her opponents . '
If there is a second tour then we are in a whole new world of manoeuvres and deals and there is everything to play for , ' said Michael Darmon , a senior political journalist and author .
Some talk of an ' Anyone But Segolene ' alliance .
Royal , a mother of four and the president of the Poitou - Charentes region , has suffered in a series of carefully choreographed televised debates between the three candidates .
The confident and smooth delivery of Strauss - Kahn , 57 , a former economist and convinced ' Social Democrat ' , has contrasted with the stilted speaking style of Royal , who has little experience of the raw reality of political rough - and - tumble . '
In the debates Strauss - Kahn was very good , open , informing and informed , ' said Frederique Dabi , of the IFOP pollsters . '
That made a difference . '
Another blow came late last week with the broadcast of a video , filmed by an activist at a small meeting in January , in which Royal suggests that something should be done about French state school teachers who profit from a light workload to moonlight in the private sector , arguing that they should work a 35-hour week in their schools .
Such ideas do not play well with the tens of thousands of teachers who are members of the Socialist Party . '
It 's a betrayal , frankly , ' Marie Franck , a high school teacher in Marseille , told The Observer . '
She is meant to be on our side . '
As the French media hunted the mole who posted the video on the internet , Royal 's aides complained of ' low blows ' .
But the battle between the candidates is more than a clash of personalities and genders .
Each reflects a different strand of left - wing thought and a different type of Socialist voter .
According to pollster Dabi , Royal 's powerbase lies among women , workers and the young while Strauss - Kahn , who is unashamedly ' Blairist ' though he dare not use the word , attracts support from middle - class professionals and even the right .
Laurent Fabius is campaigning on a hard left - wing platform , with capitalism , neo - liberal economics and big business as favourite targets .
He has strong support among long - term activists who see Royal as a moderate who has sold out .
Though Fabius scores less than 10 per cent in the polls , senior party figures point out ' that the polls probably do not reflect the weight he has in the heart of the party . '
He has established networks and , at the most recent internal party count , scored over 20 per cent , ' said Stephane Le Foll , a senior Socialist official .
Even after weeks of gruelling campaigning , there is still much indecision among Socialist party members , particularly the 80,000 who joined as a result of a hugely successful internet campaign earlier this year . '
I just do n't know who to choose , ' said Najwa Chekini , an administrator who signed up to the party 's branch in Paris 's 9th arrondissement six months ago , ' My heart says Segolene but my head says Strauss - Kahn . '
Chekini said that a key consideration was the ability of the candidates to take on Nicholas Sarkozy , the maverick Minister of Interior who is widely expected to be the main conservative candidate next year . '
Royal would get eaten alive , ' said one activist from the 14th arrondissment . '
I 'm voting Strauss - Kahn . '"
2007-02-23,"The French Socialist presidential candidate , Ségolène Royal , has called in heavyweight former rivals in an effort to shore up her flagging campaign .
Ms Royal - who has been attempting to recover from a slip in the polls that has left the conservative interior minister , Nicolas Sarkozy , as the clear leader in the race - has created a special A - list "" presidential pact team "" .
The new team includes the former presidential hopefuls Laurent Fabius and Dominique Strauss - Kahn , both of whom were resoundingly beaten for the Socialist nomination by Ms Royal in a party primary late last year .
Another Socialist big hitter , the party chief Francois Hollande - Ms Royal 's partner and the father of her four children - will also join the team , as will the Paris mayor , Bertrand Delanoe , and the former prime minister Lionel Jospin .
The personnel changes will align 53-year - old Ms Royal with the Socialist "" elephants "" who have considerable core party support .
The team will organise campaign rallies throughout France in the run up to the country 's two - round elections , which take place on April 22 and May 6 .
"" Everyone is united in this decisive phase of the campaign , "" Ms Royal said yesterday - a day after her former economics adviser announced he was leaving the party .
Eric Besson made the announcement a week after resigning his post in Ms Royal 's team , complaining that her campaign was badly organised and saying nobody had listened to his concerns .
He was quickly replaced by Michel Sapin , an old party hand , former economy minister and friend of Ms Royal .
Analysts said the Socialist contender 's reshuffle was risky because much of her popularity was based on her break from traditionalists within the party . ""
Mr Strauss - Kahn and Mr Fabius must show they are at the service of Ms Royal ... and the country , and not a screen between her and the country , "" Stéphane Rozè , the director of the polling organisation CSA , told the Financial Times .
"" If they do that , it could work . ""
In recent weeks , Ms Royal 's campaign had appeared about to implode after a series of blunders on foreign affairs and scrutiny over the eventual costs to France of her electoral promises .
However , her performance on a prime time question and answer TV talk show on Monday appeared to have repaired much of the damage .
A poll published on Wednesday showed Ms Royal beating Mr Sarkozy , the governing UMP party 's candidate , in first round voting .
According to Le Parisien newspaper , 29 % of respondents said they were most likely to vote for Ms Royal on April 22 , up two points from last week That compared with compared with 28 % - down five points - for Mr Sarkozy ."

Mr Sarkozy discussed the issue with prime minister Gordon Brown on Monday .

On Monday the IMF board said : "" Any executive director may submit a nomination , regardless of nationality .

Mr Darling told journalists that Britain had no alternative in mind to Mr Strauss - Kahn .

2007-07-11,"Britain isolated over top IMF job , screamed the headlines .
Darling outmanoeuvred by Sarko said the stories coming out of Brussels as every European Union country bar the UK supported the idea that the former French finance minister , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , should be Europe 's candidate to be the next managing director of the Fund .
Well , that 's one way of looking at it .
The other way of looking at it is to say that there are times when it is worth standing up for what you believe in .
This is certainly one of them .
The idea that the new MD of the IMF - one of the world 's most powerful jobs - should be chosen as the result of a stitch - up at a Brussels breakfast rather than by fair , open and transparent competition is outrageous .
Strauss - Kahn may be a man of a stature ( just like the three other Frenchmen currently running big international organisations ) .
He might make a decent head of the Fund .
But that is not the point .
Ever since the Fund , and its sister organisation , the World Bank , were set up at the end of the second world war there has been a cosy gentleman 's agreement between the Europeans and the Americans .
Europe would take the Fund while the Americans chose one of their own to be president of the Bank .
George Bush used this prerogative to parachute Robert Zoellick into the Bank earlier this summer as a replacement for Paul Wolfowitz .
Europe 's view is that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .
And since the current head of the Fund is a Spaniard and his predecessor was a German , clearly it must be France 's turn this time .
Any business that operated on this basis - that since the current chief executive came from finance the next one necessarily must come from marketing - would be considered to have taken leave of its senses .
And rightly so .
There is , however , more to this than simply getting the right person for the job , important though that is .
The world has moved on since 1945 ; the emergence of Asia as an economic powerhouse has utterly changed the dynamics of the global economy .
The Fund , too , has changed .
Its role was originally to help smooth developed countries through balance of payments crises .
For the past 20 years and more the main focus of its work has been in the developing world , insisting on changes in economic policy in return for financial help .
Hardly surprisingly , the bulk of the Fund 's membership bridles at the notion that the organisation should be treated as a bauble for the former colonial powers to pass around amongst themselves .
They want a bigger say in the running of the Fund , and will correctly see the Strauss - Kahn candidature as a sign that Europe will cling on to its power to the bitter end .
This is not only bad for the reputation of the Fund ; it also makes it harder to effect the necessary reforms to the way it works .
The weasel words that accompanied the EU stitch - up suggested that Europe agrees in principle with the idea of fair and open competition .
Just not yet .
Alistair Darling was right to take a stand on this issue and it is a pity more EU countries did not support him .
Let 's hope some of them are prepared to show a bit more backbone when the real decision is taken at a board meeting of the Fund in Washington in the autumn ."
2007-07-14,"Developing countries are demanding that Europe relinquish control over the top job at the International Monetary Fund , after the board of the Washington - based lender laid down rules for the most open selection process in more than 60 years .
Amar Bhattacharya , spokesman for the G24 group of developing countries , said it was vital that Dominique Strauss - Kahn , backed by most European countries , does not stand unopposed . '
It is extremely important that the best possible candidates be brought forward , ' he said .
At a heated meeting in Washington on Thursday , the IMF 's board agreed to ditch the convention , which originates from when the Bretton Woods institutions were founded after the Second World War , that the President of the World Bank is picked by the US , while Europe has the IMF job in its gift .
In a statement , it made clear that IMF directors ' may nominate nationals of any of the fund 's members ' . Non - Europeans have been nominated in the past : but Europe has always swung the job .
Bhattacharya said his members would monitor the process , to ensure each country abides by the rules , and there is genuine competition for the post . '
Every board member should be willing to evaluate candidates on their merits , not on where they come from . '
Alistair Darling , the new Chancellor , infuriated his European colleagues last week by refusing to support a deal to back Strauss - Kahn , a former French finance minister and political opponent of the current president , Nicolas Sarkozy .
A Treasury spokesman said : ' The UK is pleased that the executive board has agreed to run an open and transparent process , and looks forward to assessing the candidates in due course . '
Liz Stuart , of Oxfam International , said all the IMF 's member countries should take full advantage of the nomination period , between now and the end of August , to sound out potential candidates . '
The board 's statement is a very good start , but it 's important that people come forward to be nominated , ' she said . '
There are plenty of non - Europeans who would be great . '
Rodrigo de Rato , the IMF 's current managing director , surprised member - countries last month by announcing his early resignation , for ' personal reasons ' .
Rato has been spearheading reforms to give fast - growing developing countries a bigger say in the running of the IMF .
The agreement of a new selection process for his successor marked the clearest acceptance yet by the IMF 's board that the status quo is no longer acceptable . '
There 's a recognition that you need a strong consensus on this , ' said Bhattacharya ."
2007-07-16,"The stand - off between Britain and France over the top job at the International Monetary Fund lifts the lid on how these things work .
Alistair Darling was done up like a kipper by Nicolas Sarkozy , who united every EU country bar Britain behind the former French finance minister , Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
It goes without saying that Darling had right on his side .
The idea that the Fund is a European fiefdom , with the MD chosen not through an open and transparent process but as a result of a deal cut in Brussels is indefensible .
But there is a bigger issue at stake .
Whoever is chosen to run the IMF will join a select band of men wielding enormous power beyond the scope of the democratic process .
If DSK ( as he 's known in France ) eventually starts laying down the financial law to poor countries in Africa , it will be without the approval of a single voter anywhere in the world .
The same goes for Robert Zoellick at the World Bank , Pascal Lamy at the World Trade Organisation , for Jean - Claude Trichet at the European Central Bank and a host of lesser immortals who sit at the feet of the gods in the new Olympus .
In theory , these guys are tribunes of the people .
They are put there after horse - trading by national governments to pursue policies that will ensure global peace and prosperity .
Together , they embody a distinct world view ; growth is good , inflation is bad , free trade is good , protection is bad ; free movement of money is good ; capital controls are bad ; the market is good , the public sector is bad .
Not entirely coincidentally , this also happens to be the world view of the rich and powerful around the world .
It is the agenda of the multi - national corporation and the City of London ; it is the agenda of the media mogul and the hedge fund .
There would be a problem with this arrangement even if it could be proved that privatisation , tax breaks for the rich and financial market liberalisation had made the global economy so much more efficient that everybody was benefiting .
Why ?
Because the idea that all of the important decisions are taken beyond the scope of the democratic process leads to political apathy and disengagement - precisely what we are seeing , in fact .
Things get a lot more interesting though , when it starts to dawn on voters that this model is not working , and to the extent that it does deliver it does so for the billionaire rather than the ordinary Joe .
Take financial liberalisation .
The case for removing all the shackles from capital was that the constraints imposed after the second world war not only led to inefficiency but were also an intolerable attack on freedom .
Everything would move a bit faster and a bit more smoothly if these constraints were removed .
All sounds entirely sensible , does n't it ?
By the same token , though , it is an intolerable attack on liberty to force a teenager to pass a driving test before being allowed out on to a public road .
What 's more , traffic would move more smoothly if we abolished speed limits .
Get right down to it , and government has no part in this process at all .
We should let people sit behind the wheel of a car whenever they want .
We should leave it to the self - regulation of the motor manufacturers to restrict the speed of the vehicles put on the road .
And we should rely on the common sense of motorists to know just how safe it is to drive .
Well , there might be some libertarian ultras who would support such an idea , but most of us can tell the difference between freedom to drive and licence to kill .
Any period of self - restraint would be short - lived and before long we would all be driving like Mr Toad .
There would be an almighty car crash , after which there would be urgent calls for the old controls to be brought back .
Now take a look at the financial system .
It is easier than ever to get credit .
People who really should not be allowed to borrow are being bombarded with offers of loans .
Mortgage providers offer unheard multiples of income to first - time buyers because the speculation unleashed by too much easy money has made it impossible to get on the property ladder any other way .
Free movement of capital internationally means speculators can borrow money where interest rates are low and invest in riskier assets somewhere else in the world .
So what do you think ?
A more efficient system for apportioning capital ?
A system that has removed all the pettifogging restrictions on liberty ?
A car crash waiting to happen ?
Or , in the case of the sub - prime crisis in the United States , a car crash that is already happening , albeit in slow motion ?
What 's happened in the US is an example of how the economy has been pulled out of shape to suit one particular interest group .
Over the past few decades the New Deal constraints that were put on big finance after the Wall Street crash of 1929 were systematically dismantled .
As a result , when after 9/11 the Federal Reserve flooded the American financial system with cheap money the banks went wild .
Interest - free periods
Once they had lent all they could to those who were good risks , attention switched to the more financially vulnerable .
It was obvious many of these people would have trouble paying back their loans , but they were hooked by interest - free periods , teaser rates , no - deposit loans and mortgages where no verification of income was required .
The argument was that this was philanthropy on the part of the banks ; they were allowing the poor to get on the property ladder .
That 's right , said Robert Kuttner , editor of the American Prospect , but only in the sense that the mafia makes loans available to America 's small business community .
Loans were extended to millions of people who were never going to pay them back , but the assumption was that this was not really all that risky because house prices would continue to rise .
If the borrower could n't keep up the monthly repayments , they could sell their property at a profit .
So confident was Wall Street that it was on to a winner that it looked for another way of making money out of the sub - prime sector .
It took thousands of these loans , bundled them up and sold them as bonds .
These bonds were then sliced up into tranches of varying degrees of risk of default , which were then traded on the derivatives market .
Hedge funds picked up the riskier portions of the mortgage - based securities because the profits were potentially bigger .
As , of course , were the losses .
As interest rates have risen , this get - rich - quick scheme looks a lot less clever .
Dodgy mortgage providers have collapsed , the cost of credit has risen , putting a brake on the economy , and Wall Street 's rocket scientists have discovered that the market value of their derivatives is a heck of a lot lower than it should be according to their mathematical models .
All the ingredients are in place for a full - scale financial economic crisis in the US .
Should that occur , there would not only be a thumping great recession but a backlash against Wall Street of the kind not seen for 70 years .
That would provide a fascinating backdrop to next year 's presidential election , with the Democrats , in particular , having to decide between populism or rule by elites ( or unpopulism ) .
In those circumstances , the excesses of big finance , trade policy and income inequality would all become live issues .
The New Olympians may need to watch their backs .

2007-08-25,"The former French finance minister , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , is all but certain to clinch the top job at the International Monetary Fund after nominations close this week , despite calls from developing countries for a heavyweight candidate from outside Europe to come forward .
Anti - poverty campaigners have expressed dismay that , despite the IMF 's board insisting candidates should be judged ' without geographical preferences ' , most European governments have clubbed together and promised to vote en masse for ' DSK ' , as he is known . '
It 's totally unaccountable , ' said Liz Stuart , of Oxfam . '
This was the perfect moment to say , we are changing , we are modern , we do care about being transparent , and democratic , and relevant . '
Europe has selected the IMF 's managing director , and the US has chosen the World Bank 's President , ever since the Bretton Woods institutions were set up in the aftermath of World War Two .
But campaigners had hoped the moment was right for reform , after the departure of World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz , chosen by George Bush , who lost the confidence of staff after a controversy over his partner 's pay - rise .
Amar Bhattacharya , who represents the G24 group of developing countries , said that by announcing DSK 's candidacy at a Brussels summit last month , Europe had used its ' first - mover advantage ' to stitch up the nominations . '
I hope that , regardless of what happens this time , there will be a commitment to change the process , ' he said . '
Countries really have to say , these are not bloc nominations : we have to keep the slate open . '
Britain has a long - standing policy of opposing Europe 's stranglehold over the IMF job .
The Chancellor , Alistair Darling , said last month , ' I do n't think Europe can simply say , "" that position is ours and we are not prepared to discuss it with anyone else "" . ' '
It 's really positive that the UK did that , but it 's disappointing that they did n't nominate their own candidate , or put out a statement saying that they would support a developing country candidate , ' said Stuart . '
The process was n't well thought through and the way the EU approached it undermined any attempt to claim it was fair , ' said Peter Chowla , of the Bretton Woods Project .
' They all got behind this candidate in advance , without knowing who the other candidates might be . '
Russia surprised European governments last week by nominating Josef Tosovsky , a former Czech prime minister and central banker , but he is expected to win little support , and the Czech government itself has refused to endorse him .
Rodrigo de Rato , the IMF 's managing director , announced in June that he planned to leave Washington , for personal reasons .
Nominations to succeed him close next week , and a candidate will be chosen in September - though Rato will stay on until after the Fund 's annual meetings , in mid - October .
Bhattacharya said more open procedures for appointing the managing - director should be part of a package of reforms being negotiated between IMF members , including a bigger voice for developing countries . '
Many of these changes will not happen if you just leave it to pressure from the inside , ' he said ."
2008-01-28,"Finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 industrial nations will discuss the possibility of coordinated action to combat the threat of a global recession when they meet in Tokyo next month .
Amid growing pessimism about the risk of recession from the US spreading to the rest of the world , the meeting will look at the scope for lower interest rates to be accompanied by tax cuts .
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , said in Davos at the weekend that the fund would this week revise down its forecasts for world growth this year and gave the all clear for those countries with strong fiscal positions to reduce taxes or increase spending .
"" Economies with a low fiscal risk have to use fiscal policy .
They ca n't rely on monetary policy alone , "" the IMF managing director said .
"" We are facing global imbalances and the sub - prime crisis is only part of it .
We are facing also currency imbalances , surpluses rising in some countries , and rising commodity prices .
All those imbalances have to be addressed .
"" Strauss - Kahn 's comments were echoed by European monetary affairs commissioner Joaquín Almunia , who said there was room for European governments who had kept a tight rein on budgets to ease back as growth slowed . ""
For the European economies who have pursued an ambitious consolidation of fiscal policies during the past three years - now they have the possibilities of letting their automatic stabilisers play their role , "" Almunia said .
The call for more active fiscal policy came as an array of bankers and finance chiefs gave a gloomy assessment of the year ahead , despite last week 's emergency cuts in interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a $ 150bn ( £ 76bn ) package of US tax cuts .
"" It 's going to take some time for these things to work their way through the system , "" Citibank chairman William Rhodes said .
"" In a nine - inning ballgame , I think we 're in the fifth inning . ""
John Thain , the chief executive of Merrill Lynch , gave a gloomy assessment of the US economy , predicting that the slump in the housing market would intensify this year .
"" It will be a while before you see a return of normalcy in banking and markets , "" Thain said .
"" I think there will continue to be downward pressure on home prices , that will continue to put downward pressure on all mortgage - related securities .
The Fed cut and the fiscal stimulus package are not going to help declining house prices in the US .
"" Japan 's prime minister , Yasuo Fukuda , said the world economy faced growing downside risks .
"" There is no need for excessive pessimism , "" he said .
"" However , we should respond quickly and should implement necessary measures . ""
World Bank president Robert Zoellick said uncertainty pervaded the financial markets .
"" Some firms are going to have some big losses , "" he said .
"" I do n't think this has fully run its course . """
2008-04-10,"The global economy is caught between the twin perils of a sharp slowdown in activity and rising inflation , the head of the International Monetary Fund said today .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the Fund 's newly - appointed managing director said policymakers were grappling with both "" ice and fire "" and that there was no one - size - fits - all response to the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s .
"" The world economy is balanced between these two risks .
Too cold and there is a risk of too big a slowdown in growth ; too hot and there is the risk of too big an increase in inflation . ""
Strauss - Kahn said the recession in the United States was affecting growth prospects in the rest of world , and expressed scepticism about the prospect that the developing world would be able to de - couple itself from the problems in the West . ""
The risks are tilted to the downside "" , he said at a press conference held ahead of tomorrow 's meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors which will seek to find ways of preventing the losses of Western banks leading to a full - blown global recession . ""
These risks are in part centred on the mutually reinforcing credit and housing crisis in the US .
But there is also risk aversion , with higher financing costs and a sharp decrease in capital market flows to emerging markets "" , Strauss - Kahn added .
"" Inflation may also be back .
It 's a key concern .
Food prices have increased by 48 % since the end of 2006 and that may undermine all the gains achieved in reducing poverty . ""
Strauss - Kahn , who took control of the Fund six months ago said his organisation - set up after the Second World War to prevent a return to the Great Depression of the 1930s - was the right body to co - ordinate the global response to the current crisis .
"" The IMF is back "" , the IMF head said , outlining three key areas where work needed to be done over the coming months .
"" We have to understand better the linkages between what 's happening in the financial sector and what 's happening in the real economy .
This is not a traditional crisis caused by deficits in current accounts or capital accounts ; it is a different sort of crisis . ""
Strauss - Kahn added that the Fund also needed to improve its surveillance of the global economy - both at the level of individual countries and at a multilateral level .
Asked why the Fund had not been able to prevent the sub - prime crisis from erupting , the IMF managing director said his organisation 's warnings had been ignored .
The US , he added , had until recently refused to allow the Fund to stress - test its financial sector .
Finally , Strauss - Kahn said that poor countries in Africa were the most vulnerable to a sharp slowdown , and that the Fund needed to ensure that they were protected from the worst effects of the crisis .
He said reform of the Fund to give leading developing countries a bigger say in making decisions would help .
Elizabeth Stuart , of Oxfam , said : "" Strauss - Kahn called the reform a big success , but if the goal was to achieve real change then it looks more like a failure .
You can barely call this a reform , when 144 countries do n't even get an increase of 1 % in their voting share . ""
The Fund should now move quickly to table a serious reform that is n't just cosmetic ; one that gives a real voice to the majority of developing countries . """
2008-04-12,"Finance ministers have handed the Washington - based International Monetary Fund a powerful new role as the guardian of global stability , despite evidence that it failed to grasp the threat posed by a decade - long credit binge .
In Washington , at the IMF 's spring meetings , finance ministers backed radical plans by its managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , to cut 15 per cent of its staff , increase the say of developing countries in its decisions , and focus on monitoring the health of the world economy , instead of making controversial loans to poor countries .
Strauss - Kahn said last week that the IMF had issued repeated warnings before the sub - prime crisis .
Yet , as recently as July 2006 , an IMF check of the US economy found that , ' a range of indicators suggested that systemic risks were at a low ebb ' , and ' financial sector risks related to household borrowing appeared relatively manageable ' .
Alistair Darling has argued strongly for the IMF to be given greater powers of surveillance .
But the IMF has also given the UK 's banking system a clean bill of health twice in recent years : once in 2003 and again in December 2006 when , in a report on the British economy less than 12 months before the Treasury was forced to bail out overstretched mortgage lender Northern Rock , it said ' the financial sector starts from a position of strength and the authorities continue to promote the system 's resilience ' ."
2008-10-01,"The International Monetary Fund has added to the growing pressure on the US Congress to approve the Wall Street bail - out , as stockmarkets rose on optimism that a deal will be hammered out this week .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the IMF , warned last night that the US must take urgent steps to protect its economy from the ongoing financial crisis .
"" We 're right at the moment where action is needed , "" warned Strauss - Kahn . ""
A non - perfect plan is better than no plan at all , "" he added , in an interview with Reuters in Washington .
The prospect of a deal this week sent shares up in London , where the FTSE 100 continued yesterday 's bounce - back .
After leaping by 92 points in early trading it was up 82.5 at 4985 at 1.30pm .
Asia was also more buoyant , where Japan 's Nikkei recovered some of yesterday 's heavy losses to close almost 1 % higher .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng index gained 0.75 % .
But the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by around 100 points when trading begins on Wall Street .
The House of Representatives sent shockwaves around the world on Monday when it voted down the $ 700bn ( £ 390bn ) rescue plan , under which the US government would cleanse the banking sector 's balance sheets .
With politicians worldwide demanding action , the US Senate is due to buck convention and vote on an amended version of the rescue plan this evening – before the lower house has given its approval .
In an effort to win Congress 's backing , it now includes a clause to raise the government 's guarantee on savings from $ 100,000 ( £ 56,000 ) to $ 250,000 .
But in a sign of the problems facing the financial industry , JP Morgan warned that Europe 's banks will take fresh asset writedowns totalling € 28.4bn ( £ 22.5bn ) before the end of this year .
The research note predicted the following writedowns : • Lloyds TSB ( including HBOS ) : £ 4.5bn • Deutsche Bank : £ 3.6bn • UBS : £ 2.1bn • Barclays : £ 2.9bn • Société Générale : £
2.1bn Strauss - Kahn demanded that Europe draw up contingency plans in case its own banking system needs to be rescued .
Unlike in America , there is no single regulator overseeing the system .
"" Developing a contingency plan does not mean it 's announcing a lot of trouble coming .
But they 're not totally immune …
and so they need to organize , "" he added .
But the president of the European Central Bank , Jean - Claude Trichet , has rejected the idea that Europe should organise its own bail - out .
"" We are not a fully fledged federation with a federal budget , "" Trichet pointed out . ""
Each country has to mobilize its own efforts . ""
He also echoed calls for rapid action on the bail - out .
"" It has to go , for the sake of the US and for the sake of global finance , "" Trichet said .
Both presidential candidates have also called for a new push to get the rescue plan through .
On the campaign trail yesterday , Barack Obama warned of "" catastrophic "" consequences unless a deal is reached soon .
"" We can not risk another week or another month where American businesses are afraid to extend credit and lend money , "" he said .
There was also renewed optimism on Wall Street that the treasury would eventually be able to hoover up "" toxic "" mortgage - related assets . ""
Cooler heads are prevailing - we 'd had a little bit of panic at the close yesterday , "" said Anthony Conroy , head trader at BNY ConvergEx in New York .
"" There 's anticipation that some sort of deal will be passed by Congress in the next day or two . ""
The US public has blamed the shambolic handling of the bail - out plan on both Congress - whose approval rating has fallen to 10 % - and president George Bush , who is accused of caring about "" fat cats "" rather than ordinary people ."
2008-10-09,"The International Monetary Fund has drawn up emergency plans to bail out governments affected by the financial crisis , after warning yesterday that no country would be immune from the ripple effects of the credit crunch .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the Fund 's managing director , said it could make "" hundreds of billions of dollars "" available to either rich countries in the west , or to developing nations .
Amid fears that the extreme turbulence of the past month will push governments to the brink of financial collapse , Strauss - Kahn said he had asked the Fund 's board to activate its fast - track loan procedure .
Strauss - Kahn said , "" we are ready to answer any demand from a country facing problems . ""
He added that the Fund had not lent during the past five years , and therefore had a sizeable war chest available .
Any country seeking financial assistance will face less stringent conditions than normally apply to governments in trouble .
"" We are not going to take weeks and months to design a programme ; it will take two weeks at most , "" Strauss - Kahn said .
However , anti - poverty campaigners warned that the hurdles to receiving the IMF 's help might still be too high . ""
No one could accuse the Fund of being asleep at the wheel , "" said Marita Hutjes , Oxfam International spokesperson .
"" It is coming up quickly with money to help countries cope .
But for the poorest countries , it 's still not doing it right .
They ca n't borrow as much as they 'll need , and most of that money will be subject to high numbers of conditions .
"" Speaking on the eve of the Fund 's Annual Meetings in Washington , Strauss - Kahn repeatedly warned that "" no country is immune "" , from the credit crunch , adding that firms and consumers in emerging countries were already seeing loans become more expensive .
He pointed to a map showing the progress of "" financial global warming "" , since 2006 .
Two years ago , only a handful of countries were affected by financial problems ; but they have now spread throughout the globe .
He said the Fund had been rightly pessimistic six months ago about the scale of the financial problems , and been proved right ; but it now expected the situation to improve by the end of next year .
"" It 's a message of hope : the crisis is serious , the crisis is protracted ; but the second half of 2009 will be the beginning of recovery .
It will be slow , "" he said .
The IMF also called for better coordination of national responses to the ongoing turmoil , and Strauss - Kahn singled out the chaotic actions in Europe for criticisms .
"" I urge European countries to work together : there is no domestic solution to a crisis like this .
All lonely actions have to be avoided , if not condemned . """
2008-10-18,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the French economist who heads the International Monetary Fund , is under investigation for allegedly abusing his position by engaging in a sexual relationship with a senior official .
The inquiry , confirmed by an IMF spokesman , threatens to distract the organisation at a time when it is trying to focus its efforts on helping countries to withstand the global financial crisis .
Yesterday US President George Bush held talks with European leaders amid growing evidence that the world is sliding towards recession .
French officials and politicians reacted angrily to the Strauss - Kahn story , which appeared in the Wall Street Journal , accusing the US administration of ' playing dirty ' by ' at the very least ' pointing reporters to the IMF internal inquiry .
According to the newspaper , Strauss - Kahn had an affair with Piroska Nagy , a senior official in the fund 's Africa department who was brought up in Hungary .
The affair reportedly ended after her husband , Mario Blejer , a prominent economist and former president of Argentina 's central bank , discovered incriminating emails .
Nagy then left the IMF and part of the inquiry centres on the possibility that she may have received an excessive payout for a person of her position .
Masood Ahmed , the IMF 's chief spokesman , said : ' There was an allegation concerning improper behaviour of a personal nature on the part of the managing director .
All allegations , particularly relating to senior management , need to be investigated . '
But the handling of the investigation has drawn criticism from the IMF because not all board members were informed about it before the newspaper made its inquiries .
There was also anger in Europe . '
It 's very odd that it comes just at the moment when people are talking about the IMF and its head taking a lead role in creating a new global financial order which will not necessarily be to the advantage of wealthy , right - wing Americans , ' one French economist and government adviser told The Observer Strauss - Kahn , a former finance minister , is a leading member of the French Socialist party and is known for his moderate left - wing views .
In a statement on Friday he said the ' incident which occurred in [ his ] private life ' took place in January 2008 and that ' at no time did [ he ] abuse [ his ] position as the fund 's managing director ' .
This is the second time that a major international financial institution has been hit by scandal in recent years .
In June last year the then World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz , one of Bush 's closest allies , stepped down following a scandal over a promotion and pay rise for his long - term companion who worked at the institution .
At yesterday 's meeting with Bush , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission president José Manuel Barroso hoped to pave the way for an unprecedented summit this autumn to overhaul the global financial regulatory system .
In France , as elsewhere in continental Europe , there have been strident calls for a fundamental reform of ' liberal laissez - faire capitalism ' in recent days .
Sarkozy has attacked tax havens , hedge and sovereign wealth funds and big pay bonuses for risk - taking executives , as well as the American dominance of ratings agencies .
However , Bush and many close aides are not convinced about the need for fundamental reform . '
Our European partners are taking bold steps .
They show the world that we 're determined to overcome this challenge together .
And they have the full support of the United States , ' Bush said during a speech at the US Chamber of Commerce last week .
However , the President , who leaves office in January , did not specifically mention calls by European leaders to reform the Bretton Woods financial system under which the world has operated since 1944 .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that the US focus was on the immediate crisis . '
I think the most important thing we can do is ... stop the bleeding before we move on to the next project , ' she said .
Barroso and Sarkozy met Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Friday and agreed on the need for an international summit to forge a new vision for the world economy before the end of the year .
Gordon Brown has already said he would back such a plan ."
2008-10-19,"France 's political elite yesterday rallied around Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund , after it emerged that the former finance minister was facing an inquiry into whether he abused his position by having a sexual relationship with a subordinate .
Strauss - Kahn was defended by President Nicolas Sarkozy 's rightwing UMP party , which put him forward for the prestigious IMF appointment , as well as many of his fellow Socialists , several of whom consider him to be a potential future presidential candidate .
"" Everyone accepts that he is a good chief of the IMF , "" said François Hollande , first secretary of the leftwing PS party .
Speaking on French radio , the cabinet spokesman , Luc Chatel , stressed Strauss - Kahn 's solid handling of the financial crisis . ""
He has shown throughout that he was on top of things , "" he said .
Details of the affair , which was first reported at the weekend by the Wall Street Journal , provoked anger and suspicion in France , a country with clear media privacy laws .
Many commentators questioned the timing of the leaks , amid a global financial crisis in which the IMF plays a key role .
Others suggested the investigation , which was reportedly ordered by the head of the IMF 's 24-member board with help from the US and Russia , was leaked deliberately to "" destabilise "" him .
One close ally , Jean - Marie Le Guen , pointed out that his unashamed support of tight market regulation had not been popular with some across the Atlantic .
The IMF said on Saturday it was looking into claims that Strauss - Kahn - or ' DSK ' as he is known affectionately in France - was guilty of "" improper behaviour "" for having a brief affair with a married senior official- a charge he denies .
According to the WSJ , part of the investigation will focus on whether Piroska Nagy , who worked in the fund 's Africa department , received an excessive payoff when she left her position , six months after the "" incident "" is said to have taken place .
Her lawyer denies this ."
2008-10-27,"IMF chief keeps his job after ' error of judgment ' The head of the International Monetary Fund will remain in his job after the agency 's executive board concluded that there was no cause for dismissal over his affair with a former IMF employee .
The board issued a statement on Saturday saying that the actions of managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn were "" regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment "" .
However , the 24-member board of directors decided that the relationship had been consensual and did not involve any type of sexual harassment , favouritism or any abuse of authority .
Associated Press in Washington Eight - year ordeal ends as troops free Farc hostage
A former Colombian politician abducted eight years ago by leftwing Farc rebels has been freed in a military operation .
Authorities announced that Oscar Tulio Lizcano , 62 , who was abducted in August 2000 , was rescued yesterday in western Choco province .
Henry Murillo , a government official of Caldas province , confirmed the ex - Conservative party member 's release .
Lizcano 's wife , Martha , called his captivity "" eight years of great suffering "" .
The former presidential candidate and most high - profile of the Farc captives , Ingrid Betancourt , was freed in July .
Associated Press in Bogota Police arrest swingers for holding sex parties Police have arrested an Egyptian couple for allegedly swapping sex partners with other married couples , security officials said yesterday .
The two - a civil servant and his teacher wife - allegedly solicited other couples over the internet and invited them to their home , said the officials .
They allegedly held at least three such sex parties and police are looking for others involved .
Sex out of wedlock is illegal in Egypt , where Islamic law is the main source of legislation .
Police say the couple used chat rooms on an Arabic porn website to arrange for interviews with couples before they swapped partners .

2008-12-16,"The head of the International Monetary Fund urged governments to step up action to stem the global economic crisis or risk delaying a recovery and sparking violent unrest on the streets .
Using a speech last night in Madrid to issue his stark warning , Dominique Strauss - Kahn argued that government efforts to tackle the economic downturn so far have been uncertain and largely insufficient , which could lead to severe consequences .
He singled out the eurozone nations as he attacked the inadequate global response .
His hard - hitting coments came as fears of a prolonged slumped intensified after China showed signs that its economy could be in more trouble than initially expected next year .
Factory output in the rapidly growing economy registered the weakest growth in almost a decade last month .
The IMF 's managing director said such news signalled that a world recovery may not take place until late next year or into 2010 unless swift action is taken .
"" A lot remains to be done , and if this work is not done it will be difficult to avoid a long - lasting crisis that everyone wants to avoid , "" he said .
Governments in leading economies have been called upon by the IMF to commit a combined 2 % of global GDP , equivalent to £ 1.075bn , to try combat the dangers of a global recession .
But the IMF chief blamed governments , saying they were unwilling or unable to use more public funds to jump - start economic activity . "" If we are not able to do that , then social unrest may happen in many countries - including advanced economies , "" Strauss - Kahn said .
He added that violent protests could break out in countries worldwide if the financial system was not restructured to benefit everyone rather than a small elite .
Revealing his concerns of a deeper economic slowdown , he said that the IMF would probably cut world growth next year from its current forecast of 2.2 % .
He also predicted that China 's once red - hot economy will rapidly run out of steam .
"" We started with China at 11 % growth ...
China will probably grow at 5 or 6 % [ next year ] , "" he said .
"" The possibility of a global recession is real .
We realise something must be done . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's comments were in sharp contrast to Jean - Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank , who yesterday told European leaders they should stick to EU 's controversial Stability and Growth Pact , which limits government borrowing and total debt .
But Strauss - Kahn said that existing rules should be scrapped to allow governments to deliver essential economic stimulus packages .
"" We are facing an unprecedented decline in output and we have evidence of substantial uncertainty limiting the effectiveness of some fiscal policy measures , "" he said , "" What was decided by Brussels ... 1.5 % of GDP in the form of stimulus , is a bit below what we need . ""
His views reflect the continued clashes between European governments on how they should react to the crisis .
Germany has been uncertain about injecting large amounts of public money into economies to encourage growth and resisted pressures to join in with a more coordinated EU effort ."
2008-12-22,"The head of the International Monetary Fund backed Gordon Brown 's recession strategy yesterday by urging governments to pump more money into their economies or face a worsening downturn .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the measures announced by the G20 nations in Washington last month may not be enough to kick - start the global economy .
Strauss - Kahn added that the IMF may next month revise down economic growth forecasts for 2009 , which have already been cut from 3 % to 2.2 % "" Our forecast , already very dark ... will be even darker if not enough fiscal stimulus is implemented , "" he told BBC Radio 4 .
In an implicit backing of the British prime minister 's £ 20bn stimulus plan , Strauss - Kahn said he had reversed his view of state borrowing and believed that increasing government debt was the "" less bad solution "" when faced with the worst downturn in up to 70 years .
Nonetheless , Strauss - Kahn described the increase in UK debt to fund the economic shock treatment as "" disturbing "" .
The IMF chief said other countries should follow the British example , adding that a stimulus of about 2 % of global gross domestic product , or $ 1.2tn ( £ 800bn ) for the G20 nations , was the best option .
"" We see 2009 as really being a bad year with recession for most advanced economies and growth decreasing for emerging economies , "" he said .
"" At the G20 in Washington a few weeks ago , all the heads of state and government seemed to be aware that something has to be done and I can see that some measures have been announced , but I 'm afraid it wo n't be enough .
Our estimate is that we need a stimulus of something like 2 % of GDP , which is $ 1.2tn . ""
Strauss - Kahn also rejected the argument of Germany 's finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , who caused a diplomatic incident a fortnight ago when he described Gordon Brown 's plan , underpinned by a cut in VAT , as "" crass Keynesianism "" .
"" I understand the traditional view of the Germans , but nevertheless I think we are in a time when we should be a bit more imaginative then we have been , "" said Strauss - Kahn .
European Union leaders ignored Steinbrück 's comments earlier this month and agreed a € 200bn ( £ 185bn ) stimulus package , funded by measures including tax cuts and the acceleration of public spending projects .
He added that it was "" noble "" for the European Central Bank president , Jean - Claude Trichet , to warn that eurozone governments must control their borrowing , adding : "" He 's the head of the central bank - it 's his job to say things like that . ""
However , Strauss - Kahn said a looser fiscal policy remained a better option than curbing borrowing , which risks exacerbating the global downturn .
"" I do n't think as a general stance we should have a lax fiscal policy , but we are in the biggest crisis we have experienced for 60 or 70 years , "" he said .
"" The threat is that big today that we are between two difficult problems : increasing deficit , which is never good , and fighting against recession , which is even worse .
We have to choose the less bad solution . ""
Strauss - Kahn said the reduction in US interest rates to 0.25 % last week would not be enough to revive the world 's largest economy , and a stimulus plan , being drafted by the incoming administration of president - elect Barack Obama , will be needed .
He said the Federal Reserve rate cut was "" welcome "" but added : "" It ca n't be considered enough .
That 's why we need to use the other tools we have in our tool - kits - namely a fiscal stimulus . """
2009-03-10,"The global economy will shrink this year for the first time since the second world war as the "" Great Recession "" ravages businesses , consumers and financial institutions around the world , the International Monetary Fund warned today .
Speaking in Tanzania , IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said the economic downturn would be more severe than previously thought .
"" The IMF expects global growth to slow below zero this year , the worst performance in most of our lifetimes , "" Strauss - Kahn told African political and financial leaders in Dar Es Salaam . ""
Continued de - leveraging by world financial institutions , combined with a collapse in consumer and business confidence , is depressing domestic demand across the globe , while world trade is falling at an alarming rate and commodity prices have tumbled . ""
Strauss - Kahn dubbed the downturn the "" Great Recession "" .
The world economy has not suffered an annual contraction since 1945 .
There appears to be broad consensus that the economic downturn will be much deeper and more protracted than most experts thought just a few months ago .
In January , the IMF predicted that the world economy would grow by 0.5 % , which was already a sharp revision of its earlier prediction of 2.2 % growth .
That was based on 3.3 % expansion in developing countries and 2 % contraction in advanced economies .
The IMF is expected to announce fresh official projections later this month .
Strauss - Kahn 's warning , made at a conference to examine the impact of the financial crisis on Africa , comes just two days after the World Bank predicted that the global economy would shrink by at least 1 % this year .
The World Bank also forecast on Sunday that trade would suffer the biggest decline in 80 years , and said that by this summer industrial output could be 15 % lower than in 2008 .
And veteran investor Warren Buffett warned yesterday that the world faced "" an economic Pearl Harbor "" .
Most major economies are now officially in recession .
The UK economy shrank by 1.6 % in the last three months of 2008 , following a 0.7 % contraction between July and September , and is expected to keep shrinking through 2009 .
Japan 's economy is shrinking at its fastest rate for 35 years , with GDP falling by 3.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
And in America GDP declined by 3.3 % in the last quarter on an annualised basis .
Darling : ' Moral imperative ' to help poorer neighbours
The downturn has already sent unemployment rising sharply on both sides of the Atlantic , with analysts fearing that the UK jobless total will exceed 3 million before the crisis is finished .
There are concerns , though , that developing nations will be hit even harder .
Writing in the Guardian today , Alistair Darling says that Europe 's leaders have a "" moral imperative "" to step in to help poorer nations . ""
The International Monetary Fund has identified 26 countries , half in sub - Saharan Africa , that are particularly vulnerable to the crisis .
Central and eastern European economies are estimated to face a financing gap of $ 100bn in 2009 .
And the World Bank estimates that 129 developing countries are facing a financing shortfall of between $ 270 and $ 700bn , "" writes the chancellor .
"" Many decades of economic union have brought greater prosperity , but closer economic integration also brings challenges .
We are all affected by what happens to our neighbours , "" he adds .
IMF :
We need more funding
The IMF has already bailed out several countries that have been particularly badly hit by the financial meltdown , including Iceland , Ukraine and Hungary .
With the crisis escalating , there is growing pressure to double the IMF 's emergency rescue fund to $ 500bn .
This issue will be debated when finance ministers from the group of 20 leading economies meet this weekend , and European Union finance ministers are expected to announce their support for this move later today .
Darling has already indicated that he backs the proposal , writing in the Guaridan : "" For those most at risk , we need to increase financing through the International Monetary Fund and multilateral banks , through swap lines between central banks , and an enhanced lending facility at the EU level . """
2009-04-02,"The fundamental problem that the London G20 meeting faced is that we are facing a profound crisis in an internationally interconnected and very complex economy , but that almost all the obvious answers are national answers .
The focus on the conventional nation state follows from the high cost of crisis measures , which can only be covered by national governments and their taxpayers .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the managing director of the IMF , was also right to sound a sober note in advance of the meeting by reminding participants that unless the hugely complex problem of bad or toxic assets is dealt with , bank lending will not really start up again .
There were some unrealistically high expectations of what international action could do – for instance , in regard to coordinated fiscal stimulus , and they were inevitably disappointed .
But the summit has created some interesting policy dilemmas for the future .
The summit did the right thing in focusing on the areas where there was an urgent need for collective action .
The emphasis on greatly increasing the crisis - fighting capacity of the IMF is absolutely appropriate .
Many vulnerable emerging markets are in politically sensitive areas and economic collapse risks creating major geopolitical upheavals .
The allocation of resources to trade financing is also an important step to solving the problem of starting global trade up .
Since last September , many exporters , especially in emerging markets and in poorer countries , have found their access to trade finance cut off because of the freezing - up of financial institutions .
It was also appropriate to recognise that the big new economies , notably China and India , should have a much greater voice at the Fund , but the renegotiation of quotas will take time .
The problem down the road is that China is likely to push for a rethinking of international reserves , and in particular , for a longer - term transition to a world economy that is less based on the dollar .
Other countries have voiced similar feelings in the past : France took this position in the 1960s and 1970s , and Japan echoed the sentiment in the 1980s .
But China is in a much more powerful position as the major source of global savings to push through ideas about a new substitute for the dollar in the form of a composite or artificial reserve currency .
The other dilemma for the future lies in the debate about financial supervision .
The summit has also adopted wording that is much closer to the French and German position on tighter and closer financial regulation .
But the concrete problems will arise out of the interaction of new mechanisms at an international level , where better and more effective coordination of regulatory efforts is really required , and different national regulators .
Intensified national regulation is likely to increase the already powerful pressure on financial institutions to concentrate on their national markets .
The attack on trade protectionism is a red herring here : the new kind of protectionism is likely to come from the renationalisation of finance .
That is bad news for those countries that specialised in the provision of international financial services : and that includes not only the horrendous example of Iceland , but also the UK ."
2009-04-23,"Governments in the US and Europe must do more to fix their shattered financial systems or risk prolonging the world recession , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the managing director of the IMF , warned today .
Speaking in Washington on the eve of the IMF 's spring meetings , Strauss - Kahn said leaders at the G20 London summit had promised to clean up their banks ; but he was disappointed at how much action had been taken so far . ""
All the experience we have of past banking crisis is that you never recover before you have completed the cleaning up of the balance sheets of the financial sector .
You can postpone it – at the same time , you postpone the recovery .
"" Japan 's prime minister , Taro Aso , argued at the G20 summit that his country 's experience showed that clearing up bad loans so that banks could lend again was the key to securing an economic upturn .
Gordon Brown said leaders had agreed a "" common approach "" – but in practice , different countries have varying policies .
The US treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , has announced plans for using public funds to help institutions buy toxic assets , while European countries have implemented separate rescue plans , including the UK 's insurance - style "" asset protection facility "" and Ireland 's bad bank .
Strauss - Kahn said he remained concerned that not enough had yet been done .
"" I am asking for more efforts in this direction , "" he said.""Our belief is that this crisis is far from over . """
2009-04-25,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the dapper former French finance minister who runs the International Monetary Fund , is finding it hard to conceal a certain swagger in Washington this weekend .
If there is one big winner from the wrenching financial crisis of the past year , and the scramble by shell - shocked governments to tackle the turmoil , it is the IMF .
At the London summit of G20 countries this month , heads of state signed up to an extraordinary tripling of the IMF 's resources , handing it the responsibility of acting as a giant economic shock absorber , to prevent a string of countries falling victim to crises .
As one Oxfam campaigner said at the time : "" The IMF is big , it 's bad
and it 's back "" .
"" I think you can say that the IMF is playing its role - and that is the rationale for the tripling of resources , "" Strauss - Kahn said this weekend .
Gordon Brown claimed in London that leaders had banished the "" Washington consensus "" of neo - liberal economics promulgated by the US - dominated IMF and World Bank .
Yet the IMF was handed a massive new mandate , and given until 2011 to finish crucial reforms of "" quota and voice "" - the power each of its member countries have in the IMF 's decision - making bodies .
Two years ago , the IMF , set up in the aftermath of the second world war , seemed to have lost its mojo .
Before the credit crunch , during the calm years that became known as the "" great moderation "" , the IMF 's twin jobs , of emergency lender to hard - pressed countries and guardian of the global system , were both in abeyance .
And as lending declined , its key source of income , from interest payments , fell away .
The IMF periodically issued warnings about the risks of the "" global imbalances "" in the international economy - live - now - pay - later consumption in the US and over - sized trade surpluses and vast foreign currency reserves in rapidly expanding emerging countries such as China .
But plenty of thinktanks offered their own analyses of the world economy without the need for the IMF 's considerable staff and resources , and governments - including Britain 's - felt free to disregard its advice .
In the past 12 months , as a little local difficulty in the US mortgage markets spiralled into a worldwide recession , and with the global economy now expected to shrink in 2009 for the first time in 60 years , the IMF has been triumphantly reborn .
Iceland was the first desperate country to call on it for help - and the first developed country to borrow from it since the UK , in 1976 .
Several others , including the Ukraine and Latvia , soon joined the club ; more , including Turkey , are in fraught negotiations with IMF staff .
Strauss - Kahn arrived at the IMF in the autumn of 2007 determined to rescue it from irrelevance , but it was the credit crunch that really gave it back its job , as what he this weekend called the world 's "" fire - fighter "" .
Even the most ardent campaigners for reform agree he has made a number of key reforms .
"" You have to say things are changing faster than they have before - but it 's still at a snail 's pace , "" says Peter Chowla , of the Bretton Woods Project , a UK thinktank that monitors the IMF .
"" A lot of the credit goes to Strauss - Kahn for pushing changes through . ""
Nevertheless , there is profound concern about the IMF 's new , beefed - up role , especially among those with long memories .
During the Asian crisis of the late 1990s , it imposed stringent conditions on many countries that came to it for help , forcing them to target unrealistically low inflation rates and implement what economists call "" pro - cyclical "" policies - spending cuts and interest rate rises that can exacerbate a downturn , instead of helping .
It used its financial leverage to impose the Washington consensus recipe of financial liberalisation , privatisation and tight budgets ; in many cases , the results were catastrophic .
The IMF 's own independent evaluation office admitted that , in the case of Indonesia , for example , "" the depth of the collapse makes it difficult to argue that things would have been worse without the IMF "" .
The 21st - century IMF would argue it has learned its lessons .
Strauss - Kahn stressed this weekend that countries receiving its loans today are not required to sign up to a lengthy list of specific policy conditions .
He also published a paper saying that the IMF would give countries additional leeway , to ensure they are not forced to cut back on social spending to meet arbitrary macroeconomic targets .
"" I have insisted that we 're focusing on core conditions , not spending too much time on things that may be good for the country , but have nothing to do with the current situation , "" he said .
But an analysis of the new wave of loans , by Mark Weisbrot and colleagues from the Washington - based Centre for Economic Policy Research ( CEPR ) , finds that every one contains pro - cyclical policies .
While the IMF has led the argument for large - scale fiscal stimulus in the rich world to kick - start economic growth , at the same time , the CEPR argues it is still forcing the countries that come to it for emergency loans to cut back on spending and reduce budget deficits .
For example , Pakistan had to promise to cut its deficit from 7.4 % of GDP last year to 4.2 % this year . ""
While this might be a desirable goal , it is questionable whether this reduction should all be done this year , when the economy is suffering from a number of external shocks that are reducing private demand , "" Weisbrot and his co - authors say .
After examining each new crisis loan , they warn that , "" the re - establishment of the IMF as a major power in economic and decision making in low- and middle - income countries , with little or no voice for these countries in the IMF 's decision - making , could have long - term implications for growth , development , and social indicators in many countries "" .
Duncan Green , head of research at Oxfam , says that whatever the message from HQ in Washington , IMF staff on the ground ca n't help handing out tough medicine : "" It 's in their DNA . ""
The IMF 's heavy - handed tactics during the Asian crisis arguably played a role in the chain of events that created the credit crunch .
It was their determination to avoid being forced into the arms of the IMF again that prompted many Asian countries to pile up huge cushions of foreign currency reserves , deliberately running large trade surpluses .
This "" savings glut "" , as it became known , is one side of the so - called global imbalances that left the world economy dangerously out - of - kilter over recent years .
Having all these savings sloshing around encouraged the world 's financial system to become increasingly innovative in finding ways of investing it - including in sliced - and - diced sub - prime mortgages and the full range of other toxic assets at the heart of the financial crisis .
It is partly this harsh lesson that has prompted one of the IMF 's most important innovations - a new lending arrangement called the Flexible Credit Line ( FCL ) , which can effectively act as an overdraft for countries the IMF believes have generally sound policies .
In the past , borrowing from the IMF under its traditional "" stand - by arrangements "" has immediately been interpreted by financial markets - and voters - as a sign of deep distress , but the new facility is meant to remove that stigma .
Mexico , Poland and Colombia have already signed up and others are soon expected to follow .
Jim O'Neill , chief economist of Goldman Sachs , says the FCL is aimed partly at providing countries with an insurance policy so that they no longer feel they have to accumulate such large foreign currency reserves at home by keeping their currencies cheap and running giant trade surpluses .
"" To the extent that the FCL and similar facilities will induce emerging markets to rely less on external demand as the main driver of growth , this should boost consumption and imports in emerging market economies , and help rebalance the global economy , "" he says .
Marita Hutjes , senior policy adviser at Oxfam , agrees that it 's a good thing for governments that qualify , reducing the specific conditions they face on loans .
But she argues that it still leaves a large number of the poorest economies out in the cold .
"" We do think there are serious issues , and countries need access to funds , but it needs to be broader , or something else needs to be available for the poorer countries , "" she says .
"" The IMF constantly says financial stimulus is the right thing to do for those countries that can afford it , so it 's never for the poorest countries , because there 's the assumption that they ca n't pay for it . ""
Donald Kaberuka , head of the African Development Bank , who was invited to the London summit , told a press conference at the IMF that efforts to protect the poorest countries from the credit crunch have so far been "" timid "" .
He warned : "" They 're either debt - creating , not adequate , or not likely to be effective within the time frame that 's needed .
We do n't see how an international crisis of this magnitude can be resolved by ignoring 900 million people in Africa . ""
Sir Bob Geldof , who was in Washington this weekend to press a plan for the IMF to devote more resources from proposed sales of its gold reserves to the poorest countries , let loose a furious outburst about the perils of ignoring the plight of Africa in the credit crunch .
"" All those arguments the activists and the politicians had for many years about aid , or debt cancellation , we can lay them to rest , because we 're all begging for aid , we just call it fiscal stimulus .
And we 're all begging for debt relief , we just call it disposing of toxic assets , "" he said .
In the depths of the worst financial and economic crisis for 60 years , rich countries have so many problems to fix at home - and among their crisis - ridden neighbours , in eastern Europe , for example - there is a risk that many millions of others are still unable to make their voices heard .
Brown had hoped to reach a grand bargain on the future of the Washington financial institutions at the G20 - indeed , in the early planning stages , the London summit was envisaged as a new Bretton Woods , echoing the gathering after the second world war that set up the IMF and the World Bank .
Britain was optimistic that emerging economic powers , especially China , with its huge foreign currency reserves , could be persuaded to stump up more cash for development in exchange for more influence in decision - making .
What emerged was a giant sticking plaster .
There was little new up - front money : much of the trumpeted trebling of IMF resources is still to be found , and the inevitable arguments about influence at the table in Washington were left to another day .
China and Russia said they wanted to see a serious examination of the problems caused by the dominance of the dollar - and by implication the US - over the world economy ; everyone else quietly ignored them .
In fact , the G20 gave Brown himself the job of coming up with sealing the next stage in the process .
He has promised to "" consult widely in an inclusive process and report back to the next meeting with proposals for further reforms to improve the responsiveness and adaptability "" of the Bank and the IMF .
Chowla says the IMF 's future will be mapped out over the next 12 months , as developing countries battle for control over its decision making , and a new generation of desperate governments are thrown into its clutches .
"" It 's all to play for , "" he says .
One thing Britain could do to help seal a reform deal is offer to give up its own seat , and some of its voice , at the IMF , along with France , Belgium and others .
But the more mischievous among the NGOs say that Brown is just as likely to lay the groundwork for a new posting for himself in Washington should the next general election not go Labour 's way .
Strauss - Kahn is clear that he has more plans for radical reform over the next few months .
Referring to a recent magazine article that summed up the reforms he has instituted as building "" IMF 2.0 "" , he insisted : "" We will go further than that : we will have IMF 3.0 . ""
It may be many years before it is clear whether Brown is right and the old Washington consensus has been supplanted by a kinder economic system - or if unleashing the mighty power of a reinvigorated IMF is laying the groundwork for Credit Crunch 2.0 .

The loan arranger : five countries the IMF has helped Iceland : October 2008
Iceland 's over - sized banking sector made the country especially vulnerable to the pressures of the credit crunch .
At the IMF 's annual meetings in October it emerged that a staff team was sent to Reykjavik to talk to the government about a rescue plan .
Iceland received $ 2.1bn ( £ 1.4bn ) - the first developed country to receive an IMF bailout since Britain in 1976 .
In the run up to agreeing the package , it ratcheted up interest rates to 18 % to try and support the krona - a classic piece of pro - cyclical policymaking .
However , rates have since begun to come back down .
Hungary : October 2008
The IMF joined with the EU to offer a combined bailout package to Hungary , totalling $ 25bn , as the plunging forint made its hefty foreign debts impossible to meet .
In return , Budapest promised to cut public spending , bring spiralling deficits under control - a policy that economists warned would exacerbate the recession .
In March , the government of prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány collapsed , amid public fury about painful budget cuts .
Pakistan : November 2008
The credit crunch combined with political instability and the rising threat of terrorism left Pakistan 's finances in a perilous condition , and the IMF agreed to a $ 7.6bn loan facility , the second tranche of which was released this month .
To secure the support , Islamabad pledged to bring its deficit under control and tackle out - of - control inflation .
Latvia : December 2008
The IMF announced just before Christmas that it would lend $ 2.4bn to Latvia as the first instalment of a bailout package , but the next tranche has been halted .
Riga is refusing to take the IMF 's advice and abandon its currency peg to the euro , which the IMF believes is exacerbating the crisis .
The fund is insisting on budget cuts to bring the deficit down to less than 5 % of GDP .
Amid rising social unrest , the government is urging the IMF to allow it to run a larger deficit and warns that it will go bankrupt by June without more help .
Mexico : April 2009
Mexico became the first country to sign up to the IMF 's new Flexible Credit Line , an insurance policy which allows countries to draw down funds as and when they need them - up to $ 47bn in Mexico 's case .
The IMF says there are no conditions attached to this new instrument , but countries must "" pre - qualify , "" by being judged to have good economic policies .
Mexico was joined by Colombia and Poland soon after ."
2009-06-15,"The worst may yet lie ahead for the world economy in the current financial crisis , the head of the International Monetary Fund warned today .
Speaking during a trip to Kazakhstan , Dominique Strauss - Kahn said he largely agreed with the weekend conclusion of finance ministers from the G8 nations that the global economy was showing signs of stabilising after the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
"" Their ( G8 ) stance is that we are beginning to see some green shoots but nevertheless we have to be cautious , "" he said in opening remarks before closed - door talks with the Kazakh prime minister , Karim Masimov .
"" The large part of the worst is not yet behind us . ""
G8 ministers discussed at a meeting in Lecce , Italy , this weekend how to begin withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus they have injected into the world economy in the shape of record low interest rates , big budget deficits and flooding their economies with money .
Strauss - Kahn referred to credit growth as a sign that financial activity was beginning to pick up but did not say whether the IMF was ready to help with a possible "" exit strategy "" once economic recovery is certain .
Dollar gains The dollar rose broadly against other currencies today in the wake of the G8 meeting and after Russia said the US currency 's role as the world 's main reserve currency was unlikely to change in the near future .
Russia had last week raised the idea of moving some of its reserves out of US treasury securities .
The CBI warned today that Britain 's recovery will be delayed until 2010 , and cast doubt on the view increasingly held in the City that recent "" green shoots "" of recovery mean the recession is all but over .
Richard Lambert , the CBI director general , said the UK would suffer from the worsening of the world recession , which would continue to limit lending by banks and drag down consumer spending in the UK 's export markets .
Separately , Eurostat reported that eurozone employment plunged by a record 0.8 % , or 1.22 million people , in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2008 .
That was twice the drop seen in the fourth quarter and the third successive quarterly drop in employment .
As a result , eurozone employment was down by 1.2 % year - on - year in the first quarter of 2009 .
All of the major eurozone economies suffered employment declines in the first quarter , particularly Spain ."
2009-09-17,"It sounds more like the plot of a Hollywood thriller than a matter to be investigated by a global financial institution : a tale of improbably vast amounts of money and gold smuggled across international borders by a cast of shady characters .
But the International Monetary Fund has been asked to look into the mysterious appearance of more than £ 11bn in the Turkish treasury , amid allegations that the money was illegally spirited out of Iran .
Three Iranian opposition politicians – including a former foreign minister , Ebrahim Yazdi – have written to the IMF 's managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , saying the money belongs to Iran and should be returned .
The money is credited with stabilising Turkey 's economy .
But its origins have come under scrutiny after an Iranian businessman , Esmael Safarian - Nasab , claimed he had exported $ 7.5bn ( £ 4.5bn ) in cash and gold bullion worth $ 11.5bn into Turkey via Germany as part of a joint venture with a Turkish business partner .
Safarian - Nasab 's Turkish lawyer , Senol Ozel , said the money and gold were seized by customs officials last October and transferred to government coffers .
Some Turkish media outlets claim it had been smuggled across Turkey 's border with Iran in trucks .
Turkish media have pointed out that the sums matched an $ 18.5bn windfall announced late last year by Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Turkey 's prime minister .
Economists say it saved the country from seeking a new IMF loan .
Erdogan appeared to attribute the cash to divine intervention .
"" Turkey 's God is great , he injected $ 18.5bn into the Turkish economy in these hard economic times , "" he announced .
Officials , including the central bank governor , Dormuz Yilmaz , have dismissed reports that the money was Iranian and the intelligence ministry threatened to prosecute "" false "" reports .
Some Turkish economists said the money was a dividend from a government amnesty that enabled investors with overseas assets to bring them back without penalty .
Ozel has since issued a public apology , saying he was hoodwinked .
Yazdi and his fellow correspondents , Ahmad Sadr Haj - Javadi , a leading member of Iran 's Freedom movement , and Ezatollah Sahabi , general secretary of National Religious party wrote to the IMF after Erdogan failed to answer an earlier letter . ""
Although the identity of the person who claims to be the owner of this money is mentioned in the attached documents , the real owner is the Iranian nation , "" they wrote .
Yazdi said he expected Strauss - Kahn to launch an investigation . ""
The gentleman who claims that money belongs to him says it comes from Iran , "" Yazdi told the Guardian .
"" I do n't know this man or who he is , but it all seems very strange . """
2009-11-08,"A row blew up last night after Gordon Brown promoted plans for an international tax on City dealing that could raise funds for the world 's poor and help developing countries tackle climate change .
No sooner had the prime minister floated the idea of a tax on bank transactions than it was shot down by US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner , Canadian finance minister Jim Flaherty and Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the IMF .
At a G20 meeting in St Andrews , Scotland , Brown said the "" social contract "" between financiers and the British public had broken down and needed to change .
Keen to show that Labour would be tougher on bankers than the Conservatives , who are leading the row over bonuses , the prime minister urged fellow world leaders to back plans for a "" transaction tax "" , which could be used to meet the costs of future banking bailouts , and to fund development projects , including helping developing countries to develop greener technology .
However , he then suffered a series of rebuffs – led by Geithner , who said that "" a day - by - day financial transaction tax is not something we are prepared to support "" .
The reality is that without American backing the move would collapse .
Flaherty said : "" We are not in the business of raising taxes , we are in the business of lowering taxes in Canada .
It is not an idea we would look at . ""
Strauss - Kahn was also unimpressed , saying he believed such a tax was unlikely to be adopted as "" transactions "" were difficult to measure .
Brown had demanded that "" there must be a better economic and social contract between financial institutions and the public based on trust and a just distribution of risks and rewards "" .
He stressed that for the levy to work , it would need to be implemented worldwide . ""
Let me be clear : Britain will not move unless others move with us .
"" I do not in any way underestimate the enormous and difficult practical and technical issues that will need to be overcome that a globally cohesive system raises .
But I do not think these difficulties should prevent us from considering with urgency the legitimate issues I have discussed . ""
Following his success last year in leading the international debate on the rescue of banks , the prime minister is determined to push himself forward as a leader of other global initiatives such as the fights to limit climate change and to combat poverty in the developing world .
But on this occasion his views received , at best , a mixed reception .
After Brown 's intervention , G20 finance ministers asked IMF experts to complete by April a detailed study on how such a tax could be levied , to allow world leaders to make a decision on whether it should be implemented .
The prime minister 's conversion to the idea , which is commonly known as a "" Tobin tax "" after the Nobel prize - winning economist who first proposed it , stunned the anti - poverty campaigners who have long fought to force a transaction tax on to the economic agenda and have been repeatedly rebuffed by a pro - City Labour government . ""
A tax on banks would be a major step towards clearing up the mess caused by their greed , "" said Max Lawson , senior policy adviser at Oxfam .
"" People are n't just losing their jobs .
The economic crisis is killing people in Africa .
We must see the banks pay back something . ""
Claire Melamed , head of policy at ActionAid , said : "" If world leaders ca n't take the bankers by the scruff of the neck and start shaking the transaction tax out of them at this point , then they never will .
This is a test of whether we can force the financiers to make a bigger contribution to society , from which they make their profits . ""
Global revenues from the tax could be up to £ 420bn a year , according to an authoritative Austrian study .
They would be divided between the country where the trading took place and an international fund , which could be used to tackle poverty or climate change .
For Britain , with its status as one of the world 's largest financial centres , if just half the revenues were retained by the Treasury , it could bring a windfall of £ 45bn .
France and Germany have championed the tax , but until now the British government has resisted it ."
2009-11-12,"Two top Treasury officials have been sent to Washington under orders from Gordon Brown to press the International Monetary Fund to drop its objections to a tax on all City trades .
Britain hopes to win the backing of France , Germany and other supporters of a so - called "" Tobin tax , "" to persuade the IMF 's managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn to climb down after he appeared to rule out the idea last weekend .
Strauss - Kahn stressed the practical obstacles to a transaction tax , putting himself at odds with Alistair Darling and his fellow G20 finance ministers , who had asked the IMF to examine the issue in a report to be published by next April .
Government sources said there was a consensus among pro - Tobin tax countries that Strauss - Kahn had overstepped the mark in appearing to pre - empt the findings of work the IMF had not yet carried out .
Brown said the international tax , which could be levied on all financial transactions including currency trading and share sales , could be used as insurance against a future financial crash ; but development campaigners hope some of the proceeds can also be used to combat poverty .
The deadline for the IMF study was brought forward by G20 finance ministers when they met at St Andrew 's last weekend .
This was after Brown threw his weight behind the idea in a major speech in Edinburgh , in which he said the "" social contract "" between the financial sector and the rest of the country had broken down .
Like Strauss - Kahn , the US treasury secretary Tim Geithner was also caught off - guard by Brown 's unexpected support for the controversial tax last weekend , and told reporters it was "" not something we are prepared to support , "" leaving the government 's hopes of securing international agreement looking shaky .
But Britain is determined not to let the idea drop , and government sources said the senior Treasury team , which has already flown to the US capital , would hold meetings with representatives of other G20 economies and senior IMF staff .
"" We will be engaging constructively , "" said the source .
French president Nicolas Sarkozy has expressed support for the idea , and German chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested the revenue could help with "" climate finance "" – helping poor countries to cope with global warming .
A coalition of international trade unions and charities has written to the IMF to demand that the report , which is meant to look at ways of dampening down speculation in financial markets , be as wide - ranging as possible .
Strauss - Kahn , a former French finance minister , is due to speak at the CBI 's annual business conference later this month , and is likely to face questions about his stance on a transaction tax .
Brown had long objected to the idea , but has recently been converted to it as a way of ensuring that financial institutions bear more of the costs of dealing with crises ."
2009-11-23,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy is still in a "" highly fragile "" state following the financial crisis , and could face further turmoil in the months ahead .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the IMF , said the world economy was currently stuck in a "" holding pattern "" , just over a year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
He said it was essential that world leaders continue to work together , and argued it is too early to start reversing the various stimulus measures implemented around the globe . ""
Financial conditions have improved but are far from normal , "" Strauss - Kahn told business leaders at the CBI 's annual conference in London . ""
Signs show confidence returning , but banking systems in many advanced economies remain undercapitalised , weighed down by leaden legacy assets and , increasingly , underperforming loans . ""
On the household side , weak financial positions and high unemployment will damp down on consumption for some time … and large public deficits add to vulnerabilities . ""
Strauss - Kahn said there were four key challenges facing world leaders – exit strategies , capital flows to emerging markets , sources of future growth and financial regulation .
Support for a Tobin tax ?
Strauss - Kahn had recently ruled out a transaction tax on City profits , such as a new version of the "" Tobin tax "" which prime minister Gordon Brown is lobbying for .
Today , though , the IMF head softened his position – and even appeared to acknowledge Brown 's efforts in this area .
"" This is a very lively debate , and there are many good ideas being floated – especially here in the United Kingdom . ""
The G20 leaders have asked the IMF to examine the whole area of financial sector taxes .
Strauss - Kahn said the issue is a "" delicate balancing act "" given the current weak state of the financial sector .
But he also indicated that the current lack of agreement could be storing up future problems .
"" There is no magic bullet , but one possible answer is to reduce regulatory uncertainty .
Lay out the future requirements and the timescale for implementation .
Right now , regulatory uncertainty is throwing up some perverse incentives – it might be encouraging a risk - taking culture , a Mardi Gras effect whereby financial institutions party now in expectation of lean times to come .
"" Staying on course
Despite its concern about public deficits , the IMF believes it is still too early to start unwinding the various efforts to stimulate economic activity .
"" Exiting too early is costlier than exiting too late , "" Strauss - Kahn cautioned .
He argued that "" progressive tax systems "" might be needed to prevent the poor suffering when the time does come to start balancing the books .
The IMF also thinks that central banks should raise interest rates before starting to reverse "" unconventional methods "" such as quantitative easing . ""
Especially in many advanced economies , monetary policy can afford to stay accommodative for some time , given little sign of inflation on the horizon . ""
While the UK is still in recession , many emerging markets are now enjoying strong economic growth again .
This is leading to a surge of capital into those countries , Strauss - Kahn warned .
"" On one hand , we want capital to flow towards emerging markets …
but these flows can clearly be destabilising .
They could lead to exchange rate overshooting , asset price bubbles , and financial instability . ""
In the long term , the world economy needs sustained growth .
According to Strauss - Kahn , we are on the verge of a new paradigm where China generates the demand that was once provided by consumers in countries such as America . ""
Households in the United States and elsewhere propelled the global economy with their voracious appetite for consumption , soaking up imports from countries that relied heavily on exports to grow .
In retrospect , this model had major fault lines – much of the consumption was financed by an addiction to cheap and easy credit , and this flow was turned off , cold - turkey style , by the financial crisis . """
2009-12-10,"In an effort to stem the appreciation of its currency , the real , Brazil has twice resorted to capital controls .
In response to these measures , IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn says capital controls are "" not something that come from hell "" , but the IMF wo n't be recommending them any time soon to remedy the current crisis .
Enough is enough .
Given the economic evidence and in the wake of the current crisis , the IMF should change more than its rhetoric and do away with its Washington consensus policies by encouraging Brazil to strengthen its capital controls , not eliminate them .
In some ways Brazil is a victim of its own success .
With US and other western interest rates low and concern about the weakening of the US dollar high , investors have flocked to emerging markets .
Brazil has been the most attractive , having rebounded much better than most .
Brazil started growing again in the second quarter of 2009 and is set to grow by 3.5 % in 2009 .
However , massive capital inflows this year have caused the Brazilian real to appreciate 34 % on the dollar and over 40 % over the Chinese yuan .
This could make Brazil 's exports less attractive , accentuate its current account balance , and potentially make Brazil slide back into its crisis - ridden 1990s .
In response to these shocks , on 20 October Brazil placed a 2 % tax on foreign exchange inflows .
At first the controls seemed to have a positive effect .
Shortly after they were announced the real slid by 2 % and the stock market by 3 % .
Yet both markets regained ground .
Despite the IMF 's intransigence , taxes on inflows like Brazil 's have a good track record .
In a recent report by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) , Carmen Reinhart and Nicholas Magud assess the most rigorous studies on capital controls and conclude "" in sum , capital controls on inflows seem to make monetary policy more independent , alter the composition of capital flows and reduce real exchange rate pressures .
"" Why then have Brazil 's controls not had the desired effects ?
There are two reasons .
First , the level of Brazil 's tax is too low relative to the more successful cases analysed by Reinhart and Magud .
Second , in globalised financial system , investors increasingly learn how to circumvent capital controls .
Two of Brazil 's neighbours , Chile and Colombia , have successfully used taxes on capital inflows .
To dampen the effects of massive inflows in the wake of the earlier crises , both nations deployed an unremunerated reserve requirement ( URR ) .
A URR is a mandatory non - interest - bearing deposit in foreign currency at the Central Bank for a certain period in an amount proportional to the size of the capital flow ( 30 % for Chile , 47 % for Colombia ) .
The tax equivalent of Chile 's controls averaged 4.24 % and was as high as 7.7 % .
Colombia 's ranged from 6.4 % to 13.6 % .
Each of these tax equivalents is almost two to seven times stronger than Brazil 's current controls .
Another reason why Brazil 's controls are n't working is because investors have invented creative ways to circumvent them .
According to another NBER report , by Bernandro Carvalho and Marcio Garcia , investors have loopholed controls by disguising short - term capital as foreign direct investment , through currency swaps and other derivatives , and by purchasing American depositary receipts ( ADRs ) .
ADRs are issued by US banks and allow investors to buy shares of firms outside the US – enabling investors to purchase Brazilian shares but in New York and thereby skirt controls in Brazil .
In a step in the right direction , on November 18 , Brazil moved to put a 1.5 % tax on ADRs to stem speculating around the October controls .
Thus , a Brazilian bank or investor that deposits shares with foreign banks will be charged the tax .
How much is enough ?
At the time of writing it is not clear that Brazil 's capital controls are stiff enough , or loophole - free enough .
Rather than scorn Brazil , the IMF should be working to help Brazil design stronger and more effective ways to stem the rapid appreciation of its exchange rate .
Enough with the business as usual , the IMF must change to reflect economic thinking and 21st century realities ."
2010-03-08,"The head of the International Monetary Fund believes Greece will resolve its debt crisis without an IMF bailout , and today dismissed fears that other European nations will be engulfed by the crisis .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn insisted this morning that other eurozone countries with large public deficits would not be forced into the same predicament as Greece .
Speaking to Reuters in Nairobi , Strauss - Kahn said the wider European economy was still strong - despite fears that Greece might default on its debts .
While the IMF is poised to assist Greece if needed , Strauss - Kahn remains confident that Europe 's leaders could resolve the issue .
"" The eurozone wants to deal with the problem itself , and I can understand that , "" he said .
"" I think they can do it …
and we 're just here to help . ""
Strauss - Kahn also argued that those who claim that Spain or Ireland could suffer a debt default are simply trying to "" scare "" the financial markets .
"" We have a problem with Greece .
We do n't have a problem with Spain to date .
The eurozone has to deal with the Greek problem .
They are doing this , "" said Strauss - Kahn .
"" No one knows what 's going to happen tomorrow morning
but there 's no reason why the spillover to Portugal or to Spain will take place , "" he added .
Portugal , Ireland , Italy and Spain have been grouped with Greece as the "" Pigs "" ( or sometimes "" Piigs "" ) .
Each of them has seen the cost of insuring their debt rise , as the financial markets question whether they can repay their borrowings .
Today , the Portuguese government announced an austerity budget in an effort to cut its deficit to below 3 % of GDP by 2013 .
The country 's deficit is currently running at more than 8 % .
Those earning more than € 150,000 ( £ 135,000 ) a year will see their tax rate rise from 42 % to 45 % , and public sector wages will be capped at the rate of inflation .
Spending on social security and healthcare will be cut , and Portugal will also look to raise € 6bn by selling stakes in various companies . '
Standing together '
Strauss - Kahn 's comments came just hours after Nicolas Sarkozy pledged French support for the beleaguered Greek economy .
The president of France said the eurozone stood side by side with Greece because "" That 's what partners are for . ""
Greek prime minister George Papandreou said he hoped Sarkozy 's comments would help Greece to borrow money at more reasonable rates .
With a € 300bn national debt , Greece needs to borrow around € 53bn this year alone - even with the public spending cuts and tax rises that have prompted a wave of strikes in recent weeks .
A further two - day stoppage has been called for Thursday and Friday to protest at these austerity measures .
Last week Greece succeeded in selling € 5bn of bonds to institutional investors - bolstering hopes that the country could fix its ailing economy without a formal bailout from the IMF .
Papandreou is undertaking a whistle - stop tour of world capitals in an effort to drum up backing for Greece .
He has now flown to America ahead of a meeting at the White House tomorrow , where he is expected to ask for President Barack Obama 's support to resolve the crisis .
The US administration is expected to push Papandreou to deliver on his commitment to send Greek troops to Afghanistan .
Papandreou will also hold talks with the US treasury secretary , Tim Geithner ."
2010-03-19,"The International Monetary Fund has called for a European "" fire brigade "" funded by the finance industry to deal with the collapse of banks that operate in several countries .
Managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn urged the European Union to create a European resolution authority to deal with insolvent banks that would force shareholders and uninsured creditors – rather than taxpayers –to bear the costs of failure .
The authority would be funded by the financial industry from deposit insurance fees and levies on institutions , he said .
"" What I think is needed is a European resolution authority , armed with the mandate and the tools to deal cost - effectively with failing cross - border banks – an ex - ante [ before the event ] solution to the problems that currently hamper co - operation in crisis situations , rather than an ex - post one , "" Strauss - Kahn told a conference in Brussels today .
"" It should cover at least the major cross - border banking groups , as well as all banks running large - scale cross - border operations under the single passport . ""
Such a body could prevent a repeat of the debacle seen after Fortis collapsed in 2008 .
The Benelux lender had to be bailed out by the governments of Holland , Belgium and Luxembourg , at a total cost of € 11.2bn ( £ 9.99bn ) .
The fiasco toppled the Belgian government .
"" The difficulty of finding agreement across borders led to a likely costly break - up of Fortis along national lines , "" Strauss - Kahn said .
"" And taxpayers in many countries are paying the price for crisis management and resolution frameworks that insufficiently protected their interests . ""
Strauss - Kahn said existing plans "" have proven to be inadequate "" and make cross - border bank failures difficult to handle and more costly than necessary .
He said the reform of the supervisory and regulatory framework currently before the European Parliament was important , but needed to be matched by an "" integrated EU crisis management and resolution framework "" .
Its main objective should be "" cost - effectiveness , in a broad sense – minimising contagion , collateral damage to the economy , losses to depositors , and costs to government budgets "" .
The system would need access to a fiscal back - up mechanism , he said , with a mechanism of burden - sharing between governments .
The European Union has unveiled draft legislation to toughen the policing of financial institutions and avoid another banking meltdown .
It plans to create a super - watchdog and a new European supervisory body that would warn of early signs of trouble ."
2010-09-13,"The International Monetary Fund undermined the main thrust of the UK coalition 's economic strategy today after it warned western governments that they risked holding back the recovery and creating a massive pool of disaffected labour if they pursued draconian cuts in spending .
IMF director general , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , told a conference in Oslo that governments needed to identify ways to generate employment to prevent a generation of workers losing their skills and joining the long - term unemployed .
He said cuts in public spending had a "" human cost "" and could result in "" tragedy "" for millions of young people .
His speech will add to pressure on the chancellor , George Osborne , after the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) , the rich nations ' thinktank , said last week that cutting budget deficits this year risked derailing economic recovery .
Analysis by the IMF and the OECD is expected to feature in campaigns by trade unions and rivals for the Labour leadership at the TUC conference this week .
Ed Balls , the Labour leadership candidate , said the government needed to scrap much of its programme of cuts in favour of projects that create jobs and generate growth .
The shadow chancellor , Alistair Darling , said the reports from the OECD and IMF showed the prevailing economic analysis was firmly allied to Labour 's argument for cuts to be delayed until the economic recovery was secure and unemployment falling .
Strauss - Kahn said : "" The labour market is in dire straits .
The Great Recession has left behind a wasteland of unemployment , and this devastation threatens the livelihood , security and dignity of millions of people across the world . ""
He said the severity of the recession was in part to blame , but also how the fallout from the recession affected particular sectors .
In a reference to the UK , Ireland , Spain and the US , which suffered a banking crisis made worse by the after - effects of a housing bubble , he said : "" Job loss was greatest in countries where housing and financial markets collapsed .
Most of this came from manufacturing and construction , showing that ordinary workers have paid the price for mistakes made elsewhere . ""
The International Labour Organisation , which hosted the conference with the IMF and Norwegian government , has estimated that 34 million more people worldwide are unemployed as a result of the crisis .
The latest data on unemployment showed the increase took the total unemployment figure to about 210 million , which is the highest level of official unemployment in history .
With 45 million new job seekers a year entering the labour force , Strauss - Kahn said the situation was likely to worsen . ""
And what about the human costs ?
This is the real tragedy , "" he said .
"" Unemployment leads to a loss of earnings that is both substantial and long - lasting , especially among younger people .
The crisis hit them especially hard .
"" We must not underestimate the daunting prospect we face : a lost generation , disconnected from the labour market , with a progressive loss of skills and motivation . ""
And the human costs do not end there , "" he added .
"" If you lose your job , you are more likely to suffer from health problems , or even die younger .
If you lose your job , your children are likely to do worse in school .
If you lose your job , you are less likely to have faith in public institutions and democracy . """
2010-10-06,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund , has warned governments against using exchange rates as a "" policy weapon "" – saying a currency war risks undermining the global economic recovery .
What is this international currency war I 'm hearing about ?
Brazil 's finance minister Guido Mantega coined the phrase last week .
Around the world , countries are manipulating their currencies to gain a competitive advantage in trade .
The IMF is taking the problem seriously , with strong comments from its head this week , who said governments risked a currency war by using exchange rates to solve their own domestic problems , which in turn could derail the global recovery .
What is actually happening ?
America has printed a lot of money to kickstart its stagnant economy and this has weakened the dollar , thereby making dollar assets less attractive to foreign investors .
So , chasing high returns , all this hot money has been flowing into emerging markets like Brazil , which came through the global crisis relatively unscathed .
According to investment bank Goldman Sachs , Brazil 's real is the most overvalued major currency in the world .
Emerging economies from Brazil to Taiwan are desperately trying to stem the capital inflows to prevent their currencies rising further .
But I thought a strong currency was a symbol of economic health ?
Germany 's Deutschmark was legendary .
But in times of economic trouble countries prefer a low currency because it makes exporters ' goods and services more competitive abroad .
Many countries , including Britain , are ( partly ) counting on exports to pull their economies out of the downturn , especially because tax hikes and spending cuts are going to hit domestic demand ( consumers and businesses ) hard .
However , IMF chief Strauss - Kahn has warned that devaluing currencies could backfire as the resulting volatility poses a "" serious risk "" to the global recovery .
What impact will the hostilities have ?
Economists fear that some countries ' attempts to weaken their currencies are resulting in increased currency volatility and instability – which makes it harder to come up with a co - ordinated policy response to the downturn , amid fears of a renewed slowdown .
Central bankers like Mervyn King have long warned of the impact of global imbalances ( such as America 's trade deficit versus China 's huge surplus ) , which he said was one of the key factors in the global downturn .
So how do you devalue a currency ?
Put simply , countries can sell their currency to try to bring its value down .
The Bank of Japan recently intervened in foreign exchange markets to sell the yen , but the impact was short - lived .
Switzerland began selling Swiss francs on foreign exchanges last year and Israel has also admitted that without intervention , its currency would be much stronger .
In a fixed exchange rate system the authorities formally set a new fixed rate with respect to a foreign reference currency .
For example , in January Venezuela devalued the bolivar for the first time since 2005 , slashing its value against the dollar .
Are there any other ways a country can weaken its currency ?
There are a host of measures , from cutting interest rates to buying foreign assets .
The Bank of Japan has reinstated its zero interest rate policy – which reduces returns on Japanese investments , thereby making it less attractive for foreign investors to own them – while Brazil doubled a tax on foreign investors buying local bonds to put a lid on a recent rally in its currency .
China wants to buy Greek bonds , ostensibly as a sign of confidence in the country 's ability to escape default , but European policymakers are worried that this would push up the euro against the yuan .
What has Britain done ?
Along with the US , Britain has flooded the economy with liquidity through quantitative easing ( with possibly another round to come ) and kept interest rates extremely low , effectively devaluing its currency .
What are the implications for consumers ?
Consumers wo n't be happy with a weak currency .
Your pound will be worth less on holiday and prices will rise in Britain as imported goods become more expensive .
In the long run this means that interest rates will have to go up to combat higher inflation ."
2010-10-06,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund , has warned that an international currency war risks undermining the global recovery .
Here is what he and other policymakers around the world have said about exchange rates recently .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , IMF managing director ( 5 October )
There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate that currencies can be used as a policy weapon .
Translated into action , such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the global recovery ...
Any such approach would have a negative and very damaging longer - run impact .
Joseph Stiglitz , Nobel economics laureate ( 5 October )
The irony is that the Fed is creating all this liquidity with the hope that it will revive the American economy .
It 's doing nothing for the American economy , but it 's causing chaos over the rest of the world .
It 's a very strange policy that they are pursuing .
Jean - Claude Juncker , chairman of eurozone finance ministers ( 5 October )
China 's real effective exchange rate remains undervalued .
The Chinese authorities do not share our view .
Subir Gokarn , India 's central bank deputy governor ( 5 October )
It is becoming a larger global problem because of the imbalance , that there is so much of liquidity and the returns are skewed towards emerging markets .
So it is emerging as a potential threat and we are clearly thinking of ways in which we can deal with it .
Robert Zoellick , World Bank president ( 4 October )
I do n't foresee that we 're moving into an era of global currency wars but there are clearly going to be tensions .
Money is chasing yield .
It ca n't find those yields in developed economies and this is not only pushing up currency values in developing countries ... [ but ] also pushing up prices in assets with the risk of bubbles in property and some commodities .
Stanley Fischer , Israel 's central bank governor ( 3 October )
There is no doubt that without intervention the shekel would be much stronger .
But we are not China –
we are not going to buy $ 500bn next year .
Perng Fai - nan , Taiwan 's central bank governor ( 30 September )
The US printed a lot of money , so there 's a lot of hot money flowing around .
We see hot money in Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia .
These short - term capital flows are disturbing emerging economies .
Henrique Meirelles , Brazil 's central bank governor ( 29 September )
Evidently , there is a very serious currency problem which should be addressed .
It 's not necessarily a war .
Some countries seem to have a problem ...
Brazil is not going to pay the price .
Guido Mantega , Brazil 's finance minister ( 27 September )
We 're in the midst of an international currency war .
This threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness .
Chen Jian , China 's commerce vice - minister ( 27 September ) on proposed US bill to force China to allow the yuan to rise in value
We 'll make a decision based on our own economic development levels and the world economic situation .
If it takes the yuan to appreciate for our economy to develop , we will do it even though it would have negative impact .
But it is redundant for the US Congress to pass the proposal .
Yoshihiko Noda , Japanese finance minister ( 17 September ) on Japan 's intervention to weaken the yen
I 'm aware that there are various opinions .
But Japan 's stance is that a prolonged yen rise is undesirable as the economy remains in a severe situation with ongoing deflation .
It is important to consistently explain our stance to the international community .
Jean - Claude Juncker ( 15 September )
Unilateral actions are not the appropriate way to deal with global imbalances ."
2010-10-07,"The International Monetary Fund demanded new bank taxes and tougher financial supervision today warning that a return of "" business as usual "" risked sowing the seeds of the next crisis .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's managing director , said two new taxes on banks were needed to provide an insurance fund for future financial meltdowns and to curb excessive risktaking .
His remarks coincided with comments by the EU tax commissioner Algirdas Šemeta , who said the financial sector was "" undertaxed "" .
He outlined an idea to tax profits and remuneration that could raise € 25bn ( £ 22bn ) across the EU 's 27 states if set at 5 % of banks ' profits and wages .
His proposal is separate to George Osborne 's plan to tax banks ' balance sheets – raising about £ 2bn a year – although the Treasury said last night that it intended to hold "" further discussions with its EU partners about the benefits of a financial activities tax on certain profits and remuneration "" .
The EU has also considered a financial transactions tax ( FTT ) on stocks , bonds or foreign currency but said it would only work if applied globally .
Speaking in Washington , Strauss - Kahn slapped down the idea for such a wide - ranging financial transactions tax .
At a press conference ahead of this weekend 's annual meeting of the Fund , he said the "" Robin Hood tax "" was not the right way to tackle speculation .
Instead , the IMF favours a bank levy and a financial activities tax on the sector 's profits and pay . ""
Yes , we believe a tax on the financial sector is useful , "" Strauss - Kahn said .
"" But , no , we do n't believe the FTT is the best way to do it . ""
He said taxation should be used with regulation and supervision to tackle the problems exposed by the crisis of recent years .
But the fund did not see an FTT as the best way to address reckless behaviour by banks because it was "" a bad proxy for speculation that you want to address . ""
Strauss - Kahn said the IMF was worried about banks returning to old ways of doing business .
"" It is not the right way to go back to business as usual , and there is a risk … despite the efforts which have been made to enhance and adapt supervision . ""
Failure to find a global approach to supervision would result in different systems around the world , he said .
"" That is an important risk because loopholes in the system are the seeds for the next crisis . ""
The IMF has been repeatedly insisting since the beginning of the crisis that to repair the financial sector we need to do a lot on regulation but we also need to do a lot on supervision and crisis resolution …
it would be unfair to say nothing has been done but very little has been done . ""
In proposing an EU - wide tax on bank profits and pay , the commission gave few clues about how the money collected should be handled .
Osborne argues that any funds should be put to general use while other finance ministers have argued that the proceeds could be used as a type of bailout fund for the next bank failures ."
2010-10-10,"The world 's foreign exchange markets are bracing themselves for fresh turbulence after weekend talks at the International Monetary Fund failed to ease fears of a currency war .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn said the time for talk was over after the fund 's main policy body made little progress in settling the row between Washington and Beijing over China 's alleged manipulation of its currency . ""
The problem is that we can talk and talk and talk , "" said the IMF 's managing director after it released a communique pledging member countries to "" move toward a more balanced pattern of global growth , recognising the responsibilities of surplus and deficit countries "" .
Strauss - Kahn fears a "" race to the bottom "" as countries seek to depress the value of their currency to export their way out of recession .
He said : "" The language is ineffective .
The language is not going to change things .
Policy has to be adapted .
What we need is real action , and I do n't believe that this action can be done in another way , in a non - co - operative way . ""
Finance ministers and central bank governors expressed concern about the deteriorating atmosphere , which has seen Japan weaken the yen and China warn that American demands for a sharp revaluation of the renminbi would lead to social and economic unrest .
Last week , the dollar fell sharply against the yen and the euro .
Tim Geithner , the US treasury secretary , kept up the pressure on Beijing following the meeting of the IMF 's international monetary and financial committee , the organisation 's steering body .
He said the IMF should increase the "" candour "" of its surveillance of the exchange rate policies of member countries , which was leading them to build huge foreign exchange reserves . ""
Excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , and is inhibiting the international adjustment process , "" Geithner said .
He added that the big emerging countries , like China , should only have their demands met for a greater say in the running of the IMF if they moved towards "" more market - oriented exchange rate policies that will reduce reliance on exports and strengthen domestic demand "" .
The US was supported by European and Japanese policymakers .
Olli Rehn , the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs , said : "" Going forward , risks of excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates should be avoided in view of their adverse implications for economic and financial stability .
In this respect , the Chinese authorities are encouraged to implement soon a more flexible exchange rate regime for the renminbi . ""
Yoshihiko Noda , Japan 's finance minister , said : "" A massive flow of funds from developed countries into emerging markets has caused the appreciation of local currencies and a surge in asset prices in emerging markets .
Furthermore , these emerging markets are unable to implement monetary easing policies out of fear of renewed inflation .
"" It is not sustainable that certain countries achieve growth while imposing costs on other countries . ""
China 's deputy central bank governor , Yi Gang , said China was committed to a more flexible exchange rate but added that action was also required by developed countries such as the US in order to alleviate the global imbalance between surplus and deficit nations .
Meanwhile Thailand 's finance minister , Korn Chatikavanij , said : "" The fact that there seems to be lack of agreement as to what needs to be done at the global level with the major economies is of concern to us . ""
There seems to be a race to the bottom – US dollar , euro , renminbi – and that 's very problematic . ""
At Beijing 's insistence , the IMF communique said a priority was to have "" strong and even - handed surveillance to uncover vulnerabilities in large advanced countries .
"" Emerging countries have long complained that the fund has taken a soft approach with the US , reserving its stiffest policy advice for poor nations .
Strauss - Kahn said that instead of looking at the big five economies – the US , China , Japan , the euro zone and Britain – individually , the IMF would study them collectively to ensure policy advice was consistent with reducing global imbalances .
He added that a deal to provide emerging economies with more clout at the fund was only "" days or weeks away , "" but said power came with responsibility . ""
What I have heard , and which makes sense , is that when countries want a bigger quota – to have more say , more voice , more influence at the IMF – then they must also share the problems of the whole , "" said Strauss - Kahn .
"" You can not be at the centre and be a free rider .
The more you are at the centre , the more you need to play your part in stabilising the whole system .
Oxfam spokesman Mark Fried , said : "" Thousands of people have flown in from all over the world for these meetings , and there 's been no movement on any issues of significance .
"" There 's been a fight about currencies , and developing countries seem to have been forgotten : and hard decisions about reforming the way the IMF does business have been deferred . """
2010-10-16,"Those who run the International Monetary Fund are supreme financial diplomats .
They talk the opaque language of financial final communiques , the honed compromises between the great economic powers .
So when Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF managing director , acknowledged that the language of a recent IMF summit communique was "" ineffective "" , that the time for "" real action "" had come and that he feared "" a race to the bottom "" as the major countries began to outdo each other in beggar - my - neighbour currency wars , you should sit up and listen .
The problem is that we can talk and talk and talk , he said , but in the end something has to happen – and it has not .
If countries chose not to co - operate in unravelling the problems facing the world economy , we all faced disaster .
The United States blames China for the impasse , saying it was manipulating its currency to export unemployment to stagnation - stricken America .
China blames the US for flooding the world with dollars and taking no responsibility as the hegemonic power for the fiscal and monetary discipline necessary to underpin the world 's key currency .
Fears are growing that next month 's G20 meeting in Seoul will reveal the lack of co - operation .
It was the collapse of collaboration at the London summit in 1931 that launched the trade and currency policies that prolonged depression .
Will history repeat itself ?
The US is preparing to declare unilateral economic war on China by further swelling the flood of dollars when next month it adopts an American form of quantitative easing to boost anaemic levels of bank lending .
China will be swamped by yet more dollars displaced from the US , but is determined , as the governor of the Bank of China , Zhou Xiaochuan , repeated , to move with extreme gradualism on its currency , if it moves at all .
Both , as in the early 1930s , imagine they can get better results by going it alone .
And if they square up to each other , the rest of the world has no option but to protect itself , the dynamic that caused the competitive devaluations and trade protection of the 1930s .
This is the background to this week 's statement by chancellor George Osborne in which he will announce the fastest , deepest cuts in public spending ever mounted by a government in modern times .
Given the risks , the right policy would have been to embed flexibility in Britain 's spending , taxing and borrowing plans so the government could move fast to adjust to whatever happens .
It is not what will be announced .
There was no need for such haste .
Just as we took a decade to solve our problems after the crises of the mid-1970s and early 1990s , so we could have done the same today – aggressively cutting the deficit only when recovery is more assured .
After all , it has never been easier to sell government debt .
Equally , if more of the burden of deficit reduction had been shouldered by planned tax increases , they could have been quickly deferred or abandoned to boost the economy if world economic prospects darkened .
The haste to cut so blindly and so crudely , unless we are very lucky , will be seen by future historians as one of the great acts of economic folly .
Optimists insist China and the US will draw back from economic war and that the risks are manageable .
The Chinese have let the yuan go up by 2 % over the last two months , and are pledged to lower their trade surplus .
After all , with foreign exchange reserves of $ 2.6 trillion , the highest of any country in history , the only way China can carry on acquiring reserves on this scale without risking massive inflation is through even more draconian controls on its banking system .
Change would seem rational .
On Friday , President Obama deferred for another 90 days the launch of another weapon in the US 's economic arsenal – naming China as a currency manipulator and unilaterally imposing American tariffs on Chinese imports – in the hope that China was retreating .
There could yet be a deal in Korea .
But China 's economic model is built on sky - high saving and phenomenal export growth , especially to the US .
Only last month , the US recorded its second - biggest monthly trade deficit ; more than half was with China .
Any bargain that makes sense requires China to spend more , save and export less and the US to spend less and export more .
A US in the grip of the rising Tea party movement is hardly likely to embark on the reforms required to make the US a more compatible trade and currency partner .
It will do whatever it needs to protect American growth and jobs – and the rest of the world can adjust to it .
This , after all , is what the pre - Tea party US did to Japan in the late 1980s , forcing the yen to rise sharply , triggering a profound financial and banking crisis that delivered nearly two decades of economic stagnation .
Now the Chinese fear that an even more aggressive US wants to do the same to them and that US quantitative easing is its chosen weapon .
The Chinese Communist party could not survive two decades of Japanese - style stagnation , nor could it survive an upsurge in inflation .
Its legitimacy is based on its capacity to deliver economically , not on bankrupt communist ideology .
Nor can it easily boost Chinese consumer spending without establishing property rights and proper welfare with the accompanying rise in taxes , an existential threat to the regime .
In any case , we do not live in multilateral , international deal - making times .
The Doha round of trade talks has been deadlocked for a decade .
There is no agreement on climate change .
Effective nuclear nonproliferation remains elusive .
In the EU , member states take their cue from Eurosceptics jealously protecting national sovereignty .
Unless something changes dramatically , it is hard to see how China and the US can do anything else but remain , at best , deadlocked , at worst , sliding towards economic war .
Britain should be doing all in its power to avoid this disaster and to have a plan B to protect itself if disaster strikes .
We should be offering to play our full part in any world deal to buy time for the US and China to change , while making sure we can act fast and flexibly to respond to a climate of beggar - my - neighbour trade and currency policies .
The spending review should have been framed to allow Britain to play its part in boosting world demand , help the world arrive at the compromises necessary to sustain economic order and make our recovery more secure .
It will not be .
The coalition has many admirable aims and that two political parties can work together so effectively is refreshing .
But everything is being put at risk by once again kowtowing to the gods of financial orthodoxy .
That was always wrong in the past .
It is no less wrong today ."
2010-12-06,"European leaders came under pressure to boost the € 750bn ( £ 635bn ) rescue fund for the euro when the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , warned finance ministers that not enough was being done to shore up the single currency .
But Germany , which would be liable for the biggest share of any increase in the emergency fund , led resistance to the proposals and is likely to oppose calls for the European Central Bank buy up troubled government bonds in the eurozone .
Ahead of an EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels tomorrow , the 16 governments using the euro met to consider steps to contain the contagion threatening the single currency .
They agreed an € 85bn bailout for Ireland last week and announced that the current temporary emergency fund would be turned into a permanent European stability mechanism by mid-2013 .
Governments were drafting policies and options for an EU summit next week amid fears that the 10-month euro crisis was moving into a dangerous new phase .
Strauss - Kahn attended today 's meeting of eurozone ministers in Brussels to demand a more pro - active role by the ECB in buying up the bonds of troubled governments and to call for a large increase in the rescue fund set up in May.
The EU has already launched bailouts worth nearly € 200bn for Greece and Ireland .
The current fund would suffice to come to Portugal 's rescue , the weakest link in the euro .
But if attention then fell on Spain , the EU 's fourth biggest economy , the rescue kitty would be empty .
The meeting came as the ECB revealed that it had spent € 1.965bn buying government bonds in the week leading up to last Tuesday , up from € 1.345bn the week before and the highest weekly amount in months .
An even bigger increase is expected to show up in next week 's figures , after ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet hinted last week that the bank would buy more bonds in an effort to lower borrowing costs for weaker eurozone countries such as Greece , Ireland and Portugal .
Despite the pressure from the markets for a coherent and convincing message on the eurozone 's problems , the signals yesterday were cacophonous .
The head of Belgium 's central bank , Guy Quaden , said he supported calls to increase the rescue fund .
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany retorted there was no need for that , nor for the "" e - bonds "" ( common EU bonds issued by a new European debt agency ) called for by Luxembourg and Italy .
"" It is our firm conviction that the treaties do not allow joint eurobonds , that is no universal interest rate for all European member states , "" Merkel said .
Eurobonds would entrench German responsibility for the borrowing of weaker and more profligate countries .
They would raise the costs of German borrowing and could trigger a backlash in a country where resentment at having to bail out more feckless governments is already running high .
Wolfgang Schäuble , the German finance minister , said his centre - right coalition had to guard against the emergence of a new anti - euro political party in the country that could take advantage of public disaffection .
The stirrings of such anti - European politics are already evident .
Hans - Olaf Henkel , the influential former head of the German industrialists ' association , has just published an anti - euro tirade called "" Save Our Money "" , predicting the death of European monetary union .
Coming from a pillar of the German establishment , the book breaks taboos .
Marketed heavily , it could also be a Christmas bestseller .
Didier Reynders , the Belgian finance minister , is to chairtomorrow 's meeting of EU finance ministers .
He backs expanding the rescue fund now on the grounds that it will need to be increased anyway from 2013 , a position also supported by the European Commission .
There has been talk over the last week of doubling the fund .
The contradictory signals from senior EU finance officials underlined that a battle is under way ahead of next week 's summit to determine the rules and the scope of the new stability mechanism ."
2011-01-26,"In the last few months the international financial institutions have expressed deep concern about the social impact of the recession and announced their commitment to tackling the unemployment , advocating an income - led growth , based on decent work and social protections .
On the other hand , the International Labour Organisation 's latest report on global employment trends leaves little room for optimism and draws an alarming picture of joblessness that is threatening social cohesion and political stability , posing risks to recovery .
Last week the managing director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , and the World Bank president , Robert Zoellick , met a delegation of the International Trade Union Confederation ( ITUC ) in Washington , confirming their desire to broaden the distribution of economic growth while extending social protections .
However , beyond declarations of intent , it remains to be seen how concrete this commitment will be .
For decades , the Bretton Woods institutions have promoted a market - driven development policy and conditional lending to developing countries based on public sector cuts .
In Washington , the IMF director has agreed with the unions that mitigating the social impact in crisis - hit countries was essential and he mentioned the IMF 's ongoing work with the ILO to establish a universal social protection floor .
As a matter of fact , under the lead of Strauss - Kahn since 2007 , the IMF seems to have rediscovered the original Keynesian principles that led to its establishment in 1944 : recovery is impossible without full employment , quality jobs and decent wages .
Strauss - Kahn has also condemned the resumption of financial speculation by banks and bankers and called for a financial activities ' tax to change the culture of banking speculation .
Sharan Burrow , general secretary of the ITUC , said that "" action to regulate the financial sector must be taken at once "" .
Nevertheless , a financial transactions tax would better provide the necessary resources for development , climate action and quality public services .
As for Robert Zoellick , he said that the World Bank will consult with trade unions at national , sectorally and global level , confirming his support for the ILO core labour standards and to workers ' protections .
And yet , the World Bank 's report on Global Economic Prospects , issued just two weeks ago , clearly advocates fiscal austerity in the face of jobs recovery and protections .
According to the labour movement it seems "" highly illogical "" for the bank to promote reduced social benefits and wages when all the other international reports show that real wages are falling or stagnating .
And besides that , it 's noteworthy that the bank 's leading publication , Doing Business , ranks countries and economies according to how easy it is to start a business there .
Despite the crisis , the 2011 report still penalises those countries that require contributions by employers for unemployment insurance , workers ' compensation , pensions , maternity leave or other social protection programmes .
And the bank advocates the exemption from all forms of taxation for companies , whether it be corporate income tax , social security contributions , property tax , capital gains tax or financial transactions tax . ""
The World Bank has caused enormous damage to workers by advising borrowing countries that labour standards should be dispensed with , and it is simply irresponsible to promote the idea that companies should not have to pay one cent of tax or social contribution , "" said Burrow .
In Doing Business 2011 the "" employing workers indicator "" was removed from the "" ease of doing business index "" and country rankings , although the basic data from which the indicator is calculated remains in an annex to the report .
But until last year countries that introduced social security contributions , such as , for example , Cambodia , were seen as business - unfriendly , while regimes such as Belarus were highly ranked for making it easier to eliminate jobs , even though the country had already lost its preferential trade status with the European Union for violating fundamental workers ' rights such as freedom of association and collective bargaining .
In the 2010 edition of Doing Business , the "" top reformer "" prize was won by Rwanda , because employers were no longer required to consult with the employees ' representatives or notify the labour inspector before announcing job cuts .
So it seems fair to have very little trust in the international financial institutions ' actual engagement in a socially sustainable recovery .
Can they really be a part of the solution , since they helped create the system that has led to such global economic imbalances ?
If the IMF and the World Bank are really committed to mitigating the impact of the global recession , as they so often say , then they should be fighting now for workers ' rights .
And they should actually mean what they say ."
2011-02-01,"The head of the world 's main economic watchdog warned politicians today that while the recovery was under way , "" it is not the recovery we wanted "" .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , said the recovery was "" beset by tensions and strains which could even sow the seeds of the next crisis "" .
Speaking in Singapore he argued that allowing emerging markets to grab the lion 's share of global growth at a time when developed nations are weighed down by debts would create unsustainable imbalances .
He also said growing inequalities in both developed and developing nations could trigger social unrest and undermine future growth .
The hard - hitting speech follows hard on the heels of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the threat of further strikes in Greece and Spain ..
Strauss - Kahn , a former French finance minister , said : "" Without jobs and income security , there can be no rebound in domestic demand – and ultimately , no sustainable recovery . ""
IMF officials are visiting Greece this week to broker a deal with the country 's left - leaning government after figures showed it was struggling to make cuts in line with an IMF and EU bailout .
The IMF has come under strong criticism for forcing debtor nations in need of bailout funds to sack thousands of public sector workers and impose stiff austerity measures , including higher taxes .
But in a pointed message to countries like Britain , Strauss - Kahn said it was up to individual states to limit their budget deficits , but without widening income inequalities or putting up barriers to growth .
"" In the advanced economies , the key is to promote growth and job creation .
While structural reforms are essential to make these economies more competitive , these reforms are only likely to pay off over time .
So what can be done to improve the short term ?
The most urgent task is to repair and reform the financial sector , to reduce risk and pave the way for healthy credit growth , "" he said .
A report yesterday by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research found that more than 90 % of the 200,000 jobs created in Britain over the last two years were part - time .
The report said employers were reluctant to commit themselves to full - time staff while the economic outlook remained uncertain .
Strauss - Kahn said : "" Looking more closely , we see a worrying development : the pre - crisis pattern of global imbalances is re - emerging .
Growth in economies with large external deficits , like the US , is still being driven by domestic demand .
And growth in economies with large external surpluses , like China and Germany , is still being powered by exports .
As the IMF warned in the years leading up to the crisis – and as the G20 has emphasised – these global imbalances put the sustainability of the recovery at risk . ""
The ' global growth gap ' is also straining the recovery in other ways .
Energy prices are rising swiftly , reflecting rapid growth in the emerging economies .
Food prices are rising too – though here supply shocks are the main reason – with potentially devastating consequences for low - income countries .
Together , these price increases are beginning to feed into headline inflation .
Large and volatile capital flows to emerging economies is another challenging development .
They are complicating macroeconomic management and in some cases raising concerns about financial stability . """
2011-03-24,"By any normal reckoning , the French left should be on the verge of an electoral breakthrough .
Nicolas Sarkozy is the most unpopular president in the 50-odd - year history of France 's fifth republic .
Damned as the bling - bling "" president of the rich "" who championed the market on the eve of its greatest crisis in the postwar era , barely one in five think he 's doing a good job .
There is even speculation that he may not stand for a second term .
And whatever bounce the embattled president might derive from his new role as a war leader in the Libyan conflict is thought unlikely to last .
But although the main opposition Socialist party led the field in countrywide local elections last Sunday with 25 % of the vote , while Sarkozy 's centre - right Union for a Popular Movement scored a humiliating 17 % , it was the far - right National Front that registered the strongest advance , coming in less than two percentage points behind the ruling party .
Already the Sarkozy camp is in disarray about how to respond to the front 's success , having failed to win back supporters with attacks on multiculturalism , an anti - Roma migrant campaign and a legal ban on the Islamic face veil .
In some polls , the front 's new leader , Marine Le Pen , was ranked second for the crucial runoff in next year 's presidential elections .
But Le Pen has rebuilt the front 's fortunes not only on the back of anti - immigration and Islamophobic incitement at a time of record youth unemployment , insecurity and squeezed living standards .
She has also been stealing the left 's clothes on public services , social protection , neoliberal globalisation and the "" ultra - liberal ideology of financial capitalism "" , even invoking the names of historic French communist leaders such as Maurice Thorez to appeal to working - class voters alienated from what they see as a Tweedledum - Tweedledee political establishment .
Such a pitch is aimed at mining a deep - seated radical strain in French public opinion .
For example , in a recent poll 43 % said they thought free - market capitalism was "" fatally flawed "" and should be replaced with a different economic system , more than in any other country surveyed – and six out of 10 said this month they would like to see a "" revolt "" over social and economic problems .
It 's that kind of sentiment that has been repeatedly mobilised by the left on the streets , most recently in last autumn 's wave of strikes and mass protests against Sarkozy 's pension reforms .
It also fuelled the successful 2005 No referendum campaign against the market - oriented European constitution , which drew heavily on the opposition of the left – though not the socialist leadership .
But turning that into electoral success , or radical reform when the left has been in office , has been another matter .
As Annick Coupé of the leftist Solidaires trade unions puts it : "" There is a very strong feeling of injustice , but people do n't see a clear alternative . ""
Like New Labour in Britain , the French socialists are widely regarded as having implemented similar neoliberal policies to the parties of the right , such as privatisation and European liberalisation .
Polls show more than two - thirds of French voters believe the mainstream left and right have become increasingly alike .
That has been seized on by the smaller parties of the left and fed into the battle to be next year 's Socialist presidential candidate .
But paradoxically , the favourite is now Dominique Strauss - Kahn , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , architect of the French Socialist privatisation programme in the late 1990s , Blair - like champion of globalisation , friend of wealthy media proprietors and the epitome of the cosy political establishment that so alienates the French public .
The polls Current polling nevertheless shows DSK — as he is known in France — beating Sarkozy by 61 % to 39 % if he stands .
Part of the attraction seems to be his presidential style , and part the silence induced by his IMF role that protects him from the mud - wrestling of French politics .
But his support also appears to feed on itself .
The experience of 2002 , when Le Pen 's father beat the Socialist candidate in the first round , has led many voters determined to get rid of Sarkozy to back whichever Socialist is polling most strongly in a weak field .
Strauss - Kahn seems certain to tack left if the time comes .
But whether his reputation will survive the party 's new US - style primaries – expected to include Ségolène Royal , who lost to Sarkozy in 2007 , her ex - husband François Hollande and perhaps the more traditional Martine Aubry – is another question .
And even the Socialist party 's spokesman , Benoit Hamon , told the Guardian that Strauss - Kahn had failed to "" sign up to the rejection of neoliberalism "" necessary in the wake of the crisis .
The more radical wing of the French left – which together with the Greens potentially commands more than 20 % of the vote and could exert a powerful pressure on the Socialists to give voice to the scale of French social discontent — is beset by its own weaknesses .
The shrunken Communist party , which still has thousands of elected representatives , is part of a Left Front with the outspoken former Socialist senator Jean - Luc Mélenchon that polled 9 % last Sunday .
But the New Anti - Capitalist party ( NPA ) , formed two years ago by a charismatic postman , Olivier Besancenot , whose poll ratings at one time outstripped those of the Socialist leaders , has since haemorrhaged members and support .
Partly it has been damaged by its refusal to support Socialists in the crucial second runoff round of the French voting system .
But the party has also been racked by divisions over secularism and Islam .
Its initial endorsement of a young headscarf - wearing Muslim woman , Ilham Moussaid , as a local candidate triggered internal uproar .
Controversy over the hijab and the interpretation of the French secular tradition – particularly when it is being used as a stick to beat an ethnic and religious minority , rather than target a rightwing Catholic establishment – has cut like a knife throughout the French left .
Last month the NPA voted to ban women who wear the hijab from representing the party and Moussaid , among others , has walked out .
The possibility that despite Sarkozy 's unprecedented unpopularity , a weakly - led and divided left could still miss an open goal is taken seriously .
Hamon warns : "" Sarkozy ca n't win the presidency – but we can still lose it . ""
Perhaps more likely , as the editor of the influential left - leaning Le Monde Diplomatique , Serge Halimi , puts it : "" The paradox of French politics is that people clearly want a shift to the left in economic policy .
But because of the way the electoral system works they may end up with a choice between Strauss - Kahn and Nicolas Sarkozy – the two men of globalisation that the French hate "" ."
2011-04-05,"The global economy is facing a flock of "" black swans "" , the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn told students in Washington on Monday night that "" great uncertainty still prevails .
Indeed , numerous black swans are now swimming in the global economic lake . ""
Strauss - Kahn was referring to the theory outlined by writer and investor Nassim Nicholas Taleb , who has argued that investors take too little account of unpredictable high - impact events .
Black swans can be either positive or negative .
Strauss - Kahn 's reference to black swans is cryptic , since by definition a black swan event is so unpredictable it should be invisible to forecasters , and make a mockery of their forecasts when it breaks cover .
In more conventional forecasting territory , Strauss - Kahn said that European countries need to do more to deal with their debt crises . ""
Ultimately , Europe needs a comprehensive solution – based on pan - European solidarity – to deal with lingering financial sector and sovereign debt problems .
Progress has been partial and piecemeal so far , and this is a key risk for the crisis countries as well as for overall recovery in Europe . ""
Strauss - Kahn also said that the financial crisis had made the case for taxes to prevent risky behaviour in the finance industry .
"" We need a tax on financial activities to force this sector to bear some of the social costs of its risk - taking behaviour .
Overall , I would say there are two broad conclusions .
In designing a new macroeconomic framework for a new world , the pendulum will swing – at least a little – from the market to the state , and from the relatively simple to the relatively more complex . ""
He also said that inequality may have helped cause the financial crisis .
"" Inequality might have been one of the ' silent ' causes of the crisis .
On the eve of the crisis , inequality in the United States was back to its pre - Great Depression levels .
Like the Great Depression before it , the Great Recession was preceded by an increase in the income share of the rich and a growing financial sector .
In these circumstances , borrowing could have acted as a safety valve for ordinary people to increase living standards – but on borrowed time .
Over the longer term , sustainable growth is associated with a more equal income distribution .
"" Growth in rich countries is too low and unemployment too high , he said .
"" At the same time , the emerging market economies , especially in Asia and Latin America , are powering ahead , and dealing with overheating .
The low - income countries proved remarkably resilient , but are now being hit by high food and fuel prices , "" he said in his speech at George Washington University ."
2011-04-14,"The cost of insuring Greek debt has hit a record high on renewed fears the country will default on its borrowings .
But support came from the head of the IMF , who insisted the embattled country would "" make it "" .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn said Greece would be able to meet its debt obligations and pay down its debt if it received more support from the EU , a veiled warning to Germany and France that they must show greater leniency towards the struggling Athens government .
"" I understand how painful it is for the Greek people
but I think Greece will make it , "" he said .
Data released by Markit showed the cost of insuring Greek debt for five years , using a credit default swap , had risen above 1,100 basis points for the first time .
This means it would cost € 1.1 m ( £ 970,000 ) to insure € 10 m of Greek debt , compared with £ 55,000 to insure £ 10 m of UK debt .
The yield , or effective interest rate , on Greek bonds also rose sharply after the German finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , suggested "" further measures "" may be needed to bring Greece 's finances under control .
Sterling rose against the euro as investors dumped the single currency .
Schäuble told German newspaper Die Welt that investors holding Greek bonds could face losses after 2013 , when the current rescue package expires .
His comments came after George Papaconstantinou , the Greek finance minister , admitted that the country might need "" more time "" to persuade financial markets that its recovery plan is credible .
Speaking in Washington ahead of the IMF 's spring meetings this weekend , Strauss - Kahn said : "" Greece will make it provided two things happen : first , that all areas of the programme are really implemented in due time .
The Greek government , which was very bold in implementing a lot of areas in the last year , should not run out of steam .
So , going ahead , what has to be done is absolutely necessary . ""
Secondly , he said , there was a need for a more comprehensive plan from Europe : "" The piecemeal approach dealing with one day interest rates , another day something else is not working well ... and we are still waiting for this to show up . ""
He also accused the eurozone countries of moving slowly to address the sovereign debt issue and support indebted countries .
Greece had made great strides to tackle over - spending and raise taxes but other initiatives had worked less well , he said , citing the example of wealthy tax dodgers . ""
The richest people in the country are still not paying the taxes they would pay in any other European country , "" he said .
City analysts say it looks increasingly likely that Athens will be forced into a debt restructuring .
Gary Jenkins , head of fixed - income research at Evolution Securities , said : "" Greek bonds are getting crushed today due to the comments from the German finance minister and the Greek equivalent .
We believe that if the idea is to get the debt back to a sustainable level then the target will be the Maastricht treaty limit of debt - to - GDP ratio of 60 % .
In order to reach that level , bonds will have to take a haircut of some 62 % . ""
The difference in yields on Greek 10-year bonds and their German equivalent jumped to more than 1,000 basis points for the first time since May 2010 , when Greece was forced to seek a bailout .
"" Greece 's spreads are in now in uncharted territory , "" warned Gavan Nolan , director of credit research at Markit .
Greece is fully funded this year through the bailout agreed with the European commission and the International Monetary Fund .
However , it was expected to attempt to raise up to € 30bn in 2012 ."
2011-04-16,"The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is on a collision course with chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England governor Mervyn King after the Washington - based agency voiced concern over Britain 's refusal to support a funding package to tackle the eurozone crisis .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the IMF , said Europe needed to come up with a more coherent plan to deal with government debt following the bailouts of Ireland and Greece .
He criticised piecemeal attempts to resolve individual countries ' debt problems , which critics believe leads to instability and undermines investor confidence in Europe .
The likelihood of prolonged negotiations over a Portuguese bailout deal was another instance of the need for an overarching mechanism to deal with all EU countries should they get into trouble , Strauss - Kahn told the IMF 's spring conference .
However , Osborne has made it clear that he believes resolving the debt problems of eurozone countries is a matter for the eurozone and not for the broader EU , which includes nations with their own currencies .
The UK is expected to participate in raising € 85bn-€90bn ( £ 52bn-£55bn ) to support Portugal , but Osborne has told France and Germany there will be no more cash from the UK for eurozone bailouts after the Portugal deal .
The chancellor would like to go further and repeal article 122 of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been used to corral EU member states to bail out Ireland and Greece .
The treaty says : "" Where a member state is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control , the council , on a proposal from the commission , may grant , under certain conditions , union financial assistance to the member state concerned . ""
A move to amend the article is seen as essential if Britain is to avoid taking part in further bailouts .
It is understood the Bank of England also views the debt problems of eurozone members as a matter for countries within the euro area .
Strauss - Kahn said that a "" European deal "" needs to be in place because "" the piecemeal approach is not working "" .
And Olivier Blanchard , the IMF 's chief economist , said the European debt crisis was one of the most crucial issues holding back the world economy and preventing the restoration of confidence : "" How Europe is going to get out of a hole is a very big issue .
"" The IMF is understood to want Brussels to coordinate a long - term strategy with funding facilities that indebted countries can access without the need for further negotiations .
Eurozone leaders have agreed to put in place a € 500bn European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , but the scheme will not be ready until 2013 and relies on France and Germany as lead underwriters of the fund .
IMF officials fear that without a speedier resolution and the participation of Britain and other richer EU nations outside the eurozone , in particular Sweden and Denmark , the investor spotlight will fall on other heavily indebted countries such as Italy , Belgium , Spain and Hungary .
Italy has a debt to GDP ratio of 110 % , while Belgium 's debts have reached 98 % of GDP .
Spain and Hungary have lower total debts , but remain in recession and investors are concerned these countries will find it difficult to grow and create jobs while implementing unprecedented spending cuts .
If any of these countries gets into trouble , several investor institutions have argued that the current funding mechanisms will be unable to cope , triggering another sovereign debt crisis .
Earlier this month EU finance ministers , including Osborne , met in Hungary to discuss the terms of Portugal 's bailout package .
Osborne ruled out offering direct bilateral loans to Lisbon , but is expected to participate in an EU - wide funding package and a large slice of funding via the IMF .
The IMF has part - funded the Greek and Irish bailouts .
It has become increasingly frustrated at the hardline attitude of Berlin and London to the support , which has only been offered at high interest rates and with terms that demand dramatic cuts in spending and higher taxes .
The IMF recently loosened the terms of Greece 's IMF loans after attempts to recoup lost taxes from the country 's wealthy businesspeople failed .
Strauss - Kahn said he was anxious that weakening growth and high youth unemployment would lead to social unrest .
The IMF cut its 2011 forecast for Irish GDP growth to 0.5 % from 0.9 % and said unemployment would hit 14.5 % , from the 13.5 % anticipated previously .
Despite the gloomy prognosis , he said he was confident Greece and Ireland would meet their debt obligations and begin to recover , but concern remained over the protection offered by the EU for future crises .
Ireland was downgraded last week by ratings agency Moody 's , which said Dublin 's recovery plans were still in doubt .
Moody 's cited Ireland 's weaker growth prospects when it cut the country 's rating by two notches to the verge of junk status and kept its outlook on negative , meaning the next move could also be down .
Osborne said Spain showed that eurozone countries were capable of regaining investor trust without further support from EU countries .
He praised the socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero for restoring investor trust in the country after months of speculation that it would follow Portugal in needing a bailout ."
2011-04-18,"As the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank gathered in Washington for their annual spring meetings , there was more talk about how much the IMF has changed .
Its managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , quoted John Maynard Keynes in his speech at the Brookings Institution : "" The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes .
"" In his opening address to the fall meetings last year he went further , making a point about the increase in public debt in the high - income countries which should be required reading for US business journalists : "" Make no mistake : this increase of 35 percentage points [ in the public debt of the high - income countries ] is mostly due to low growth , to expenditure linked to the rescue of the financial sector , to lack of revenue because of the economic downturn .
Only about one - tenth comes directly from the stimulus .
So the lesson is clear : the biggest threat to fiscal sustainability is low growth .
"" There have been some significant changes in the IMF in recent years , mostly in the area of research , where the fund has acknowledged that controls on capital inflows are a legitimate tool for governments to use .
There has been some limited lending without conditions .
And although the IMF included "" pro - cyclical "" conditions – ie macroeconomic policies that worsened the downturn – in most of its agreements during the world recession , on the optimistic side , it reversed course in many cases as the downturn deepened .
But unfortunately , the IMF 's practice still does not match its rhetoric or even , increasingly , its own research .
In Greece , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , Latvia and other countries , the fund is still involved in the implementation of pro - cyclical policies that will keep these countries from recovering for a long time .
For Greece , Ireland and Latvia , it will be nine to 10 years before they reach their pre - crisis levels of GDP .
There is absolutely no excuse for this , from an economic point of view .
Any policies that require this kind of extended period of unemployment and stagnation are by definition wrong .
If this is what they need to ensure debt repayment , then the country is better off defaulting on its debt , as Argentina did when it was faced with an unsustainable debt burden and defaulted at the end of 2001 .
The economy shrank for just one quarter and then grew 63 % over the next six years , recovering its pre - crisis level of GDP in less than three years .
Rhetoric aside , the fund 's policies still reflect the creditors ' point of view .
And from the creditors ' point of view , a country like Greece – whose debt even the financial markets recognise it will have to restructure at some point – must first go through hell .
The European authorities and IMF together have so much money ( $ 750bn for the IMF , $ 635bn for the European Financial Stability Facility and $ 87bn for the European Financial Stabilisation Fund ) that it would be quite simple to painlessly rescue the relatively small economies of Greece , Ireland , Portugal , or Latvia – or even the much larger Spanish economy , restoring growth and employment first and worrying about the debt after the economy is on track .
But from a creditors ' point of view , this would be rewarding "" bad behaviour "" .
So these countries ' citizens must suffer through years of high unemployment ( 20 % in Spain , 15 % in Ireland , 11 % in Portugal , 14 % in Greece , 17 % in Latvia ) , not to mention the privatisations and anti - labour "" reforms "" they are also subjected to .
To be fair to Strauss - Kahn as well as some of the economists in the IMF 's research department who would like to pursue more enlightened policies , they do not run the institution .
Final say rests with an executive board , which is run primarily by the US treasury department and the European authorities ( the latter have final say in Europe ) .
And on top of the US treasury department sits Goldman Sachs .
The IMF 's newly released "" World Economic Outlook "" calls for more "" implementing fiscal consolidation and entitlement reforms "" in the high - income countries , saying that "" the need is particularly urgent in the US "" where "" broader measures such as social security and tax reforms "" will be essential .
The fund is right about "" tax reforms "" , since the Bush tax cuts for high - income taxpayers , continued under the Obama administration , are a significant contributor to the long - term deficit problem .
But the social security system contributes nothing to either the immediate or long - term deficit problem .
It can pay all promised benefits for the next 26 years , and would require only minor adjustments to maintain solvency indefinitely .
By contrast , it is our broken private healthcare system that is responsible for nearly all of the long - term deficit projections .
The fund projects about 2.5 % annual GDP growth for the high - income countries over the next two years , and 6.5 % for emerging and developing economies .
By calling for fiscal consolidation in the rich countries , the IMF seems to accept that they are doomed to slow growth and high unemployment for the foreseeable future ; they want the faster - growing developing countries to appreciate their currencies and give the high - income countries a boost by importing more .
At the same time , they are worried that the developing countries are "" overheating "" , and that many need a "" tightening of macroeconomic policies "" .
But the real changes – the ones that have contributed to the rebound in the economic growth that has taken place in low - and middle - income countries over the past decade – have been the loss of much of the fund 's influence on policy that it had 10 or 20 years ago .
This is especially true for middle - income countries – in Asia , most of Latin America , Russia and others , although many low - income countries are still dependent on the fund and its allied lenders .
The IMF 's lending fell precipitously from 2003 to 2007 , and although it has recently come back to 2003 levels , the fund does not have nearly as much influence in middle - income countries as it once did .
So hopefully fewer countries each year will have to listen to the IMF 's advice – unless they want to focus on Strauss - Kahn 's lofty Keynesian rhetoric ."
2011-04-19,"David Cameron has been accused of being "" vindictive "" after indicating that he would block any attempt by Gordon Brown to become the managing director of the International Monetary Fund .
David Blanchflower , a former Bank of England monetary policy committee member , hit out at the prime minister 's suggestion that Brown "" might not be the most appropriate person "" to head the IMF in the light of his record in ministerial office .
Brown has emerged as the favourite to take the £ 270,000-a - year role when the incumbent managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , stands down .
The former prime minister , who was reportedly networking at a US conference of policymakers at Bretton Woods , New Hampshire – where the IMF was founded – last week , would need to be nominated for the post by the government .
But Cameron raised doubts about his suitability for the post , saying he was someone "" who did n't think we had a debt problem in the UK when we self - evidently do "" .
Blanchflower accused the prime minister of appearing "" extremely small minded "" .
"" This is the most vindictive thing I 've heard from a prime minister in 50 years , "" he said .
"" It looks to me to be extremely small - minded . ""
The Labour leader , Ed Miliband , insisted that his former boss was "" eminently qualified for the job "" and accused Cameron of "" jumping the gun "" . ""
To rule someone out even before the vacancy has even arisen seems to be going some , even for him , "" Miliband said .
"" Let 's see if the vacancy does arise –
but I think he [ Brown } would be a strong candidate . ""
Miliband described Brown 's record over the 2007 - 08 financial crisis as "" outstanding "" and blamed the budget deficit on a worldwide financial meltdown .
He said : "" The government sometimes wants to tell you the deficit caused the financial crisis –
I think they 're wrong about that . ""
Earlier today , asked whether the coalition would veto a move by Brown to take the helm , Cameron told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme : "" I have n't spent a huge amount of time thinking about this , but it does seem to me that , if you have someone who did n't think we had a debt problem in the UK when we self - evidently do have a debt problem , then they might not be the most appropriate person to work out whether other countries around the world have debt and deficit problems . ""
The prime minister said it was important that the IMF was headed by "" someone extraordinarily competent and capable "" and praised Strauss - Kahn for doing an "" excellent job "" in the role .
He suggested that the IMF should look to "" another part of the world "" for its next leader in order to increase its global standing .
"" If you think about the general principle , you 've got the rise of India and China and south Asia , a shift in the world 's focus , and it may well be the time for the IMF to start thinking about that shift in focus , "" he said .
"" Above all , what matters is – is the person running the IMF someone who understands the dangers of excessive debt , excessive deficit ? ""
And it really must be someone who gets that rather than someone who says that they do n't see a problem . ""
The Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds said : "" It is not patriotic , or in Britain 's interests , for the prime minister to play party politics with important international appointments .
"" We should n't forget that David Cameron called it wrong on every occasion during the financial crisis . """
2011-04-19,"David Cameron 's jibe at Gordon Brown 's ambitions to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund –
Cameron said Brown "" might not be the most appropriate person "" because of his track record – was a cheap shot .
But in the context of Brown 's chances of getting the top job at the IMF , Cameron was spot on .
When Dominique Strauss - Kahn resigns as head of the IMF later this year , in order to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency , it 's safe to say that Brown will not be his replacement .
Obviously , without the backing of the British government , Brown does n't stand a chance .
But even if Cameron wanted to rescue a vanquished foe from the political wilderness , it would be exceedingly difficult for Cameron to persuade the rest of the world to take Brown – or almost any British candidate for that matter – on board .
That 's because of forces beyond Brown 's or Cameron 's control .
The leadership of the two multilateral institutions , the IMF and the World Bank , is still carved up between the Americans ( who get the World Bank job ) and the Europeans ( who get the IMF spot ) .
Despite efforts to open recruitment to the rest of the world , it has n't happened yet and is only likely to occur in a combination of exceptional circumstances .
Of course Brown counts as European but because of his euro - scepticism ( the currency , not the continent ) he is not regarded with warmth by the EU 's euro - zone members .
Since the IMF 's role in the next few years will involve a lot of effort in Portugal , Greece , Ireland and perhaps other members of the single currency , the euro - zone partners of France and Germany not not want to the IMF leadership to fall into the wrong hands .
To complicate matters there is the question of who replaces Jean - Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Bank later this year .
At this point the matter becomes a three - dimensional chess match between France and Germany .
The net effect is that France 's Christine Lagarde , its current finance minister , is a front - runner for the IMF top job .
That would mean a French managing director replacing another French managing director , a trick only the French could pull off .
Lagarde would be the first woman to head the IMF or World Bank , something that is long overdue .
There are many other European candidates .
Italy 's central bank governor , the highly regarded Mario Draghi , could be a contender as a consolation prize for not getting the ECB presidency in the aforementioned three - dimensional chess .
Outsiders will argue that it is time the IMF selection process is opened to candidates outside the magic circle of rich nations , and that 's a slim but serious possibility .
In that case , Kemal Dervis would tick all the boxes , a former finance minister of Turkey with economics degrees from the LSE and Princeton , and currently head of the UNDP .
Or there 's Mohamed El - Erian , chief executive of giant US bond fund Pimco , a former IMF staff member and a French - Egyptian national with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge .
In comparison , Brown 's resume seems a little thin .
And that 's without adding his unhappy reputation as a manager , which may also be a factor .
The sad thing is that , with the right candidate , the UK could make a case for being next in line for the IMF leadership : the last seven managing directors have been French , Dutch , French , French , German , Spanish and French .
See a pattern there ?"
2011-05-09,"In a country that has never forgiven Nicolas Sarkozy 's love of bling , it was n't the brightest idea for the French Socialists ' great presidential hope to be photographed climbing into a € 100,000 Porsche car .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund and long - hailed as the only man who can beat Sarkozy , now looks certain to return to France and run for president in 2012 .
Secret meetings in Paris in recent days have mobilised his future campaign team .
But "" Porschegate "" has created a headache for the man whose greatest challenge is convincing voters that he is not a haughty champagne socialist .
From Washington , Strauss - Kahn has spent months trying to convey to the French electorate that he is not the voice of globalised fat cats and highly - paid technocrats but a true leftwing intellectual who can save the French social model .
Sliding into a sports car outside his € 4 m ( £ 3.5 m ) Paris penthouse with his millionaire wife was a faux pas , even if the vehicle was not his , but belonged to an adviser who works for one of France 's richest men .
Sarkozy 's entourage could not hide their glee .
So many Porsche jokes flew around the Socialist party that Ségolène Royal , a rival of Strauss - Kahn , ordered her supporters not to crack sports - car gags online .
Things were made worse for Strauss - Kahn , as France on Monday marked 30 years since François Mitterrand 's 1981 election victory .
Mitterrand is modern France 's only Socialist president ; his sphinx - like public self - restraint went under the slogan La force tranquille ( calm strength ) .
Strauss - Kahn was quickly dubbed La Porsche tranquille .
Strauss - Kahn – or DSK as he is known in France – has remained silent over his presidential ambitions owing to the impartiality of his IMF job .
But his lieutenants in Paris said over the weekend that he will declare his intentions on 28 June , the start of the Socialists ' race to chose a candidate .
Polls continue to show him far ahead of Sarkozy .
The latest survey for LH2 found Strauss - Kahn taking 23 % of the vote followed by the extreme right politician Marine Le Pen ( 17 % ) and Sarkozy ( 16 % ) .
Not only would DSK beat Sarkozy , the incumbent would be eliminated in the first round .
"" To walk away now looks weak , "" said a diplomat who knows Strauss - Kahn but wanted to remain anonymous .
Jean - Jacques Urvoas , one of DSK 's close supporters , said he was "" convinced "" his man would run .
But even advisers acknowledge that a return to Paris would not be easy .
A former finance minister and economics professor , Strauss - Kahn will land in the middle of a party fighting over a primary race to nominate its candidate .
His attributes – experience of global politics , presidential demeanour , understanding of finance – are also weaknesses .
He has been criticised for being haughty , arrogant , and worse – "" free - market "" and not truly leftwing .
Although seen as architect of the 35-hour week , a cause celebre of the French left , DSK is regarded to be on the right of his party . ""
He 's not a socialist , "" said Roland Dumas , a former foreign minister in Mitterrand 's government .
The Socialists chose Royal over Strauss - Kahn to run in the last presidential election in 2007 .
He now faces another rival , her former partner François Hollande .
The former Socialist party leader has emerged as a surprise challenger by positioning himself as a man of the people against DSK 's man of the establishment .
In a poll this week , Hollande was seen as the Socialist who most resembled Mitterrand .
The primary race will begin in June and end in the autumn .
Strauss - Kahn 's greatest weapon may prove to be his third wife , Anne Sinclair , France 's answer to the Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman .
She has helped neutralise his moneyed image by preparing a book about her art - dealer grandfather , suggesting the couple 's wealth comes from her inheritance rather than her husband .
Sinclair has also set out to neutralise Strauss - Kahn 's troubled image as , what the French press politely call , "" the great seducer "" .
In 2006 , when he was last preparing to run for president , she told L'Express she was "" rather proud "" of his reputation , saying : "" It 's important for a politician to be able to seduce . ""
Sinclair has remained silent over his brief affair with a senior IMF colleague .
In 2008 , an IMF investigation cleared him of harassment and favouritism over the affair while deeming it a "" serious error of judgment "" .
When Porschegate erupted and the right took advantage , the MP Pierre Moscovici , a DSK lieutenant , warned against a campaign of "" stink bombs "" .
It was interpreted not only as a warning against jibes about Strauss - Kahn 's wealth but also to silence rumours that the Sarkozy camp could go rummaging through his private life to catch him out during an election campaign .
Olivier Ferrand , who is head of the thinktank Terra Nova and is close to Strauss - Kahn , said the Socialist party primary would work in DSK 's favour , giving him a "" legitimacy "" as the left 's true candidate if he won .
The Socialist party , which could be dented by anti - globalisation candidates on the hard left , wants to avoid a repeat of the "" political aberration "" of April 2002 when an array of leftwing candidates split the vote and the Socialists were knocked out of in the first round by Jean - Marie Le Pen 's Front National .

2011-05-13,"Is Dominique Strauss - Kahn , current head of the International Monetary Fund , a "" queutard "" – literally , a man who makes extensive use of his intimate parts ?
In any case , that 's a talent for which he won an award last Tuesday at the satirical prize ceremony "" Les Gerard "" ( the French political equivalent to the Razzy awards ) .
This dubious honour was n't only based on rumours .
Strauss - Kahn ( widely known as DSK ) had an affair with Piroska Nagy , a Hungarian economist , while working at the IMF in 2008 .
Both the IMF and a law firm did investigations and came to the conclusion that he never used his power to sleep with his collaborator .
At the time , he was still married to Anne Sinclair , a famous French TV anchor .
He eventually had to publicly apologise .
That was n't the only scandal .
There was a fuss last year when a young French author , Tristane Banon , described her encounter with him .
She explained that she had interviewed him for a book about public figures and their missteps , and claimed she had to fight him off physically .
She said she had n't made a complaint at the time , because she did n't want to be "" the girl who had a problem with a politician "" .
This side of DSK 's life has almost become folklore in France .
In 2009 , humourist Stéphane Guillon even dedicated his comedy slot on the popular morning radio show La Matinale de France Inter ( the French equivalent for Radio 4 ) to this particular side of the politician : "" Exceptional measures have been taken at Radio France in order not to awaken the Beast .
Here are the measures , as detailed by the trade unions .
I quote : ' In order to guarantee the safety of the personnel , female workers are asked to wear long , unrevealing and anti - sex clothes ' . ""
This made Guillon famous , and almost got him fired .
Unsurprisingly , DSK was not amused and expressed it bluntly when he entered the studio 20 minutes later . ""
The great seducer "" –
that 's how the French press politely refer to Strauss - Kahn .
Anne Sinclair , his wife of 20 years , appears to deal with his reputation with surprising pragmatism .
In an interview with L'Express magazine , she explained : "" It 's important for a politician to be able to seduce . ""
She also wrote a blog post in 2008 , right after DSK 's affair with the IMF 's economist , claiming this kind of incident can happen to a couple , and that they still love each other like at the early beginning .
The post has since been deleted .
If DSK runs for president – he is a very serious contender – rumours will weigh on his campaign .
I would n't be surprised if some of his collaborators tried to convince him not to , scared of lurid headlines .
Every detail of his life is already under close scrutiny : a recent photograph showing him getting into a Porsche led to what media called the "" Porschegate "" .
It made a disastrous impression on public opinion , in a climate of low purchasing power and economic rigor .
Agnès Poirier , a French political journalist based in London , argued he 's just French , a womaniser among many others who does better than most politicians .
After all , former president Jacques Chirac was nicknamed "" 3-minutes - douche - comprise "" , literally "" 3-minutes - shower - included "" , as his driver reports in his book 25 Years
With Him – more recently , Nicolas Sarkozy was mentioned in Gossip Girl as a "" bad kisser "" .
Will DSK 's reputation matter in the election ?
Do we , female voters , care about male politicians ' sex lives ?
We all heard the stories in the news , and it is true that he might not be really popular among feminists .
But the answer is no .
As old - fashioned as it might seem , French voters tend to judge politicians according to their projects .
What we think of them as men is another story .
In 2007 , nobody blinked at Sarkozy 's failing marriage .
Nor did we ever care about Chirac 's alleged cheating on his wife Bernadette .
I can imagine it would be different in the US and UK , despite it happening a lot .
The Monica Lewinsky scandal was taken really seriously , had important political consequences and quickly spoiled public opinion towards former president Clinton .
Personally , I doubt this side of DSK 's life would have any influence on how he would run the country .
Maybe it 's idealistic of me , but a presidential position would put Strauss - Kahn under the spotlight even more – and he knows it .
I am not a member of the Socialist party but I could vote for DSK .
He 's a key member of a major political party , was finance minister , deputy , a political representative in Sarcelles ( one of the poorest city in France in the suburb of Paris ) , helped the government pass crucial measures and managed the IMF during one of the worst financial crises our modern economy has been through . ""
L'Americain "" , as some French call him , would be a legitimate candidate .
We will have to keep an eye on him .
But not in his bedroom ."
2011-05-15,"With the global economy still fragile after the worst downturn since the 1930s and Europe gripped by a debt crisis , the accusations against Dominique Strauss - Kahn could hardly have come at a worse time for the International Monetary Fund .
The organisation he heads now risks being left rudderless as delicate negotiations take place on the terms of a new loan package to Greece and as the fund seeks agreement on policies to prevent a relapse into recession .
If Strauss - Kahn is found guilty , there will be a power struggle to fill the vacuum , with the developing world insisting the time has come to end the European - American carve - up of the top jobs at the IMF and its sister organisation , the World Bank .
Traditionally , Washington has nominated the president of the bank while the Europeans have decided who should run the fund .
Strauss - Kahn is the fourth Frenchman to hold the role since the organisation was established at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 .
If the world 's lender of last resort is forced to find of a new leader , the choice will be crucial .
There are plenty of distinguished economists from developing countries with experience of running central banks and finance ministries , most of them with PhDs from the top US universities .
But it is possible that the Europeans and Americans – who dominate decision - making at the fund – will insist on a safe , orthodox choice if they are to end their gentleman 's agreement stretching back more than 75 years .
The Germans , for example , would probably prefer one of the many developing country economists who have degrees from the University of Chicago , and who can be relied upon to champion balanced budgets .
The Republicans on Capitol Hill will be looking for a candidate who believes in free markets and small states .
So while Strauss - Kahn moved the fund in a more progressive direction , there is no guarantee that this approach will continue under a new leader .
When he arrived in the autumn of 2007 , the fund suffered from three big problems : it was ideologically wedded to the free - market philosophy of financial liberalisation that caused the world 's banking system to implode ; it had suffered from weak leadership ; and it was short of money .
Strauss - Kahn admitted that the fund 's failure to spot the crisis coming in the period before his arrival had been caused by "" group think "" .
He highlighted the need to focus on employment and accepted that countries facing speculative pressure were justified in using capital controls to defend themselves .
The fund 's coffers were also replenished , in part due to the funding organised by Gordon Brown at the London G20 summit in April 2009 and in part by the sale of the IMF 's gold reserves .
Even so , Strauss - Kahn 's revamp of the IMF has been partial and is still very much a work in progress .
Changes to the rules mean the next managing director should be chosen by an open and transparent process .
However , the same rule was in force when Strauss - Kahn was appointed .
If a prominent European candidate with the right credentials was put forward , he or she would still have a good chance of securing the job , given the voting structure of the fund 's board .
In theory , Brown would be the obvious European choice to continue Strauss - Kahn 's work .
He chaired the IMF 's key policy committee for almost a decade when chancellor and believes the fund should actively intervene to tackle poverty and make the global economy less unstable .
To get the job , however , Brown would need the support of David Cameron , something the prime minister has said publicly he will not be given .
The chances are , therefore , that the fund 's next boss will come from the developing world , although the candidate will still have to be acceptable to the major shareholders –
the US and the big European countries ."
2011-05-15,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's spectacular arrest on serious sexual assault charges is an unprecedented scandal in the French presidential race .
It has stunned the left , disgusted the right and thrown the 2012 election campaign wide open .
DSK had been consistently predicted to trounce Nicolas Sarkozy and all other contenders in the presidential election next April and May.
The economist and former Socialist finance minister was expected to announce his candidacy at the end of June .
He was tipped to win the Socialist party primary race in October and take on the record - breakingly unpopular Sarkozy .
Whatever the outcome of the US investigation into the alleged sex attack , Strauss - Kahn 's hopes for the 2012 presidency are almost certainly over .
French voters are largely immune to politicians ' sex lives , which they consider private .
But allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape are of a different order , pollsters warned .
The Socialist party leader , Martine Aubry , described the news as a "" thunderbolt "" .
The Socialists have time to push another candidate , but it will exacerbate existing tensions .
The frontrunner is now François Hollande , the jovial former party leader with social democrat tendencies who had already scored a surprise hit in the polls by styling himself as an "" ordinary guy "" against Strauss - Kahn 's ivory tower image .
His weak points are a poor record as party leader and a lack of government experience .
Hollande 's former partner , Ségolène Royal , already beaten once by Sarkozy , still insists on standing in the primaries
but she is polling low .
The great unknown is Aubry herself , daughter of the former head of the European commission Jacques Delors .
She polls well and many of the party 's old guard would like to see her run .
But a host of other Socialist faces may now mount challenges , complicating things further .
The Socialist favourites , including Royal and Hollande , were careful not to start mud - slinging against each other yesterday and to respect Strauss - Kahn 's presumption of innocence .
Hollande called it simply "" terrible news "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's lieutenants insisted that the charges of alleged brutal sexual assault bore no resemblance to the man they knew .
Some were plain about Strauss - Kahn 's well - known reputation for seduction , but suggested this could have been a plot .
The Socialist MEP Gilles Savary said "" everyone knows Dominique Strauss - Kahn is a libertine "" but warned that nothing had been ruled out , including the possibility that the New York allegations were a trap .
Until now , the 2012 race against Sarkozy had been seen as an open goal for the Socialists , if only they could stop fighting each other .
Now potential new centrist candidates could benefit .
The anti - globalisation extreme left will undoubtedly profit , and the big fear is a fragmentation of the leftwing vote .
It risks a nightmare repeat of 2002 when too many leftwing contenders split the vote , allowing the extreme right Jean - Marie Le Pen to knock the Socialists out of the final round .
If the Socialists are eliminated from the May 2012 final round and Sarkozy faces the Front National 's Marine Le Pen , the president will be assured a second term ."
2011-05-15,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund and the man French Socialists hope will be the next occupant of the Elysée Palace , was arrested at JFK airport in New York on Saturday afternoon accused of a sex attack on a Times Square hotel maid earlier in the day .
He was taken off an Air France flight by officers from the Port Authority of New York and turned over to Manhattan police , according to a spokesman from the agency .
Plainclothes officers boarded the flight at 4.45pm , moments before take - off , and took the 62-year - old out of the first - class cabin and into custody .
He had been due to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday .
"" It was 10 minutes before its scheduled departure , "" said John Kelly , a Port Authority spokesman .
Port Authority officers were acting on information from the New York Police Department , whose detectives had been investigating a brutal alleged attack on a woman employee at the Sofitel New York on West 44th Street in the heart of the city 's theatre district .
The 32-year - old woman told police that she entered Strauss - Kahn 's room at about 1 pm on Saturday and he emerged from the bedroom naked , threw her down and tried to sexually assault her , NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said .
She broke free and escaped the room and told hotel staff what had happened who called the police .
When New York City police detectives arrived moments later , Strauss - Kahn had already left the hotel , leaving behind his mobile phone and other personal items .
"" It looked like he got out of there in a hurry , "" Browne added .
Strauss - Khan was being questioned on Saturday night by the NYPD special victims office .
No charges have yet been filed .
Rumours of dangerous liaisons and sexual conquests have had little effect on Strauss - Kahn 's chances of occupying the highest office in France , but last night 's arrest may alter his future ambitions .
Strauss - Kahn was expected to throw his hat into the election ring within weeks .
He has been fighting off a very French furore over assertions his tastes are too luxurious to lay claim to the political left .
Strauss - Kahn is suing a French newspaper that claimed staples of his lifestyle included luxury homes and sought - after works of art .
In its report , France Soir also said he had several handmade suits made by Barack Obama 's tailor , a claim hotly denied .
The tailor , a 75-year - old Frenchman from Marseille , sells suits for between £ 4,300 and £ 21,000 .
Questions over Strauss - Kahn 's wealth were raised two weeks ago after he was pictured climbing into a friend 's £ 87,000 Porsche Panamera S outside his £ 3.5 m Paris home alongside his heiress wife .
For months opinion polls have suggested that Strauss - Kahn is the only potential opposition candidate who might unseat Sarkozy in next year 's election , but after the France Soir reports François Hollande , the former Socialist party leader who is also seeking the party 's nomination as presidential candidate , leapt to within a few points of him .
Hollande 's ex - wife , Ségolène Royal , who lost to Sarkozy in 2007 , is another Socialist contender to be leader , along with two other hopefuls .
In its report on Thursday , the newspaper said that since Strauss - Kahn and his wealthy wife , Anne Sinclair , had arrived in the US capital for his IMF job in 2007 they had lived a life of luxury .
The couple was said to have bought a £ 2.5 m home in the upmarket Washington district of Georgetown .
Other reports revealed that Strauss - Kahn , who allegedly earns £ 22,000 net a month , also has a flat in the 16th arrondissement of Paris which was bought for £ 2.2 m in 1990 , another flat on the expensive Place des Vosges in the 4th arrondissement bought in 2007 for £ 3.4 m , and a riad in Marrakech .
That the Strauss - Kahns are wealthy has never been a secret .
Sinclair is the granddaughter of Paul Rosenberg , a celebrated dealer of modern art , and has inherited part of his collection , which is said to include at least one Picasso .
In many countries , such wealth would not necessarily be viewed as an impediment to a leftwing politician 's career .
In France , however , the flashiness has appalled some observers . ""
Can one be leftwing and very rich ? "" asked Jean - Jacques Bourdin , a commentator on French radio station RMC .
"" If Sarkozy represented for many the ' bling - bling ' right then Dominique Strauss - Kahn is , whether he likes it or not , a representative of the left ' vroom vroom ' . ""
He finds himself today in a very worrying situation for a future socialist presidential candidate .
Because in the collective subconscious to be leftwing and to have lots of money … does n't always go together , "" said Bourdin .
However , supporters were quick to jump to Strauss - Kahn 's defence .
Michèle Sabban , vice - president of the Île - de - France socialists , told journalists : "" Dominique is staying true to himself .
He admits his relationship with money and that 's good . ""
Another supporter , local councillor Hussein Mokhtari , added : "" So he has to eat sandwiches and drive a 2CV when he is head of the IMF ? ""
Even political enemies such as Jean - Luc Mélenchon , leader of the Left party and a rival presidential candidate , dismissed criticism of his wealth .
"" Being leftwing is a conviction , a commitment ; never would a man of the left say to another ' profit and shut up … '
I think someone who is rich can also be of the left depending on how his wealth was gained . """
2011-05-15,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund and the French left 's great hope for president , has been arrested and charged with sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a maid in a New York hotel .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , was taken from the first - class cabin of a Paris - bound Air France flight on the tarmac at JFK airport by plainclothes officers before Manhattan police formally arrested him on charges of criminal sexual act , attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment .
New York police spokesman Paul Browne detailed the allegedly brutal attack on a woman at the Sofitel New York on West 44th Street in the heart of the theatre district , where Strauss - Kahn was staying in a $ 3,000 ( £ 1,850 ) a night suite .
The 32-year - old woman told police she entered Strauss - Kahn 's room at about 1 pm .
Browne said : "" She told detectives he came out of the bathroom naked , ran down a hallway to the foyer where she was , pulled her into a bedroom and began to sexually assault her , according to her account .
She pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act , according to her account to detectives .
He tried to lock her into the hotel room . ""
By the time police arrived , Strauss - Kahn had left the hotel , leaving behind his mobile phone and other personal items .
"" It looked like he got out of there in a hurry , "" Browne added .
Strauss - Kahn , who does not have diplomatic immunity as head of the IMF , is expected to be brought before a state court on Sunday .
His lawyer said he would plead not guilty .
According to New York state law , a criminal sexual act includes forcibly compelling someone to engage in oral sex .
The offence carries a potential sentence of 15 to 20 years – the same as attempted rape .
Unlawful imprisonment carries a potential sentence of three to five years .
The allegations threaten to severely damage the standing of the IMF , where Strauss - Kahn was leading the response to the global financial crisis .
Strauss - Kahn had been on his way to Europe to discuss the worsening European debt crisis .
A meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel scheduled for Sunday has been cancelled .
He was also scheduled to meet European financial ministers on Monday and Tuesday and was to have discussed how best to tackle Greece 's debt crisis and finalise Portugal 's € 78bn bailout package .
The arrest will cast a cloud over the IMF 's role in addressing the rescues and is likely to have a major impact on stock markets on Monday as traders react to yet more uncertainty in Europe .
Strauss - Kahn has strongly supported the Greek rescue .
A senior Greek government official told Reuters the arrest would not change the IMF 's policy in Greece but could cause delays in the short term .
The IMF - led bailout has become increasingly unpopular with other IMF members amid growing doubts about the Athens ' ability and resolve to meet the commitments of the international aid package .
The IMF said it "" remains fully functioning and operational "" in a statement on Sunday . ""
IMF managing director Strauss - Kahn was arrested in New York City .
Mr Strauss - Kahn has retained legal counsel , and the IMF has no comment on the case ; all inquiries will be referred to his personal lawyer and to the local authorities . ""
An IMF investigation in 2008 cleared Strauss - Kahn of harassment and favouritism over an affair with a senior colleague but deemed it a "" serious error of judgement "" .
The charges have stunned French politics , where DSK was the Socialist favourite to beat Nicolas Sarkozy in next year 's presidential election .
Strauss - Kahn was expected to declare within weeks that he would run in the primary race to become the left 's official candidate .
But political commentators suggested his presidential dream was over .
Jacques Attalli , the economist , a prominent Socialist and friend of Strauss - Kahn said : "" The most likely outcome is that this case will stick and even if he pleads not guilty , which he may be , he wo n't be able to be candidate for the Socialist primary for the presidency and he wo n't be able to stay at the IMF . ""
Michel Taubmann , author of a new official and approved biography of Strauss - Kahn , said : "" He is a well - known seducer but does not have the profile of a rapist . ""
Strauss - Kahn is suing a French newspaper that claimed staples of his lifestyle included luxury homes and sought - after works of art .
France Soir also said he had several handmade suits made by Barack Obama 's tailor – a claim hotly denied .
The tailor , a 75-year - old Frenchman from Marseille , sells suits for between £ 4,300 and £ 21,000 .

Hollande 's ex - partner , Ségolène Royal , who lost to Sarkozy in 2007 , is another Socialist contender , along with two other hopefuls .
Renaud Muselier , an MP for Sarkozy 's ruling centre - right party said : "" It 's a disaster for our country and France 's image because he is the head of the IMF and it completely changes the cards for the presidential election . ""
The French Socialist party said it was "" stupefied "" and holding crisis talks .
Jean Veil , one of Strauss - Kahn 's France - based lawyers , said : "" We must wait until things settle and see if it 's true or a provocation .
We must be especially careful not to get into a media circus and we must wait until things are clear . """
2011-05-15,"For a leftwing French presidential hopeful trying to prove he did n't like bling , room 2806 of the Sofitel hotel near Manhattan 's Times Square was luxurious .
For $ 3,000 ( £ 1,850 ) a night , it boasted a foyer , conference room , living room , bedroom and bathroom .
But the size of the suite compounded the brutality of the alleged assault on the hotel maid who described being dragged from room to room in a violent sex attack by one of the most important men in the world economy .
At about 1 pm on Saturday afternoon , a 32-year - old chambermaid entered the suite at the luxurious hotel on West 44th Street in the heart of New York 's theatre district .
She had been instructed to clean and was told it was empty .
According to the hotel worker 's account to police , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the IMF , emerged from the bathroom naked , chased her down a hallway and pulled her into the bedroom where he began to sexually assault her .
New York police department spokesman Paul Browne said Strauss - Kahn had been naked when he "" grabs her and pulls her into the bedroom and on to the bed "" .
The 62-year - old then deliberately locked the door to the suite , it was alleged .
"" She fights him off , and he then drags her down the hallway to the bathroom , "" Browne continued .
There , Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her again , forcing her to perform oral sex on him and trying to remove her underwear , according to the Associated Press .
The woman was able to break free and escape the room , alerting colleagues , who dialled 911 for the police .
When detectives arrived moments later , Strauss - Kahn had already left the hotel , leaving behind his mobile phone and other personal items .
"" It looked like he got out of there in a hurry , "" Browne said .
The maid , who has not been named , was taken to hospital and treated for "" minor injuries "" .
The New York police quickly tracked Strauss - Kahn to John F Kennedy airport .
At 4 pm , he was sitting in the first - class cabin of Air France flight AF23 to Paris as it sat on the runway preparing to take off .
Ten minutes before the plane was due to depart , two US investigators boarded .
"" What 's this about ? ""
Strauss - Kahn reportedly asked , before agreeing to go with the police .
He was not handcuffed and the arrest took place so quietly that other French passengers said they had n't even noticed Strauss - Kahn , just "" some sort of police issue that delayed the flight "" .
The former French finance minister , who as IMF head earns $ 420,930 a year tax free , was taken to a police holding cell in Harlem .
Reporters from across the world massed outside and , at 3 am , a police spokesman confirmed Strauss - Kahn had been charged with a criminal sexual act , attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment .
The French consul general met Strauss - Kahn overnight under the normal rules of protection for French citizens detained abroad , a spokeswoman for the consulate in New York said .
Strauss - Kahn was due to appear before a county judge on Sunday afternoon .
A lawyer acting for him said he would plead not guilty .
It was not clear what Strauss - Kahn , who has been married three times and has four children , was doing in New York .
He is based in Washington and had a meeting on Sunday night in Berlin with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , which was swiftly cancelled after his arrest .
Police investigating whether he deliberately fled the hotel would have to establish whether or not he was scheduled to take the Air France flight to Paris or whether he got on the first available plane .
The French media reported Strauss - Kahn had a longstanding agreement with Air France that he could board any flight .
French TV said he was due to have lunch with his daughter in Paris on Sunday before heading to see Merkel .
His wife , the former TV presenter and millionaire art heiress Anne Sinclair , was at the couple 's € 4 m ( £ 3.5 m ) Paris apartment at the time of the alleged attack .
After the arrest , she was said to have gone to stay with friends .
"" I do not believe for a single second the accusations levelled against my husband , "" she said .
"" I do not doubt his innocence will be established .
I appeal for restraint and decency . ""
The French political class was braced for more details to emerge of Strauss - Kahn 's predatory attitude to women , an open - secret in political circles .
President Nicolas Sarkozy told a meeting of MPs last year that , next to DSK , he looked like a "" Methodist pastor "" .
The novelist Tristane Banon was expected to detail an alleged attack on her in 2002 .
Banon 's mother , a Socialist , appeared on French national television to claim how he allegedly attacked her daughter .
Strauss - Kahn 's allies admit he has a reputation for pursuing women .
One Socialist said Strauss - Kahn deliberately did nothing to hide the fact that he was a "" libertine "" .
But friends said it was unthinkable that he had gone as far as attempted rape .
Michel Taubmann , author of a new authorised biography which tells how Strauss - Kahn married his childhood sweetheart at 18 before going on to marry twice more , said : "" He is a well - known seducer but does not have the profile of a rapist . ""
That part of the alleged attack conjured up uncomfortable parallels with a recent fly - on - the - wall documentary about Strauss - Kahn aimed at softening his haughty image with the French electorate .
He had cheerfully been filmed – fully clothed – in his hotel bathroom showing how he hangs up his suits in the shower and leaves the hot tap running for half an hour to steam out the creases .
The allegations spread panic among the left at an extremely awkward time in the runup to the Socialist party 's internal battle for a candidate to beat Sarkozy .
Strauss - Kahn , seen as the biggest danger to Sarkozy , had already been accused of being a champagne socialist in what his allies said was a concerted campaign against him .
When Socialist MP Pierre Moscovici recently warned against the use of "" stink bombs "" in the political campaign , many read between the lines that it was a warning about political opponents digging up aspects of Strauss - Kahn 's private life and relationships with women .
The far - right politician Marine Le Pen said Strauss - Kahn 's arrest meant he could no longer run for president .
"" All of Paris – journalistic Paris , political Paris – has been abuzz for months about the rather pathological relationship that Mr Strauss - Kahn maintains towards women , "" she said .
One rightwing MP from Sarkozy 's ruling party compared Strauss - Kahn to JR in the soap opera Dallas .
The full implications of the shame raised by the allegations was apparent in New York 's Daily News 's headline : "" Le Perv "" ."
2011-05-15,"The news from New York of sexual assault charges brought against the IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn has unnerved Greece , the country at the centre of Europe 's worsening economic crisis , with officials saying it added more uncertainty to decision - making at a critical time .
Strauss - Kahn had been due to attend a crucial meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Monday , where Greece 's spiralling debt is expected to be the focus of discussions .
A Sunday meeting with the German chancellor Angela Merkel was similarly slated to focus on re - rescuing Greece a year after the € 110bn ( £ 96bn )
IMF and EU bailout . ""
This adds uncertainty to the prospect of early resolution .
The more uncertainty exists in terms of major institutions , the higher the cost for a country like Greece , "" said Louka Katseli , Greece 's minister of labour and social security .
"" What is needed are firm decisions [ to ensure ] financing for the next years . ""
Saddled with debt estimated to be € 340bn and climbing by the day , Athens accepted this month that without further financial support it would be unable to refinance € 60bn of maturing debt .
With Greece effectively locked out of international capital markets , Strauss - Khan had been a strong proponent of throwing the nation a second financial lifeline to stave off economic collapse .
Despite some unflattering asides from the IMF head – who recently enraged Greeks when he described them as being "" in deep shit "" – he is also seen as a pair of safe hands .
Regard for the Frenchman has weathered the IMF 's failure to resuscitate Greece 's parlous public finances amid criticism of its emphasis on recession - inducing austerity and spending cuts . ""
The IMF under his stewardship has been more flexible with Greece than its other creditors , the EU and ECB , "" said Theodore Pelagidis , professor or economic analysis at the University of Piraeus .
"" He was much more understanding of the nature of the crisis .
This now makes the situation more complex because one of the principal negotiators is out of the game and people are asking who is next and what should we expect ? ""
Although Greek officials also insist the furore is unlikely to change IMF policy towards them , Strauss - Khan 's removal from the scene would coincide with an increasingly explosive political and social environment in an austerity - weary country .
Mounting speculation over Greece 's ability to manage its debt – combined with persistent speculation it is heading for a sovereign default and even exit from the eurozone – has heightened a growing sense of political paralysis in Athens .
Senior monitors from the IMF , EU and ECB , who are currently in the capital auditing finances , have added to the tension , reportedly suggesting that unpopular measures such as the privatisation of ailing state companies will be unavoidable in the months ahead .
"" It [ his arrest ] comes at a critical time when we need more loans or some other radical solution to pay bills and pensions and cover maturing debt , "" said Pelagidis .
"" It is one more factor of uncertainty for a country that is full of uncertainties and fears that it will be abandoned by its partners . """
2011-05-15,"The presumption of innocence is a legal principle , but not , alas , a political reality .
Within hours of the news breaking that Dominique Strauss - Kahn had been charged with sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a room maid in a New York hotel , France began to talk about the IMF chief and possible presidential candidate in the past tense .
There was at least one immutable political reality guiding this .
Presidential candidates for the Socialist party have two weeks from the end of June to the middle of July , to put their name down .
Mr Strauss - Kahn 's lawyer said yesterday his client denied all the facts on the charge sheet .
But he would have to do much more than this in a very short space of time to declare his candidacy and salvage his political career , and the wheels of criminal justice do not turn that fast .
The assumption is that both his candidacy and his political career are over .
In the maelstrom of comment that his arrest generated , the plight of the alleged victim was soon forgotten .
It should never be .
This is about justice not the careers of high fliers in politics and finance .
The scandal deals a grievous blow both to the IMF and to French politics .
Mr Strauss - Kahn , the fourth Frenchmen to run the IMF , is regarded both as a competent and progressive head of an organisation at a crucial time in attempts to stabilise the world economy .
He struck out against the high priests of neoliberalism by focusing on employment and recognising that countries facing speculative pressure could use capital controls as a defence .
But this was work in progress and the tough conditions imposed on Greece and Ireland have caused many to question how much of the old thinking has really changed .
With interest rates on Greek bonds continuing to soar , Mr Strauss - Kahn 's removal could not have come at a more vital time for Greece and the IMF .
The flurry of official statements yesterday reflected that concern .
The IMF put one out saying it was fully functioning .
French politics are plainly not .
As Nicolas Sarkozy has sunk further in the opinion polls , DSK , as he is known , was looked upon ( not just by the right wing of the Socialist party ) as the only man who could unseat the French president .
He had yet to throw his name into the hat , but had he done so , he would have been regarded as the leading Socialist candidate .
There could not have been a better moment for him politically .
The outgoing president was discredited , the Socialist party in disarray – unable to overcome the turf wars of its warring barons .
With a stint at the IMF behind him , he would have been the ideal man to lead France out of the financial storm .
He was not without a history .
There had been a string of sexual indiscretions , and a well - documented taste for the good life .
In Britain he would have been called a champagne socialist .
A photograph of him and his wife climbing into a Porsche in Paris was enough to stir controversy , even though the car turned out not to be his .
But a bling - bling president challenged by a vroom - vroom socialist ?
None of this would have been enough to stop him roaring down the road that led to the Élysée , not so much a grand chemin as a six - lane autoroute .
Mr Strauss - Kahn 's removal leaves the Socialist party in shock – not , it has to be said , for the first time in the party 's recent history .
The man who will inherit Strauss - Kahn 's mantle as a moderate is François Hollande , who prefers scooters to Porsches .
His former partner , Ségolène Royal , refuses to rule herself out , learning nothing from her last ego - fuelled attempt on the presidency .
Emergency conclaves of the socialist baronry are , however , meat and drink to the far right , particularly Marine Le Pen .
She will have little difficulty claiming that Mr Strauss - Kahn 's fall from grace sullies not just one individual 's career , but a whole elite .
Whether justified or not , the far right could well make hay with it ."
2011-05-15,"Everything was ready , even the T - shirts with the slogan : "" Yes , we Kahn "" .
Even the hagiographic biography , with its chapters on extramarital sex leading to its happy ending : its subject 's proclamation of eternal love to his celebrity wife .
But France woke up today to the news that Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the IMF and the man tipped to replace Nicolas Sarkozy next year as French president , was behind bars in New York , charged with the sexual assault of a hotel maid .
Although DSK , as he is known in France , denies the accusations , he 's clearly now out of the IMF , out of the French presidential race and , most likely , out of politics altogether .
Before this , DSK had everything going for him : a discredited outgoing president , an opposition party in search of a saviour , and an economic context that made him the ideal man to lead a European country in the midst of the financial storm .
He seemed set to win the Socialist party primaries , and to become the second Socialist president of the fifth republic , some 17 years after François Mitterrand .
How could he blow his career prospects so stupidly ?
This question is so disturbing that many in France think only a setup could explain his fall .
Before the sexual assault story emerged , a series of negative stories about him had appeared in recent days : a photograph of him getting into a Porsche ; an article in a trashy newspaper about his extravagantly priced suits ; a cover story in a major news weekly L'Express about his excessive wealth .
But none of these cheap attacks scored .
An opinion poll , published on Saturday – the day of the alleged attack in New York – showed that the French did n't care ; DSK remained strongly ahead with voters .
Even those on the left who had doubts about his personality and his luxurious lifestyle kept quiet , because they felt France desperately needed his economic skills .
Their hopes now dashed , French Socialists do n't have much time to repair the wreckage .
There are other possible Socialist candidates , but the battle lines had been developing assuming that DSK would lead the pack .
There was a talk of a pact between him and Martine Aubry , the party 's leader and mayor of Lille : that if one of them stood , the other would refrain .
There was even a rumour of a US - style "" ticket "" , where DSK could be president and Aubry his prime minister .
With DSK out , the less - charismatic Aubry will be under pressure to announce her candidacy , if only to prevent another run by her rival Ségolène Royal , the disastrous Socialist candidate of 2007 .
But the man to watch is François Hollande .
A few months ago political journalists smirked when he announced he would run for the Socialist candidacy .
Now they 'll take him seriously .
He has run a strong pre - campaign , lost weight , and displayed both a sense of humour and a political seriousness .
He is the anti - DSK candidate , not so much for his ideas –
he is a moderate socialist trying to salvage public services –
but for his modest style .
Opinion polls make him a credible opponent to Sarkozy ; he could win .
But the damage of the DSK affair will weaken the left , and the beneficiary will not be the ruling UMP party .
Marine Le Pen , president of the populist Front National , was quick to blast DSK as a symbol of a discredited old political class .
Both as a political "" outsider "" and as a woman in politics , Le Pen could gain most from the scandal .
Disarray among the Socialists , a big boost for the far right – the impact of an event in a New York hotel room , of which we still know very little , is already huge .
And in the middle of it all is a man sitting in a police cell , wondering how he could get so close to his goals and then fall so quickly ."
2011-05-16,"For a former colleague at the International Monetary Fund , he is a "" remarkable politician ... an exceptionally adroit operator , playing people like they were pieces on a chess board "" .
A staunch ally in France 's Socialist party praises "" a mind of strength and subtlety , a real intellect … a moderniser , someone who saw the future of the left years before anyone else "" .
Students he taught at the top Paris business school HEC and at ENA , the hothouse for France 's elite , speak of "" warmth , wit and charm "" , "" huge charisma "" , "" a persuasive , seductive personality "" .
Few of which qualities will stand Dominique Strauss - Kahn – IMF chief , academic , former French finance minister and probably the left 's best chance of ejecting Nicolas Sarkozy from the Élysée palace next year – in particularly good stead as he waits in New York to defend himself against charges of sexual assault and attempted rape .
Having risen to prominence on the global stage only relatively recently in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , he may now be brought low by a failing long recognised in France , if rarely discussed owing to the country 's draconian privacy laws .
Strauss - Kahn has never before been accused of a violent sexual crime .
But his "" only real problem "" , Jean Quatremer of the left - leaning newspaper Libération warned presciently in 2007 – one of very few journalists to make more than oblique reference to the 62-year - old 's reputation – "" is his relationship to women …
Too forceful , he often verges on harassment .
"" That not insignificant consideration aside , Strauss - Kahn 's has been a career of almost uninterrupted progression through the ranks of France 's – and then the world 's – political and administrative elite .
The son of a tax adviser and a journalist , DSK , as he has been known in France since his earliest involvement in national politics in the 1970s , was born in Neuilly - sur - Seine , just outside Paris , in April 1949 .
The family moved to Morocco when he was barely two , but returned to France from Agadir following an earthquake there in 1960 .
Strauss - Kahn showed early academic promise , graduating with degrees in business studies , law and political science from HEC and Sciences - Po and a doctorate in economics from the University of Paris .
A friend from this period , the business leader Denis Kessler , recalls a bearded young academic "" with enormous commitment to the leftwing causes of the day – he was fiercely opposed to the Vietnam war – but at the same time a brilliant , dedicated and hard - working researcher and , ultimately , professor "" .
For several years he combined university teaching with a succession of increasingly senior civil service jobs in assorted economic planning departments .
Having flirted briefly with the communists ( he said later he gave that up "" as soon as I learned about economics "" ) , Strauss - Kahn joined the Socialist party in 1976 , and found himself economic affairs adviser to the future prime minister , Lionel Jospin , as early as 1981 .
He was first elected to parliament in 1986 , and appointed trade and industry minister by the then president , François Mitterrand , in 1991 .
Ejected from parliament in the Socialists ' heavy defeat of 1993 , he switched seamlessly to the private sector , making what the French press have frequently reported as a considerable personal fortune at the head of his own influential business and legal consultancy , DSK Consultants .
By now married to Anne Sinclair , daughter of a millionaire art dealer – Pierre Rosenberg represented Picasso , Braque and Matisse – and one of the country 's best - known TV journalists ( her Sunday interview programme , Sept sur Sept , was for some 13 years France 's most - watched politics show ) , DSK became an increasingly influential figure in the opposition Socialist party .
Instrumental in modernising the party 's economic policies , he was appointed finance and economic affairs minister under Jospin following the Socialists ' sweeping election victory in 1997 .
Suave , permatanned and plainly not short of a franc or two , Strauss - Kahn spoke against the Socialists ' flagship legislation , the 35-hour week , and embarked on a series of privatisations of major French public companies such as France Telecom , Crédit Lyonnais and Aérospatiale , none of which endeared him to party activists .
( For many on the left of the party , DSK remains almost a caricature champagne socialist , a despised "" social democrat "" whose views on labour relations , globalisation , austerity programmes and the primacy of the markets are closer to Thatcherism than to the traditions of French socialism .
Even had he decided to stand for the party 's nomination in the 2012 presidential elections , many commentators believe it is by no means certain he would have won it . )
Late in 1999 , he was forced to resign to clear his name in an array of complex financial scandals related to his consultancy .
Strauss - Kahn was subsequently cleared on all counts after a two - year investigation and re - elected as a constituency MP in 2002 , remaining a powerful member of the Socialist party 's national leadership , he wasbut beaten by Ségolène Royale to the party 's nomination for the 2006 presidential elections .
The following year a triumphant Sarkozy , recognising the centrist threat posed by DSK were he eventually to become the shattered Socialists ' figurehead , packed him off to the IMF with his blessing .
The president could not have anticipated the extent to which his potential rival would turn the global financial crisis to his advantage on the domestic stage .
Strauss - Kahn , whose first move at the IMF was to introduce radical reforms to the way it functioned , getting rid of some 600 staff and selling off part of its gold reserves , is widely credited with transforming the organisation , propelling it – and himself – to the fore as saviour of the single currency and the stricken economies of Greece , Ireland and Portugal .
While unable as IMF chief to make public his plans , if any , for the French presidency , Strauss - Kahn has nonetheless been running a highly successful advance campaign through a handful of energetic publicists from the Euro RSCG advertising agency .
Recent months have seen a slew of wildly favourable biographies and documentaries , and several not always scientific opinion polls have combined to put DSK far ahead of the field as French voters ' favoured candidate on the left , and perhaps the only "" credible "" candidate from the Socialist party .
Even more recently , the conservative press has made much of photos of him at the wheel of a Porsche , and published details of his brace of luxury apartments in central Paris , sumptuous riad in Marrakech , extensive art collection and € 25,000 suits made to measure by Barack Obama 's tailor .
The presidential campaign promised to be vicious to a degree not yet witnessed in French politics .
There seems little doubt , unless Strauss - Kahn is cleared within days , that that race will not now take place .
Some , including America 's ambassador to France , whose views were revealed by WikiLeaks , believed DSK lacked the "" fire in his belly "" to go through with a potentially dirty – and undoubtedly very personal – fight .
Many on the socialist left and the right of French politics believe he would not have won even if he had entered : he was a friend of bankers , industrialists and international economists , utterly unrepresentative of French socialism , a world away from the concerns of ordinary French people , incapable of uniting his party and not , ultimately , of the left at all .
For his backers , though , Dominique Strauss - Kahn was the only figure on the left with the charisma , arrogance , authority and force of personality to have a realistic chance of defeating even a severely weakened Sarkozy .
A reputation as a bit of a ladies ' man is no obstacle to success in French politics , indeed quite the reverse .
A conviction for assault and attempted rape , however , is an altogether different matter ."
2011-05-16,"A French writer who claims Dominique Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her nine years ago is to file an official complaint , her lawyer has announced .
Tristane Banon previously described the attack , which happened when she was in her early 20s , in a television programme in 2007 , when she called Strauss - Kahn , whose name was bleeped out , a "" rutting chimpanzee . ""
She says she consulted a lawyer at the time , but was persuaded not to take action by her mother , a regional councillor in the Socialist party and friend of the Strauss - Kahn family .
Banon is goddaughter to Strauss - Kahn 's second wife .
Banon 's lawyer , David Koubbi , said : "" We are planning to make a complaint .
I am working with her . ""
Strauss - Kahn was remanded in custody today after appearing in a New York court accused of a sexual attack on a hotel maid .
The 62-year - old head of the International Monetary Fund – who was widely tipped to be France 's next president – was refused bail by the judge , Melissa Jackson , who ruled he might attempt to flee the US .
His offer to post bail of one million dollars was turned down .
DSK , as he is known in France , will now stay in prison until his next court hearing on May 20 .
He faces charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , a criminal sex act , unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching and could face up to 25 years in prison .
Strauss - Kahn denies the charges .
Koubbi said Banon , now 31 , was "" literally blown over "" when she heard the claims Strauss - Kahn had attacked a hotel chambermaid in New York . ""
At the same time , she was certainly not surprised , "" he said .
Across France , after the shock of Strauss - Kahn 's arrest , came speculation , self - pity and conspiracy theories .
For some , the story of Strauss - Kahn 's fall from presidential hopeful to prison cell was a combination of sordid tale and Shakespearean tragedy .
For others the story was so extraordinary it smacked of a set - up .
Only three weeks ago , Strauss - Kahn evoked such a possibility in an interview with French newspaper Libération when he said he thought he was under surveillance and named the three principal difficulties he foresaw if he was to stand for the presidential elections .
"" Money , women and the fact I am Jewish . ""
He added : "" Yes , I like women ...
so what ? ""
He said he could see himself becoming the victim of a honey trap : "" a woman raped in a car park and who 's been promised 500,000 or a million euros to invent such a story ... "" But not in his or his Socialist party 's worst nightmares , nor in President Nicolas Sarkozy 's wildest dreams , could anyone imagine Strauss - Kahn , nicknamed with almost tacit admiration the ' Great Seducer ' , being at the epicentre of what was described as a "" political earthquake "" .
Jean - Marie Le Guen , a Socialist party MP who has known Strauss - Kahn for 25 years , said the story was "" not credible "" and inconsistent with what he knew of the politician 's character . ""
Seduction , yes , but no way would he use constraint or violence .
A certain number of facts , and certain aspects of the story we are hearing from the press , make this not credible . ""
He said Strauss - Kahn had not fled the scene of the alleged crime as reported but had lunched in New York before catching a flight booked weeks previously .
France - Soir reported that when plain - clothed police officers approached the politician in the first - class section of the Air France plane bound for Paris , he looked up at them and asked : "" What 's the matter ? ""
Le Guen said his friend knew he would be the target of mud - slinging but added : "" What they are asking us to believe …
it 's just hallucinations .
I 'm a doctor
and I know this can happen .
We knew there would be hyper - violent attacks on him [ Strauss - Kahn ] .
We could hear the knives being sharpened in preparation . ""
Libération editor Nicolas Demorand suggested France was having its first sex scandal "" à l'anglo saxonne "" and was "" brutally entering a zone of public debate which , up to now whether because of the cultural exception , the ' latin ' identity or democratic weakness has been confined to rumours and gossip among a small inner circle "" .
"" Politicians … enjoy a particular tolerance on this subject , "" he wrote .
"" Part of the shock comes also from the unusual scene , until now unthinkable here : police arresting a top - level politician on a matter of morals . ""
There is sympathy for Strauss - Kahn 's third wife , television journalist Anne Sinclair , who Le Guen said was bearing up with "" strength and courage "" .
In a spasm of self - flagellation , political commentators spoke of the affair as a disgrace and humiliation for France , referring to the country as "" the victim "" in the affair .
Nathalie Kosciusko - Morizet , the ecology minister , did at least mention the 32-year - old chambermaid allegedly attacked by Strauss - Kahn . ""
As well as the presumed victim , the chambermaid , there is a proven victim … France .
We should remember the facts are very serious ; in France we tend to treat things like this a little bit lightly , "" she told news agency AFP .
Of the pictures of Strauss - Kahn being led in handcuffs by New York police , criticised by some , including Le Guen as "" hyper violent "" , Kosciusko - Morizet said the French politician was a suspect like any other .
"" I have confidence in American justice …
it 's so French to see conspiracies everywhere
, it 's something I believe that 's in our culture . ""
The Socialist party was holding an emergency meeting to decide on how to react to the crisis in its ranks .
Two months from the closing date for the party 's primary election in October , Strauss - Kahn was the opposition 's main hope of unseating Sarkozy ."
2011-05-16,"I must admit that , when I first heard Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the IMF , had been taken off a plane to face an attempted rape charge in New York , I had a preposterous thought : "" That Sarko must be quite a piece of work to plant a hotel chambermaid within tempting distance of a naked and priapic DSK .
How on earth did he manage that ? ""
By this morning , various other fanciful notions had taken a firm hold on French public opinion , according to some media accounts .
Those villainous and puritanical Americans must have done it because they fear DSK ( 62 ) and his brilliant management of the IMF , conspiracy theorists are telling each other over their first Pernod of the day –
it is the soft power version of the raid on Abbottabad .
Not in the FT , of course .
The grown - ups ' focus is not on how the French head of the fund ( allegedly ) emerged from the shower in his $ 3,000-a - night suite at the Sofitel ( French , naturally ) in mid - town Manhattan to leap on the unnamed employee ( 32 ) and try ( allegedly ) to impose typically rough IMF terms on her , titillating though the details may be to some FT readers .
"" What exactly is a sex addict ? "" hedge fund managers , captains of industry and other masters of the universe will be asking each other in the steam bath at the gym , those whose vices have hitherto been confined to making money , not ( allegedly ) chambermaids .
It is a good question , certainly one that baffles me .
But let 's tackle the important things first .
The FT 's long - trousered focus is on the loss DSK 's departure in disgrace would be to the tottering world of high finance .
Three years ago , much of the world 's banking system came within hours of collapse , including ours .
We are all still in intensive care .
Is this petty moment of personal folly ( alleged ) the moment when the edifice starts to crumble ?
Probably not , but Strauss - Kahn matters to us because of his efforts to shore up the eurozone 's fragile financial base .
He has immense authority ( "" he may be the only senior policymaker who is not German whom the Germans take seriously "" ) and understands the situation .
The Guardian 's Larry Elliott is also alarmed .
The Greeks are nervous .
The Guardian 's editorial flag is at half mast .
DSK 's fate also matters because ( yet again ) his loss would be seen as the west having scored an own goal that weakens its standing in global affairs much as the banking crisis did .
The Washington - based IMF has been headed by a European ( often French ) since it and the World Bank ( headed by an American ) were set up as part of the postwar settlement .
That may not last .
The fund has been generous to European states in trouble – they are both creditors and borrowers – including Britain in 1976 .
Emerging Asian powers , notably China and India , have been saying "" it 's our turn "" , and are more likely to get DSK 's job when it becomes vacant – possibly quite soon – than they were on Friday .
They will be less sympathetic to profligate white folk , and understandably so .
Last but not least ( to the French ) , the arrest of DSK blows a Titanic - sinking hole in the script for the 2012 presidential elections in which clever , glamorous and worldly DSK ( a former French finance minister in the Jospin era ) returns in triumph from a successful tenure at the IMF – as it has been – to crush the pipsqueak
Nicolas Sarkozy 's ( 56 ) hopes of a second term in the Élysée Palace .
None of that was assured .
Ségolène Royal ( 57 ) and her estranged partner , father of her four kids , François Hollande ( 56 ) ( no bourgeois Miliband - esque compromises for them ! ) are also manoeuvring for the Socialist candidacy .
So is Jacques Delors ' daughter , Martine Aubry ( 60 ) .
On the far right , Marine le Pen ( 42 ) is already proving a more adept National Front candidate than her old dad .
The dynastic Le Pens campaign against the self - styled French "" republican elite "" whose conduct ( also quite dynastic ) makes the domestic arrangements of David Laws and Chris Huhne look a little staid , and David Cameron 's Flashman - esque tendencies a touch vapid .
Now that Alan Clark has gone to higher service and Steve Norris has hung up his trousers , all Britain can offer by way of sex addiction is a couple of footballers and a sprinkling of sad super - injunctions .
Meanwhile , Marine Le Pen now adds allegations of offensive and persistent behaviour towards women to the charge sheet against DSK on top of accusations of very high living already levelled by his own side .
A serious pickle , then , and one that may cause us all collateral damage .
We have to assume that DSK is not guilty unless proven guilty , but that is a judicial matter .
Politically , DSK , in handcuffs , is already all but dead .
As Agnès Poirier , my favourite French commentator , said on Radio 4 this morning , an extra - marital affair is nobody 's business , but allegations of rape are something else .
He has "" hours or days "" to save himself , she said .
Living in London as she does , Poirier is probably more frank than the Paris branch of the trade , where the pronounced weaknesses of the political and corporate elite – think François Mitterrand 's mistress and daughter living in the Élysée , an open secret – are usually discussed only in private , though , even in France , that is changing .
The privacy - focused system has its strengths ( they think the Anglo - Saxons weird and hypocritical about sex ) , but its weaknesses show at times like this .
As I have noted here before , a French reporter once made claims to me about Jacques Chirac 's womanising ( we were waiting for a Blair - Chirac press conference to start ) and I said : "" It could n't happen here . ""
"" Of course not , it would all be in the tabloids , "" he replied .
Each case is different .
Did I know about John Prescott 's office liaison ?
No .
Did I know that Alan Clark played the field ?
Yes .
He occasionally talked about it .
Some do .
As I have argued here before .
So why would a wealthy and successful man like DSK , married to someone who sounds a formidably impressive wife , with the world at his feet , leap ( allegedly ) on a New York chambermaid and ruin it all ?
Good question , not yet answered by Fleet Street features departments .
The Mail 's story , wrongly entitled "" Hollywood 's first sex addict "" , was about Richard Burton 's prodigious need for sex and his capacity to deliver the goods wherever and whenever opportunity arose .
Handsome , clever , shameless , funny
– Burton was all those things and blessed with a vast memory for seductive poetry , wrote his latest biographer , Tom Rubython .
But it was his voice that clinched his conquests .
Three women a week for 30 years ?
I was exhausted just reading about it and gave up halfway .
Clearly Burton loved women as well as sex .
But I 'm not sure this is always the case .
A love of risk and intrigue is part of the story for men with lots to lose , we are told .
So is power over women and the capacity to abuse it .
Some Don Juans I know do n't seem actually to like them much .
Each case is different , and surely revolves around how the parties felt about the transaction .
So far as we can tell , JFK ( who claimed he got a headache after two days without sex ) got no complaints .
In less protective times , Bill Clinton seems to have attracted few except the chequebook kiss - and - tell variety .
But Clinton obviously liked women , too .
Our own mid - Victorian prime minister , Lord Palmerston , was a notorious ladies ' man and very popular with it .
When he got mixed up in a paternity case in his 70s , Disraeli is supposed to have said : "" We must keep it a secret , or he will sweep the country .
"" That may be why some columnists have been arguing that Cameron 's Flashman image is one to be treasured , not deplored .
So life - affirming qualities are usually more attractive than puritan ones .
But attempted rape is not ."
2011-05-16,"By this time next year , Dominique Strauss - Kahn might well have been president of France .
The 62-year - old was by far the most popular choice to be the Socialist presidential candidate , and he was the only contender seen as capable of unseating Nicolas Sarkozy .
But now his plan to run for the Elysée Palace appears to be in ruins , even without resolution of the New York case , after further allegations against him were broadcast on French television on Sunday night .
A local official of the Socialist party claimed that Strauss - Kahn had attacked her daughter , who is goddaughter to Strauss - Kahn 's second wife , in 2002 .
Tristane Banon was in her 20s and writing a book when she approached Strauss - Kahn for an interview in 2002 .
In a TV programme in 2007 , in which Strauss - Kahn 's name had been bleeped out , Banon allegedly described him as a "" rutting chimpanzee "" and described how she was forced to fight him off .
"" It finished badly … very violently …
I kicked him , "" Banon said .
"" When we were fighting , I mentioned the word ' rape ' to make him afraid , but it did n't have any effect .
I managed to get out . ""
Banon consulted a lawyer , but did not press charges .
"" I did n't want to be known to the end of my days as the girl who had a problem with the politician . ""
Banon 's mother , Anne Mansouret , told journalists on Sunday night she had dissuaded her daughter from legal action because she believed Strauss - Kahn 's behaviour had been out of character and because of close links with his family . ""
Today I am sorry to have discouraged my daughter from complaining .
I bear a heavy responsibility , "" she said .
She said Strauss - Kahn was "" an otherwise warm , sympathetic and extremely talented man "" , but the attack left her daughter depressed and traumatised .
"" My daughter , despite the passing years , is still shocked by these facts .
Her life was completely upset by this affair and she was depressed for a long time . ""
She added that it was clear Strauss - Kahn had "" difficulty controlling his urges "" .
She said : "" I 'm not a doctor or psychiatrist , but there is something violent in this predatory move . ""
Of the half - a - dozen candidates expected to seek the Socialist party nomination in the autumn , Strauss - Kahn was the frontrunner .
A poll for the Parisien newspaper , before the furore erupted , gave him 41 % among members of his party , way ahead of his nearest rival .
With Sarkozy 's popularity at a record low , "" DSK "" was on track to get to the Elysée Palace in the two - round election next year .
However , supporters warned him the fight would be dirty .
Last week he claimed to be victim of a "" smear campaign "" orchestrated by the French president after details emerged of his luxury lifestyle , with photos of him climbing into a friend 's £ 87,000 Porsche outside his £ 3.5 m Paris home .
Another paper claimed he had a penchant for suits costing anything up to £ 22,000 , an allegation he denied and over which he threatened legal action .
His supporters dismissed the stories as mud - slinging .
But in 2008 , after a well - documented affair with Piroska Nagy a Hungarian economist and a junior colleague at the IMF , he was forced to publicly apologise for "" an error of judgment "" , but was cleared of abusing his position .
He insisted the relationship was consensual , but when his wife , journalist Anne Sinclair , described it as a "" one - night stand "" , an indignant Nagy wrote to investigators saying : "" I was not prepared for the advances of the IMF director general .
I did n't know what to do …
I felt damned if I do , damned if I do n't . ""
Nagy left her job at the IMF after the affair , and hinted at harassment of female staff , adding that her boss had "" without question "" used his position to seduce her .
Sinclair , Strauss - Kahn 's third wife , told journalists she had forgiven her husband : "" We love each other as much as before . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's alleged womanising appears to have been an open secret in French political circles for years .
Thierry Saussez , a former adviser to Sarkozy , who took part in the TV show with Banon , said : "" All this stupefaction from people is sheer hypocrisy .
Everyone in Paris has known for years he had something of a problem .
Not many female journalists are prepared to interview him alone these days . ""
In 2009 , the radio satirist Stephane Guillon dedicated his morning comedy slot on France Inter to Strauss - Kahn 's "" obsession with females "" .
Some commentators suggested his behaviour was a reflection of French culture .
In 2000 French writers Vincent Giret and Véronique Le Billon wrote almost presciently in their biography of him : "" There is only one thing this famous man has avoided … a fall from grace . """

The arrest of the IMF chief at the weekend has been taken by the market as adding another element of uncertainty into the outlook for risk .
Although the IMF is playing a key part in the peripheral bailouts , it is unlikely that this incident will obstruct the progress made in either the Portuguese or Greece packages .
The Portuguese situation is scheduled to take centre stage during today 's EU finance ministers meeting .
Approval of a bailout is widely expected to be given ; the bond market is awaiting to see whether or not the interest rate tied to the loan can be viewed as punitive or not .
Joshua Raymond , market strategist at City Index
The arrest over the weekend of Dominique Strauss - Kahn has done little to upset stock markets today , whilst the euro , having initially suffered in early trade , has bounced back to gain against the dollar and sterling .
Naturally traders are attempting to speculate as to what the impact of no Strauss - Kahn could have on today 's talks with EU finance ministers on Greece .
The truth of the matter is it is likely to make little difference .
Manchester United would have still won the Premier League title without Sir Alex Ferguson at the game against Blackburn Rovers over the weekend and the IMF 's goals will maintain in the short term until there is clarity over the validity of allegations made against the IMF 's leader .
In truth , the allegations over the weekend may have only served to speed up Strauss - Kahn 's expected departure from the IMF .
He had been long expected to run for the French presidency next year , and had he done so , a change in leadership at the IMF was likely to be only months away .
The impact of Strauss - Kahn not heading up the IMF , should this turn out to be the case , could be more in the shape of a change in long - term strategy , particularly if his replacement is not European .
The "" special relationship "" between the IMF and Europe has been long heralded over the last few years .
Under Strauss - Kahn 's stewardship , the body has been hugely beneficial in attempting to proactively stabilise the eurozone debt situation , and so a new leader may attempt to strengthen the IMF 's scope of activities to outside of the eurozone , particularly emerging markets and helping to correct the global imbalances of currency manipulation .
Gavan Nolan , director of credit research at Markit
The news about Dominique Strauss - Kahn is dominating the headlines but having little impact on sentiment in the financial markets .
Some have suggested that his potential removal as head of the IMF could derail bailouts for peripheral eurozone countries .
But the sovereign market is outperforming today , suggesting that investors see the news as a non - issue .

Over time it is possible that the IMF could adopt a tougher stance towards European countries under a different leader if the arrest of IMF head leads to his departure as managing director ( deputy managing director Nemat Shafik will represent the IMF at today 's Ecofin meeting )
but it is difficult to believe that it will have a short - term impact ."
2011-05-16,"A New York judge has ordered the head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , to be remanded in custody after prosecutors expressed fears that he might flee to France to escape charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid .
The judge , Melissa Jackson , refused a request for bail , agreeing that Strauss - Kahn , who was pulled off a Paris - bound plane on Saturday and charged with a criminal sexual act , attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment , represented a flight risk .
His defence lawyers said Strauss - Kahn denied the charges , and one of them , Ben Brafman , said it was "" quite likely he will be exonerated "" .
Earlier they said Strauss - Kahn had agreed to undergo scientific and forensic tests and intends to "" vigorously "" defend himself .
The prosecution on Monday compared Strauss - Kahn to Roman Polanski , the film director who fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with an underage girl .
Prosecutors said they were investigating an additional incident , without specifying what it related to , and that they were waiting for the forensic information from the hotel .
The defence offered $ 1 m ( £ 618,000 ) bail and said the IMF chief was prepared to reside with his daughter in Manhattan and wear an electronic bracelet .
But the judge refused .
Strauss - Kahn appeared tired , impassive and dishevelled at the hearing , having waited for the court to deal with a string of more mundane cases involving three men accused of minor drugs offences .
The charges threaten to create a leadership vacuum at the IMF , overseer of the global economy , and throw wide open next year 's French presidential election , ending the hopes of the French Socialist who was favourite to beat Nicolas Sarkozy .
The euro fell to a seven - week low against the dollar on Monday after the charges , raising uncertainty over the status of aid to Greece .
Strauss - Kahn was led off an Air France flight on Sunday as he headed for Europe for crunch talks with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and European finance ministers over the debt crisis .
He was charged with assaulting a 32-year - old maid at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
The maid identified Strauss - Kahn at a police lineup at the special victims unit in Harlem , New York , where the 62-year - old was being held .
William Taylor , another of Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers , said : "" Our client willingly consented to scientific and forensic examinations at the request of the government . ""
Taylor said Strauss - Kahn was "" tired , but he 's fine "" .
Strauss - Kahn is alleged to have left his hotel in a hurry after sexually assaulting the maid , forgetting his mobile phone and other items .
The woman has not been named .
In a statement , Jorge Tito , the managing director of Sofitel New York , said he could not comment on the case . ""
However , we want to stress that our employee has been working with Sofitel New York for three years and we have been completely satisfied with the quality of her work and behaviour . ""
The 32-year - old hotel worker told police she entered Strauss - Kahn 's room to clean it at around 1 pm on Saturday .
He allegedly emerged from the bathroom naked , ran after her and dragged her into a bedroom where he began sexually assaulting her on the bed .
According to the police account of the "" brutal "" attack , he locked the door to the suite , then dragged the maid down a hallway into a bathroom where he assaulted her again .
The woman escaped from the room and was later treated in hospital for minor injuries .
Police found Strauss - Kahn had left his room seemingly "" in a hurry "" , leaving behind personal items including his phone .
The allegation is a major embarrassment to the IMF , which has authorised billions of dollars in aid to troubled countries and played a major role in the eurozone debt crisis .
The arrest will cast a cloud over the IMF 's role in addressing the rescues , and is likely to have an impact on stock markets as traders react to yet more uncertainty in Europe .
Strauss - Kahn had been due in Europe for talks over how best to tackle Greece 's worsening debt crisis and finalise Portugal 's € 78bn bailout package .
A senior Greek government official said the arrest would not change the IMF 's policy in Greece but could cause delays in the short term .
The IMF - led bailout has become increasingly unpopular with other IMF members amid growing doubts about the Greek government 's ability and resolve to meet the commitments of the international aid package . ""
This adds uncertainty to the prospect of early resolution .
The more uncertainty exists in terms of major institutions , the higher the cost for a country like Greece , "" Louka Katseli , the minister of labour and social security , told the Guardian .
"" What is needed are firm decisions [ to ensure ] financing for the next years , "" she said .
The IMF this weekend appointed John Lipsky , first deputy managing director , as interim boss in Strauss - Kahn 's place .
The board had been due to meet on Sunday in what it described as a "" informal "" meeting but issued a statement saying the briefing had been postponed "" pending further developments in New York "" .
The case threatens to throw the spotlight on Strauss - Kahn 's reputation in France for targeting women , something alluded to but hushed up in the press .
On Sunday night Anne Mansouret , a Socialist councillor , alleged on French state TV that her daughter , the novelist Tristane Banon , had been the victim of an attempted sex attack by Strauss - Kahn in 2002 but had not gone to police .
Mansouret claimed Strauss - Kahn had "" a kind of addiction , a difficulty in controlling his impulses , which is a problem "" .
She claimed his "" preying "" on women was a kind of "" violence "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's allies said he was a well - known seducer but the allegations of attempted rape seemed far - fetched and unlikely .
Strauss - Kahn does not have diplomatic immunity as head of the IMF .
After a night in police custody in Harlem , he was expected to appear before a county judge .
Under New York state law , a criminal sexual act and attempted rape both carry potential 15- to 20-year prison sentences .
Unlawful imprisonment carries a three- to five - year sentence ."
2011-05-16,"There was a gasp from spectators when Dominique Strauss - Kahn was finally led into room 130 of the Manhattan criminal court .
It was n't as if his appearance was unexpected .
An international assembly of journalists had packed the narrow benches for the better part of a day waiting for the 62-year - old IMF boss .
It was just that he looked so out of place .
Reporters stood and half crouched to get a better look before being ordered to sit down as Strauss - Kahn was brought in from a backroom in handcuffs .
The French presidential candidate and alleged sex offender sat on a bench at the back of the room .
He seemed to be trying to shrink himself into the corner as he waited his turn before the judge .
The proceedings started with a retinal scan , a relatively new procedure that is done in the court room .
Strauss - Kahn 's cellmates lined up to have their pictures taken first .
Some squinted , some widened their eyes as if in shock , some smiled , others looked defiant , one had to lift her long fringe out of the way as the cameraman moved in for her closeup .
Strauss - Kahn stared into the lens looking angry , embarrassed and lost .
Looking a little like a Gallic Bernard Madoff , Strauss - Kahn wore a black mac and trousers .
They would have appeared smart if they did n't look like he had slept in them .
There was little evidence of the flair and charisma that led to him being known as "" the great seducer "" .
Despite his slept - in appearance , DSK was still better dressed than his fellow prisoners .
Most were 30-plus years younger than him , black or Latino , wearing baggy jeans and T - shirts and carrying baseball caps .
All of the other middle - aged white guys in court were wearing uniforms or scribbling in notebooks .
They were free to leave whenever they liked .
Most of the accused were on drug charges .
Many were sent home on bail , one with a fine of $ 75 , another with a few days ' community service .
There were moments of humour .
One man accused of drug possession was found with a batch of glassine bags – the packaging of choice for drug merchants .
He said he used them to collect buttons .
Every seat was taken and no standing was allowed .
Relatives of the accused were unable to find a perch , the accused themselves were told to wait in the corridor for their paperwork .
Outside the room an international press pack lobbied for entry until eventually the authorities caved and allowed a few to line the walls .
Many of the journalists had spent the better part of Sunday waiting for Strauss - Kahn 's arraignment and were clearly outstaying their welcome as far as some of the court police were concerned .
"" Do they think we should do their jobs for them ? "" said one when asked , again , what the judge 's name was .
Her name is Melissa Jackson , supervising judge for New York county 's criminal court .
Jackson has overseen many high - profile cases .
Earlier this month she imprisoned two men who allegedly plotted to blow up New York synagogues and possibly the Empire State Building .
She is not a woman to be messed with .
Jackson once got in to an altercation with rapper , and notorious diva , Foxy Brown .
Brown had assaulted a neighbour with her Blackberry . ""
Counsel , she has gum in her mouth , "" Jackson told Brown 's lawyer .
The rapper stuck out her tongue to prove she did n't and soon found herself handcuffed to a bench .
Brown got feisty with her would be jailers and refused to apologise until Jackson waved the threat of an extra 30-days in jail before her lawyer .
Strauss - Kahn stood quietly , head bowed as his lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , tried to keep him out of jail .
Brafman , too , is used to high - profile cases ; his former charges have included Sean "" P Diddy "" Combs and Michael Jackson .
But even he looked distracted as a battery of cameramen was allowed in court to take yet more photos
Strauss - Kahn is unlikely to be putting on his mantle .
Every step of his downfall seems to have been presented as a photo opportunity .
In the end Strauss - Kahn 's appearance in Manhattan criminal court lasted all of 30 minutes , but it capped a two - day odyssey through the bowels of New York 's criminal system .
After his arrest late on Saturday he was held in a cell in a special victims ' unit in East Harlem as an ever growing press pack waited outside .
He was then placed in a police lineup and identified by his alleged victim , who was escorted from the building beneath a blanket .
Strauss - Kahn was to have been in court on Sunday but that was delayed by medical and forensic examinations .
Late on Sunday , he was brought out of his Harlem cell in handcuffs to be dazzled by flashbulbs , the "" perp - walk "" familiar to high - profile suspects and loved by prosecutors and the press .
After all the waiting his first appearance in court brought gasps from the audience .
Having failed in his bid for temporary freedom Strauss - Kahn kept his back to the crowd .
Then he was led away again , shoulders hunched , to a room at the back of the court where prison bars were clearly visible .

This article was amended on 17 May 2011 .
The original said that [ Melissa ] Jackson waived the threat of an extra 30-days in jail before a lawyer .
This has been corrected ."
2011-05-16,"Less than three weeks ago , Dominique Strauss - Kahn sat down in a Paris restaurant for an off - the - record lunch with two journalists from the daily Libération .
The IMF chief outlined the three biggest personal hurdles in his relentless campaign to become president of France : "" Money , women and being a Jew . ""
He started with women . ""
Yes I like women ,
so what ?
"" he asked . ""
For years , there 's been talk of photos of a giant orgy , but I 've never seen them come out , "" he added , challenging his opponents to produce long - rumoured pictures of a night at a posh swingers ' club dating back decades .
He said he had warned President Nicolas Sarkozy ( while they stood side by side at the urinals of the gents during a recent international summit ) to stop smearing him over his private life .
Strauss - Kahn then volunteered to the journalists a hypothetical example of something that could bring him down : "" A woman raped in a parking lot who is promised half a million euros to make up her story . ""
Before Strauss - Kahn 's opponents began throwing what one socialist described as "" stink bombs "" at him , he was keen to present himself as the victim of a potentially ruthless campaign .
Everyone in French political and media circles knew Strauss - Kahn 's achilles heel was his attitude to women .
Even his closest political allies admitted he was an inveterate seducer , an unashamed libertine .
But what makes the scandal new and unprecedented in a presidential race is the crossing of the line to sexual violence , attempted rape and brutal assault .
Strauss - Kahn denies the charges , and his allies call him a seducer without the "" profile of a rapist "" .
But if , as the extreme - right Marine Le Pen affirms , all of Paris had long been abuzz with talk of his "" rather pathological relationship "" with women , why was n't Strauss - Kahn pulled up on it before in France ?
He had already been chastised by the IMF over one affair with a junior in 2008 .
It raises the uncomfortable question in the French media and politics of two parallel worlds : what is printed , and what is behind it , gossip , and what must officially remain "" unsaid "" .
Consensual extramarital sex is a non - story in France , part of the right to a private life protected by fearsome libel and privacy laws .
Having a mistress , philandering , even routinely propositioning journalists have been brushed aside for countless political figures . ""
How many senior male French politicians are n't either a groper , a cheater , a charmer or a serial seducer ?
And it goes right to the top of the political class , "" sighed one news editor .
"" France is still a kind of monarchy that kept the aristocratic morals of the 18th century .
The lord of the manor has a right to the women ; the king has his mistresses .
"" If more allegations against Strauss - Kahn come to light and lead to criminal charges , it will call into question a taboo in France about speaking out .
Tristane Banon , the novelist and journalist is , according to her lawyer , preparing to go to police alleging Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her in 2002 .
Her mother , Anne Mansouret , a senior Socialist figure , said that she advised her daughter not to file a lawsuit at the time because Strauss - Kahn was a politician with a bright future , as well as a friend of the family .
But she said that even the fact that her daughter later spoke out publicly about the attack on TV had left her "" traumatised "" by the subsequent "" harassment "" in her professional life over having dared to speak out .
Her mother suggested there was a kind of "" invisible barrier "" put up on her work projects , as if media bosses and publishers feared the consequences of "" what she could reveal "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's spokesman has previously denied the claim , and said Banon had invented the allegation to generate publicity for herself .
The journalists , Christophe Deloire and Christophe Dubois , broke a taboo in their 2006 book , Sexus Politicus , about politicians ' sexual behaviour .
They wrote of Strauss - Kahn 's tendency to "" seduction to the point of obsession "" , mentioning , but not naming , female journalists who had been irritated by his gestures towards them .
They also referred to one senior civil servant who did n't take up his offer to "" come up to his office to relax "" .
It seemed striking that when Strauss - Kahn left for the IMF in Washington in 2007 , with many politicians privately wondering how he would cope in a puritan US which frowns upon sexual advances , only one journalist raised the issue .
Brussels correspondent for Libération , Jean Quatremer , wrote on his blog : "" Strauss - Kahn 's only real problem is his relationship to women .
Too heavy … it borderlines harassment . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's communications team asked him to take the blog down .
Quatremer explained to Le Parisien that he had refused , saying if they thought it was libellous , they could sue .
They did not .
In 2008 , the French press began to more openly touch on the issue of Strauss - Kahn and women after the IMF investigated his affair with a junior colleague , the Hungarian economist Piroska Nagy .
He was cleared of abusing his position but was forced to apologise .
Nagy said she thought he had a "" problem "" which affected his ability to work with women .
Others in France spoke out .
The Socialist party MP Aurelie Filipetti recalled a "" very heavy , very pressing "" come - on to her by Strauss - Kahn .
She said that afterwards : "" I made sure I never ended up alone with him in a closed space . ""
The humorist Stephane Guillon went furthest in 2009 , satirising Strauss - Kahn 's "" obsession with females "" on the equivalent of Radio 4 's Today programme .
Strauss - Kahn accused him on air of "" nastiness "" and Guillon – already under fire for lampooning several political figures – was sacked shortly afterwards .
In 2006 , when Strauss - Kahn failed in his bid to become the Socialist presidential candidate , part of his problem was his publicly haughty and condescending attitude to the eventual winner , Ségolène Royal .
But five years later , as Strauss - Kahn 's opinion poll ratings soared and he was tipped to become president , it was clear that a saga like the Nagy affair had no effect on the electorate 's view .
Sexual violence is another matter entirely .
In a country where the leader 's sexual habits are officially ignored , allegations of attempted rape have been a severe shock ."
2011-05-16,"Talks on resolving the European debt crisis have been plunged into disarray after the head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a maid in a New York hotel .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , was taken from the first class cabin of a Paris - bound Air France flight at JFK airport by plainclothes officers then formally arrested on charges of a criminal sexual act , attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment .
The charges threaten to create a leadership vacuum at the IMF , overseer of the global economy , and throw open next year 's French presidential election , ending the hopes of the French Socialist who was favourite to beat Nicolas Sarkozy .
The allegation is a major embarrassment to the IMF , which has authorised billions of dollars of lending to troubled countries and played a major role in the eurozone debt crisis .
The arrest will cast a cloud over the IMF 's role in addressing the rescues and is likely to have an impact on stock markets as traders react to yet more uncertainty in Europe .
Strauss - Kahn had been flying to Europe to discuss the worsening European debt crisis .
He had been scheduled to meet the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , on Sunday and European financial ministers on Monday and Tuesday .
He was to have discussed how best to tackle Greece 's worsening debt crisis and finalise Portugal 's € 78bn bailout package .
A senior Greek government official said the arrest would not change the IMF 's policy in Greece but could cause delays in the short term .
The IMF - led bailout has become increasingly unpopular with other IMF members amid growing doubts about the Greek government 's ability and resolve to meet the commitments of the international aid package .
The IMF said on Sunday that it "" remains fully functioning and operational "" .
The deputy managing director , John Lipsky , would step in as acting chief and another official would attend today 's meeting in Brussels . ""
Mr Strauss - Kahn has retained legal counsel , and the IMF has no comment on the case ; all inquiries will be referred to his personal lawyer and to the local authorities , "" said a spokesman .
The case threatens to throw the spotlight on Strauss - Kahn 's reputation in France for targeting women , something alluded to but hushed up in the press .
On Sunday night Anne Mansouret , a Socialist councillor , alleged on French state TV that her daughter , the novelist Tristane Banon , had been the victim of an attempted sex attack by Strauss - Kahn in 2002 but had not gone to police .
Mansouret claimed Strauss - Kahn had "" a kind of addiction , a difficulty in controlling his impulses , which is a problem "" .
She claimed his "" preying "" on women was a kind of "" violence "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's allies said he was a well - known seducer but the allegations of attempted rape seemed far - fetched and unlikely .
The 32-year - old hotel worker at Manhattan 's Sofitel , near Times Square , told police she entered Strauss - Kahn 's room to clean it at around 1 pm on Saturday .
He allegedly emerged from the bathroom naked , ran after her and dragged her into a bedroom where he began sexually assaulting her on the bed .
According to the police account of the "" brutal "" attack , he locked the door to the suite , then dragged her down a hallway into a bathroom where he assaulted her again .
The woman escaped from the room and was later treated in hospital for minor injuries .
Police found Strauss - Kahn had left his room seemingly "" in a hurry "" , leaving behind personal items including his phone .
He was detained by police at 4 pm on a flight about to take off for Paris .
A spokesman for the hotel said the woman had worked there for three years , and was "" completely satisfactory in terms of her work and behaviour "" .
New York police said the maid later picked Strauss - Kahn out of a lineup , the Associated Press reported .
Strauss - Kahn does not have diplomatic immunity as head of the IMF .
After a night in police custody in Harlem , he was expected to appear before a county judge .
Under New York state law , a criminal sexual act and attempted rape both carry potential 15 to 20-year prison sentences .
Unlawful imprisonment carries a three to five - year sentence .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , said : "" He denies all the charges against him .
And that 's all I can really say right now .
"" Brafman is one of New York 's most high - profile defence lawyers .
His clients have included mobsters and celebrities such as Sean "" P Diddy "" Combs and ex - New York Giants football star Plaxico Burress .
Howard Wheeldon , senior strategist at BGC Partners , said the arrest was a "" huge blow "" for the IMF . ""
DSK has changed attitudes to the IMF .
Seven or so years ago it was n't perceived to be going its job , he 's done a lot to reshape it .
The timing is very bad , both for the organisation and for the unfortunate degree of uncertainty it will generate in the sovereign debt crisis . ""
The French left was thrown into disarray .
Strauss - Kahn , the favourite to beat Sarkozy in the 2012 election race had been expected to announce his candidacy next month .
The allegations mark the end of that hope and will worsen infighting on the left .
The Socialist economist Jacques Attali said Strauss - Kahn 's 2012 presidential hopes were dead : "" Even if he pleads not guilty , which he may be , he wo n't be able to be candidate for the Socialist primary for the presidency and he wo n't be able to stay at the IMF . ""
Others felt Strauss - Kahn had shamed the entire French political class .
The centrist politician François Bayrou said : "" If the facts prove true … it 's something degrading for all women .
It 's terrible for France 's image . ""
Bernard Debré said Strauss - Kahn 's wallowing in sex was a "" humiliation "" for France .
Dominique Paille , of the centrist Radical party said if true "" it would be a historic moment , in the negative sense , for French politics . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's arrest provoked nervousness in Greece , the country at the centre of Europe 's worsening economic crisis . ""
This adds uncertainty to the prospect of early resolution .
The more uncertainty exists in terms of major institutions , the higher the cost for a country like Greece , "" Louka Katseli , the minister of labour and social security , told the Guardian .
"" What is needed are firm decisions [ to ensure ] financing for the next years , "" she said .
"" The IMF under his stewardship has been more flexible with Greece than its other creditors the EU and ECB , "" said Theodore Pelagidis , professor or economic analysis at the university of Piraeus .
"" He was much more understanding of the nature of the crisis .
This now makes the situation more complex because one of the principal negotiators is out of the game and people are asking who is next and what should we expect ? ""
Professor Tom Cooley , former dean of Stern School of Business at New York University , said : "" It is a blow to the IMF at a time when they have begun to define a new and important role for the institution in the modern global economy . ""
Cooley said that the IMF was "" an organisation of consummate professionals with deep professional leadership so I am sure they will carry on just fine . """
2011-05-16,"Woken to the news that his greatest rival had been arrested on attempted rape charges , Nicolas Sarkozy did what he does best to show he was unflustered and calm .
He went for an early morning jog .
But he is not thought to have worn his famous New York police department T - shirt .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn was the pollsters ' favourite and Sarkozy 's key challenger , but his apparent elimination from the race does not mean the French president will automatically win in 2012 .
The deeply unpopular Sarkozy , who once styled himself as the great reformer , is accused of massively disappointing France , favouring the rich , doing nothing to help the struggling middle and lower classes , dividing society , stigmatising Muslims and damaging the standing of the presidency with his personal foibles .
His approval ratings have dropped below one - third of the electorate and his re - election bid will be tough .
His centre - right UMP party is squabbling and divided .
The far - right Marine Le Pen is a serious threat – polling high and threatening to knock the mainstream right or left out of the final - round runoff .
Le Pen , who likes to set herself apart from the ruling political class , is expected to benefit from the DSK scandal .
New centrist candidates , such as the former minister Jean - Louis Borloo , are also threatening to eat into Sarkozy 's vote .
Whoever the Socialists choose to replace the one - time favourite Strauss - Kahn , the New York hotel allegations are a huge difficulty .
Until now , the left had hoped to run a campaign easily picking apart the loathed personal failings of Sarkozy : his bling - bling tastes , his vaunting of his private life , his unpresidential demeanour .
This will now be almost impossible .
While sex assault charges hang over Strauss - Kahn it will mean any attack on Sarkozy 's behaviour will seem trifling in comparison and easily batted back .
One government minister told Le Monde : "" There 's a kind of jubilation because these Socialist types have n't stopped lecturing us on morals and virtue for years . ""
Ministers and Élysée advisers were ordered on Monday to publicly respect Strauss - Kahn 's presumption of innocence , not to say France had been humiliated by the affair and certainly not to be seen to rejoice .
Several political figures on left and right suggested the possibility of the Strauss - Kahn scandal being a plot or a trap that directly benefits Sarkozy .
But even in the president 's entourage , the election race now seemed wide - open with no certainties .
Some on the right felt the DSK scandal had come too soon .
If it had been at the end of the campaign , it would have left Sarkozy with a clear run , but now it simply opened the course for any permutation of new candidates on the left and centre – mostly unknown quantities .
There are two initial Socialist favourites to run .
François Hollande , polling high , is the jovial self - styled "" ordinary guy "" and social democrat .
But the party leader Martine Aubry seems to threaten Sarkozy the most – as a woman steeped in local leftwing politics she is the opposite of the president .
Aubry 's deputy , Harlem Désir , insisted the party had not been "" decapitated or weakened "" .
The Socialists will hold urgent talks on Tuesday to decide how to proceed with their primary race to choose a candidate , due to begin next month ."
2011-05-16,"With Dominique Strauss - Kahn locked in a New York police station , the IMF is likely to be sidelined in talks about the European debt crisis , City analysts warned .
Despite providing billions of euros in funds to Greece , Ireland , and more recently Portugal , experts said that the IMF could now be distracted by the allegation facing Strauss - Kahn , and the power vacuum left behind him , thereby damaging its chances of bringing the eurozone 's warring factions to a workable conclusion .
Strauss - Kahn was French finance minister when the euro was created in 1999 , and had brought his organisation centre stage as governments wrestled with the financial crisis .
As an authority on Europe 's economic issues and being comfortable with its web of power politics , he has paid particular attention to the lurching sovereign debt crisis being played out in Brussels .
His experience is widely perceived to have been crucial while the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , wrestled with the eurozone 's biggest crisis since its inception .
His absence will increase worries about the IMF 's longer - term capacity to promote deals to an increasingly divided Europe .
"" It 's like losing an experienced ship 's captain , while navigating particularly difficult , uncharted waters , "" said Jan Randolph , head of sovereign risk analysis at IHS Global Insight .
Nick Bullman , of advisory firm CheckRisk , said Ireland faced losing one of its champions in the negotiations : "" Sarkozy and Ireland 's taoiseach , Enda Kenny , have not hit it off well , and the Strauss - Kahn arrest frees Sarkozy to take a tougher line on Ireland 's corporate tax rates , "" he said .
France wants Ireland to increase corporate tax from 12.5 % to nearer the EU average , in return for a more generous debt package .
In Washington , Strauss - Kahn 's absence will be felt , especially among staff from outside the EU and US who saw him as less of a western poodle than predecessors .
In Europe , he argued vociferously for Greece to be cut more slack as it searched for a solution to its huge debts .
A meeting scheduled for Monday with Merkel was expected to involve a heated exchange on Greece , with Merkel taking a harder line .
Strauss - Kahn allowed his staff earlier this year to attack the US , its main paymaster , for running a bigger budget deficit while others tried to reduce theirs .
He also changed the emphasis of the fund 's lending from simply a means to impose neo - liberal capitalism on near - bankrupt victims , to a more sympathetic programme with less micro - management from Washington .
At the IMF 's most recent conference in Washington , Strauss - Kahn stressed the failure of western governments to promote job creation as a means of safeguarding social democratic structures .
He feared the riots in Athens would spread across Europe .
"" Whatever else one might like to think of him , Dominic Strauss - Kahn does have the remarkable ability to cut a knife through dogmatic politics and diplomacy when it occurs , "" said Howard Wheeldon , senior strategist at BGC Partners .
One question is whether it is now more likely the IMF will be led by someone outside the EU , possibly from an emerging economy .
David Cameron has said he would have no problem if a non - European headed the fund , though Merkel said she favoured a European ."
2011-05-16,"Would Greece have been granted a bailout on such soft terms if Dominique Strauss - Kahn had n't been at the International Monetary Fund ?
Would Ireland have been able to cling to its low rate of corporation tax in the face of hostility from France and Germany ?
It 's impossible to know , but a change at the top of the IMF – assuming that 's what now follows – will make such questions harder to answer .
Under Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's traditional "" tough love "" approach to over - indebted nations seemed to become only tough - ish when the future of the eurozone was at stake .
That stance can no longer be taken for granted , especially if the IMF is now forced to break with tradition by appointing a non - European as managing director .
Indeed , now that eurozone countries are the biggest recipients of IMF loans , such a break would seem to be the correct way to proceed – it would look cleaner , as Brazil and China might care to argue .
Sovereign debt markets were , nonetheless , broadly untroubled by the arrest of Strauss - Kahn .
That 's perhaps because the short - term implications may be roughly zero .
The IMF will not take a different line on Greece 's latest request for extra cash ; its script is already written .
Nor will Germany try to exploit the situation to press Greece to enforce deeper austerity measures .
But the long - term implications may be different if the IMF , minus Strauss - Kahn , is no longer so keen to be in the midst of the action in the eurozone .
In that case , the eurozone 's big players – Germany and France – may have to confront directly the question of what they are trying to achieve via the Greek bailout .
From the Greek point of view , the uncertainties have just become greater ."
2011-05-16,"EU ministers remain determined to contain the debt crisis after the arrest of IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn for alleged sexual assault , which has cast a cloud over a key gathering in Brussels on Monday .
Europe 's financial leaders will discuss how best to deal with Greece 's mounting debt crisis in a meeting in which Nemat Shafik , a deputy managing director who oversees IMF work in several EU countries , will represent Strauss - Kahn .
The talks will centre on whether Greece should be given more financial help , and what conditions should be applied to any new rescue package .
Some European leaders are unhappy at what they regard as a lacklustre effort by the Greek government to raise money by selling government property .
The Greek government said Strauss - Kahn 's arrest , on charges of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a maid in a New York hotel , would not affect efforts to resolve its financial woes . ""
The Greek government deals with institutions , not individuals , and continues unimpeded to implement the programme that will get it out of a crisis , "" a spokesman for the Greek government said .
Wolfgang Schaeuble , the German finance minister , struck a similar tone , insisting that the talks would go ahead as planned .
James Nixon , chief European economist at Société Générale in London , told Bloomberg TV that the IMF chief 's absence is "" not a fatal blow to the Greek situation "" , adding that "" any of these negotiations are larger than a single person "" .
The talks will start with ministers from the eurozone nations , followed by a full council meting of Ecofin ministers from across the EU .
This will include George Osborne , who joked on Monday morning that "" not everyone is going to be there "" in a reference to the Strauss - Kahn arrest .
Strauss - Kahn has played a key role since the financial crisis began , and other experts have taken a dimmer view of his absence from the talks . ""
The leadership vacuum at the IMF comes at a highly inopportune time for Europe , which is teetering on the brink of a full - blown debt crisis , "" said Eswar Prasad , a professor of international economics at Cornell University and a former IMF official .
The euro hit a seven - week low of $ 1.4049 against the dollar in early trading , before recovering some ground .
Julian Callow , chief European economist of Barclays Capital , predicted that ministers will reiterate their support for Greece , but doubted whether any new rescue deal would be agreed this week .
"" We 're getting a few signs that the global economy is starting to soften – with commodity prices under pressure .
If you were to announce a restructuring of Greece it would be very difficult for the financial markets .
""
The eurozone countries , led by Germany , are demanding bigger government spending cuts in exchange for granting extra aid to Greece or giving the country more time to pay back loans .
A € 78bn ( £ 68bn ) bailout for Portugal is also on the agenda for the meeting in Brussels , as is Ireland 's progress in dealing with its debt issues that required its own EU - IMF bailout .
Strauss - Kahn remains in New York , where he was arrested at JFK airport on Sunday .
He has agreed to undergo scientific and forensic tests , and his lawyers said he intends to "" vigorously "" defend himself against the charges .
He is expected to appear in a court in Manhattan at 11 am EST ( 4 pm BST ) .
His detention meant he missed a meeting with the German chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday night , that would also have focused on renewed help for Greece a year after the € 110bn bailout .
On Sunday night , the IMF convened an informal session and made Strauss - Kahn 's deputy , John Lipsky , acting managing director ."
2011-05-16,"Talk of a crisis at the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the wake of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's shocking arrest on rape charges is overdone .
Whatever fate and the US legal system has in store for Strauss - Kahn , the IMF rolls on .
It 's true that the IMF has a huge role in the European debt crisis talks and that the timing of DSK 's downfall could n't be much worse .
But managing directors come and go , while the IMF is a bureaucracy , run by technocrats , and its daily operations are overseen by a powerful , autonomous executive board , which is where its decisions are made .
In any case , DSK 's departure as managing director was already being anticipated , even if the circumstances were n't .
Strauss - Kahn has maintained his innocence .
But barring evidence that rapidly clears his name , "" his career at the IMF is over , which means that the race to succeed him is on , "" as Felix Salmon of Reuters puts it .
The hunt for DSK 's successor will see two opposing forces at work .
One force is that of the traditionally dominant Europeans , who want to retain their privilege of naming one of their own to the post and – frankly – need the IMF to fill Europe 's political vacuum in dealing with its financial crisis .
The other force is the muscle flexing coming from the developing world , which wants to end the Euro - American duopoly that has run the IMF and World Bank since inception , and argues that an outside candidate would allow developing world economies to more fully trust the IMF .
DSK 's disgrace would seem to enhance the prospects for a non - European candidate , if the developing countries can present a united front and – crucially – get US support for such a move .
If they ca n't and the Europeans persist , then the developing world 's candidates will once again have to wait .
Even so , the developing world and their NGO allies should be careful what they wish for .
As the Guardian 's Larry Elliott points out , the price the Europeans and Americans would most likely insist upon is "" a safe , orthodox choice if they are to end their gentleman 's agreement stretching back more than 75 years "" .
That means a non - European managing director could be even more hardline than the European alternatives .
Several of the best qualified outsider candidates being discussed are as economically dry as they come .
While there might be karmic satisfaction at seeing an Egyptian or Turkish managing director prescribing the IMF 's medicine to Europe 's wounded , it does n't make the dose any more pleasant for patients elsewhere in the world .
Germany has the biggest incentive to make sure the next IMF managing director is to its liking , because of the financial implications for the euro - zone from the rescues of Greece , Portugal and whoever else may need one .
Another round of funding for Greece would jeopardise Angela Merkel 's parliamentary majority .
So the answer to the question of who will be the next managing director of the IMF is : whoever Germany wants it to be .
Felix Salmon argues that France 's finance minister Christine Lagarde is the most likely replacement .
I thought so too – although DSK 's downfall reduces the appetite for another French candidate , even if Lagarde would be the first woman to head either the IMF or World Bank .
Elsewhere in Europe there are other qualified candidates , although not as many unalloyed contenders as one might think .
Marek Belka , the Polish central bank governor , is one possibility , with a varied career but lacking the political clout needed .
As a short - term fix , Luxembourg 's Jean - Claude Juncker would not be out of the question , as an experienced European power - broker .
But Lagarde remains the most obvious choice ."
2011-05-16,"The allegations against Dominique Strauss - Kahn have highlighted some of the worst facets of British journalism .
Some newspapers have simply ignored the story , presumably on the grounds that the International Monetary Fund is a faraway body of which we know little , while the former broadsheets have tended to revel in the mix of high finance and "" high jinks "" , even though the incident involves a charge of a serious sexual crime .
The background coverage of the role of the IMF is equally unedifying , with the televised detention of the IMF chief seemingly just an interruption to the process of agreeing another bailout for Greece .
The IMF was holding its latest biannual meeting with representatives of 187 countries , which registered further snail - like towards recognising the shifting economic balance of power in the world economy .
The fund had previously agreed to double its capital ( or quotas ) to $ 756bn , and a series of fast - growing countries led by China and India are increasing their quota to partially reflect their increased weight in the world economy .
This is at the expense of the much slower economies of the old G7 grouping , including the US , Japan , Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada , who see their quota and voting power reduced .
There has also been a gradual breakdown in the so - called Washington Consensus , which was supported by the IMF , the World Bank and the US treasury department .
This has been a crusading ideology , championing an end to capital controls and in favour of lower state spending , privatisations and reduced pay and living standards to bolster competition .
The repeated and disastrous failures of these policies in Africa , Asia and Latin America did little to dent the ideology until the costly default of Argentina in 2002 .
As the whole preceding period had been an exercise in implementing Washington Consensus economics , there was nobody else to blame when it failed so spectacularly and drove Argentina into bankruptcy .
This was echoed in the recent crisis in all the western economies .
Not only did the IMF fail to foresee the biggest economic crisis since the depression of the 1930s , but also its own shibboleths of deregulation , free movement of capital and reduced taxes and government spending contributed to it .
Temporarily , at least , most western governments abandoned these failed nostrums simply to avert economic catastrophe .
The IMF has shifted uncomfortably to adapt to the new situation , even boasting in one recent publication that "" we have worked closely with governments to protect and even extend social spending "" .
Elsewhere , authoritative IMF research has shown both how counterproductive government spending cuts will be and how increased government investment provides the answer to the economic crisis .
Now that the mood in the G7 has swung back in favour of lower state spending , privatisations and reduced pay this new thinking may not last .
In any event , IMF - style impositions have come to western Europe ( with the fund itself the junior partner to the EU ) with predictable results .
Growth forecasts are being slashed for Portugal , Greece and Ireland , and in Britain too – there being no need for the IMF when you have a Tory - led government .
But these are failed and backward - looking policies .
We have been living in exceptional times .
For most of recorded history , until the end of the 19th century , China and India were far bigger economies than any in western Europe or the US .
Their rapid growth over recent decades means the world economy is tilting back towards its usual axis .
The composition , voting rights and leadership of the IMF should reflect that .
Given the scintillating growth of the Chinese and Indian economies , we would all do well to learn from a new Indian or Chinese head of the IMF ."
2011-05-16,"European governments are wrestling with the prospect of a fresh bailout for Greece a year after they committed € 110bn ( £ 95bn ) to Athens , under pressure from Washington and Beijing to calm the markets and stabilise the euro .
The meeting of the 17 finance ministers of the eurozone was overshadowed by the absence of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund and French presidential hopeful , who is facing sexual assault charges in New York .
Strauss - Kahn has been a key player in the Greek drama and had been due to attend the dinner in Brussels .
The ministers – along with the 10 EU finance ministers from outside the single currency , including chancellor George Osborne – agreed on a € 78bn bailout for Portugal , the third rescue of a eurozone country in a year .
They also signed off on the permanent eurozone bailout fund , the European stability mechanism , which is to shore up the currency from 2013 .
They were expected to agree that Mario Draghi of Italy be appointed the next head of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt .
With governments reeling from French socialist Strauss - Kahn 's arrest on charges of attempted rape , the meeting in Brussels was also the first chance for ministers to discuss who would be the next head of the IMF in Washington ; the post is traditionally held by a European .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , was the first to say that Europe should retain its prerogative over the post , amid calls that it was time the IMF job went to someone from the emerging economies .
"" We know that in the mid - term , developing countries have a right to the post of IMF chief and the post of World Bank chief , "" she said .
"" I think that in the current situation , when we have a lot of discussions about the euro , that Europe has good candidates to offer . ""
During the past year , Strauss - Kahn has been a decisive advocate of the bailouts , influential in the Greek emergency through his close relationship with socialist prime minister George Papandreou .
Merkel surprised the rest of Europe last year by insisting the IMF play a central role in the bailouts , with the fund putting up a third of the € 750bn rescue pot .
While Greece was expected to plead for more help last night , no decisions were expected for several weeks .
The European commission said new "" arrangements "" were possible , with the options including a combination of cutting the interest rate on the bailout money , extending the repayment terms and topping up the loans by up to € 60bn .
But the emphasis in Brussels and EU capitals was on first urging greater austerity on Athens .
Papandreou has been told he will have to show convincingly that he is committed to selling off Greek public assets through a radical privatisation programme before the eurozone will return to his rescue . ""
We will discuss Greece but not conclusively , "" said Jean - Claude Juncker , Luxembourg 's prime minister and president of the eurozone grouping .
"" We will be informed by the IMF , the European Central Bank and the European commission and then we will see . ""
This troika has been in Greece for the past week assessing the government 's adherence to the savage programme of spending cuts and is said to be unhappy with what it has found .
The next tranche of the bailout , € 12bn , is due to be disbursed next month but there are threats it could be withheld .
The threats prompted Greek media reports at the weekend that pensions and teachers ' and civil servants ' wages could go unpaid next month if the money did not arrive .
But eurozone governments have repeatedly emphasised in the past fortnight that Greece will not be allowed to default on its mountain of debt , making it unlikely that the € 12bn will be retained .
Diplomats in Brussels and German officials made it clear the US and China were stepping up pressure on the EU to resolve the Greek dilemma , exasperated by the mixed signals from European capitals that have led to turmoil on markets and fresh questions about the euro 's viability .
An emergency , supposedly secret , meeting in Luxembourg 10 days ago of the French , German , Spanish and Italian finance ministers , which sparked a panic about a possible Greek default , was said to have been the direct result of transatlantic pressure .
At meetings of global finance officials in Washington last month , according to diplomats in Brussels , the Americans , Chinese and Canadians voiced their irritation with European indecision and demanded action to calm the markets .
"" The US , Canada , and Beijing told the EU :
You 've got to get this done to stop the speculation , "" a diplomat said ."
2011-05-16,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's possible exit from the IMF was already under discussion before his arrest because of his potential tilt at the French presidency .
In any case his IMF term was due to end in 2012 .
There are now numerous potential successors .
Gordon Brown bolstered his position with several speeches in the last six months on reform of the global economy .
Brown sat on the IMF policy committee for 10 years , understands its often contradictory aims and knows many of the people at the top of the organisation who can get things done .
David Cameron is hostile to the idea – but Brown is said to consider Cameron 's antipathy to his candidature as a bonus .
Christine Lagarde , the French finance minister , is credited with keeping France and its banks out of the headlines during the Greek crisis last year , though she would be the fifth French person in the role .
Last week French prosecutors demanded an inquiry into Lagarde 's role in awarding compensation to businessman Bernard Tapie .
Kemal Dervis Emerging market economies could vote as a bloc for an alternative candidate like Dervis , who as Turkey 's finance minister worked with the IMF to avoid sovereign bankruptcy in 2000 , and now directs the global economy programme at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Agustin Carstens , Mexico 's central bank governor would fit the bill as a representative of a growing and vibrant emerging economy .
But as a graduate of the University of Chicago , which spawned a legion of hardline monetarists , he would be considered a backward step by Strauss - Kahn supporters .
Stanley Fischer was described by world - renowned economist Nouriel Roubini as "" brilliant "" when his name entered the frame as a possible replacement .
He won a second five - year stint as governor of the Bank of Israel last year .
But like Carsterns , he is considered a hawk .
South African finance minister Trevor Manuel would be an outside choice .
At the moment he is involved in a racism row which would undermine his diplomatic credentials .
Shri S Sridhar runs the private - sector Central Bank of India .
The long - time banker is another orthodox candidate who is currently aggressively expanding his operations across Asia , but could drop everything to be IMF boss ."
2011-05-17,
2011-05-17,"As Dominique Strauss - Kahn sits in his prison cell this week a grand jury is deciding whether he will stand trial .
Under New York state law all felony cases must be presented to the grand jury , consisting of 23 local residents .
The jury meets in private to look at the evidence and decides whether or not a prosecution will proceed .
They can conduct independent investigations if they feel it is necessary .
The grand jury does n't have to decide if it believes someone is innocent or guilty .
But it has to agree that the evidence presented to them has enough merit for a trial to proceed .
If that is the case then it votes for an indictment – a written statement charging an individual with the commission of a felony .
The case is then adjourned as the two sides prepare for a public court battle .
Given that Strauss - Kahn 's alleged victim maintains she was attacked by the IMF boss , it seems unlikely that the grand jury will dismiss the case .
On Friday the grand jury will let its verdict in the Strauss - Kahn case be known ."
2011-05-17,"The events leading to the arrest of Dominique Strauss - Kahn in New York are not yet known in their entirety .
But , in France , the media reaction to the attempted rape charge confirms that when a rape or sexual assault is reported , the alleged perpetrator quickly morphs into victim – and vice versa .
The news of Strauss - Kahn 's arrest for allegedly assaulting a housekeeper at the hotel where he was staying immediately prompted astonishment : how could this successful politician take the risk of committing an offence that could lead , in the US , to 30 years behind bars ?
Conversely , was this in fact a political conspiracy , contrived by his powerful enemies ?
Friends and allies were certainly quick to rush to his defence : Bernard - Henri Lévy has vouched for his good character and Robert Badinter , husband of prominent feminist Élisabeth , insisted on French radio that he had been unfairly and deliberately "" destroyed before any trial "" .
Either way , the spotlight focuses on the potentially ruined politician , and not his alleged victim .
In France , the case has swept to the top of the news agenda .
But it has done so with an unequivocal message : poor DSK !
The photographs of a wealthy and powerful man slumped and unshaven in the dock have evoked pity and sympathy – Martine Aubry , first secretary of the French Socialist party , said she was "" stunned , shocked "" after seeing them , and pleaded for the media onslaught to stop .
And yet , nothing has been mentioned about the plight of his alleged victim , or about how hard it is to speak out about sexual violence .
DSK 's behaviour towards women is talked about as if it was n't harassment , but a game of seduction .
And if we finally start talking about his alleged victim , it 's to suggest she was a honeytrap .
Instead , the press chooses to highlight the words of his political allies , who describe him as a benign seducer – but "" one that does not force anything "" .
Commentators repeat that this is about his "" private life "" .
But with a non - consenting person , it is not an issue of privacy .
Still , this distinction seems beyond France 's leading journalists .
And then there 's the brand of humour that 's employed .
On Monday morning , the daily Metro carried the headline "" la débandade "" ( roughly meaning "" stampede "" , but also a play on the word "" bander "" , meaning "" to be sexually aroused "" ) .
On Twitter , the lawyer and influential blogger Maître Eolas had a similar bit of fun : "" DSK still favourite for the presidential erection "" .
Similar jokes are everywhere – that touch of Gallic humour that transforms claims of sexual violence into knowing jokes .
How this news has been treated by the French media says a lot about the country 's tolerance of sexual misconduct .
DSK 's reputation with women was an open secret .
The journalists knew , the politicians knew .
But , as Libération journalist Jean Quatremer writes , "" having written about it in July 2007 …
I incurred the wrath of some of my colleagues and part of the political class "" .
Indeed , following the appointment of DSK at the IMF , he wrote on his blog : "" The only real problem with Strauss - Kahn is his relationship to women .
Too forceful , he often borders on harassment .
It 's a flaw known about in the media , but nobody is talking about it openly ( we are in France ) .
"" The code of silence reigns .
Take the journalist and novelist Tristane Banon , who claims to have been sexually assaulted by DSK in 2002 , when she was in her early 20s .
Her mother , Anne Mansouret , a socialist candidate in the presidential primaries , told French TV on Monday that she had deterred her daughter from pursuing legal action because Strauss - Kahn was a family friend .
But she added that the alleged assault had driven her daughter into depression .
In this country , it seems that the shame of sexual assault is still squarely placed upon , and carried by , the victims .
It is akin to those families where incest is kept silent for fear of reprisal or to preserve the family , while the victim is scarred for life and asked to suffer in silence .
It is a means of preserving a social equilibrium dictated by the powerful .
In the case of Banon , the silence should have been broken by the media .
The young woman had spoken about her ordeal on a TV discussion show .
Around her the other guests laughed ; the host even punctuated her testimony with a sarcastic "" j'adore ! ""
– not easily translated in this context , but roughly meaning "" what cheek ! "" in a half - admiring , half - shocked tone .
Incidentally , a guest also asked how she was dressed , picking up on the theme of the victim who "" had it coming "" .
To date , we do not know what really happened .
But what we do know is that the way the French media talk about the alleged victims is crucial to cracking the code of silence surrounding sex crimes in France .
As it is , whether DSK is guilty or innocent , it looks unlikely that this case will do much to break that code .

2011-05-17,"Another day , another politician outed as an adulterer .
This time , the story will likely not fade from the headlines at the usual rate .
This time , the adulterer is Arnold Schwarzenegger , who doubles both as the former governor of California and a major movie star .
To make the situation still more lurid , he cheated with a servant , had a child with her , and covered it up – apparently , even from his wife – for a decade .
Oh , did I mention that he 's married to a member of the Kennedy clan , Maria Shriver ?
And that she 's a prominent feminist activist ?
And that she used her credibility as a liberal feminist Democrat to cover for him when he admitted to decades of sexual harassment during the 2003 campaign , when he was also exposed for participating in the 70s in what , by his description , sounds suspiciously like a gang rape ?
And that while his wife was out there working on behalf of women , Schwarzenegger was taking the time to rail against the evils of single motherhood ?
You know , just to make sure that no future would - be defenders of his bad behaviour could claim , "" At least he 's not a hypocrite .
"" If you presented it as a novel or a film script , you 'd get it bounced back with a note that said , "" Try to make it believable . ""
But despite the craziness of this particular situation , the basic story of the adulterous politician has become commonplace .
Is there any situation more confounding in politics than the exposure of adultery in the ranks of ambitious politicians ?
Once or twice , you expect a man ( and they are mostly men ) to screw up and get caught , but the endless parade of cheaters and cads defies common sense .
Why , your average voting citizen asks , would someone who has given his entire life over to striving for power risk everything for some fleeting sexual experience ?
Why , especially , do those men who fancy themselves not just political but moral leaders so readily make exceptions for their own peccadilloes ?
Most of us will never know , because most of us are n't wealthy members of an elite class who have been pampered into forgetting that you ca n't have whatever you want whenever you want it .
For most of us , cleaning our own houses , cooking our own food and having to fly coach provides a daily dose of humility – which can be a helpful thing to keep in mind when sexual temptations present themselves .
To make it even worse , even the more liberal - minded male politicians not only have this kind of class pampering , but they also tend to live in a world where women are easy to take for granted .
For many a male politician , women appear to exist for the purpose of making your life more pleasant and your ambitions easier to realise .
It 's not just that women are more likely to fetch your food , fluff your pillows and organise your life while you sit around talking politics and strategy in male - dominated groups of strategists and advisers .
It 's also that your wife has been demoted from a partner to your top cheerleader , expected to compromise her principles and ambitions so you can attain power .
Maria Shriver is a perfect example of the way that the role of the political wife demeans and objectifies women .
During the 2003 gubernatorial race in California , when Schwarzenegger was buried under a stream of allegations of sexual harassment , Shriver used her substantial reputation as a powerful , feminist woman as a shield against allegations levelled at her sleazy husband .
When a man like Schwarzenegger lives in a world where women are so subservient to him that they throw their reputations away for his political ambitions , it 's no surprise that he ca n't muster the basic respect for women required not to horndog the servants behind his wife 's back .
To be clear , there are two camps of egotistical politicians who cheat so stupidly , and the two should not be conflated : those who value consent and those who treat women like sex toys they can grab at , with little regard for what the women in question feel on the subject .
Men like Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich are cheating cads , but they , as far as we all know , draw the line at violence against women .
Unfortunately , when you build up a culture of overwhelming male entitlement such as politicians live in , you ca n't expect all of them to understand that , while cheating and lying is bad , harassing and assaulting is exponentially worse .
This is something to keep in mind when contemplating the Schwarzenegger situation , and his long and admitted history of harassing women that predates these revelations .
But it 's also something to keep in mind with regard to the charges of rape , sexual assault and unlawful imprisonment against the IMF head Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Whatever the outcome of his case , there is no excuse for those who fail to distinguish between actual assault and caddish but consensual behaviour .
Conflating the two only amplifies a culture of entitlement for those living the low - responsibility elite lifestyle , blurring the line between treating women poorly and treating women criminally ."
2011-05-17,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund , is in Rikers Island prison in New York after he was refused bail on charges of attempting to rape a hotel maid , as prosecutors said they were looking into reports he had engaged in a similar attack before .
Looking tired and gaunt in a badly - fitting black rain - coat , the unshaven 62-year - old was led into the New York criminal court hearing in handcuffs to face charges over a brutal sexual assault which have left the IMF in disarray and sent shockwaves through French politics , almost certainly ending the presidential hopes of the man tipped as the clear winner against Sarkozy in 2012 .
Strauss - Kahn 's defence lawyers denied the charges against him , but failed in a bid for $ 1 m bail . ""
This battle has just begun , "" his defence attorney , Benjamin Brafman , told dozens of reporters gathered outside the court . ""
Mr Strauss - Kahn is innocent of these charges . ""
After the hearing , Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance set out the case against Strauss - Kahn .
He is charged with seven crimes , including attempted rape , sexual abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment , against a 32-year - old hotel maid who had entered his suite at the Sofitel hotel near Times Square at around midday to clean .
Conviction carries a prison sentence of up to 74 years .
According to the criminal complaint , Strauss - Kahn shut the door of his hotel room , trapping his alleged victim inside , before grabbing her chest without her consent .
John McConnell , an assistant district attorney said : "" He sexually assaulted her and attempted to forcibly rape her , "" and when that failed , he forced her to perform oral sex .
He said the US authorities were now investigating whether Strauss - Kahn "" engaged in conduct similar to the conduct alleged in this complaint on at least one other occasion "" .
Asked to clarify by the judge , McConnell said the incident took place "" in Europe "" .
In France , writer and journalist Tristane Banon was preparing to file a legal complaint relating to an alleged sexual attack in Paris in 2002 .
Her lawyer , David Koubbi , said : "" We 're planning to make a complaint . ""
Strauss - Kahn did not enter a plea and was remanded to stay in prison until a hearing on Friday after prosecutors argued that the IMF head , who had been detained in the first - class cabin of an Air France jet about to take off for Paris hours after the alleged attack , was a flight risk "" like Roman Polanski "" .
District attorney Daniel Alonso compared Strauss - Kahn to the French - Polish film director who fled the US after having sex with an underage girl and has avoided extradition ever since .
Alonso said France had no extradition treaty with the US and Strauss - Kahn was a wealthy man who had been arrested attempting to flee the country .
Brafman , who previously successfully defended Michael Jackson against child molestation charges , said it was "" quite likely "" his client would be "" exonerated "" and disputed he was trying to flee .
Instead , Brafman said his client had a lunch meeting near the hotel and that his lunch partner would be able to testify .
He said hotel security found out he was at the airport only after they called him and he told them where he was .
He said Strauss - Kahn had been booked on to the Air France flight to Paris for some time .
The IMF is holding talks on how to react to the court hearing .
Strauss - Kahn 's wife , the millionaire former TV presenter Anne Sinclair , who has declared she believes he is innocent , was expected to fly to New York .
She had offered to pay bail .
In Paris , the ruling rightwing UMP said the allegations had seriously damaged France 's image abroad .
The environment minister , Nathalie Kosciusko - Morizet , said : "" In addition to the presumed victim – the chambermaid – there is another proved victim , that is France .
It must be reiterated that these charges are very serious , in France there is a tendency to treat this somewhat lightly . ""
She brushed aside the growing suggestions among some French politicians that this could be a plot or trap to bring down the 2012 presidential frontrunner .
She had "" confidence in the American justice system "" .
She added : "" It 's so French to see conspiracies everywhere , it 's something in our culture I think .
"" Images of Strauss - Kahn with his hands handcuffed behind his back and escorted by police shocked France , where famous figures are usually allowed to leave unseen by underground passageways .
The Socialist party leader , Martine Aubry , said the pictures , which dominated all news bulletins , were "" profoundly humiliating "" .
The Socialist MP and Strauss - Kahn supporter Manuel Valls said the images were "" of an unbearable cruelty "" and were so staggering that "" for French political life , there will be a before and an after "" this moment .
Giving more details of the allegations Strauss - Kahn is to face in France , David Koubbi , Banon 's lawyer , told French radio : "" There are a number of elements , facts , which prove what she is saying .
So , to the question that some people might legitimately ask – ' Is she making it up ? '
– the answer is no . ""
Banon had previously made the allegation on TV in 2007 and in an interview with a news website , but had not gone to police .
She said on TV she had gone to interview Strauss - Kahn , who had first insisted on holding her hand , then made sexual advances .
"" It ended really badly .
We ended up fighting , "" she said .
"" It finished really violently .
We fought on the floor .
It was n't a case of a couple of slaps .
I kicked him , he unhooked my bra , he tried to open my jeans . ""
She said he had acted like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" .
On radio , Strauss - Kahn 's political ally , Socialist Jean - Marie Le Guen , dismissed the Banon case as ill - founded .
Under French law , sexual assault charges must be filed within three years but attempted rape charges can be brought up to 10 years after the alleged attack .
Banon did not file charges at the time of the alleged assault after her mother , Anne Mansouret , a local Socialist party councillor and Strauss - Kahn 's friend , persuaded her against it .
She says she now regrets that decision ."
2011-05-17,"The Strauss - Kahn scandal is France 's Monica Lewinsky moment .
The charges are far worse than in Bill Clinton 's case , but France has been thrown into the same soul - searching about sex and power .
It is tearing itself apart about how to deal with the story .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn is innocent until proven guilty .
But the language of his leftwing allies and defenders – implicitly questioning the alleged victim 's honesty , stability and honey - trap potential – has sparked a debate on the sexism and snobbery of French politics .
The Paris elite has been forced to confront the issue of the sexual behaviour , and at worst the alleged sex crimes , of its whole ruling class .
As the Socialist party met for crisis talks , senior Strauss - Kahn allies came under fire from feminists for their comments so far .
Several Socialists had acknowledged outright that their mentor DSK was a "" seducer "" but went on to say that in no way had he "" the profile of a rapist "" , that the case could be a plot to bring him down , that the allegations were "" hallucinations "" , "" not credible "" or "" full of contradictions "" , and he was simply "" incapable "" of having carried out the attack .
Others targeted the US justice system .
Jack Lang , the Socialist former culture minister , said American justice was "" politicised "" ; New York judge Melissa Jackson was determined "" to make a Frenchman pay "" .
Strauss - Kahn was portrayed as a martyr for being made to appear on TV in handcuffs .
Robert Badinter , the former justice minister , called his public appearance escorted by police "" shameful "" and a "" tragedy "" .
Caroline De Haas , head of the group Osez Le Feminisme , was deeply concerned at the debate 's tone .
"" One comment was Strauss - Kahn did n't have the ' profile of a rapist ' .
There is no such thing , "" she said ; rape took place throughout society and every social class .
With only 10 % of France 's 75,000 rape victims each year going to the police , De Haas felt the outright dismissal of the attempted rape allegation sent a threatening message to victims in France .
François Bonnet , a founder of the influential Mediapart website , warned that by making a "" blind defence "" of DSK , his entourage was making a gross error which was damaging the entire Socialist party .
At the party headquarters , senior figures began attempting to temper comments .
Jean - Pierre Bel , head of the Socialist group in the Senate , warned against talking of Strauss - Kahn 's innocence as a certainty , saying "" one must wait "" for the facts .
Martine Aubry , the party leader , urged caution and awaited Strauss - Kahn 's version of events .
Women 's rights campaigners said the politicians had shown little thought for the alleged victim .
Damagingly for the Socialist party , this aspect is interpreted as a class issue : the mighty dismissing the claims of a lowly worker .
Clementine Autain , a feminist and a former Communist councillor in Paris , warned of the uncomfortable "" class dimension "" of politicians who wanted to "" render invisible "" the lowly chambermaid while "" protecting "" the head of the IMF .
Beatrice Vallaeys , a Libération journalist , said the class element of a leftwing figure allegedly attacking one of the most vulnerable in society made the case appear even more morally corrupt .
At stake was a wider question of the behaviour of men in power , and what the French political class could or could not get away with in its treatment of women .
Already the Roman Polanski case had left France squirming .
In 2009 Swiss police swooped on the director for fleeing the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with an underage girl .
The current French culture minister gave Polanski unfailing support , others in the arts defended him , and philosophers suggested in the media that the girl was precocious and asked for it .
Sociologist Eric Fassin warned of a kind of "" sexual exception "" made for artists who were excused their behaviour , saying France now faced the same question of a similar exception being made for politicians .
If Strauss - Kahn had taken off on the Air France flight to Paris which he had boarded when arrested , would France have extradited him back to the US to face the charges ?
Perhaps not , some political commentators whisper ."
2011-05-17,"Pressure is building for Dominique Strauss - Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund following his arrest on charges of attempted rape .
Strauss - Kahn , who is being held at Rikers Island penal complex in New York , was denied bail on Monday at a court appearance where prosecutors successfully argued he was a flight risk .
The IMF head was arrested on Sunday and charged with the attempted rape of a 32-year old chambermaid .
While he has denied all charges , some of those he was due to meet are now calling for him to consider his position .
The Austrian finance minister , Maria Fekter , said he was hurting the IMF , while her Spainish counterpart , Elana Salgado , said her sympathies were with the alleged victim . ""
Considering the situation , that bail was denied , he has to figure out for himself , that he is hurting the institution , "" Fekter told journalists as she arrived at a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels .
Salgado said the offences he was accused of were "" extraordinarily serious "" .
She said he needed to decide for himself if he should step down .
"" If I had to show my solidarity and support for someone it would be toward the woman who has been assaulted , if that is really the case that she has been , "" she said .
Other European officials were more supportive .
"" I 'm very sad and upset .
And he 's a good friend of mine , "" the Luxembourg prime minister , Jean - Claude Juncker , said on Monday .
"" I did n't like the pictures I 've seen on television , "" he added , referring to footage that showed Strauss - Kahn in handcuffs being escorted by police outside a New York police station .
Strauss - Kahn was arrested on a flight back to Europe where he had been due to host a series of high - level meetings about Europe 's debt crisis .
The case has rocked the financial world as the IMF grapples with the European debt crisis .
The institution has led the bailouts of Greece , Portugal and Ireland and Strauss - Kahn has been one of the bailout packages ' greatest supporters .
After his arrest the IMF 's second - in - command , John Lipsky , was named acting managing director .
Prof Tom Cooley , former dean of Stern school of business at New York University , said : "" It is a blow to the IMF at a time when they have begun to define a new and important role for the institution in the modern global economy . ""
But Cooley added that the IMF was "" an organisation of consummate professionals with deep professional leadership - so I am sure they will carry on just fine "" .
The IMF 's board met on Monday to discuss the crisis but made no announcement .
Among those being mentioned as possible successors to Strauss - Kahn are Gordon Brown , French finance minister Christine Lagarde , Kemal Dervis , a former finance minister for Turkey who is now at the US public policy thinktank the Brookings Institution , and Mohammad El - Erian , an Egyptian award - winning author who heads the Pimco bond fund .
El - Erian is a former IMF staffer .
Strauss - Kahn is due back in court on Friday and is expected to plead not guilty .
After his hearing on Monday , Benjamin Brafman , the IMF 's boss 's lawyer , said : "" This battle has just begun .
Mr Strauss - Kahn is innocent of these charges . """
2011-05-17,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's new home on Rikers Island could not be further away from the world of jet - setting luxury he is used to .
After he was denied bail on Monday , the IMF chief was transferred to a three- metre by four - metre cell in the New York prison complex 's west facility , the penal colony 's smallest , which usually houses prisoners with communicable diseases .
It is also used for those who might be at risk from fellow prisoners , should one decide to make a name for himself by attacking a celebrity .
Rikers is harsh , loud and dangerous , according to those who know the island jail well .
"" It 's crowded and the food is terrible , "" Gerald Lefcourt , a well - known defence lawyer , told Reuters .
"" One of the dangerous things is famous people are preyed upon .
There are really heavy - duty prison bars and gates that make a lot of clanging sounds every time they are open and closed . ""
The prison 's location on the East river between Queens and the Bronx would give the IMF chief a good view of the planes taking off at JFK and LaGuardia airports – if only he had a window .
The island holds a series of facilities and has an average daily prison population of 14,000 , overseen by 7,000 prison officers .
The Francis Buono bridge links the island to Queens and is the only way on and off Rikers .
Strauss - Kahn is one of 25 - 30 inmates in the west facility , but will be kept from other inmates when he leaves his cell to stretch his legs , watch TV or exercise .
"" This is not about isolating the inmate from any human contact , this is about preventing the inmate from being victimised or harmed in some way as a result of his high profile , "" said the spokesman .
Lights go out at 11 pm .
He is allowed three visitors a week aside from his lawyer and he will be given one hour a day for exercise .
Strauss - Kahn was issued bedding and a standard toiletry kit of a drinking cup , soap , shampoo and toothpaste , the spokesman said .
The prison has a notorious reputation for violence .
A 2009 New York Times investigation alleged a culture of inmates "" self - policing "" , with Rikers guards looking the other way as prisoners attacked and even killed other inmates .
The city has been successfully sued by inmates who claimed to have been the victims of beatings by other prisoners while guards looked the other way , or worse , ordered the attacks .
Three former Rikers guards and three inmates are facing charges that they ran a "" fight club "" in the prison , in which teenage prisoners beat fellow inmates .
One of their alleged victims , Christopher Robinson , 18 , died after a beating in the jail .
His family is suing for $ 20 m .
Strauss - Kahn is far from being the prison 's most infamous inmate .
Mark Chapman , John Lennon 's murderer was held there after he killed the musician . ""
Son of Sam "" killer David Berkowitz was another inmate .
Rikers has also been familiar to rap stars .
Tupac Shakur served time there as did Lil Wayne and Foxy Brown , who was sent there by judge Melissa Jackson – the same judge who denied Strauss - Kahn bail ."
2011-05-17,"Pressure is building on Dominique Strauss - Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund , with the US treasury chief and European finance ministers questioning if he can carry on in the light of his arrest .
In a speech in New York on Tuesday , Tim Geithner , the US treasury secretary , said Strauss - Khan was "" obviously not in a position to run the IMF "" .
He said : "" I think it 's important that the board of the IMF formally put in place for an interim period somebody to act as managing director . ""
Geithner 's comments came after Austria 's finance minister , Maria Fekter , and others , said Strauss - Kahn was damaging the IMF : "" Considering the situation , that bail was denied , he has to figure out for himself , that he is hurting the institution , "" she told journalists at a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels .
Strauss - Kahn is being held in isolation at the notorious Rikers Island in New York , having been refused bail after denying charges of a sexual assault on a 32-year - old chambermaid .
His lawyers are expected to reapply for bail on Friday ; one New York tabloid reported they might be preparing to argue sexual contact was consensual .
A grand jury is meeting in private to decide whether evidence is strong enough for a case to proceed over the alleged attack in a luxury Manhattan hotel suite .
Jurors will announce their decision on Friday .
Fekter 's Spanish counterpart , Elena Salgado , also put pressure on the IMF boss .
She said the alleged crimes were "" extraordinarily serious "" and Strauss - Kahn needed to decide for himself if he should step down .
"" If I had to show my solidarity and support for someone , it would be toward the woman who has been assaulted , if that is really the case that she has been , "" she said .
IMF officials are also reportedly keen for Strauss - Khan to step down .
Officials at the institution said they could not comment and said they had not spoken to Strauss - Kahn since his arrest .
Other European officials were more supportive .
"" I 'm very sad and upset .
And he 's a good friend of mine , "" the Luxembourg prime minister , Jean - Claude Juncker , said .
"" I did n't like the pictures I 've seen on television , "" he added of footage showing Strauss - Kahn in handcuffs escorted by police .
Strauss - Kahn , who had been tipped to win the French presidency as the Socialist candidate next year , is accused of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a maid at the Sofitel hotel last Saturday .
He was detained by police hours later as he sat in the first class cabin of an Air France flight about to take off for Paris .
He had been due to host meetings about Europe 's debt crisis .
The New York Post reported that his lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , might be preparing to argue sexual contact was consensual .
It quoted a source close to the defence : "" There may well have been consent . ""
Brafman told the court on Monday that forensic evidence taken by police from his client over the weekend "" will not be consistent with a forcible encounter "" .
The brother of the alleged victim , who has not been named , told the Daily Mail his sister called him an hour after the incident and said : "" Somebody has done something really bad to me . ""
She was crying uncontrollably , he said , claiming she told him Strauss - Kahn twice tried to force himself on her .
Lawyer Jeffrey Shapiro , representing the maid , said she was from Guinea in west Africa and has a 15-year - old daughter ; he said she had no agenda , had no idea who Strauss - Kahn was , felt "" alone in the world "" and was now in hiding .
The allegations have shocked France .
In a CSA poll , 57 % of voters and 70 % of Socialists said they thought Strauss - Kahn was the victim of a plot .
The philosopher Bernard - Henri Levy said Strauss - Kahn had been his friend for 20 years and would remain so : "" Charming , seductive , yes , certainly ; a friend to women and , first of all , to his own woman , naturally ; but this brutal and violent individual , this wild animal , this primate ?
Obviously no , it 's absurd . ""
Le Monde reported that Strauss - Kahn 's wife , Anne Sinclair , had got a call from her husband as he was travelling to the airport .
He mentioned a "" serious problem "" but made no allusion to a hotel attack .
Strauss - Kahn 's former wife , Brigitte Guillemette , defended him in an interview with Le Parisien .
He is believed to have to met their daughter Camille after the alleged attack .
Guillemette said it was "" unthinkable "" he could do what he was accused of and then lunch with his daughter minutes later . ""
He 's someone who is gentle .
Violence is not part of his temperament , "" she said .
French writer Tristane Banon is considering filing a police complaint for attempted rape against Strauss - Kahn over an alleged attack in 2002 .
New York mayor Mike Bloomberg defended the police decision to parade the handcuffed IMF boss before the media in a so - called "" perp walk "" , a move that has caused outrage in France , where former French culture minister Jack Lang described it as a "" lynching "" .
Bloomberg told reporters : "" I think it is humiliating , but if you do n't want to do the perp walk , do n't do the crime .
I do n't have a lot of sympathy for that .
Our judicial system works where the public can see the alleged perpetrators .
"" The case has rocked the financial world as the IMF grapples with the European debt crisis ; it led the bailouts of Greece , Portugal and Ireland , and Strauss - Kahn has been one of the bailout packages ' greatest supporters .
After his arrest , the IMF 's second - in - command , John Lipsky , was named acting managing director .
Among those being mentioned as possible successors are Gordon Brown , French finance minister Christine Lagarde , Kemal Dervis , a Turkish former finance minister now at the US Brookings Institution , and Mohammad El - Erian , an Egyptian award - winning author who heads the Pimco bond fund .
China 's top official at the IMF , Zhu Min , is also a potential deputy managing director .
France 's Socialist party met for emergency talks about its forthcoming primary race for a candidate to run against Nicolas Sarkozy next year , with Strauss - Kahn out of the picture .
"" There was emotion , of course , and the shock we all feel , but it is our responsibility to be up to the task , "" said party leader Martine Aubry .

This misspelling has been corrected ."
2011-05-18,"The French philosopher
Bernard - Henri Lévy has added his voice to the debate over Dominique Strauss - Kahn by writing a piece in defence of the head of the International Monetary Fund .
Published on the Daily Beast news website , Lévy stresses that the accusations of attempted rape levelled against Strauss - Kahn have not yet been proven .
He writes : "" I do not know what actually happened … in the room of the now famous Hotel Sofitel in New York
…
I do not know –
no one knows , because there have been no leaks regarding the declarations of the man in question – if Dominique Strauss - Kahn was guilty of the acts he is accused of committing there , or if , at the time , as was stated , he was having lunch with his daughter . ""
Lévy goes on to question how a chambermaid could have gone alone , "" contrary to the habitual practice of most of New York 's grand hotels of sending a ' cleaning brigade ' of two people , into the room of one of the most closely watched figures on the planet "" .
He also casts doubt on the account of Tristane Banon , the French writer who claims Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her nine years ago .
The philosopher says he holds it against those who "" complacently "" accept the account of "" this other young woman , this one French "" , who "" pretends to have been the victim of the same kind of attempted rape , who has shut up for eight years but , sensing the golden opportunity , whips out her old dossier and comes to flog it on television "" .
[ See footnote ]
Banon described the attack in a television programme in 2007 , but Strauss - Kahn 's name was beeped out when the programme was broadcast .
On Monday Banon 's mother , Anne Mansouret , a Socialist councillor and friend of the Strauss - Kahn family , said she had persuaded her daughter not to press charges at the time of the alleged assault , a decision she says she now regrets .
Lévy writes : "" What I do know is that nothing in the world can justify a man being thus thrown to the dogs . ""
He continues : "" Nothing … permits the entire world to revel in the spectacle , this morning , of this handcuffed figure , his features blurred by 30 hours of detention and questioning , but still proud . ""
He rails against the American judge who , "" by delivering [ Strauss - Kahn ] to the crowd of photo hounds , pretended to take him for a subject of justice like any other . ""
Lévy says in the article that the man he calls a friend of 20 years , "" bears no resemblance to this monster , this caveman , this insatiable and malevolent beast now being described nearly everywhere .
Charming , seductive , yes , certainly ; a friend to women and , first of all , to his own woman , naturally , but this brutal and violent individual , this wild animal , this primate , obviously no , it 's absurd .
"" At the beginning of last week Ségolène Royal denied rumours that Lévy was trying to negotiate a rapprochement between herself and her then fellow would - be Socialist candidate for France 's presidential election in 2012 , Dominique Strauss - Kahn .

2011-05-18,"Lawyers for the International Monetary Fund are pushing for Dominique Strauss - Kahn to clarify his position as he sits in jail facing charges of sexual assault with the IMF 's board split on what to do next .
IMF officials have yet to speak to their managing director since his arrest on Sunday for an alleged attack on a chambermaid at a New York hotel , and pressure is mounting on the institution , which plays a critical role in global finance , to appoint a new head .
The US treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , and European finance ministers have made it clear they believe he should resign .
Strauss - Kahn , who was denied bail and is considered a flight risk , is being held in Rikers Island prison in New York .
According to city officials , the only people with access to the IMF boss are his family and his lawyers .
Sources close to the IMF say its board is split on how to proceed .
Strauss - Kahn 's deputy , John Lipsky , has stepped in on an interim basis , but both men had been planning to retire shortly even before the scandal broke .
The race to succeed Strauss - Kahn has now intensified with candidates from the developing world pushing for senior jobs that have traditionally been dominated by Europeans .
Some IMF members believe Strauss - Kahn should resign as soon as possible , arguing the scandal is damaging the institution .
But there are others who argue their boss has yet to give his side of the story and that the IMF should not bow to pressure until more details emerge .
IMF officials did not return calls for comment .
But the pressure is building on the IMF to do something .
At a speech in New York , Geithner made clear the US believed the institution needed to act . ""
[ Strauss - Kahn ] is obviously not in a position to run the IMF
and it is important that the board of the IMF formally put in place for an interim period someone to act as managing director , "" Geithner said .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers will be in court again on Friday , when a grand jury is expected to announce the decision to put their client on trial , and are expected to press once more for bail .
Professor John Coffee of Columbia Law School said Strauss - Kahn could be out of jail by the weekend if his lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , could come up with a plan that appeases the judge .
New York chief assistant district attorney Daniel Alonso successfully argued Strauss - Kahn was a flight risk and compared him to film director Roman Polanski , who fled the US after being accused of having sex with an under - age girl .
Coffee said Brafman was one of the most experienced lawyers working in the US and would more than likely find a solution that would get his client out on bail . ""
Even Bernie Madoff got bail , "" said Coffee . ""
And he was a flight risk . ""
Coffee said that , like Madoff , Strauss - Kahn might have to employ an expensive 24-hour surveillance team to monitor his movements while he is placed under effective house arrest in an apartment or hotel ."
2011-05-18,"Turkish politician and economist Kemal Derviş is the early frontrunner to replace Dominique Strauss - Kahn at the International Monetary Fund .
William Hill is offering odds of 5/2 on Derviş , the former Turkish finance minister , becoming the IMF 's next managing director .
He is followed by Montek Singh Ahluwalia , deputy chairman of India 's Planning Commission , at 5/1 .
Germany 's Axel Weber is third favourite at 7/1 .
Singapore 's Tharman Shanmugaratnam – who was promoted to deputy prime minister earlier on Wednesday – and
former UK prime minister Gordon Brown are both available at 8/1 .
Derviş had already been identified as a strong candidate to replace Strauss - Kahn , 62 , who is currently in Rikers Island prison , New York , facing charges of sexual assault on a 32-year - old chambermaid .
A former head of the United Nations Development Programme , Derviş leads the global economy programme at the Brookings Institution in Washington and is known to have strong connections with the IMF .
For Derviş , Ahluwalia or Shanmugaratnam to be appointed , though , Europe 's political elite would have to yield its traditional grip on the IMF .
Each of its 10 managing directors has been European – and four hailed from France – thanks to a cosy transatlantic arrangement that means an American has usually run the World Bank .
But the events in New York in recent days may end this status quo .
Weber , the former head of the Bundesbank , is understood to be the favoured choice of German chancellor Angela Merkel .
Under the weighted voting system used by the IMF , a candidate backed by European members and the US would be almost certain of success .
The pressure on Strauss - Kahn has intensified since US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner said the Frenchman he was unable to run the IMF from Rikers Island .
He is due to appear in court on Friday , and denies committing a sexual assault at his Manhattan hotel last weekend .
His five - year term at the IMF ends next year , but he had been expected to step down early to run for the French presidency .
William Hill 's odds in full ( accurate on Wednesday afternoon ) :
5/2 : Kemal Derviş 5/1 :
Montek Singh Ahluwalia 7/1 :
Axel Weber 8/1 :
Tharman Shanmugaratnam 8/1 : Gordon Brown 10/1 :
John Lipsky 10/1 : Mark Carney 12/1 : Philipp Hildebrand 12/1 : Peer Steinbruck 14/1 : Christine Lagarde 16/1 : Stanley Fischer 16/1 : Changyong Rhee 16/1 : Hyun Song Shin 20/1 : Trevor Manuel 20/1 : Mohamed El - Erian 25/1 : Agustin Carstens"

2011-05-18,"Since Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's arrest on allegations of sexual assault , the French media have been under pressure .
They are accused , chiefly by the US press , of cowardly observing a "" code of silence "" over politicians ' private lives ; of either burying or failing to properly investigate the Socialist presidential frontrunner 's long - rumoured predatory nature toward women .
The debate has consumed the French commentariat , with many political editors insisting that they allude as much as possible to Strauss - Kahn 's reputation as a seducer , within the bounds of France 's strong libel and privacy laws and cultural view of sex being a politician 's private business .
One political editor suggested it was French politicians who should be taken to task .
Many had long - whispered that sexual behaviour might bring Strauss - Kahn down during the presidential campaign – if they had evidence that his behaviour was potentially criminal , they should have spoken out , the editor said .
Nicholas Demorand , editor of the daily Liberation , said his paper would continue to respect politicians ' privacy .
"" It 's a democratic principle – hypocritical in some people 's eyes , but fundamental ...
Ditching this principle would lead to encouraging short - term buzz and trash over quality news . ""
Others warned that close links between journalists and politicians led to self - censorship , with the fear of being denied crucial access preventing reporters from exposing inappropriate behaviour .
The chasm between the US and French media was clear in a row over images of Strauss - Kahn since his arrest .
The IMF head was filmed unshaven and in handcuffs being escorted by New York police before his court appearance .
These images were broadcast all over the world – except in France , where one of Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers threatened legal action against channels broadcasting them .
The CSA , the government 's media watchdog , warned to use "" the greatest restraint "" in broadcasting them because the French law on presumption of innocence does not allow suspects to be shown in handcuffs .
French state TV has since made limited use of the scenes of Strauss - Kahn in court and is now avoiding the handcuffed shots .
Other French channels said it would be absurd not to use them when they were broadcast online and across the world .
New York 's mayor , Michael Bloomberg , agreed the display of Strauss - Kahn being led by police was humiliating and would be unfair if a defendant was proved to be innocent . ""
But if you do n't want to do the ' perp walk ' , do n't do the crime , "" he added .
US media have criticised the French for showing more compassion for Strauss - Kahn than for the alleged rape victim , whose identity some French newspapers have published .
The feminist French lawyer Gisèle Halimi , praised the US justice system , which she said protected women 's dignity .
"" I am convinced that if this affair had taken place in France , we would never have heard anything about it , "" she told Le Parisien ."
2011-05-18,"As Dominique Strauss - Kahn continues to contemplate the vagaries of fate from his prison cell on Rikers Island , legal experts have begun to amass on either side of what promises to be a long and potentially ugly court battle .
Teams of lawyers for the prosecution and defence are starting to muster their arguments , dispatching investigators around the globe .
The cases they compile over the next few days and weeks are likely to set the tone for any future trial .
The prosecution side is led by the Manhattan district attorney 's office and its special victims bureau , one of the oldest units in the US to deal with rape and other sex crimes .
Closely advised by the New York police , it put together the charges against Strauss - Kahn , which include two counts of committing a criminal sexual act , attempted rape , sexual abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment .
The charge sheet accuses the IMF chief of having locked a maid in his room at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan on Saturday , after which he grabbed her chest without consent , attempted to strip her and make further sexual contact with her .
According to the police account , the woman entered the room around midday thinking it was empty .
Strauss - Kahn allegedly emerged from the bathroom naked .
He is then said to have locked the door to the suite , pulled her into the bedroom and sexually assault her .
She fought him .
He then allegedly dragged her into the marble bathroom and , using physical force , sexually assaulted her again .
The prosecution team will be focusing in the first instance on any physical evidence that corroborates the use of sexual force .
Robert Mintz , a former federal prosecutor based in New York , said they would be looking for signs of a struggle .
"" That could include any bruises or scratches on the victim suggesting forcible contact , or forensic evidence in the room such as tables or lamps that have been knocked over , "" he said .
Then prosecutors will try to put together further supporting evidence relating to the behaviour of the alleged victim and perpetrator .
Crucial to that will be any CCTV footage from the hotel 's corridors .
France Inter radio yesterday claimed that there was video footage showing the hotel worker leaving room 2806 in a panic .
The radio station said video also showed Strauss - Kahn leaving the room , also in a panic .
Any further evidence that he left the room in a hurry , for example the suggestion that he later called the hotel reporting he had left a phone behind , may become important to the prosecution case .
Investigators will also want to know whether he booked his flight back to France – he was arrested on an Air France aircraft at JFK just before take off – at the last minute , which would suggest a possible attempt to flee .
In many rape and sexual assault cases , there is insufficient forensic evidence to prove force and the trial comes down to the credibility of the only two witnesses – in this case Strauss - Kahn and his accuser .
Speaking to his credibility , New York prosecutors told a court on Monday they were looking into reports that he had "" engaged in similar conduct "" to the alleged hotel attack "" on at least one other occasion "" .
This was believed to relate to allegations by a French journalist , Tristane Banon , who claimed on TV that Strauss - Kahn attacked her during an interview in 2002 .
She said he had acted like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" .
As for the woman , they may call on her brother who has told newspapers that she called him after the alleged incident to say "" somebody did something really bad to me "" .
For his defence , Strauss - Kahn has turned to Benjamin Brafman , a New York lawyer renowned for his skills in front of a jury , and with no shortage of experience in handling tricky , high - profile cases .
Brafman successfully defended the rapper Sean "" P Diddy "" Combs on gun - possession charges in 1999 and was involved in the early stages of Michael Jackson 's child molestation case .
Unusually , Brafman has already given an indication of how he plans to direct the Strauss - Kahn defence , saying in court that "" the evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible encounter "" .
That points to a defence of consent , which in turn presages a so - called "" word versus word "" trial in which a jury is asked to consider the credibility of the two main parties ' testimony .
As such , the defence may seek to discredit the main prosecution witness , the maid .
Michael Discioarro , a Manhattan criminal defence lawyer , pointed out that New York law forbids any reference in court to the alleged victim 's past sexual history unless it can be shown to be relevant to the case , for instance if she had falsely accused somebody of a sex crime in the past . ""
But they will be looking for ways of casting doubt on the maid 's credibility in other ways , "" Discioarro said .
Investigators are likely to be sent to her home country of Guinea in west Africa to search for any signs ofpast criminal activity , failure to pay taxes or other skeletons in her cupboard .
The defence team is expected to focus on the police 's initial discrepancy over timings .
Police spokesman Paul Browne said the alleged attack happened at about 1 pm , then corrected this to around midday .
Any significant discrepancies in the timeline of the alleged crime could be exploited using technology .
CCTV footage , the data recorded on electronic room keys used to open the hotel door , and timings stamped on the receipt at the restaurant
Strauss - Kahn went on to could all prove invaluable .
After the alleged attack , he is reported to have immediately left the hotel to have lunch with his daughter at a restaurant near the hotel .
Camille , 26 , a PhD student at Columbia University , is the only child from his second marriage to the consultant Brigitte Guillemette – who has said it is unimaginable that he could have committed such crimes , then gone for lunch with his daughter minutes later .
Brafman will also hope to undermine any suggestion that his client tried to flee the scene by showing that he booked the flight to Paris in advance ."
2011-05-19,"France is gripped by the biggest political sex scandal the country has ever seen .
TV news bulletins and rolling news channels have hit record audience figures , newpaper websites have seen traffic soar .
Sociologists described a nation in shock , hooked on the "" brute emotion "" of a scenario in which one of the most powerful men in the world might have fallen so low .
Psychoanalysts rushed to dissect the subconscious forces that might have driven Dominique Strauss - Kahn to allegedly commit an appalling act of violence in sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a hotel maid .
If he is found guilty , some suggested an unconscious drive to self - sabotage by a man who could n't bear the power that had been foisted on him – his wife and all around him so wanted to see him become French president next year that he might have been unable to cope .
Serge Hefez , the French psychiatrist , compared the Strauss - Kahn saga to the head - butt of the football hero Zinedine Zidane , which ended France 's World Cup dream of 2006 .
If true , it was about the unbearable pressure of rising to the top , he suggested .
All agreed that the image in France of DSK as a serial - seducer whose friends claimed he "" loved women "" was totally different from someone committing violent sex attacks , which could be psychologically linked to having low self - esteem , hating yourself and hating others .
France is not only psychoanalysing Strauss - Kahn ; the nation has put itself on the couch .
Sociologists also began to unpick why France is so enthralled by conspiracy theories that Strauss - Kahn might have been ensnared by a plot .
A poll on Monday , the day after DSK 's arrest , found 57 % of French people , and 70 % of Socialist sympathisers , thought he was the victim of a plot .
Several leading names on the French left , as well as some of the right , suggested DSK could have fallen for some kind of manipulation or trap , leading Le Monde to run a front - page editorial warning that the conspiracy theories were a dangerous regression and threat to democracy .
The environmental MEP Daniel Cohn - Bendit called for "" an end to the rumours about plots "" .
The sociologist Denis Muzet suggested in Le Monde that the French public had fallen for conspiracy theories because people were so shocked by the accusations against such a popular politician that they had gone into denial .
Stéphane Rozès , the political analyst , said French public opinion was oscillating between two theories : that Strauss - Kahn was either victim of a plot or he had some kind of sickness .
Strauss - Kahn 's attitude to women continued to be dissected by journalists .
The French news weekly Le Point claimed that shortly before he was detained by police who boarded an Air France plane at JFK airport , he had said to a flight attendant : "" Nice arse . """

2011-05-19,"The former IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn has been bailed by a New York court as he faces trial for allegedly sexually assaulting a maid in a Manhattan hotel .
Judge Michael Obus set bail terms of $ 1 m in cash as well as $ 5 m in an insurance bond set against the international politician 's properties in the US .
He also demanded that Strauss - Kahn surrender all his travel documents and that he remain under house arrest in Manhattan under 24-hour armed guard .
The ruling , issued at a Manhattan criminal court , will release the former IMF chief from his humiliating custody on Rikers Island , where he was held since being arrested on Saturday accused of having attacked a hotel maid .
Strauss - Kahn attended the hearing wearing a grey suit and light grey shirt .
The judge said he had based his decision on the sole concern of the court : that Strauss - Kahn return to court to face justice .
It was revealed during the proceedings that the grand jury of 23 members that has been sitting this week to consider the case against Strauss - Kahn has voted for an indictment to proceed against him .
The precise terms of the indictment , including three counts of violent crimes , are likely to remain undisclosed until he is formally arraigned within the next 10 days , but it removes a major hurdle to the economist facing trial .
According to the charge sheet compiled by police , Strauss - Kahn is accused of sexually assaulting the hotel maid who came into his room at the Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan last Saturday lunchtime .
The woman entered the room thinking it was empty .
Strauss - Kahn is alleged to have come out of the bathroom naked and locked the door to the room before sexually assaulting her twice , once in the main room and once in the bathroom .
Representing the defendant , William Taylor argued to the court that Strauss - Kahn was an "" honourable man "" who had only one desire at this time , "" to clear his name "" .
He presented the judge with the details of a New York security company , Stroz Friedberg , that would be responsible for ensuring that the former IMF chief would not flee the country .
Stringent conditions would include an electronic bracelet that would send a signal to the company and a police station the moment Strauss - Kahn left the property , video cameras to monitor him inside the property , and a 24-hour rotation of armed guards who would be physically present at the apartment .
Taylor said that Strauss - Kahn 's wife , Anne Sinclair , had bought a property in Manhattan under her name , and that it had been scoped out and approved by the security company as a suitable location for him to remain under house arrest .
"" There is nothing more restrictive that can be accomplished along these lines , "" Taylor said , adding that a large cash sum , believed to be $ 1 m , had also been proposed as surety .
But he complained that the prosecutors ' response had been "" no , no , no , not that there has been any question of credibility of these conditions .
That position is unfair . ""
Taylor pointed to Sinclair and Strauss - Kahn 's daughter Camille , both of whom were sitting in court holding each other 's hand .
The lawyer referred to the two women as the defendant 's "" beautiful family "" . ""
The idea that he would attempt to live the rest of his life as an accused sex offender in France as a fugitive is ludicrous , "" Taylor said .
Taylor sought to rebut the suggestion that Strauss - Kahn had shown a suspiciously hasty departure from his hotel room in Manhattan last Saturday before his arrest at JFK airport by producing Air France paperwork that showed his flight to Paris had been booked in advance .
He said the defendant had surrendered both his passports and that his UN passport would be handed over by the weekend .
Of the charges that he faces , he said : "" We expect that Mr Strauss - Kahn will be vindicated .
But that 's for another day .
""
The Manhattan district attorney , who is leading the prosecution of the former IMF boss , told the judge that he was facing serious charges with strong evidence amassing against him . ""
While the investigation is still in the early stages , the proof against him is substantial and continuing to grow every day , "" said John McConnell , speaking for the prosecution .
He said that the maid , a widow from Guinea in west Africa aged 32 who has been named by some French papers , had told a consistent story to investigators and had immediately sounded the alarm to hotel staff and police .
Forensic tests taken from the alleged victim have yet to be completed , but "" evidence supporting the victim 's account has already been found "" .
According to McConnell , Strauss - Kahn presented a "" substantial flight risk .
He is an international figure who truly has global influence and that gives him potential access to enormous economic resources . ""
Under questioning by the judge , it was revealed that the defendant has a US bank account with a "" low seven - figure sum "" in it .
Given his resources and influence , the prosecution said that no bail could be set high enough to ensure that the defendant would return to face trial . ""
His own conduct in this case has shown a propensity to compulsive criminal conduct , "" McConnell said ."
2011-05-19,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn has resigned as managing director of the International Monetary Fund , saying he wanted to devote "" all his energy "" to battle the sexual assault charges he faces in New York .
The IMF 's executive board released a letter from Strauss - Kahn dated 18 May , in which the former managing director denied the allegations against him and went on to say that it was with "" infinite sadness "" that he presented the board with his resignation .
"" I think at this time first of my wife – whom I love more than anything – of my children , of my family , of my friends .
I think also of my colleagues at the fund ; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more . ""
To all , I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me .
"" I want to protect this institution which I have served with honour and devotion , and especially – especially – I want to devote all my strength , all my time , and all my energy to proving my innocence . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's resignation comes after increasing international pressure for him to step down as he faces charges of assaulting an employee at a New York hotel .
The maid , a 32-year - old immigrant from the west African country of Guinea , told police that Strauss - Kahn , 62 , came out of the bathroom naked , chased her down , forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear before she broke free and fled the room .
Strauss - Kahn , who has held in New York 's Rikers Island prison since Monday , is to make a second application for bail on Thursday with his lawyers set to offer new bail terms including $ 1 m ( £ 619,000 ) in cash and placing their client under house arrest .
A judge rejected his initial plea for bail agreeing with prosecutors that he was a flight risk .
A grand jury has been convened to assess whether Strauss - Kahn will be indicted .
Their decision will not be known until Friday .
The decision to press for bail ahead of the decision suggests lawyers are urgently trying to free him .
If he is released on bail , the deadline to secure an indictment would be extended .
Selection process begins The IMF 's statement late on Wednesday said the process of choosing a new leader would begin , but in the meantime John Lipsky would remain acting managing director .
Several potential candidates to replace Strauss - Kahn have already been suggested , although none has yet indicated that they are interested .
These include French finance minister Christine Lagarde , former Bundesbank president Axel Weber , and Kemal Dervis , Turkey 's former minister of economic affairs .
The IMF will hold a vote among its member countries to choose the next managing director .
The US has the largest share of voting power , with 16.7 % of the total votes , followed by Japan with 6 % , Germany with 5.7 % and the UK and France with 4.85 % each .
To win , a candidate must attract 85 % of the votes .
Critics say it allows Washington and the leading European nations to control the process , so that that IMF is always run by a European in return for an US citizen at the head of the World Bank .
This status quo could be now be challenged , though .
On Tuesday China , which holds just 3.65 % of the voting power , said the selection of the next IMF leader should be based on "" fairness , transparency and merit "" .
Brazil 's finance minister , Guido Mantega , reiterated this point on Wednesday , arguing was important the selection process was based on merit , rather than on nationality .
Brazil , which is an important , fast - growing emerging economy , has just 1.38 % of the voting power - less than Belgium or the Netherlands .
European leaders have reportedly been lobbying to maintain their grip on the IMF .
German chancellor Angela Merkel indicated on Monday that she favoured another European at the helm of the IMF ."
2011-05-19,"The public uproar engulfing France over Dominique Strauss - Kahn makes an illuminating contrast to the furore in Britain over Ken Clarke 's latest bout of controversy , yesterday 's row over sentencing policy for convicted rapists .
Strauss - Kahn finally resigned as the head of the IMF overnight after a string of fresh allegations about his sexual behaviour ( "" he behaved like a gorilla "" ) emerged , none related to the allegations that he assaulted a chambermaid in the Sofitel Hotel , in mid - Manhattan , last weekend .
But official France , the "" republican elite "" , has seen the affair in a very different light .
The American justice system and social morals have been attacked .
French media have been threatened with legal action for publishing photos of DSK in handcuffs ( so unfair to the accused ! ) and at least one of his ex - wives insists he has "" many faults but [ violence ] is not one of them "" .
Ok , if you say so .
A worldly , Francophone friend says the explanation may be that DSK asked the Sofitel to provide him with sexual services –
this was rich Manhattan , after all – and he mistook his alleged victim for the woman he thought he 'd paid to see .
Apparently he was a past user of one escort agency .
Seedy , yes , but it would at least explain his ( alleged ) bizarre behaviour ?
Either way , it all sounds a bit weird to me .
A French poll says 57 % of people think DSK has been set up .
But laissez faire ( is that the right phrase ? )
French attitudes towards the boundaries of private / public behaviour have long struck me as a bit weird .
The fact is that insiders knew their prospective president , a brilliant public figure whose loss may harm us all , had a problem in his attitude towards women .
Yet Jean Quatremer , the journalist who blogged about it in 2007 ( as DSK headed towards the IMF ) was abused as a "" Torquemada of sexual politics "" for mildly observing that DSK 's behaviour ( "" too heavy - handed , he often verges on harassment "" ) might land him in trouble in the US , where women do not put up with the "" you 'll have to sleep with me if you want an interview "" attributed to DSK at home .
Jump on the Eurostar and in an hour
or so you can find people , not so different from their French friends and neighbours in countless ways , taking a very shirty view of Clarke 's round of combative interviews on his sentencing policy proposals yesterday .
You can find a verbatim account of his session with Victoria Derbyshire on Radio 5 Live here as part of the Mail 's wall - to - wall hostile coverage .
David Cameron 's exchanges with Ed Miliband at PMQs ( I was out of town and missed it ) are here .
If you want to read the Sun hyper - hypocritical "" Well done
, Ed Miliband "" editorial ,
you 'll have to find it yourself .
The accusation that Clarke has "" betrayed every woman in Britain "" is nauseating coming from the bum and tit brigade .
But it 's where we are this morning , and the Guardian 's own editorial has it right .
The "" Clarke Must Go "" lobby is an unholy alliance between the Labour party ( in France , the lefties are on DSK 's side ) and the Tory tabloids , which have been gunning for the justice secretary as a cabinet liberal with as much zeal as they have been stalking Vince Cable , Chris Huhne and David Laws .
We 're not doing that one today , merely noting in passing the power of selective indignation – or the lack of it on the other side of the Channel .
But does the current potency of gender politics also create an atmosphere where selectivity thrives , whether it 's sexual crime , women 's share of university places or the dole queue ?
I think it may , and that we should be mindful of it .
Comment is Free is running a poll that will test the waters of public opinion inside and outside what we must now think of the Yes
to AV bastion of central London .
But Clarke 's real offence , to many , is his disputing the proposition that "" rape is always rape "" .
Circumstances matter , he insisted as he attributed much of the furore to "" newspaper nonsense "" ( he probably meant yesterday 's Mail , which got the sentencing row going ) and said the tabloids love of "" a bit of sexual excitement in the headlines "" .
Hard to dispute that , I 'd say .
But no one ever argues that murder is n't always murder or assault is n't serious , our own Jane Martinson counter - argues today .
But they do differentiate , they do .
A man who knocks down another man in a brawl and sees the man fall on a pavement stone and smash his skull is sometimes charged with murder but convicted of manslaughter , sometimes even acquitted .
Well within recent memory , women who killed brutal , abusive husbands – especially with premeditation ( you may need to plan to overcome a stronger person ) – could be convicted of murder .
In 1955 , Ruth Ellis was hanged for shooting a real bastard , something which , even then , many people could see was wrong .
It never happened again , it would not happen now – and quite right , too .
So there are distinctions to be made about all types of crime – the motive , nature , context and consequences to name but a few .
Clumsy and 70 yearsold he may be , but has Clarke ever been accused of sexism by women colleagues , let alone of DSK - ism ?
I think not .
Acknowledging distinctions was all Clarke struck me as trying to do in the context – let 's remember – of sentencing policy : do we really think it 's good to pack our fetid prisons as much as we do , at great cost and doubtful benefit ?
I realise that rape must be an unusually traumatic experience for most victims , uniquely horrible in its own way , as a few other categories of crime are too .
Millions of women have suffered it in war .
Not all such lives are shattered .
But it 's also a very difficult case to prosecute in our kind of society for reasons I 'm not going to address today .
Not the right moment to further inflame heightened feelings , and we all know the arguments .
We 'll leave that one to Fay Weldon or Germaine Greer .
Doubtless they are typing away , fearlessly and furiously , as we speak ."
2011-05-19,"Why is the head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , now on suicide watch in Rikers Island prison , New York ?
Why is a reportedly traumatised hotel chamber - maid awaiting the huge pressure of a high - profile attempted rape trial ?
It did not take long for members of the British press to provide an answer .
It was down to the reluctance of the French media to report on the sexual lives of politicians .
The culture of openness about sexual matters , in both Britain and the US , the argument goes , firmly encourages powerful men better to police their own demanding proclivities , thus protecting both them and their would - be victims .
Strauss - Kahn is of course presumed innocent of the charges made against him until a decision is made by a jury .
But it quickly emerged that his aggressive and risky sexual behaviour , according to allegations , had been notorious in Paris for some time .
Notorious in Paris !
That takes some doing .
In light of the current controversy over privacy superinjunctions , with certain sections of the press arguing that it is in the public interest for newspapers to expose "" sexual wrong - doing "" because it provides a moral compass for the powerful and also sets a good example to the population over whom they wield power , it was an irresistible point to make .
But it was made , perhaps , a little too quickly .
Commentators were still in full flow , somehow forgetting John Prescott 's "" old - fashioned "" attitudes to women , or Alan Clark 's mother - and - daughter simultaneous affairs , or John Major 's fumbles with Edwina Currie , or Bill Clinton , when the news broke that the former governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , had fathered a secret child with the family housekeeper , while his wife , Maria Shriver , was pregnant with their son .
An affair is not a crime , of course .
But the fact is that a number of women had made public claims of offensive treatment at the hands of Schwarzenegger , prior to his election .
The former movie star merely had to agree that there had been some inappropriate behaviour , but that it was very much in the past , for the allegations to stop being a problem .
Threat of public exposure did not stop the former film star .
Actual public exposure , indeed , did not stop him .
The efficacy of the Anglo - Saxon newsprint stocks as a moderator of sexual mores seems far from proven , as a brief look at the statistics on anything from sexually transmitted disease rates to the high incidence of sexual crime in Britain and the US would confirm .
Because , of course , there is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that the lurid reporting of sexual incontinence does very much at all to influence the behaviour of either the celebrity or the "" civilian "" ( as Liz Hurley puts it ) .
In recent decades the press has worked tirelessly to publicise unusual , unsavoury or "" immoral "" sexual matters .
The very lowest point came in 2009 , when a 13-year - old was plastered all over the papers as "" Britain 's youngest father "" .
The baby , it turned out , was not his , but this minor fact emerged after several other boys had claimed in the media to have had sex with the 15-year - old mother at the centre of the story .
It was eventually established that the father was a 14-year - old , also named in the press .
I find it utterly repulsive that newspaper executives can lay claim to providing a moral guidance service when they are capable of intruding so thoroughly , so avidly and so inaccurately into the private lives of children .
Paradoxically , I 'd say it was far more likely that a constant diet of sexual scandal in "" family newspapers "" has nurtured the very culture of irresponsible sexuality that these publications claim to stand against .
I note particularly that the rate of teenage pregnancy in Britain is the highest in western Europe .
Figures for pregnancy among under-18s in decadent , look - away , anything - goes France are a quarter of Britain 's .
Perhaps the general French assumption that sex is private among consenting adults , rather than a fascinating talking point to be screamed out from the shelves of every local newsagents , has its positive side .
These points may seem to drift far away from the alleged events in the New York Sofitel last Saturday afternoon .
But inevitably this case is being used as a vehicle for the delivery of a number of arguments , cultural difference among the media of various nations being only one of them .
But the US , Britain and France are agreed on one thing at least : attempted rape is a very serious crime .
Again , a common generalisation is that powerful men are commonly a sexual menace , assuming that they can help themselves to women , when they ca n't .
Can I suggest that although this sort of view is considered , rightly , to be militantly feminist , the truth is that it characterises women as blank and passive , every bit as much as the pre - feminism credo that insisted that women did not really like sex at all .
It must surely be acknowledged that even women , we paragons of virtue , are capable of finding power , esteem and wealth to be sexually attractive , and that these predatory men are not operating entirely in a strange vacuum , unrelated to reality ?
Their assumptions of female sexual availability are based on experience , not delusion .
I am not excusing such attitudes here , far from it , but simply asking whether attempts to draw such unrealistically stereotyped sketches of monseigneurial assumption and underling reluctance , might cast more heat than light on the highly important issue of sexual relations between men and women ?
Whatever the outcome of Strauss - Kahn 's trial , allegations about his antics over many years will offer a global lesson in how not to treat women .
First and foremost , it ought to be understood quite simply that women are not all the same .
It is important to remember that men , even powerful men , are not all the same either , and no more helped by crude stereotyping than women are ."
2011-05-19,"The International Monetary Fund is facing growing pressure from emerging economic powers and campaigners to appoint a non - European as Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's successor , following the resignation of the imprisoned IMF managing director .
China and Brazil have demanded that the succession process be handled in a fair and open way , and are calling for an end to the status quo under which a European has led the IMF since its creation in 1945 .
The IMF has yet to reveal how Strauss - Kahn 's replacement will be chosen but in a letter to the G20 group of the world 's largest economies Brazil 's finance minister , Guido Mantega , said : "" If the Fund wants to maintain its legitimacy , its managing director must be selected after broad consultation with the member countries . ""
A global group of anti - poverty campaigners said that the troubled state of the global economy made it imperative to select the best possible candidate from a worldwide pool .
"" It is time for the European and US governments to finally end the sordid , tacit deal between the two regions that has maintained a de facto northern leadership at both the Fund and the World Bank , "" said Bhumika Muchhala of the Third World Network .
Germany 's Angela Merkel has made it clear that she wants the job to go to a European .
European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said he also thought the role , which has become crucial since the eurozone sovereign debt crisis exploded , should go to a European .
He told CNN : "" Yes , I think it should be a European ... they are the biggest stakeholders in the IMF and there are a lot of Europeans that can do that job .
So why now choose someone because he 's not European ?
That makes no sense .
"" There are equally trenchant opinions among IMF insiders .
One former senior official said : "" The big danger here is if the Europeans just try to put their person in .
For example , Christine Lagarde [ France 's finance minister ] .
That would be a disaster .
The Europeans have their heads in the sand again and if they do it , there will be bad fallout . ""
"" Christine Lagarde stands for protecting big banks .
I know people like what she said to Jamie Dimon [ chief executive of JP Morgan Chase ] at Davos
but she 's the most pro - bank bailout of the lot .
"" The Americans are going to try and put in [ White House adviser ] David Lipton as number two .
Lipton is Mr Bank Bailout .
He worked for Citigroup .
If they put in Lagarde and Lipton , what does that say ?
We are going with the total bank protection plan .
That would be a disaster . ""
Voting power Under the voting system used by the IMF , America and Europe have been able to ensure that a European candidate runs the IMF while an American citizen takes charge at the World Bank .
The eurozone debt crisis , which has seen the IMF contribute to the bailouts of Greece , Portugal and Ireland , has led many emerging market countries to believe that the next head of the IMF should not come from the EU .
The US holds nearly 17 % of the voting power at the IMF , giving it enough muscle to block a non - favoured candidate .
China , despite being the world 's second largest economy , holds only 3.65 % of the votes .
Beijing , like Brasilia , appears keen for someone from an emerging economy to run the IMF this time .
Jiang Yu , a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign minister , said on Thursday that the IMF 's top executives should be appointed on the basis of "" impartiality "" and "" merit "" .
This came after the state - run China Daily newspaper reported Guo Tianyong , a leading Chinese economist , predicting that "" Europe 's history of chairing the IMF may be broken "" .
The decision will eventually be made after an election involving each of the 187 member countries .
Any country can nominate a candidate , and a winner must secure 85 % of the votes .
However , this voting power is concentrated among just a few countries , with America holding an effective veto .
Each country has been assigned a "" quota "" of voting shares , which is related to its GDP , the nature of its economy and the size of its international reserves .
These quotas were fixed when the IMF was created in 1945 , and reflect the balance of economic and political power at that time , giving America and Europe the power to swing the decision .
In practice , a series of behind the scenes negotiations has ended with a European being appointed to take the rein .
Two years ago the IMF agreed to make the voting system more equitable , and it has plans to dilute Europe 's influence and bolster "" dynamic "" emerging nations including China and Brazil .
Neither plan , though , has yet been implemented .
The IMF 's role When the IMF is not stepping in as the lender of last resort for desperate countries facing a cash crunch , its job is to oversee the workings of the global economy .
Each member country gets an annual school report from the IMF , known as an "" Article IV "" , that scores its performance on a range of policies , from keeping its public finances under control to tackling unemployment .
In practice , governments can often have the harshest criticisms of their performance watered down , but a negative verdict can still be embarrassing .
Since the financial crisis , the IMF is also meant to be taking on a stronger role in global "" surveillance "" – trying to foresee the next trouble spots in the global economy , and persuade countries to take action to resolve imbalances , such as gaping trade surpluses or undervalued currencies , before world financial markets descend into chaos .
However , it is still unclear how exactly the IMF will carry out this new role , and whether the offending countries will take any notice of it whatsoever .
The IMF also hosts two meetings a year – a spring meeting in April and an annual meeting in the autumn – which act as a forum for the world 's finance ministers to get together and discuss the challenges of globalisation ."
2011-05-19,"With the resignation of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the eurozone this week lost one of its most ardent advocates .
This time last year , he was instrumental in persuading a reluctant Angela Merkel to back an unprecedented € 110bn ( £ 95bn ) bailout of Greece with significant assistance by the IMF , both technical and financial .
Unless a European is appointed , the next managing director is likely to scale back the IMF 's political and practical support for the eurozone 's rescue mission .
Coupled with a return to market fundamentalism , the fund 's retreat from Europe 's mess would spark contagion from the eurozone 's banking and sovereign debt crisis to the global financial system .
One person who wo n't succeed Strauss - Kahn is Mario Draghi , the governor of the Bank of Italy .
The eurozone 's finance ministers are expected to nominate him today as the next president of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) when the incumbent Jean - Claude Trichet retires in October .
The timing of Draghi 's nomination for the ECB 's top job could hardly be better .
It will help calm down global financial markets and stabilise the euro amid economic uncertainty and a lack of political leadership in Europe .
Yesterday EU finance ministers signed off a € 78bn bailout for Portugal and a permanent euro rescue mechanism from 2013 , but neither addresses the growing divergence between the eurozone 's core and periphery countries .
As governments dither over greater fiscal co - ordination and common eurobonds , the ECB 's key monetary policy decisions such as interest rates will be key in ensuring the euro 's survival .
Draghi 's appointment goes against two recent European trends .
First of all , a drawn - out process of horse trading that ends in choosing second – or even third - rate – candidates such as Catherine Ashton , the EU 's hapless high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who has failed to raise the union 's global profile .
Similarly , the various successors to Jacques Delors as European commission president have not distinguished themselves , except by their mediocrity and subservience to the narrow interests of national leaders .
By contrast , Draghi is highly qualified and widely respected .
Educated at the prestigious US university MIT , he has taught at Harvard and is one of Europe 's best economic minds .
Despite being a former Goldman Sachs banker , he has impressed as chair of the G20 's financial stability board that drafted the Basel III agreement – the new regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions .
Together with the Italian finance minister , Giulio Tremonti , he is also credited with steering Italy 's debt - ridden economy through the crisis without requiring financial assistance .
By nominating Draghi , EU leaders have also broken with a second trend – to give in to populist pressure and make decisions according to national calculations .
That tactic backfired twice when Merkel delayed decisive action on the eurozone 's sovereign debt crisis .
Her party was nevertheless defeated in two key regional polls .
This time she has not caved in to pressure from a hostile public and press .
Bild , Germany 's equivalent of the Sun , recently ran a headline saying that "" inflation and Italians "" go together "" like tomato sauce and spaghetti "" .
In an interview last week with Die Zeit – a respected weekly more comparable to the Observer – Merkel said of Draghi that "" He is very much in line with our ideas about stability and economic solidity . ""
This raises questions about the ECB 's independence and mandate .
Unlike Jens Weidman – the president of Germany 's Bundesbank , who served as economic adviser to Merkel – Draghi will be his own man .
As such , he will protect the ECB 's main mandate of securing price stability .
If energy and commodity prices continue to soar , then the core countries of the eurozone wo n't countenance a rising inflation rate for very long .
But contrary to the all the arch - monetarists who see the spectre of inflation everywhere , Draghi must be pragmatic and continue to fight the forces of stagnation or even economic slump .
After all , the mandate of price stability gives the ECB licence to prevent deflation , as falling real prices raise the value of debt and threaten depression – exactly the predicament of Greece , Ireland and Portugal that have received bailouts .
Beyond price stability , Draghi must quietly help create the conditions for stronger economic growth .
That is the only sensible way out of the sovereign debt crisis and the social recession that is upon the eurozone 's periphery ."
2011-05-19,"The fall of Dominique Strauss - Kahn has triggered a defining test of European influence .
Yet Britain is no mere spectator in this process .
We have major interests at stake in the choice of Strauss - Kahn 's successor .
This country , and the Cameron government , face big decisions about whether and how to fight for those interests , or perhaps risk seeing them vanquished in their present form for all time .
For more than 65 years the International Monetary Fund has been headed by a European , with an American deputy , while the US provides the head of the World Bank .
In practice , the IMF job has most frequently gone to a French candidate such as Strauss - Kahn , or the frontrunner to succeed him , Christine Lagarde – for 35 of the last 48 years , in fact .
But that postwar apportionment has come under assault from the rising economic powers of Asia and Latin America .
Europe remains a huge economic player – too many here underestimate this .
But there 's a growing sense that , politically , we are now punching too far above our weight .
The issue has been extensively wrestled at successive economic summits , notably at the G20 in Pittsburgh two years ago and again in Seoul last November , which both made important changes to IMF governance .
The role of the Obama administration , less Eurocentric than its predecessors , has been pivotal .
The choice of next IMF managing director would inevitably have arisen soon anyway , possibly in only a few months if Strauss - Kahn had returned to run for the French presidency next spring .
But the chair is suddenly vacant .
Now it 's decision time .
What to do ?
The argument for fairness and progress is powerful and in many ways compelling .
The US - Europe duopoly reflects a world that is passing .
China , India , Brazil and the rest are creating an ever larger share of the world 's wealth .
That growing share should be , and is gradually being , recognised in the makeup of the instruments of global financial governance .
The idea that Europe , ailing and failing in so many ways , can automatically command the seat at the wheel of the IMF after Strauss - Kahn 's departure is increasingly hard to sustain , not least in Obama 's and the Tea Party 's Washington .
What is more , there are talented alternatives aplenty .
They range from Turkey 's Kemal Dervis , who has important admirers in the UK government , to South Africa 's Trevor Manuel , Mexico 's Agustin Carstens and Singapore 's Tharman Shanmugaratnam ( endorsed by the former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson and Labour 's former City minister Paul Myners on the World At One ) .
Come in Europe , your time is up , is now a widespread view .
Yet in some ways it is also the argument made from the comfortable armchair of the beau monde onlooker , not from the sweaty and practical engine room of the engaged political participant .
Europe pays more into the fund than anyone else , so why should it not use its role as principal shareholder ?
High - minded self - denial and historically aware European internationalism would be a lot easier to envisage if it was reciprocated , notably in the US , which in significant ways is also on the down escalator of global economic influence .
If Washington wants to back an emerging - world IMF head , then it would make sense for the US to give up its traditional grip on the deputy 's job .
But there is not much sign of that .
In the real world of sovereign debt crises , bailouts and deficit - cutting inhabited by Angela Merkel and the rest of Europe 's leaders , a European IMF head is not just convenient but essential , as Strauss - Kahn has undoubtedly been during the continuing European crisis .
And serious politicians do n't give away power without a bankable quid pro quo .
That 's why Merkel was so quick to demand an early European successor .
The IMF has been good for the eurozone in the last two years .
The member states have a raw collective self - interest in that continuing to be the case .
David Cameron , George Osborne and the Bank of England governor , Mervyn King , do not have to be quite so desperate as Merkel .
Yet even from their position a European successor makes a lot of sense .
Partly this is because Britain can have some influence over which candidate goes forward .
More importantly , it is because the scale and effectiveness of the IMF 's engagement with Europe under Strauss - Kahn has helped to shield the larger European nations , Britain included , from having to spend money they can ill - afford , or try to restructure the EU in ways that would antagonise their voters .
Strauss - Kahn was much admired in Whitehall .
He fought to protect a progressive agenda amid inescapably hard times .
He had economic credibility , and was what one minister admiringly calls an absolutely A - grade political operator .
He got things done .
He is the proverbial hard act to follow .
If Gordon Brown were not Gordon Brown he might be , as he would like to be , the man for this hour .
But Brown is unappointable .
He has done nothing to cultivate the leaders whose goodwill and trust he would need .
He is instinctively uncollegiate in a job that requires immense persuasive skills .
And he ca n't be trusted not to use the IMF as a bully pulpit against Cameron and Osborne .
A more intriguing UK outsider , in every sense – and absolutely guaranteed to have Brown chewing the carpet – is Peter Mandelson .
China has asked if the former business secretary and EU trade commissioner would take the job .
Mandelson is definitely interested .
The coalition might be open to it too .
Germany and France are another matter .
Mandelson nevertheless ticks a lot of boxes .
Ultimately what matters is that the IMF stands behind the economic life of its member states .
The nationality of the boss is less important than the fund 's strategy and credibility .
We ought to know more , therefore , about what candidates for these big international jobs actually stand for , and what our governments are looking for when they vote .
Given Europe 's contributions and the priority of its problems , there remains a good case for a managing director who understands Europe .
But Europe ought to have learned by now that doing the right job is more important than making the appointment .
In the end , international institutions need leaders who can speak to and deliver for the nations .
Strauss - Kahn did that .
His successor must do so too .
And that means a more transparent appointment system than the usual secret carve - up ."
2011-05-19,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn will make a fresh bid for freedom on Thursday with his lawyers set to offer new bail terms including $ 1 m in cash and to place their client under house arrest .
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is currently being held in New York 's Rikers Island prison after being charged with the attempted rape of a hotel employee .
A judge rejected his initial plea for bail agreeing with prosecutors that he was a flight risk .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers filed new papers late on Wednesday asking a judge to release him on bail .
According to the papers , the IMF boss is willing to be confined to a location in Manhattan , wear an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements and post $ 1 m bail in cash .
A grand jury has been convened to assess whether Strauss - Khan will be indictedwith their decision expected on Friday .
The decision to press for bail ahead of Friday 's decision suggests lawyers are urgently trying to free Strauss - Kahn from Rikers , where he has been held since Monday .
If he is released on bail , the deadline to secure an indictment would be extended .
The IMF is coming under increasing pressure to appoint a new head as Strauss - Kahn fights the charges .
The US treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , and senior European finance ministers have all suggested he should resign .
The scandal comes as the IMF struggles to deal with Europe 's debt crisis .
One senior former IMF executive , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : "" He has to go .
If he is willing to resign , that 's more dignified , and I would have no problem with that .
But they have to separate him from the IMF . ""
He said vital work was being left undone at the IMF because the institution was too distracted by the scandal .
"" They wo n't tell you what is going with the Egypt programme , they wo n't say what 's going on with the Portugal meeting on Friday .
This is not a joke .
This is an organisation that matters to the world economy . ""
France 's former finance minister , Christine Lagarde , is emerging as a potential successor to Strauss - Khan , whose job is held by his deputy .
John Lipsky .
The Swedish finance minister , Anders Borg , told Sky News that , should the position of IMF managing director become vacant , Lagarde was one of the "" obvious candidates "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's bail could bear some similarity to the arrangement that saw Ponzi scheme fraudster Bernard Madoff confined to house arrest while awaiting his trial .
Madoff had to employ a private security team to constantly monitor his movements and apartment .
However , Madoff pleaded guilty , which made the prosecution more disposed to agree to his bail conditions .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers have so far denied any wrongdoing .
He is expected to argue that any sexual contact was consensual .
The argument has been rejected by Jeffrey Shapiro , a lawyer representing the alleged victim .
"" There was nothing about any aspect of this encounter between this young woman and the defendant which was remotely consensual or could be construed as consensual , either physical contact or sexual contact , "" Shapiro said in an interview with CBS ."
2011-05-19,"Now that Dominique Strauss - Kahn has resigned from his position as managing director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , it is worth taking an objective look at his legacy there .
Until his arrest last week on charges of attempted rape and sexual assault , he was widely praised as having changed the IMF , increased its influence and moved it away from the policies that – according to the fund 's critics – had caused so many problems for developing countries in the past .
How much of this is true ?
Strauss - Kahn took the helm of the IMF in November of 2007 , when the IMF 's influence was at a low point .
Total outstanding loans at that time were just $ 10bn , down from $ 91bn just four years earlier .
By the time he left this week , that number had bounced back to $ 84bn , with agreed - upon loans three times larger .
The IMF 's total capital had quadrupled , from about $ 250bn to an unprecedented $ 1tn .
Clearly , the IMF had resources that it had never had before , mostly as a result of the financial crisis and world recession of 2008 - 2009 .
However , the details of these changes are important .
First , the collapse of the IMF 's influence in the decade prior to 2007 was one of the most important changes in the international financial system since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in 1971 .
Prior to the 2000s , the IMF headed up a powerful creditors ' cartel that was able to tell many developing country governments what their most important economic policies would be , under the threat of being denied credit not only from the fund but also from other , then larger lenders such as the World Bank , regional lenders and sometimes even the private sector .
This made the fund not only the most important avenue of influence of the US government in low- and middle - income countries – from Rwanda to Russia – but also the most important promoter of neoliberal economic "" reforms "" that transformed the world economy from the mid 1970s onward .
These reforms coincided with a sharp slowdown of economic growth in the vast majority of low- and middle - income countries for more than 20 years , with consequently reduced progress on social indicators such as life expectancy and infant and child mortality .
The IMF 's big comeback during the world recession did not bring the middle - income countries that had run away from it back to its orbit .
Most of the middle - income countries of Asia , Russia , as well as Latin America , stayed away , mostly by piling up sufficient reserves so that they did not have to borrow from the fund , even during the crisis .
As a result , even a low - income country like Bolivia , for example , was able to renationalise its hydrocarbon industry , increase social spending and public investment , and lower its retirement age from 65 to 58 – things it could never do while it was living under IMF agreements continuously for 20 years prior .
Most of the IMF 's new influence and lending would land in Europe , which accounts for about 57 % of its current outstanding loans .
As for changes in IMF policy , these have been relatively small .
A review of 41 IMF agreements made during the world financial crisis and recession found that 31 of them contained "" pro - cyclical "" policies : that is , fiscal or monetary policies that would be expected to further slow the economy .
And in Europe , where the IMF has most of its lending , the policies attached to the loan agreements for Greece , Ireland and Portugal are decidedly pro - cyclical – making it extremely difficult for these economies to get out of recession .
The IMF 's influence on Spain , which does not yet have a loan agreement , is similar .
And in Latvia , the IMF presided over an Argentine - style recession that set a world historical record for the worst two - year loss of output ( about 25 % ) – a complete disaster .
To be fair , some changes at the fund during the tenure of Strauss - Kahn were significant .
For the first time ever , during the world recession of 2009 , the IMF made available some $ 283bn - worth of reserves for all member countries , with no policy conditions attached .
The fund also made some limited credit available without conditions , though only to a few countries .
The biggest changes were in the research department , where there was tolerance for more open debate .
For example , there were IMF papers that endorsed the use of capital controls by developing countries under some circumstances , and questioning whether central banks were unnecessarily slowing growth with inflation targets that may be too low .
But as can be seen from what is happening in the peripheral Eurozone countries , the IMF is still playing its traditional role of applying the medieval economic medicine of "" bleeding the patient "" .
To be fair to both Strauss - Kahn and the fund , neither the managing director nor anyone else at the IMF is ultimately in sole charge of policy , especially with respect to countries that are important to the people who really run the institution .
The IMF is run by its governors and executive directors , of whom the overwhelmingly dominant authorities are the US treasury department , which includes heavy representation from Goldman Sachs , and , secondarily , the European powers .
Until decision - making at the IMF undergoes a dramatic change , we can expect only very small changes in IMF policy .
This can be seen most clearly in the current case of Greece : Strauss - Kahn was aware that the fiscal tightening ordered by the European authorities and the IMF was preventing Greece from getting out of recession ; but while he pushed for "" softer "" conditions , he was powerless to change the lending conditions from punishment to actual help .
That 's ultimately because the European authorities ( European Commission and European Central Bank ) , not the IMF , are calling the shots – although Strauss - Kahn encountered plenty of resistance within the fund itself , too .
The voting shares of the IMF have changed only marginally , despite all the reforms of the last five years .
The share of "" emerging market and developing countries "" – with the vast majority of the world 's population – has gone from 39.4 % to 44.7 % , while the G7 countries have 41.2 % , including 16.5 % for the US ( down from 17.0 % pre - reform ) .
But the voting and governance structure is not currently the main obstacle to changing IMF policy .
At this point , the developing countries – and we should add in the victimised countries of the eurozone – are not using their potential influence within the fund .
Their representatives are mainly going along with the decisions of the G7 .
If any number of these countries were to band together in a sizeable bloc for change within the fund , there could be some real reforms at the IMF .
Such an outcome can be seen from the last decade of struggle within the World Trade Organisation , where developing countries have often not accepted the G7 consensus , and have successfully blocked the negotiation and implementation of rules that would hurt them – despite the fact that the WTO rules have been , from the outset , stacked against developing countries .
It is true that the WTO operates by consensus rather than a quota - based voting structure , but that is not the key difference between it and the IMF .
The key difference is in the role of developing countries and their representatives .
There is talk now of replacing Strauss - Kahn with an open , merit - based process of selection , breaking with the 67-year tradition of reserving the position for a European – most often , a French – official .
At the moment , such change does not appear likely to happen .
It would be a step forward , but it would be only a symbolic change , and the odds are good that the next managing director – of whatever nationality – will be to the right of Strauss - Kahn .
Real change at the IMF is in the hands of the governments of most of the world – but only if they dare to organise it ."
2011-05-19,"The 32-year - old woman allegedly attacked by the head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , is expected to testify to the grand jury deciding whether to prosecute him .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , is hoping to be granted bail on Thursday as his lawyers return to court to contest charges of sexual assault and attempted rape .
He is being held at the Rikers Island prison in New York .
Authorities have confirmed he is under suicide watch , fitted with a medical device to make sure he does not stop breathing during the night , and is checked on 24 hours a day .
His wife , Anne Sinclair , visited him in jail yesterday .
"" I do not believe for a single second the accusations levelled against my husband , "" she said in a statement .
Strauss - Kahn is accused of attacking the maid in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan around lunchtime on Saturday .
Prosecutors are assessing DNA and other evidence from Strauss - Kahn , from the woman , and from the scene of the alleged crime .
Investigators have taken a piece of carpet from Strauss - Kahn 's hotel suite to test for DNA evidence , law enforcement officials told the Associated Press .
Grand jurors are due to announce their decision on Thursday , and lawyers believe it is almost certain that a case will be brought against Strauss - Kahn .
A growing number of women are coming forward to claim they were the victims of his unwanted sexual advances .
Last night Kristin Davis , the self - styled Manhattan madam who supplied prostitutes to former New York governor Eliot Spitzer , claimed Strauss - Kahn had also been a client .
She said one $ 1,200 an hour escort refused to see him again because he had been "" aggressive "" .
On Wednesday the IMF chief 's lawyers made a second application for bail , offering $ 1 m in cash and pledging to keep him under house arrest in Manhattan with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements .
The bailing hearing has been set down to be heard on Thursday .
This week , Manhattan 's chief assistant district attorney , Daniel Alonso , successfully argued that Strauss - Kahn was a flight risk , and compared him to film director Roman Polanski , who fled the US after he made a plea bargain admitting underage sex but was then faced with jail .
John Coffee , a professor at Columbia Law School , said Strauss - Kahn could be out of jail by the weekend , and he expected that his lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , could come up with an arrangement pending trial that would satisfy the judge .
Coffee said Brafman was one of the most experienced lawyers in the US and would more than likely find a solution that would grant bail . ""
Even Bernie Madoff got bail , "" said Coffee . ""
And he was a flight risk . ""
Coffee said that , like Madoff , Strauss - Kahn might have to employ an expensive 24-hour surveillance team to monitor his movements while he is placed under effective house arrest in an apartment or hotel .
The woman Strauss - Kahn allegedly attacked is now in hiding .
An immigrant from Guinea in west Africa , she has not been named .
Her lawyer , Jeffrey Shapiro , said yesterday her life had been turned "" upside down "" and she had been unable to return to her home because of the press attention ; he also said that she strongly contested what has been suggested will be Strauss - Kahn 's line of defence , that the sex was consensual .
Pressure is mounting for Strauss - Kahn to resign as IMF managing director .
Lawyers for the institution are attempting to contact him to clarify his position ; its officials have not spoken to him since arrest .
The US treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , and European finance ministers have all made it clear they believe he should resign , in view of the institution 's central role in global finance .
Sources close to the IMF say there is a split among its board : some want him to go , and some say it should not bow to pressure .
Strauss - Kahn 's deputy , John Lipsky , has stepped in on an interim basis , but both had planned to retire shortly .
The race to succeed Strauss - Kahn has now intensified , with candidates from the developing world pushing for senior jobs traditionally dominated by Europeans .
Some IMF members want Strauss - Kahn to resign as soon as possible , arguing that the scandal is damaging the institution ; others say he has yet to give his side of the story and maintains his innocence , and the IMF should not bend to pressure .
IMF officials did not return calls for comment ."
2011-05-19,"Gordon Brown will stake his claim to be the next head of the International Monetary Fund with a speech in South Africa on Friday urging rich western nations to meet their pledges on education to the world 's poor .
As jockeying began to fill the job of managing director of the Washington - based organisation left vacant by the resignation of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former prime minister will seek to negate opposition to his candidature from David Cameron 's coalition government with a direct appeal to developing countries .
Brown will share a platform with Graça Machel , the wife of Nelson Mandela , to launch his review of education , criticising the G8 countries for their failure to provide the aid necessary to meet the United Nations target of putting every child into school by 2015 .
"" My concern is that the international community is failing to honour a promise made to the world 's children – a promise that the G8 underwrote , "" Brown says in the report . ""
And my conviction is that this is both unnecessary and counter - productive .
It combines indefensible ethics with unsound economics . ""
Bookmakers have made Brown an outsider for the IMF job , installing the French finance minister Christine Lagarde as favourite to succeed her fellow countryman following his arrest at the weekendin New York over sexual assault allegations .
Brown , however , is highly regarded in Africa for his work on debt relief and development , and admired by the leading emerging nations such as China for co - ordinating the global response to the financial crisis of 2008 - 09 .
While the former prime minister has not launched a formal campaign , he would be willing for his name to be put forward for the job .
Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week about his report on education , Brown said : "" We are facing an education emergency .
Unless we take the action we are proposing there is no chance of meeting the education MDG [ millenium development goal ] .
That 's a betrayal of children . ""
Brown urged the creation of a global fund for education , with financing of $ 3 - 4bn annually to hit the target of universal primary education by 2015 .
Brown said poor countries needed 1.8 million more teachers and extra spending on classrooms and equipment in order to fulfil their economic potential .
"" We are now less than five years from the target date – and one primary school generation from a broken promise .
There are currently 67 million primary - school - age children and an even greater number of adolescents who are not in school . ""
Treasury sources said the UK was reserving its position on the IMF job and said intense negotiations were going on behind the scenes to find a replacement for Strauss - Kahn .
The insistence by Europe that it should retain its stranglehold on the job in a tradition that dates back to the Fund 's creation in 1944 met with immediate opposition from developing countries , who believe the time has come to recognise the growing importance of Asia and Latin America to the global economy .
Cameron said last month that he thought Brown should not get the job and Vince Cable , the business secretary , made it clearon Thursday that the coalition was not backing Brown .
"" I think promoting national champions , whoever they are , probably is n't the best way of dealing with this , "" Cable said .
Tim Geithner , the US treasury secretary , called for a speedy selection process to end the power vacuum at the top of the IMF , but hinted that Washington would not simply rubber - stamp a European nomination .
"" We want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession , "" Geithner said .
The G8 will discuss the vacancy at the IMF at its summit in Deauville next week , with the expectation that a name commanding general support will come forward within the next fortnight .
Europe , in the throes of a sovereign debt crisis , is particularly keen to have a new managing director speedily appointed from a euro - zone country .
Lagarde said she supported a European for the job .
"" I 'm a true European and I 'm convinced that Europe is the way to go , as far as we are concerned , "" she told reporters on a visit to a French supermarket .
"" I am a convinced European and I think that for such a candidacy , the Europeans must be united . ""
In Berlin , German chancellor Angela Merkel pushed for a rapid decision and underlined her hopes for another European .
"" It is of great significance , of course , that we find a quick solution . ""
Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the IMF , said a European stitch - up could endanger the IMF 's credibility .
"" This could potentially end it as an organisation that can make a contribution .
It 's nonsense , absolute nonsense – the Europeans have lost their grip .
The most important thing is even - handedness .
The IMF has to offer the same advice , the same support to every country , irrespective of the colour of their skin , the language they speak , or their friendliness to the French . ""
Peter Chowla , of thinktank the Bretton Woods Project , said : "" It should be someone who 's not a serving member of a government , because the IMF needs to act as a neutral arbiter of rich countries ' policies .
We need a reformer , a strong reformer , and it 's pretty clear that any of the European candidates will not be a reformer . """
2011-05-21,"The government has officially backed Christine Lagarde , the French finance minister , to be the new head of the International Monetary Fund , effectively ending Gordon Brown 's dwindling hopes of snatching the job .
European leaders are anxious to settle on a candidate to replace Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who resigned as the IMF 's managing director after being arrested in New York on suspicion of sexually assaulting a hotel chambermaid .
George Osborne followed Italy , Germany and several other European governments in explicitly supporting Lagarde , 55 , who won plaudits for her shrewd political judgment when the global financial crisis sent European economies into turmoil .
"" I believe Christine is the outstanding candidate for the IMF – and that 's why Britain will back her , "" said Osborne , who praised her "" real international leadership "" as chair of the G20 finance ministers .
The chancellor said that he viewed Lagarde as a sympathiser in Britain 's hawkish approach to budget deficits : "" She has been a strong advocate for countries tackling high budget deficits and living within their means . ""
He said that a woman head for the IMF would be welcome : "" I also personally think it would be a very good thing to see the first female managing director of the IMF in its 60-year history . ""
Lagarde , who represented France at synchronised swimming as a teenager , speaks fluent English , having worked as a lawyer in the US .
She has been France 's finance minister since 2007 , and has been popular both among financiers and the public .
She was voted Europe 's best finance minister in a Financial Times poll in 2009 .
Germany 's Angela Merkel and Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi have both praised Lagarde in recent days and smaller European nations , including Sweden and Austria , have backed her .
Under a long - running informal agreement , leadership of the World Bank has generally gone to an American , with the IMF job going to a European .
Some policymakers , particularly in the US , have suggested that it is time for a candidate from an emerging nation to have the role .
Trevor Manuel , South Africa 's finance minister , has been mentioned , as has Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore .
With the eurozone beset by debt crises in Greece , Portugal and Ireland , leaders in the European Union are , however , keen for a sympathetic voice at the IMF .
The US , which is yet to make its position clear , will have a key role in determining the outcome of the selection process , with a new head due to be appointed by the end of June .
The government 's decision to back Lagarde will come as a bitter disappointment to Brown , who has lobbied for the job , citing his long - standing role in reforming international financial institutions .
However , even before Strauss - Kahn 's arrest , David Cameron had let it be know that he did not consider the former prime minister an "" appropriate person "" for the post .
•
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the Record column , Sunday 29 May 2011 .
This report , referred to Trevor Manuel as South Africa 's finance minister .
He was certainly one of South Africa 's longest - serving finance ministers , having been appointed in 1996 and moving to his current job as planning minister in 2009 ."
2011-05-21,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn was granted bail on Friday but the former International Monetary Fund boss is finding New York an unwelcoming city .
Strauss - Kahn had been hoping to move into a $ 14,000 ( £ 8,620 ) a month apartment in the luxurious Bristol Plaza building on the upper east side of Manhattan – a building that bills itself on its website as "" Better than a hotel "" .
But the building 's management barred Strauss - Kahn before he could even get out of jail .
Late on Friday night he was reported to have moved into far less salubrious accommodation in downtown Manhattan , although the new arrangement will be a huge improvement on the cell in New York 's notorious Rikers Island prison , where he has spent the past four nights .
Anne Sinclair , Strauss - Kahn 's wife and a former journalist , was said to have hired two apartments in the Bristol Plaza .
News of his new abode attracted a huge media scrum outside the building and objections from residents .
Police had to put up barricades to hold back the TV crews .
The Bristol Plaza is located in one of Manhattan 's most exclusive neighbourhoods .
It is positioned just a few blocks from designer department stores Bloomingdales and Barneys .
Speaking anonymously , one resident said the media scrum was the first news he had heard of Strauss - Kahn 's arrival .
"" It 's outrageous .
You think someone would have told us .
I am going to object to this , "" he said .
Strauss - Kahn will now stay in a corporate apartment near the site of the former World Trade Center , managed by Stroz Friedberg LLC , the investigations and surveillance company that oversaw the house arrest of fraudster Bernard Madoff as he awaited trial .
A judge granted Strauss - Kahn bail on Thursday , while he fights charges that he attempted to rape a hotel chambermaid .
The former IMF boss has posted a $ 1 m cash deposit as well as a $ 5 m insurance bond as bail .
He is to be kept under house arrest , wear an electronic tag to monitor his movements and pay $ 200,000-a - month to hire a 24-hour , gun - toting security team authorised to use force should he attempt to flee .
"" I expect you will be here when we need you , "" judge Michael Obus said when granting bail .
"" If there is the slightest problem , we can withdraw conditions . ""
Strauss - Kahn resigned from his position at the IMF on Thursday .
The institution is set to hand him a $ 250,000 golden handshake and a life - long pension that would be "" far , far less than that amount in subsequent years , "" said the IMF .
The former IMF head was jailed after he was seized on an Air France plane at JFK airport last Saturday , just moments before it took off .
Strauss - Kahn will formally answer charges on 6 June .
The 32-year - old hotel maid who has accused Strauss - Kahn of attempted rape is currently in hiding .
She gave details of her ordeal to a grand jury this week and told police she entered his hotel room to clean it , thinking it was empty .
He then allegedly jumped from a bathroom naked and attacked her .
He denies all charges .
It was n't all bad news for Strauss - Kahn however .
Tristane Banon , a journalist who claimed Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her eight years ago , said she would n't file a criminal complaint against him for the time being .
Banon 's lawyer , David Koubbi , told BFM TV that the journalist would decide later about filing a complaint because she did n't "" want to be manipulated by the US justice system "" ."
2011-05-21,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's alleged sexual assault of a hotel chambermaid last Saturday has made an extraordinary story , but is not as exceptional as might be assumed .
Whatever the outcome of the Strauss - Kahn case , it is certain that in the upper ranks of international organisations , there exists a culture of impunity that permits highly - placed managers to sexually assault , abuse and harass women – be they colleagues or domestic workers – and get away with it .
DSK 's case is unusual in that diplomatic immunity has not been asserted as a block to the pursuit of criminal charges .
Most of the time , this immunity that makes international officials and civil servants of a certain standing act as though they are untouchable .
Domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to diplomats ' actions .
In 2007 , the American Civil Liberties Union compiled 63 documented cases of diplomats sexually , psychologically and physically abusing domestic workers .
The following year , the Government Accountability Office released a report that counted 42 cases since 2000 , but also said the numbers were likely much higher than those reported .
The office made some recommendations to the US state department , which handles diplomatic affairs , but in January , Thomas Melito , the GAO 's international affairs and trade director , told me most of them had not yet been implemented .
To this day , few allegedly abusive diplomats have faced charges .
Still , a recent case of domestic abuse in a diplomatic household set an encouraging precedent .
Vishranthamma Swarna , a maid to former Kuwaiti UN diplomat Badar Al - Awadi , claimed to have suffered sustained mistreatment , including rape , when she was not cooking , cleaning and caring for the diplomat 's children in New York .
Swarna was isolated : she spoke no English and was banned by her employer from leaving the house .
She also inhabited a legal black hole : since her employer , who brought her in on a special visa , had diplomatic immunity , he could not be prosecuted in the United States for his actions .
With help from the ACLU , Swarna was able to take her case to the federal district court of New York , where the judge ruled that her work did not have a "" direct … benefit to diplomatic functions "" and that Al - Awadi could subsequently not be protected from prosecution under the Vienna conventions ( pdf ) .
The decision means that a diplomat can now be held liable for mistreating a domestic worker , but not for sexually abusing a secretary or intern , whose work is arguably vital to the embassy or consulate 's work .
It remains to be seen whether victims like Swarna will begin speak up .
But even then , their alleged abusers can conveniently relocate .
Al - Awadi has since moved to Paris .
Women who work at international organisations also face sex discrimination and harassment , and the more highly ranked their harassers , the less likely they are to get justice .
In 2004 , Ruud Lubbers , the high commissioner for human rights , reportedly grabbed Cynthia Brzak , an American employee , and pressed his groin against her buttocks in full view of other UNHCR staff .
Brzak and many other female employees report that it is normal to be treated in such a way at the UN and other international organisations .
But since filing a complaint is seen as a career - killer , most sexual harassment incidents go unreported .
Victims have very little legal recourse , and must go through the UN 's complex internal justice system .
Brzak pressed charges because she was tired of the permissive culture .
"" I just wanted a message sent that you can not keep jumping on women at three in the afternoon , "" she says today .
What began as a simple request for an apology led to a protracted legal battle .
Despite an internal investigation that found Lubbers unequivocally guilty of repeated counts of sexual harassment , Kofi Annan declared that he lacked evidence to charge the official .
Lubbers denied the allegations and would not apologise , though he was eventually forced to resign .
In 2006 , Brzak filed a complaint against the UN in a New York court , but to no avail : six years and $ 700,000 in legal fees after the incident , the UN had its immunity upheld .
"" They need to defend [ themselves ] because if the immunity is ultimately breached , the UN will be bankrupt in a year or two because of the number of similar cases , "" says Brzak 's lawyer , Ed Flaherty .
Brzak 's case was highly publicised , but most are not .
Over the course of this year , I have spoken to many women who say that their bosses at the UN , the WHO , Unicef and other international organisations take liberties that would otherwise be punishable by law .
Again , very few harassers faced repercussions .
It was a relief to hear from the IMF , the Elysée palace and the state department that DSK 's alleged conduct would not be protected by diplomatic immunity .
What lies in store for the former IMF chief remains to be seen , yet the fact that he was arrested and arraigned is , in itself , a significant development .
But it will take more than one case to end the culture of impunity ."
2011-05-22,"There is a thin line between due speed and indecent haste , and the discussion about who should replace Dominique Strauss - Kahn as head of the International Monetary Fund has surely lurched over it .
Given Mr Kahn only tendered his resignation on Thursday , a remarkable gaggle of politicians has come forward with firm views about who should replace him .
Germany 's Angela Merkel , France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and José Manuel Barroso of the European commission all insist that the job goes to a European – sharpish .
For Silvio Berlusconi , not known as an authority on the global economy , the French finance minister Christine Lagarde would make "" an excellent choice "" .
Anders Borg of Sweden agrees , and so too now does George Osborne , relishing the chance to twist the knife into Gordon Brown 's faded hopes .
These are just the public pronouncements ; imagine the lobbying backstage .
Such jostling for the top job happens in organisations far less exalted than the IMF , of course .
But this game of sharp elbows runs directly counter to what is best for the Fund and the world economy .
It is also precisely what world leaders promised they would n't do .
In 2009 , at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , Mr Sarkozy , Ms Merkel and Mr Berlusconi were among the government heads who signed a communique stating : "" We agree that the heads and senior leadership of all international institutions should be appointed through an open , transparent and merit - based process . ""
A line was supposed to have been drawn under the old system of a White House crony ruling the World Bank and a spare European politician running the IMF .
That had often led to poor governance of these supposedly vital institutions , it was widely acknowledged , and was out of place after the banking crisis .
So why is an argument that commanded fervent global agreement just two years ago now being trampled over ?
It 's no good pointing at the eurozone crisis : a new IMF boss will have a five - year term and other big issues to deal with .
If you doubt it , look at this week 's warning from the International Energy Agency about high crude prices : "" Oil - importing developing countries are most likely to be seriously affected by high oil prices , undermining their economic and social wellbeing . ""
Or else cock an ear to the rows between America and China .
Ministers constantly tell voters that competition is good for economies .
So why do n't they follow the same principle when it comes to choosing who runs economic institutions ?
Publish the criteria for appointing the next IMF boss and hold an open recruitment process .
And let the best candidate get the job – wherever they come from ."
2011-05-22,"Australia and South Africa challenged the convention of appointing a European as head of the International Monetary Fund on Sunday , opening a north - south rift over the future of the agency in the wake of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's arrest in New York for sexual assault .
The two countries ' call for IMF management to be chosen on merit rather than by nationality is believed to have the support of the world 's emerging powers , including China , India and Brazil .
Britain and other major European states have put their support behind the French economy minister , Christine Lagarde , but Trevor Manuel , a former South African finance minister was emerging as a strong challenger on Sunday .
The position of managing director of the Fund was left open when Strauss - Kahn resigned last week to fight charges of attempted rape of a hotel worker in Manhattan .
The challenge to European control of the IMF came in the form of a joint statement by Australia 's treasurer , Wayne Swan , and South Africa 's finance minister , Pravin Gordhan . ""
For too long , the IMF 's legitimacy has been undermined by a convention to appoint its senior management on the basis of their nationality , "" it said .
"" In order to maintain trust , credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of its stakeholders , there must be an open and transparent selection process , which results in the most competent person being appointed as managing director , … regardless of their nationality . ""
Swan and Gordhan are co - chairs of the G20 's IMF Reform Working Group , and their statement reflect the claims of emerging powers , developing countries and champions of institutional reform that the post - war status quo by which Europe chose the head of the IMF and the US ran the World Bank , was no longer legitimate in a changing world half a century later .
Switzerland also declared on Sunday it would not necessarily back a European for the managing director 's job , and there were signs last night of a surge in support for South Africa 's Manuel as an "" outsider "" candidate .
However , there are other contenders for that role , such as Mexico 's central bank chief , Agustín Carstens .
A three - person shortlist will be drawn up by the IMF 's executive committee on 10 June and a vote will be held on 30 June .
European capitals were quick to back Lagarde in an effort to quash any uncertainty over the IMF 's future at a precarious moment in talks over eurozone debt .
Lagarde played a central role in the EU response to the crisis and is currently involved in negotiations over Greek debt .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , the Italian president , Silvio Berlusconi , and the French government all praised her abilities over the weekend .
William Hague restated Britain 's enthusiastic endorsement of Lagarde on Sunday , and denied that his government 's backing for the 55-year - old Frenchwoman was a snub to Gordon Brown , who was reported to have been interested in the job .
"" I can certainly tell you we have never received any public or private communication in the government from Gordon Brown seeking to be a candidate for this position .
But in any case we regard Christine Lagarde as an outstanding candidate , "" the foreign secretary told the BBC 's Politics Show . ""
She has a very strong record in bringing about deficit reduction , in countries living within their means .
It is very important for anybody running the IMF to have a strong sense of such things and strong international respect .
She certainly has all of those things so she is most definitely our preferred candidate . ""
Washington has so far made no comment on its preferences .
Lagarde faces a further threat to her candidacy in France , where a court has until 10 June to decide whether to investigate her role in the settlement of a legal claim in 2008 of € 285 m ( then £ 226 m ) in favour of the former minister and businessman Bernard Tapie .
The French press is also scrutinising her private investments for evidence of any conflicts of interests .
Lagarde denies any wrongdoing ."

2011-05-23,"Following Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's indictment on 19 May , the trial to come may or may not establish "" the truth "" .
But the story will certainly keep unfolding – or rather the stories .
First of all , there is obviously a sexual narrative , in both senses of the term : the scandal is inseparably about gender and sexuality .
The transatlantic contrast is evident to all , as it was at the time of the Monica Lewinsky affair .
While French commentators have revived the familiar puritan myth against American society , the American press once again wonders , "" are French women more tolerant ? ""
– meaning : of sexual misconduct , at least by powerful men .
Cultural contexts do matter .
While the criminal court single - page complaint explicitly mentions "" oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct "" , the French press dropped the latter , and immediately transformed the former into "" fellatio "" – thus making a consensual act less implausible for its readers .
And indeed , some politicians in France have tried very hard to live up to the Gallic reputation : while in the New York Times Maureen Dowd sighed in relief that at least the French had avoided referring to Dreyfus , soon enough , former Mitterrand minister ( and arch - republican ) Jean - Pierre Chevènement obliged . ""
Plus ça change , plus c'est la même chose "" ?
On the contrary : culturalist readings may already be out of date – along with the men whose comments have provoked outrage ( and not only among feminists ! ) , who now realise that sexism is not so "" normal "" any longer .
Jack Lang , President Mitterrand 's minister of culture , Robert Badinter , then minister of justice ,
Bernard - Henri Lévy , once a "" nouveau philosophe "" , have all become , as a result of their male defence of DSK , objects of anger or , even more significantly , ridicule – not only in the United States , but also in France .
All of a sudden , these traditional icons of the left just look foolish – worse : old - fashioned .
By contrast , no less unexpectedly , feminism now sounds modern – better : cool .
Even in French , the times , they are a - changin ' .
Once the gender narrative emerges to make power visible in a story that might otherwise have been reduced to mere seduction gone wrong , other narratives of domination suddenly emerge .
The first pertains to class .
The recurrent mention of the "" $ 3,000 suite "" did not only reverberate with attacks already levelled against the potential presidential candidate 's wealth ( or his wife 's , for that matter ) ; it also emphasised the gap separating the accused from his accuser , a single mother living in the Bronx .
The princely wooing of Cinderella only looks charming in fairy tales , or in their updated versions – romantic comedies .
Think of the 2003 film Maid in Manhattan , with Jennifer Lopez gently and kindly seduced by Ralph Fiennes , a rich heir and candidate to the US Senate .
The DSK scandal is a reality check , reminding us of the actual life of working - class maids , even ( if not especially ) in luxury hotels .
The class dimension is all the more important if one bears in mind the increasing repression against sexual crimes in France ( as elsewhere ) .
In the last decade , the focus of public conversations , regarding violence against women , has been "" others "" – in particular , working - class youths ( especially of foreign origin ) from the "" banlieues "" – that is , the underprivileged neighbourhoods .
Interestingly , when the media started discussing gang rapes , in 2000 , journalists borrowed the term "" tournantes "" from the slang of the slums .
While such youths have generally been presumed guilty , in particular in the court of public opinion , today , when the rape allegedly occurs in a suite towering over Manhattan , and not a sordid basement in Vitry - sur - Seine , many rediscover the virtues of the presumption of innocence .
Class stereotypes matter .
In fact , they translate into judiciary truths .
While victim surveys establish that violence against women occurs in all classes ( and neither less nor more among the bourgeoisie ) , the study of court cases reveals that almost always only working - class rapists go on trial .
The sociology of rape is radically different if considered from the point of view of women , or the judiciary system .
It is in this context that Jean - François Kahn 's phrase has proven equally infelicitous and illuminating .
The famous journalist , in order to minimise the accusation ( he felt "" certain "" – or "" almost "" – that there had been "" no violent rape attempt "" ) , described his friend 's "" imprudence "" in strangely archaic language as "" troussage de domestique "" ( in English , this might uneasily translate as "" ancillary shagging "" ) .
The gender norm thus turns out to be a class norm .
It is also a racial one .
This third narrative is but a variation on the second one : the class definition of hotel maids is simultaneously racialised .
This dimension , which will almost inevitably arise in a public trial , has so far remained mostly implicit .
However , when denouncing the media treatment of DSK in the United States , many have used the term "" lynching "" .
These Frenchmen may not be aware of Clarence Thomas , who became the second black man on the US supreme court upon replacing Thurgood Marshall : his famous outburst against "" high - tech lynching "" , during the 1991 hearings about the accusation of sexual harassment levelled against him by former colleague Anita Hill , a black woman , turned the table and imposed a racial , rather than gender reading of the scandal – was he not married to a white woman ?
At least , French politicians should know something about US racial history : in the era of Jim Crow , and beyond , thousands of black men were ( falsely ) accused of raping white women – and lynched .
Using the same term for a white man accused of rape by a black woman could prove incendiary in the American context .
But such a parodic reversal also brings to mind the 2005 petition by formerly progressive ( and now reactionary ) public figures in France , such as essay writer Alain Finkielkraut and soon - to - be President Sarkozy 's cabinet minister Bernard Kouchner , against "" ratonnades anti - Blancs "" – naming what may or may not have been anti - white attack , after anti - Arab racist violence at the time of the Algerian war .
This comparison only reminds us that the racial dimension will almost inevitably surface in France – through a fourth narrative – in postcolonial terms .
The plaintiff is not an African American ; this black woman is an immigrant from western Africa – more precisely , she was granted asylum after leaving Guinea , her country of origin .
She speaks French , the language inherited from the colonial past .
Moreover , she is a Muslim ( rumour even has it that she wears a hijab – see , for example , Katha Pollitt 's column ) .
This at a time when the Sarkozy administration and the government party UMP racialise national identity in the name of secularism – from the law against hijab in 2004 to the one against niqab in 2010 .
Should DSK 's lawyers plead consensual sex , despite the defence lawyer 's warnings , they would fuel this postcolonial narrative .
Indeed , colonial domination may have played on the assumption of consent – and not only ( though also ) in sexual terms – while today , the postcolonial context of immigration policies leads France to impose upon African nations the policing of migrants to France under the Orwellian names of "" co - development "" or ( even better ) "" solidary development "" .
That this scandal concerns the man who was head of the IMF , now confronted with the accusations of a sub - Saharan migrant , could only reinforce such a narrative .
In the end , the story may not be just about France , or the United States , or even the transatlantic mirror game ; the narratives of domination resonate in a globalised world .
DSKgate may play the role that the Clarence Thomas hearings eventually did in the United States 20 years ago – this event , which played not only on gender and sexuality , but also on race and class , turned out to be a pedagogical lesson on a national scale .
Such stories shake immemorial norms , along with implicit assumptions that obviously went without saying .
But this disruption can prove productive .
The current public conversation , notwithstanding angry misunderstandings , will create new languages of intelligibility , as old ones have already been jettisoned .
It will shift the boundaries of the visible and the invisible , the thinkable and the unthinkable – the normal and the intolerable . ""

2011-05-23,"The arrest of Dominique Strauss - Kahn has been greeted by New York 's popular papers with a raft of anti - French headlines , lame puns and clichéd phrases en Français .

2011-05-24,"One very important fact has been largely absent from the coverage of the sexual assault case against Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and , until latterly , leading candidate to be the next president of France .
The hotel housekeeper whom he allegedly assaulted was represented by a union .
The reason that this is an important part of the story is that it is likely that Strauss - Kahn 's alleged victim might not have felt confident enough to pursue the issue with either her supervisors or law enforcement agencies , if she had not been protected by a union contract .
The vast majority of hotel workers in the United States , like most workers in the private sector , do not enjoy this protection .
This matters because under the law in the United States , an employer can fire a worker at any time for almost any reason .
It is illegal for an employer to fire a worker for reporting a sexual assault .
If any worker can prove that this is the reason they were fired , they would get their job back and probably back pay .
( The penalties tend to be trivial , so the back pay is , unfortunately , not a joke . )
However , it is completely legal for an employer to fire a worker who reports a sexual assault for having been late to work last Tuesday or any other transgression .
Since employers know the law , they do n't ever say that they are firing a worker for reporting a sexual assault .
They might fire workers who report sexual assaults for other on - the - job failings , real or invented .
In this way , the United States stands out from most other wealthy countries .
For example , all the countries of western Europe afford workers some measure of employment protection , where employers must give a reason for firing workers .
Workers can contest their dismissal if they think the reason is not valid , unlike the United States where there is no recourse .
Imagine the situation of the hotel worker had she not been protected by a union contract .
She is a young immigrant mother who needs this job to support her family .
According to reports , she likely did not know Strauss - Kahn 's identity at the time she reported the assault , but she undoubtedly understood that the person staying in the $ 3,000-a - night suite was a wealthy and important person .
In these circumstances , how likely would it be that she would make an issue of a sexual assault to her supervisors ?
Housekeepers are generally among the lowest - paid workers at hotels , often earning little more than the minimum wage .
It is a high turnover job , meaning that any individual housekeeper is likely to be viewed as easily replaceable by the management .
If this housekeeper did not enjoy the protection of a union contract , is it likely that she would have counted on her supervisors taking her side against an important guest at the hotel ?
Would she have been prepared to risk her job to pursue the case ?
We can never know how this particular woman would have responded otherwise – as , fortunately , she did have the protection of a union .
However , it is likely that many similar assaults go unreported because the victims do not feel they can risk their jobs to pursue the case .
They simply have to accept sexual harassment and even sexual assault as "" part of the job "" .
There is a special irony to this situation given Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's prior position .
The IMF , along with other pillars of the economic establishment , has long pushed for reducing the rights of workers at their workplace .
Specifically , they have pushed countries around the world to adopt measures that weaken the power of unions .
The IMF has also urged western European countries to eliminate or weaken laws that prevent employers from firing workers at will .
These laws , along with unions , are seen as "" labour market rigidities "" that prevent labour markets from operating efficiently .
In the dream world of the economists ' textbook policies , all employers would have the ability to fire employees at will .
There would be no protective legislation and no unions to get in the way .
In that economist 's dream world , then , powerful executives could be fairly certain that they would have licence to molest hotel workers with impunity ."
2011-05-24,"The first results from DNA tests into the alleged sexual assault by the former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn on a hotel maid in New York has confirmed a link between him and swabs taken from the woman 's uniform , reports suggest .
According to the Associated Press , DNA samples taken from Strauss - Kahn last week with his permission have matched material found on the maid 's shirt .
Results of further tests have yet to come in , including a sample of the carpet and swabs taken from sinks and other surfaces in the hotel room .
Any genetic link confirmed in early tests is likely to be used by both prosecution and defence teams to support their cases .
On the one hand , the New York district attorney 's office leading the prosecution may use it as evidence that a sexual assault took place on 14 May inside Strauss - Kahn 's room at the Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan .
But the defence could also cite the finding as evidence of a consensual sexual meeting between the former IMF leader and the maid .
Strauss - Kahn 's main lawyer , Benjamin Brafman , has said in court that the evidence will "" not be consistent with a forcible encounter "" .
Unless solid forensic evidence is uncovered that points categorically towards a criminal act then any eventual trial is likely to come down to the word of Strauss - Kahn versus that of the unidentified woman as to whether any encounter was forced or consensual .
He has been charged with two counts of committing a criminal sexual act , attempted rape , sexual abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment .
Strauss - Kahn has been released under $ 1 m bail under stringent conditions that include wearing an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements and a 24-hour armed guard .
But he has turned into something of a pariah , unable to settle in any place because of the complaints of irate neighbours .
He is currently living in a temporary apartment on Broadway in lower Manhattan that is owned by the security company , Stroz Friedberg , assigned to guard him and ensure that he does not attempt to flee the country and return to his native France which has no extradition treaty with the US .
Earlier , he was forced to leave the Bristol Plaza on the Upper East Side after the residents ' board objected to the media scrum that had assembled outside the front door .
He is now reportedly trying to rent a townhouse from which he could not be evicted .
The woman is living at an undisclosed location in New York .
Reuters spoke to her family in Guinea in a village without mains water or electricity .
A man called Mamoudou , believed to be her brother , told the agency : "" In our family , we are above material things .
Even if you a billionaire , we do n't care .
The most important thing for us is how you follow God 's path . ""
The average annual income in the village is about a dollar a day .
Mamoudou told Reuters that his sister left the village after her husband died , moving first to a suburb of the capital , Conakry , where she learned how to sew and then on to New York where she now lives with her 15-year - old daughter ."
2011-05-24,"After his recent arrest , Dominique Strauss - Kahn was described as a man who had "" a difficulty in controlling his impulses "" .
Whatever the outcome of this particular court case , it is a story that gives Dennis Kelly 's After the End an unsettling topicality .
The claustrophobic two - hander is about Louise , a popular young office worker , who wakes to find herself in an underground nuclear fallout shelter .
Mark , a colleague from the reprographic department , explains he has rescued her from the carnage created by a suitcase bomb .
Luckily , he never got rid of the old shelter in his garden .
Luckily , he kept it stocked with food .
It could be an episode of The Survivors were it not for Mark using the situation to exert his control .
Free of the social pecking order that defined him as the workplace misfit and her as the alpha female , he tries to strong - arm Louise into showing him respect .
Throw in his sexual urges , and we are in the dark territory of John Fowles 's The Collector .
Kelly seems to suggest that , given a bit of power , a man will cut out the complexity of a two - way relationship and assert his own desires .
In Amanda Gaughan 's gripping production , Nicola Daley charts an alarming path from queen bee to neurotic victim .
Underplaying the geeky aspect of Mark 's character , Jonathan Dunn is all the more frightening for seeming ordinary .
Together , they expose uncomfortable tensions in a battle of the sexes that has not yet ended ."
2011-05-25,"The International Monetary Fund is in the public eye , and not solely because of Dominique Strauss - Kahn –
the institution is also undergoing media scrutiny for having the type of office culture that , according to employees , seems to be tarnished with harassment .
But for all the talk about the IMF and its former director , few people in the west seem to know much about how the IMF actually operates in the countries where it holds ( or used to hold , until popular rebellions made the situation unsustainable ) a very tight grip .
As an Argentinian , I can not remember ever not knowing the intricacies of how the IMF operates in our region .
We all know , or have been victims ourselves , of the policies it imposes to approve a new line of credit , accept delayed payments , or renegotiate interest rates for our national debts .
The visit of an IMF delegate can be the subject of headlines for weeks , months even .
After all , a negative rating can bring down governments .
The story of my life is entangled with its interventions .
Take my father .
On his deathbed , he was still worried about possible fluctuations in dollar exchange rates as a result of IMF demands that would further deplete whatever little we had left at that point .
My uncle .
He declared bankruptcy and closed down his 30-year - old business because he could no longer compete with low - cost manufacturing countries due to the IMF 's imposition of dollar parity and unrestricted import policies .
My mother .
She was unable to obtain a widow 's pension , after my father , who contributed to the system for more than 25 years , passed away – the IMF had demanded a reform of pension and retirement funds .
With everything now privatised , there was no longer any safety net .
And my grandmother .
She lived and died on the poverty line because of the reductions in her retirement payments , which were imposed to tackle the national deficit .
Back in 2000 , the public hospital where I was admitted for emergency care could not provide more than a piece of stale bread for breakfast .
When my condition was no longer life - threatening , I was asked to use a chair for the remainder of the night instead of taking a hospital bed .
The public healthcare cuts demanded to , yet again , control the deficit , had made operating the hospital more a labour of love than one of management efficiency .
For Christmas 2001 , my mother was unable to buy food because there was a revolution in our streets : the population refused to accept further IMF "" adjustments "" .
I was on the other side of the world at the time , unable to do anything that would help her buy anything due to Argentina 's collapsed banking system and the impossibility of issuing international money transfers .
While the impact of the IMF 's policies is often invisible to many in the west , we lived with them – endured them – on a daily basis .
Ever since I can remember , I 've seen the IMF 's work associated with metaphors of sexual assault . ""
The raped nation "" – again and again , that is how South American media would metaphorically refer to the policies imposed by the IMF .
Our media and , more specifically , tabloid media , whose target demographics have always been the working class and the poor ( who also happen to be the most affected by these policies ) have been drawing on rape comparisons for decades .
Yes , our resources were depleted and our youth deprived of basic healthcare and education as a result of measures that benefited the international financial industry and were implemented with the complicit , necessary help of corrupt local government officials .
But without fail , we would read headlines portraying our countries as women who have been assaulted , raped , stripped of their dignity .
Such violent metaphors have become part of mainstream discourse , where they remain unchallenged .
And now we seem to have come full circle .
It is no longer about our "" defiled nations "" .
The body of a woman , who also hails from a developing country , is now at the centre of an international scandal .
A woman who might not have been an economic migrant if it was n't for the policies that the IMF imposed on the global south .
Suddenly , the gruesome tabloid metaphors of my childhood no longer refer to economic measures inflicted by an institution that responds to international , neocolonial financial interests .
They acquire a more tangible , grave tone .
As I write this , I read about the heated debates regarding Strauss - Kahn 's successor .
Will it be another European ?
Will it be someone from an emerging nation ?
They say the job should be based on competence and résumé .
They also say the south should finally have a leading voice in the IMF .
I guess the most urgent skills to run such an institution are off the negotiation table because , if you ask me , what the IMF needs is a good dose of empathy and compassion , so that both its policies and the actions of the individuals that run it no longer need to define our southern lives ."
2011-05-25,"In the midst of the media storm surrounding IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn last week , my feelings were perfectly expressed in a tweet by Paul Kingsnorth : "" Could someone please arrest the head of the IMF for screwing the poor for 60 years ? ""
Without diminishing the seriousness of the sexual allegations against Strauss - Kahn , the role of the IMF , over past decades and at present , is a far bigger story .
Of particular importance is its role at this crucial moment in the Middle East .
The new loans being negotiated for Egypt and Tunisia will lock both countries into long - term economic strategies even before the first post - revolution elections have been held .
Given the IMF 's history , we should expect these to have devastating consequences on the Egyptian and Tunisian people .
You would n't guess it though , from the scant and largely fawning coverage the negotiations have so far received .
The pattern is to depict the IMF like a rich uncle showing up to save the day for some wayward child .
This Dickensian scene is completed with the IMF adding the sage words that this time it hopes to see growth on the "" streets "" not just the "" spreadsheets "" .
It 's almost as if the problem had been caused by these regimes failing to follow the IMF 's teachings .
Such portrayals are credulous to the point of being ahistorical .
They do not even mention , for example , the very positive reports the IMF had issued about both Tunisia and Egypt ( along with Libya and others ) in the months , weeks , and even days before the uprisings .
To some extent , though , the IMF is aware that its policies contributed to the desperation that so many Egyptians and Tunisians currently face , and is keen to distance itself from its past .
Indeed , as IMF watchers will know , this is part of a new image that the IMF , along with its sister organisation the World Bank , has been working on for a while .
The changes , so far , do not go beyond spin .
You ca n't , as they say , polish a turd –
but you can roll it in glitter .
Take , for example , the heartwarming IMF and civil society webpage , which as early as August 2007 was noting that civil society groups , by and large , "" believe that global institutions also need to be accountable to a broader definition of stakeholders to be effective and legitimate "" .
Why then , is the IMF not ( as Mohamed Trabelsi , of the International Labour Organisation 's North Africa office , suggested when I interviewed him recently in Cairo ) meeting the civil society groups and unions in Egypt and Tunisia ?
It would rather make backroom deals with Mubarak - appointed finance minister , Samir Radwan , and the generals currently running Egypt who are themselves members of an the economic elite that sees its privilege threatened by the approach of democracy .
Beginning in the 1990s , IMF - led structural adjustment programmes saw the privatisation of the bulk of the Egyptian textile industry and the slashing of its workforce from half a million to a quarter - million .
What 's more , the workers who were left faced – like the rest of Egypt – stagnant wages as the price of living rocketed .
Though you would n't know it from western coverage , the long and gallant struggle of these workers , particularly the strike of textile workers of Mahalla el - Kubra , is credited by many Egyptian activists as a crucial step on the Egyptian people 's path towards revolution .
This failure to appreciate the revolutions as a rebellion not just against local dictators , but against the global neo - liberal programme they were implementing with such gusto in their countries , is largely a product of how we on the western left have been unwitting orientalists , and allowed the racist "" clash of civilisations "" narrative to define our perceptions of the Middle East .
We have failed to see the people of the region as natural allies in a common struggle .
It is this blindness that makes the revolutions appear as instantaneous explosions , like switches suddenly flicked , rather than as events in a continuum .
A good place to start the story , if you want it to make sense , would be the Egyptian bread riots of 1977 , which came following an initial round of economic liberalisation ( which was as much a part of Sadat 's change of cold war allegiances as his salute to the Israeli flag in Jerusalem ) .
It should not have surprised us that as people 's struggle to survive grew more and more grinding following the IMF - led reforms of the subsequent decades they would rise up once more .
Nor should we surprised at the moneyed fightback , which will no doubt be attempted .
During this transition period , forces like the IMF will seek to lock in and enlarge the neoliberal project before there is an accountable government to complain about it .
The example of South Africa , as documented by Naomi Klein , immediately springs to mind .
The ANC 's famous Freedom Charter , she points out , contained many demands for economic justice including the provision of housing and health care , and the nationalisation of major industries .
However , while Nelson Mandela was negotiating the structure of the new parliament , Thabo Mbeke was busy in economic talks with FW de Klerk 's government during which , in Klein 's words , he was persuaded "" to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts , economists and officials from the IMF , the World Bank , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and the National Party – anyone except the liberation fighters from the ANC "" .
The team of ANC economists busy drawing up their plan would find themselves unable to implement it once the party was in government .
The consequences for South Africans have been disastrous .
These new loans from the IMF threaten to bind the newly democratic Egypt and Tunisia in much the same way .
Once more , local elites could collaborate with the institutions at the helm of global capitalism to screw the broader population .
If this occurs , these revolutions will be robbed of much of their meaning , and a terrible blow will be dealt to the broader Arab spring ."
2011-05-25,"The French finance minister , Christine Lagarde , has launched her bid to become the next head of the International Monetary Fund following the resignation of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who is facing charges of sexual assault .
If she is successful she will become the first woman to head the organisation , known as "" the world 's banker "" , since its inception in 1945 .
Lagarde , who has the backing of Britain , Germany , France and the European Union , said she came to the decision to throw her hat in the ring to become the IMF 's new managing director after "" mature reflection "" and having consulted with the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy . ""
If I 'm elected I 'll bring all my expertise as a lawyer , a minister , a manager and a woman [ to the job ] , "" she said at a press conference in Paris on Wednesday .
Although Lagarde has emerged as a front - runner for the influential post , which has historically been held by a European , IMF directors from Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa ( Brics ) said the unwritten convention of appointing a managing director from Europe was "" obsolete "" and undermined the legitimacy of the fund .
The Brics group called for a "" truly transparent , merit - based and competitive process "" .
Lagarde is also facing a possible legal investigation into the payment of € 285 m of taxpayers ' money to controversial businessman Bernard Tapie , a supporter of Sarkozy , to settle a long - running legal dispute .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , stood down last week after he was arrested in New York on 14 May and indicted on seven charges of sexual assault on a hotel housekeeper , including attempted rape .
He denies the charges and has been released on bail .
Admirers of the 55-year - old Lagarde , a former national synchronised swimming champion , have described her as a "" rock star "" of the financial world .
She earned praise at home and abroad for her handling of the economic crisis in Europe and for her no - nonsense , straight - talking approach .
Having worked as a lawyer in the US for 25 years she speaks impeccable English .
She earned the nickname L'Américaine among her compatriots for suggesting the French needed to stop their "" obsessive thinking "" , roll up their shirtsleeves and "" get to work "" to pull the country out of the financial doldrums .
Kenneth Rogoff , a former IMF chief economist who is now professor at Harvard University , said of her : "" She is enormously impressive , politically astute and a strong personality . ""
He told the New York Times : "" At meetings all over the world , she is treated practically like a rock star . ""
Sarkozy is reported to be planning to seek Barack Obama 's support for Lagarde when the leaders meet at the G8 economic summit in the French seaside town of Deauville on Thursday and Friday .
America has by far the biggest say , with 16.74 % of the votes , followed by Japan with 6.01 % , Germany 5.87 % , and the UK and France with 4.85 % .
Other member countries have less than 4 % .
On Wednesday the US treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , said Lagarde and the Mexican candidate for the post , Agustin Carstens , were both "" credible "" figures to lead the IMF , but added he wanted the candidate with the broadest support .
The debt crisis in European countries , including Greece , Portugal and Ireland , has made the IMF 's role overseeing the global financial system – and lending money to struggling nations – even more crucial .
Lagarde said she would not focus exclusively on Europe . ""
No zone has been spared by the financial crisis , "" she said , adding that she would "" serve the fund , not as a European , not as a French person or minister , but as someone at the service of the fund and its members "" .
A decision on whether an inquiry will be held into the Tapie affair will be made in Paris on 10 June , but Lagarde said she had "" total confidence "" and would maintain her candidacy even if an investigation is launched .
"" I have always acted in the interests of the state and in absolute respect of the law , "" she said .
The IMF 's 24-member executive board , representing the 187 member countries , is expected to name a new managing director by the end of June .
If appointed , Lagarde said she would also bring a woman 's touch to the male - dominated corridors of the IMF headquarters in Washington .
In a recent television interview , the French minister expressed the view that men , left to themselves , will usually make a mess of things , a view she reiterated in a newspaper interview . ""
In gender - dominated environments , men have a tendency to show how hairy chested they are , compared with the man who 's sitting next to them …
I honestly think that there should never be too much testosterone in one room . """
2011-05-26,"Should Gordon Brown be considered , let alone picked , to run the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in succession to Dominique Strauss - Kahn ?
When David Cameron gave him the thumbs down on the radio a few weeks ago , I thought the prime minister 's position was wholly defensible .
But plenty of serious people I respect think otherwise and have not hesitated to say so publicly
– this at a time when they have little or nothing to gain from endorsing a man who has no political future in Britain and is n't going to get the IMF plum either .
These matters will doubtless be discussed in the corridors of the G8 summit which convenes across the blustery Channel in Deauville this morning , graced by Barack Obama , who was so shamelessly flattering to our fragile self - esteem all day yesterday .
It must quite have tired him out .
Between them , the European Union ( 32 % ) and the US ( 16.7 % ) have a virtual majority of IMF votes – extra ones are never hard to find among debtor nations – and could settle the vacancy in Deauville , probably in favour of Christine Lagarde , the French finance minister , a highly competent lawyer who speaks perfect English .
But she is not an economist and her CV is not overwhelming .
The Guardian 's Larry Elliott made the case for Britain 's former chancellor and PM on Monday and against his "" shabby treatment "" by Cameron and George Osborne , who are backing Lagarde against non - European claimants .
But Larry is far from alone .
In the Evening Standard , the former World Bank president , Sir James Wolfensohn , praised his record and said it shows Brown has the "" leadership skills , the vision and the determination "" to be an effective MD at the IMF at a very delicate time for the world economy and especially for Europe , which has always dominated the fund .
This week , the FT has run letters from other heavyweights .
The crossbench peer , economist and biographer of Keynes , Lord ( Robert ) Skidelsky , accuses coalition ministers of "" a woeful example of putting domestic politics ahead of the world good "" because Brown is "" by far the best qualified "" candidate .
Skidelsky cites Brown 's role in reversing the slide towards another global depression in 2008 - 09 , his championing of debt relief for Africa , his insistence on rebalancing global current account inbalances ( i.e. being so indebted to the likes of China and Germany ) , and his knowledge of EU finance in the current crisis .
All solid points , though the fourth bumps straight into a problem for Brown which ought to be a plus in the Tory camp – though some argue it killed his prospects within the major EU states from day one .
No guessing which problem , though he rarely gets any credit .
It was Brown 's insistence on five tests of the national interest –
I barely remember them , but that was never the point – before the Labour government would consider taking Britain into the eurozone when it became a hot issue after 1997 .
We would have had to cut public spending , lower interest rates and the exchange rate to enter , and Brown put domestic priorities first .
Was it mere tactics – partly to thwart the pro - euro but economically unsophisticated Tony Blair – that motivated him ?
Or did he grasp that you need a state to run a currency , and that Europe is n't one ?
As the fate of the eurozone hangs in the balance , we can see that now .
It is not yet clear whether the zone will develop into a de facto economic union run by the Germans , will contract to discard troublemakers on the fringe of the "" optimal currency zone "" , or will implode entirely .
So high are the stakes – the EU 's share of global output will have fallen from 25 % in 2000 to 18 % by 2015 , but it still matters – that the union 's case for keeping the job in European ( usually French ) hands is a powerful one , the FT 's Martin Wolf conceded in midweek .
Indeed , he assumes that the Deauville summit will stitch it up for Lagarde .
But Wolf is also frank enough to say that the counter - case being made by non - Europeans or Americans ( both champions of the status quo , which gave them control of the IMF and World Bank after 1944 ) is a better one – namely that the IMF should set up a commission to examine all possible candidates ( India , Mexico , South Africa and others have serious claimants ) and pick the best one .
Moreover , the case that Europe needs to hang on to the job because it needs an IMF chief who understands its problems – 79.5 % of IMF credit was to Europe as of last month , says Wolf , two - thirds of it propping up eastern European economies – is pretty insulting to non - Europeans , who have had to take usually harsher IMF medicine .
In fact , Europe might benefit from unbiased and objective advice – you might call it "" tough love "" – of the kind that Strauss - Kahn , a talented economist and skilled politician , could hardly provide when he had at least one eye on the French presidency .
Where does this leave Brown ?
Sitting quietly next to Blair , listening to Barack Obama in Westminster Hall , as TV viewers will have seen yesterday .
But I detect no signs of anyone suddenly championing his case in the corridors of power .
Lord Desai , the Labour economist and erstwhile Brown buddy , signed another FT letter making the case for a non - European .
Is their disavowal shabby of Cameron and Osborne ?
Does it put petty party politics and personal ill - feeling before the national or EU interest ?
Maybe .
Under both governments lately , the Brits have become increasingly parochial and marginalised in Brussels , focusing energies on the US relationship and the wider world without acknowledging that Europe is often the best ( the only ? ) institution through which to leverage our own ( modest ) power into something bigger .
But their core case against Brown is not lightly dismissed either .
It is that he failed to create a regulatory framework to tame the boom ( so did Washington , and the Tories egged them on ) or lean against the boom in terms of curbing borrowing in the good times ( they embraced his spending strategy until after the crash ) .
But he was in charge at the Treasury , later at No 10 , and as John Major and Norman Lamont – in charge on Black Wednesday – can attest , life is sometimes unfair .
Gosh , we never knew he was interested in the IMF job , William Hague said on TV .
Knew ?
He routinely threatened to walk out on Blair for the IMF during his long decade at No 11 .
Which brings us to the personal factors .
Brown 's persistent disloyalty to Blair – love - bombing him would have been so much smarter – is underpinned by his solitary habits , well - documented in both Brussels and Washington , where diplomats often did not know where their chancellor was .
Not a man for schmoozing would - be allies in corridors , he tended to do his Brussels stuff ( lecturing fellow finance ministers on British economic success ! ) and then fly home to the comforts of his coterie of advisers , not all of whom would now vote for him either if they had a vote .
He was also personally rude to the two Tories , their winning Blair / Brown duo , who were smart enough to oust him from office when chance arose .
From my own observation , Osborne was the only shadow chancellor of the seven who faced Brown across the Commons dispatch box over 10 years who rattled him , often by just teasing .
Not that GB would face the music personally when the Treasury got into trouble – he would dispatch a junior minister .
All in all , and despite his achievements , fairly set out by Skidelsky , I end up in the No camp on grounds of Brown 's personal and judgmental failings , and suspect that plenty of people who have worked closely with him ( and know him better than I do ) now think the same .
Listen , and you can hear their silence .
We ca n't have someone in charge who does n't accept how important it is to bear down on excess debt , Cameron trilled brightly when putting the boot in .
We 're yet to discover how well Dave does on that score .
It could be less well than the glowering Heathcliff of the heather .
Come back , Gordon all is partly forgiven ?
No , not yet , and not in time to do him much career good .
I see Peter Mandelson 's name was touted for the IMF job by Martin Kettle the other day .
The Great Mentioner , as Americans describe incestuous namechecking gossip , is also encouraging Nick Watt to report that Cameron wants Mandy to run the World Trade Organisation .
So do the Chinese , it is said .
Both suggestions are preposterously ethno - centric but , as between Brown and Mandelson ( whose career he did so much to damage ) , in a catfight I 'd put my pennies on M'Lord surviving every time .

2011-05-27,"We can all agree that this has been a terrible few weeks for French masculinity – thanks not only to the off - duty actions of former IMF chief and alleged "" rutting chimpanzee "" Dominique Strauss - Kahn , but also to the moronic , insulting rationalisations offered de haut en bas by highly placed apologists such as Bernard - Henri Lévy and Jack Lang , who 've sounded like scheming bourgeois misogynists from some mid - period Claude Chabrol movie .
Before this grotesque episode , DSK had always reminded me of the great burly , barrel - chested , ugly - beautiful stars of French gangster movies ; you could just imagine him blackmailing Lino Ventura , whom he strongly resembles ( all the more so in handcuffs ) or beating up Yves Montand in some Pigalle pissoir .
Luckily , we can still turn to Gérard Depardieu to redeem this fine tradition of Gallic movie sex symbols resembling bison who 've been punched in the face a hundred too many times .
With his squat , beefy torso and his bashed - in face , that incomparable hooter and his growly street eloquence , he 's the honourable descendent of all those Parisian pugs , from Ventura and Jean Gabin to Jean - Paul Belmondo and the brutish Jean Yanne , down to the current champion , Vincent Cassel .
Depardieu started out like the beautiful , young Ray Winstone – his was a rough - trade kind of beauty – and has ended up more like the mature Michael Gambon , a titan , every scar and wrinkle thrice - earned .
But more than that , even at his fattest and drunkest , he embodies something of the spirit of insurgent , poetically aspirant working - class republican France .
He 's like the male Marianne , having played such national icons as Cyrano , Tartuffe , Danton , Porthos and even Obélix , and the continuity of his career spans the full spectrum and recent history of his country 's cinema .
He has few parallels in other countries .
He started out in the late golden age of post - war European cinema working with Truffaut ( when he was still alive ) and Bertolucci ( when he was still a decent filmmaker ) , starred in Marguerite Duras 's aggressively boring masterpiece Le Camion , and sailed onward through a staggering arc of works by Berri , Sautet , Resnais , Téchiné and Blier , right down to the age of François Ozon and Mathieu Kassovitz .
It 's said that the French will accept Depardieu in anything , as anyone , no matter how fat or miscast .
Truth is , he is good in anything , as anyone , even this week 's genial , small - scale comedy Mammuth .
When Brando got fat , he got lazy ; when Depardieu piled on the pounds , he got busy ( and then dieted ) .
If he 'd gone to Tahiti instead of Brando , he 'd have ended up like Gauguin , not Doctor Moreau .
And if French cinema had a Mount Rushmore , he 'd be on it .
Vive le bison !"
2011-05-28,"Former chancellor Alistair Darling has endorsed France 's Christine Lagarde as his first choice to head the International Monetary Fund , in a further sign of his former boss Gordon Brown 's failure to rally support .
Talking to the Observer , Darling said that France 's finance minister was the best candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss - Kahn . ""
In the field of those who have declared so far , I think she is the best , "" said Darling , who as chancellor had tense relations with Brown .
"" I knew her throughout my three years as chancellor .
One of the advantages she has is that having worked in the United States as a lawyer for many years she is able to see the world through American eyes in a way someone based in continental Europe can not do .
At the same time she is from the eurozone . ""
She has an easygoing manner and she gets on with people exceptionally well .
I remember a meeting of Ecofin [ EU finance ministers ] dealing with the Greek crisis last May and it was her determination that the meeting would not end before there was an agreement , which meant there was an agreement . ""
She is easy for us to work with but on issues where it was France against the others she was French to the core .
She is no easy touch . ""
The current chancellor , George Osborne , has also praised Lagarde as a strong candidate for the job after Downing Street made it clear that it would not be supporting Brown .
Brown has not formally thrown his hat into the ring and has preferred to bide his time to see if support would gather behind him .
Crucially Germany has also come in behind Lagarde , effectively dashing the hopes of its own former finance minister Peer Steinbrück , and former Bundesbank head Axel Weber .
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Lagarde was "" distinguished "" and "" very experienced "" , while finance minister , Wolfgang Schäuble , told the Bild on Sunday newspaper that she was "" outstandingly qualified "" and "" extremely respected and appreciated in the entire financial world "" .
Mr Strauss - Kahn was the fourth Frenchman to have held the IMF 's top job .
He is in New York on bail awaiting trial for sexual assault and attempted rape – charges he denies ."
2011-06-01,"An accusation of child abuse against a former French minister has sparked a major row in the wake of the charges against Dominique Strauss - Kahn for attempted rape .
Luc Ferry , a philosopher and former education minister , told a TV chat show that a former French minister had previously been caught at an orgy with young boys in Marrakech in Morocco .
He said senior government sources , including a former prime minister , had told him about the incident , but would not name the ex - minister involved for fear of libel laws .
Politicians attacked Ferry for making vague allegations .
Rachida Dati , the former justice minister , said if Ferry knew something he must reveal the facts otherwise he risked the offence of failing to report a crime .
The foreign minister , Alain Juppé , said if Ferry – who was in government from 2002 to 2004 – had proof of a crime "" he must go through the justice system "" and not just "" go yacking to the press "" .
A Moroccan NGO for the protection of children said it would file a legal complaint , demanding an investigation .
Under French law , authorities are able to investigate sex tourism or sex crimes committed abroad .
Meanwhile , the philosopher and writer Jean - François Kahn , who was on the talk - show panel with Ferry , told the webiste Arret Sur Images that after the programme , Ferry had given him the name of the former minister , though Kahn refused to reveal it .
On Wednesday , Ferry repeated his claims on TV , but said he had no proof or facts .
Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the IMF and one - time Socialist hopeful for next year 's presidency , has denied allegations that he attempted to rape a New York hotel maid .
He is expected to plead not guilty on Monday .
The case has sparked a wider debate in France on whether the media should do more to investigate politicians ' private lives ."
2011-06-03,"Among a group of women shouting "" We 're all chambermaids ! "" , one softly - spoken 43-year - old was glad to see feminists taking to Paris streets in the wake of the Dominique Strauss - Kahn affair .
The well - dressed woman , who now counsels sexual violence victims , said she had been attacked by a French businessman with political connections but had never pressed charges .
"" I was raped by a powerful man .
I went to the police , they said the pressure would fall on me and I risked being destroyed .
I did n't take it any further .
Victims feel they have almost no voice in France .
We hope that might change now . ""
France now talks about "" before and after DSK "" .
Two weeks since the head of the International Monetary Fund and great Socialist hope for president was arrested and charged with attempting to rape a New York hotel maid , a sexual revolution is underway .
Strauss - Kahn denies the charges against him , but whatever the outcome of his case , it has sparked an outpouring against French sexism and harassment disguised as "" gallantry "" , as well as a new openness about tackling rape .
France always prided itself on a tradition of unbridled sexuality and a society based on seduction , where Jacques Chirac kissed female leaders ' hands and declared that Michèle Alliot - Marie , who served as justice , defence and foreign minister , had "" the best legs "" on the right .
Many argued that the dreaded "" American puritanism "" – the US 's strict laws on workplace touching and harassment – would make France a dull place .
But now the floodgates have opened on women denouncing French machismo .
When Le Parisien reported this week that the sports minister , Chantal Jouanno , avoided wearing skirts in parliament for fear of salacious comments from male MPs , other political women confessed they did the same .
It was n't the Strauss - Kahn charges themselves that caused the backlash .
It was the perceived belittling of rape and sexism of leading French thinkers reacting to his case .
Suddenly France , the land of feminist luminary Simone de Beauvoir , was being lampooned abroad as a macho backwater .
Feminists held street protests and young male politicians rushed to sign a mayor 's anti - sexism petition distancing themselves from what the US media called the reign of the French "" dirty old man "" .
Despite outrage , the Socialist Jack Lang has stuck by his comments that Strauss - Kahn should have been released on bail earlier , considering that "" no one had died "" .
The journalist and philosopher Jean - Francois Kahn dismissed the case as a "" troussage de domestique "" , a phrase suggestive of French aristocrats having non - consensual sex with servants .
He later apologised and quit journalism .
Women politicians are speaking out .
One female Socialist MP wearing trousers and a summer top to a recent commission hearing was reportedly told by a rightwing MP : "" Dressed like that , you should n't be surprised at being raped . ""
The former environment minister Corinne Lepage told Libération she had seen a female MP raise the issue of a rape in parliament and a male MP shout : "" With a face like that it 's hardly going to happen to you . ""
Women politicians complained of jokes , cat - calls , belittling and attempts to chat them up .
Political journalists spoke of politicians who repeatedly texted them , locked them in cars or knocked on their hotel room doors during party conferences .
Sexism in French politics had long been decried , notably in 2007 when Patrick Devedjian , a senior Sarkozy ally , was forced to apologise after calling a female politician a "" salope "" – bitch or slut .
But since "" l'affaire DSK "" feminists hope there is no going back .
The real impact is legal .
Chantal Brunel , MP and head of France 's observatory on sexual equality , said : "" I think the DSK affair will do more to further the cause of women in terms of violence , than any law .
Because today laws already exist on violence , the problem is women speaking out . ""
Rape crisis telephone lines reported an increase in calls in recent days .
Counsellors said the fact the whole country was talking about a sex assault alleged by a hotel worker against a powerful man had broken the "" omertà "" in France , where only one in 10 rapes are reported .
The renowned feminist lawyer Gisele Halimi warned that if the DSK affair had happened in France , it would likely have been hushed up and never reached court .
Nicolas Sarkozy , whose low poll ratings have climbed slightly in recent days , is sensitive to the national mood .
He condemned sexist comments about the DSK case , saying : "" Frankly some things we 've heard we would have preferred not to . ""
Then this week , the civil service minister , Georges Tron , was forced to resign from government after two women , emboldened by the Strauss - Kahn case , filed complaints for harassment , including inappropriate foot massages and groping .
The state prosecutor opened a preliminary inquiry for sexual assault .
Tron denied the allegations and threatened to sue the women for libel .
They told French radio they would not be scared off and would pursue the complaint .
It is unusual for a Sarkozy minister to leave government so fast , particularly before charges are made , but the president could n't risk the effect public opinion .
The former prime minister Jean - Pierre Raffarin said a "" return to morals "" would now be at the heart of next year 's presidential election campaign .
For many , the French culture of sexual conquest is a hangover from the old , monarchic traditions of the Ancien Régime : powerful men seen as having a right to exact sexual favours from subordinates and political leaders held in esteem for their libido .
The commentator Laurent Joffrin warned that France 's "" archaic "" notions and heavy - handed seduction were in fact "" all about holding women in disdain "" .
The historian Dimitri Casali said that in France sex and power had always been linked - Napoleon had 60 mistresses , the Sun King Louis XIV had 300 , but Louis XVI who had erection problems ended up guillotined in the French revolution , he explained in L'Express .
But he said the "" monarchic tradition "" of prizing leaders with multiple sexual conquests "" may now be living its final hours "" .
In numbers 18.5 % of MPs in the French parliament are women , compared to 21 % in the UK , 33 % in Germany and 46 % in Sweden .
Less than a quarter of the French senate is female 19 % The pay gap between men and women in the private and semi - private sector in France 15 % of executives in large French companies are women .
A new law sets a 40 % quota by 2017 75,000 rapes each year in France , but only 10 % of women go to the police .
A woman dies every three days as a result of domesetic violence"
2011-06-03,"If there is one good thing about the Dominique Strauss - Kahn debacle , it is that the scandal has put the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in the global spotlight .
Surprised were many to learn that there has been a longstanding and non - democratic tradition whereby a European always heads the IMF ( and an American heads the World Bank ) .
This has to change .
The IMF should have an open , transparent and merit - based process to choose Strauss - Kahn 's successor .
Given that Europe and the United States did such a poor job in preventing and mitigating the global financial crisis , such a process would most likely yield a managing director from developing countries .
Agustín Carstens , Mexico 's central bank governor , has officially entered the race as "" the "" emerging market candidate .
This week , he kicks off a campaign by traveling to Brazil , Argentina , Canada and Germany .
While a developing country managing director of the IMF would be most welcome , Agustín Carstens ' record epitomises what is wrong with global finance and would send the organisation back to its darkest days .
From 2003 to 2006 , Carstens served as deputy managing director of the IMF .
This is the period when even the IMF admits that it had hit rock bottom .
By the IMF 's own account : "" The IMF 's ability to correctly identify the mounting risks was hindered by a high degree of groupthink , intellectual capture , a general mindset that a major financial crisis in large advanced economies was unlikely , and incomplete analytical approaches . ""
To its credit , the IMF has attempted to become relevant again and move beyond those dark days , and in the past few years has called for new thinking in general , and has specifically loosened its stances on inflation targeting and capital controls .
The new managing director of the IMF must continue down this path if the IMF is to be relevant and effective in the 21st century .
Unfortunately , Carstens has not been able to learn from the crisis and has stuck to the outdated thinking – or as the IMF said "" incomplete analytical approaches "" – that caused the crisis .
Upon leaving the IMF in 2006 , Carstens became Mexico 's finance minister .
Despite the fact that Mexico was among the developing countries hardest hit by the crisis , on Carstens ' watch , Mexico had one of the feeblest stimulus packages and most uneven recoveries from the crisis in the western hemisphere .
In 2010 , Carstens was chosen to head Mexico 's central bank .
Yet , while the IMF had started to preach change , Carstens held Mexico to tight inflation targeting and shunned capital controls .
Relative high interest rates and unchecked capital flows in Mexico under Carstens have choked off credit for the real economy in Mexico , overvalued the exchange rate , and put Mexico at a competitive disadvantage , especially with respect to China .
This steadfast resistance to reflection and change should come as no surprise , given that Carstens is a "" Chicago boy "" .
At the University of Chicago economics department where Carstens got his training , the now discredited theories of rational expectations and efficient markets have long been gospel .
These theories claim that financial markets price assets perfectly and that any government regulation of those markets would drag down the economy .
Moreover , when a crisis does hit , it is natural – and there should not be attempts to recover through government stimulus .
It is clear that "" markets first , regulation last "" has been the rule of thumb for Agustín Carstens for decades .
As he tries to woo other emerging markets , he may change his tune during this campaign .
Do n't be fooled .
The old cliché holds : actions speak louder than words and Agustín Carstens has long been a standardbearer for a "" groupthink "" that has should never again hold sway at the highest levels of global finance ."
2011-06-04,"French finance minister Christine Lagarde is expected to travel to India this week to drum up support for her candidacy as managing director of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , with just days to go for developing countries to unite behind a non - European contender .
In the wake of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's humiliating resignation , the Bric countries , Brazil , Russia , India and China , condemned the long - standing convention that a European runs the Washington - based lender .
But with nominations closing on Friday , they have so far failed to unite behind an alternative to Lagarde , who has the backing of European countries including Germany and Britain .
Russia has proposed Kazakhstan 's central banker Grigory Marchenko , but he has little support outside the ex - Soviet bloc countries .
Agustín Carstens , Mexico 's central bank governor , has put himself forward , but as a Chicago - trained economist is too orthodox for governments hoping for radical change at the IMF .
Jo - Marie Griesgraber , director of the US campaign network New Rules for Global Finance , said : "" What 's depressing is that developing countries ca n't get their act together , frankly . ""
Matthew Martin , of Development Finance International , said he was amazed : "" There are plenty of excellent people who know what they 're doing in developing countries . """

2011-06-07,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has denied attempted rape and the sexual assault of a hotel maid .
The one - time French presidential hopeful , who will face trial over the allegations that cost him his job and sent the IMF into crisis , will be back in court on 18 July .
At a brief hearing at Manhattan criminal court he pleaded not guilty in a strong voice , standing with his defence team and watched by his wife , the millionaire former journalist Anne Sinclair .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers said they needed six weeks to assess evidence collected by the US authorities .
DNA matching Strauss - Kahn 's has reportedly been found in semen on the maid 's clothing and on carpet from his hotel room .
Experts say the defence will probably argue that any sexual contact was consensual .
Among those watching the latest twist in the case were Jay McInerney , author of Bright Lights Big City , and French bestselling author Catherine Cusset .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers say forensic evidence does not support a forcible encounter . ""
In our judgment , once the evidence has been cleared , it will be clear that there was no element of forcible compulsion in this case whatsoever .
Any suggestion to the contrary is simply not credible , "" said Ben Brafman , his lawyer .
Kenneth Thompson , the lawyer representing the maid , said : "" The victim wants you to know that all of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's power , money and influence throughout the world do not keep the truth about what he did to her in that hotel room from coming out .
And that despite the smear campaign that is being committed against her , she is standing up for her dignity as a woman .
"" She 's standing up for her self - respect as a woman .
And she is standing up for all women and children around the world who have been sexually assaulted or sexually abused and are too afraid to say something .
""
The former IMF chief entered court holding hands with his wife as they passed several dozen hotel workers chanting : "" Shame , shame . ""
One of the protesters , from union Local 6 , held a sign that read "" An injury to one of us is an injury to all of us . ""
Strauss - Kahn was released on $ 6 m bail three weeks ago .
He has been staying in a $ 50,000 a month townhouse in Tribeca , Manhattan .
The former IMF boss is wearing a electronic tag that monitors his movements and must pay $ 200,000 a month for a private security team authorised to use force should he attempt to flee .
He is under curfew between 10 pm and 6 am and allowed out only for court , doctors ' visits and religious services .
Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere .
He can receive up to four visitors at a time besides family .
Last month a moving company picked up 44 boxes of furniture , clothes , art and a rug from Strauss - Kahn 's $ 4 m Washington DC home and delivered them to the Tribeca townhouse .
At the time of his 14 May arrest the 62-year - old economist had been considered a leading Socialist contender to run against the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy ."
2011-06-07,"It was their uniforms that caught the eye .
Dressed in traditional black and white or crisp blue , hundreds of hotel chambermaids gathered outside a courthouse on Monday to wait for the arrival of Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
When the former IMF leader appeared , flanked by his billionaire wife and bodyguards , they roared their disapproval , shouting : "" Shame on you . ""
The protesters – almost all women – had come from more than 20 hotels across the city , and were all members of the New York Hotel Workers ' Union , there to support the 32-year - old hotel worker Strauss - Kahn is accused of attempting to rape and unlawfully imprison .
John Truciano , a spokesperson for the union , said they had laid on two buses after workers said they wanted to be at the arraignment .
While , generally , union strength in America may be low , the NYHWU says New York City has the highest proportion of unionised hotel workers in the world , at 75 % , and boasts on its website that the city is "" one of the only places on earth where most hotel workers are not afraid to speak up and demand justice "" .
Since the Strauss - Kahn case hit the headlines , a former chairman of one of Egypt 's major banks has also been arrested on charges of sexually abusing a maid at another Manhattan hotel .
Female workers in the Sofitel hotel , where the attack is alleged to have happened , have asked to be allowed to wear trousers , and the union is planning to talk to the hotel associations about equipping chambermaids across the country with panic alarms .
"" Incidents such as this are very rare , "" insists Truciano .

2011-06-07,"The struggle for the leadership of the International Monetary Fund took on a harder edge on Tuesday as Mexico 's Agustín Carstens lambasted Europe for seeking to impose the French finance minister , Christine Lagarde , on the rest of the world .
Carstens , the governor of Mexico 's central bank , is seeking support from developing countries to succeed Dominique Strauss - Kahn as managing director of the IMF and said it was time to break Europe 's stranglehold on the job .
Urging a fair and open process , Carstens told the Financial Times : "" If emerging markets do n't act in line with our aspirations , we will never get to where we want to be .
If we give in to the European church and treat it as business as usual , things will never change . ""
Applications for the IMF post close on Friday and Carstens said that Europe was not interested in appointing the new managing director on merit . ""
Europeans are not acting in that way ...
Even before we have a final list of candidates , they have made up their minds . ""
Despite raising the temperature in the IMF race , Carstens is viewed with suspicion by some leading developing countries , such as Brazil , who see the Chicago University - educated central banker as too orthodox in his economic views .
His intervention came as Lagarde , the clear frontrunner , continued to seek support for her own bid in a meeting with Indian officials .
Speaking after the latest part of her global tour , Lagarde said the talks had been fruitful .
"" I have demonstrated my merits and it is for them to decide whether I am good enough or not , "" she told CNBC .
Indian authorities , though , refused to say whether they would offer the French finance minister their support .
The finance minister , Pranab Mukherjee , told journalists in New Delhi that India felt the selection should be based on "" merit , competence , and [ be made ] in a transparent manner "" .
Lagarde is now heading to China to drum up support .
Nominations for the top job at the IMF close on 10 June , with the victor expected to be announced on 30 June .
Other potential candidates include South Africa 's former finance minister Trevor Manuel .
Traditionally , the head of the IMF has always been European but this status quo has been criticised by many nations outside the European Union since Strauss - Kahn 's arrest on attempted rape charges in New York and subsequent resignation left the post vacant .
Lagarde , though , is backed by several countries .
A Russian official said on Tuesday her knowledge , education and experience made her "" second to none "" .
As Carstens and Lagarde were seeking support for their candidatures , the Washington - based institution warned that Europe must take tough decisions before the IMF can release more aid for Greece .
Amid expectations that a second bailout for Greece will be announced within weeks , Bob Traa , the IMF 's senior representative in Greece , said the EU needed to do more work before the fund 's board could release more loans .
"" I believe there is a summit in Europe , in June , where some hard nuts need to be cracked .
They need to make some decisions , and then we will go to our board and disburse in early July , "" he told a banking conference ."
2011-06-10,"Choosing a team to root for in this year 's NBA finals has been like deciding whether to let your daughter marry Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Seriously , what do you do if you ca n't stand the Heat – or the Mavericks ?
Consider Miami : the team 's schadenfreude - ometer has been registering radioactive levels since last July , when LeBron James announced his decision to take his talents to South Beach .
In one of the most unctuous hours in television history , James was not only ungrateful in spurning his hometown of Cleveland , Ohio , but he also managed to insult New York and Chicago , with whom he had been flirting .
As far as those three cities are concerned , there 's a middle seat waiting in the Ninth Circle of Hell for "" The Whore of Akron "" ( as Esquire writer Scott Raab has dubbed him )
– right between Judas and Brutus .
As the season unfolded , it looked as if James and Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were a team of simony – sorry , destiny – but the pressure was clearly getting to them .
After a one - point loss to the Chicago Bulls , King James and his court were reportedly crying in their locker room .
Crying ?
With a 43 - 20 record ?
Even LBJ 's old team , the Cavaliers , did n't get weepy this season , and they went on a 26-game losing streak , tied for the worst ever in American sports history .
But then you have the Dallas Mavericks , a team who look at the NBA 's salary cap the same way Suri Cruise sees a shoe sale .
In the past decade , the Mavs have spent $ 851 m on players – nearly a quarter - billion more than the Heat – but they still do n't have a championship to show for it .
Naturally that drought does n't sit well with Dallas 's eternally adolescent owner , Mark Cuban .
The 52-year - old billionaire , who often makes Donald Trump seem shy , is at once the best and worst thing to happen to the NBA .
While his on - court cheerleading is undoubtedly infectious – he 's not just the owner , he 's a fan !
–
Cuban 's diatribes against the league and its officials have cost him nearly $ 2 m in fines over the years – including $ 250,000 after game five of the 2006 NBA finals against Miami .
( Petulant show - off that he is , Cuban matches each fine with a donation to charity . )
But here 's the funny thing : during this year 's finals , Cuban has been silent .
Either the NBA commissioner David Stern finally found a diplomatic solution to the Cuban Whistle Crisis , or Cuban himself wisely found the mute button and decided to let his team 's play speak for itself .
And it 's working .
The ancient Mavericks , led by their 32-year - old warrior Dirk Nowitzki ( who has played with a torn tendon in his left hand and despite a triple - digit fever in game four ) now have a 3 - 2 lead over the Heat as the series heads back to Miami this weekend .
Dallas 's aggressive defense and rainbow three - pointers have so utterly confounded the South Beach Cerberus of James , Wade and Bosh that LeBron looks like a lost puppy on the court .
After calling game five "" the biggest of my life "" , James actually stepped up – particularly since Wade was hobbled with a hip injury in the first quarter – and managed a triple double .
But when the game was on the line , LBJ once again entered the Witness Protection Program .
In the fourth quarter , he scored a whopping two points , bringing his final - quarter total in the series up to an astronomical eleven .
All of which has considerably diluted the Haterade that fans were drinking a week ago .
The Mavericks without The Cuban Show are actually a likeable team of old - timers who deserve a champagne shampoo .
And now that the Chosen One has become the Frozen One , cheering for the Heat almost feels like charity .
Almost .
Ether way , if they do win the title , it wo n't be because of LeBron .
And that 's a crying shame .
The last two games of the NBA season are to be played in Miami on Sunday and Tuesday ( if a game seven is required ) .

2011-06-11,"Lourdes Colón - Santos knew she was in trouble when the guest asked to stay in the room while she was cleaning .
As she emptied the bin in the bathroom , she could feel his eyes burning into her from behind . ""
He was watching me every time I bent down , "" she said .
"" I saw it out of the corner of my eye .
I felt really uncomfortable . ""
Colón - Santos managed to make her excuses that time and leave to clean another room at the luxurious New York Hilton .
But the repugnance of incidents like this prompted her and more than 100 other chambermaids to face down the former IMF head , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , outside court last week .
Pictures of Colón - Santos , her arm outstretched and fist clenched , her face contorted with rage , were splashed across newspapers .
"" Shame on you , shame on you , "" she yelled , as the Frenchman walked into court to plead not guilty to charges of sexual assault and attempted rape . ""
I felt as if I was defending myself , defending my own person , "" she said , later .
"" It could just as easily have been me that this happened to . ""
The woman standing in an identical grey uniform next to Colón - Santos in the photograph was her friend and colleague Ada Vélez Escalera .
She chanted , too , and gave Strauss - Kahn the thumbs - down . ""
It was when he walked out of court and he was smiling , that made me so angry , "" said Vélez .
"" That 's why we look so fierce and passionate . ""
Colón - Santos , 61 , moved to New York from the Dominican Republic when she was 43 .
She has worked at the Hilton for seven years and sends part of her $ 24.19 an hour wages back home to relatives .
Among her colleagues , tales abound of indignities and unreported humiliations .
"" A fellow worker at the hotel was called to a guest 's room , and when she got there he was in the bathroom , naked , in an aroused state .
He invited her to come in and feel it , "" she recalled .
The employee ran from the room .
Vélez , who came to the United States from Puerto Rico when she was 16 to study , has been working at the Hilton for 19 years .
"" We are so proud of the jobs we do .
It 's very physically demanding and on top of that there can be compromising situations , "" she said .
The one "" situation "" she remembers herself involved a travelling businessman who took a liking to her and put a gift out on the bed – a skimpy nightdress and a heap of cash . ""
On day one , I ignored it .
On day two , I ignored it .
On the third day of his stay he made sure he was in the room when I arrived , and he asked me to go out with him , "" she said .
She politely turned him down , explaining she was happily married .
Fortunately , he did not react badly .
Strauss - Kahn 's alleged assault –
he denies all charges – of a 32-year - old housekeeper at New York 's Sofitel six weeks ago has both encouraged hotel employees to speak out and made them more nervous of being attacked .
"" A lot of us do n't speak up .
You 're embarrassed or have a family to support
and you know if it will be you or the guest who 's believed .
In this case she was brave enough to scream for help , "" said Vélez , a union representative for the Hotel Trades Council , which represents more than 80 % of New York 's 10,000 housekeepers – a term
she and her colleagues dislike , while hating being called "" maids "" or "" chambermaids "" .
The alleged victim has taken on a team of civil lawyers but
so far they , she and the criminal prosecutors are focused solely on bringing the former IMF chief to trial .
No plea deals are being discussed and no lawsuit has been filed suing Strauss - Kahn .
"" If it was me personally , I would not take any money .
I would just go for justice , "" said Vélez , 50 .
Strauss - Kahn is expected to argue that the sex was consensual .
Vélez , Colón - Santos and most room attendants think this is incredible and outrageous .
A source close to workers at the Sofitel told the Observer that after the alleged attack , the housekeeper ran sobbing down the hotel corridor : "" She was almost hysterical , screaming and crying .
She was dishevelled .
She was in shock . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers may try to argue that the 62-year - old could not have physically forced the young woman to give him oral sex , as investigators claim happened .
"" Come on .
You would be frightened .
He 's locked the door and you think your life is in jeopardy .
It 's a panic situation , you can be coerced , "" said Vélez .
She said she did not believe that the alleged victim might have offered Strauss - Kahn sex for money , saying this kind of practice did not go on in reputable hotels .
The victim is "" deeply traumatised "" , Doug Wigdor , one of her lawyers , said this weekend .
"" She is still absolutely devastated . ""
Her colleagues all over the city have taken up her cause .
"" I 'm proud of being a room attendant and when guests come to our hotels they need to respect us and know we are there to make their rooms clean and comfortable , not for private service , "" said Vélez .
"" I had to leave my education because I had a sick child .
But the money I 've earned as a room attendant helped me have a house , a decent life and put my son and daughter through college , "" she said .

Puerto Ricans are US citizens ."
2011-06-16,"It has foiled his chances of moving into the Élysée Palace , forced his resignation from one of the stellar jobs in global finance , and sparked debate about the predatory sexual behaviour of the French male elite .
But the alleged attempted rape of a chambermaid by Dominique Strauss - Kahn in a plush Manhattan hotel suite last month may also have compounded Europe 's year - long currency crisis , with the fate of the euro and the continent 's big banks hinging on how – and if – Greece can be saved from sovereign default for the second time in a year .
As intense bargaining continued behind the scenes over Europe 's response to the escalating Greek turmoil , the Guardian has learned that the change in leadership at the top of the International Monetary Fund last month also brought an abrupt shift in IMF style and policy on Europe 's bailout of Greece .
Just as it was becoming clear that last year 's ¤110bn ( £ 97bn ) rescue had failed and that a similar sum would be needed to forestall a Greek sovereign default and a calamitous impact on exposed European banks , the IMF presented the German government with an ultimatum : deliver iron - clad guarantees on a new Greek bailout and put a figure on the sums needed , or there will be no release of IMF funds for Greece next month , risking a default by Athens .
Senior officials involved in the high - stakes negotiations say that the turning point came in the elegant resort of Deauville on the Normandy coast late last month , where Nicolas Sarkozy hosted Barack Obama and other world leaders at a G8 summit .
Strauss - Kahn had stood down the previous week following his New York arrest .
His temporary replacement as head of the IMF , John Lipsky , went to France to force the hand of the Germans , the key players in the bailout drama .
Strauss - Kahn had been a central figure in the euro crisis and had won plaudits for his role as a political fixer , and as a skilled French politician .
Lipsky , an American , was less silky , much blunter .
On the margins of the Deauville summit , he negotiated with the government of Angela Merkel , and with Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium – who will chair yet another crisis EU summit next week as president of the European Council .
Greece is set to run out of money by 15 July unless the fifth tranche of the joint eurozone - IMF bailout , amounting to ¤12bn , is disbursed .
The Guardian understands that Lipsky told the Germans that the IMF would withhold the funds unless Berlin guaranteed a new bailout and named the figure by then .
Merkel has consistently played for time throughout the crisis and always refused to act until the last minute , in the process exasperating the Americans , who take the view that "" in a crisis like this , a massive government response is necessary – act quickly , dramatically , and comprehensively , "" in the words of a senior diplomat in Brussels .
This is the opposite of how Merkel has handled the crisis from the very start .
In the current bind , the Germans again hoped to play for time , and delay a new rescue until September , according to people involved in the Deauville negotiations .
Too late .
Lipsky called their bluff and the Germans yielded through gritted teeth .
"" It was agreed that the IMF will participate in the next tranche , "" said an EU ambassador .
"" It is no longer problematic .
There will be a second rescue .
That 's the agreement – in principle . ""
But in a replay of the tactics that have characterised every episode in the bailout drama of the past year , the Germans , having reluctantly conceded on the big issue , then sought to dictate the terms of the new bailout , picking fights with the French , the European Central Bank , the European commission and Van Rompuy .
Ten days after the Deauville deal , Wolfgang Schäuble , the German finance minister , leaked a letter to his eurozone peers conceding that Greece would go bust by July without a rescue , but insisting that the price for German participation in the new bailout was that Greece 's private creditors had to accept losses on their loans to Athens – the moral hazard argument .
Powerful opponents , led by the ECB , Olli Rehn , the commissioner for monetary affairs , and Van Rompuy , say that seizing the moral high ground might be all well and good , but will actually make a bad situation a lot worse .
It could bring down the Greek banks , have a disastrous knock - on effect on French and German banks , and leave the eurozone contemplating the euro 's demise in its own "" Lehman 's moment "" .
The veteran president of the euro group of countries , Jean - Claude Juncker of Luxembourg , warned that if Greece 's creditors were forced to shoulder losses of ¤35bn – the kind of figures talked of in Germany – the Europeans would need to stump up ¤24bn more to save the Greek banks – robbing Peter to pay Paul .
The result for the past fortnight has been an arcane argument across Europe about restructuring , rescheduling , rolling over or reprofiling Greek debt .
In the more brutal world of the financial markets , this is called a default , whatever the euphemism manufactured by an EU summit .
Diplomats , officials , and central bankers are also desperately devising formulas that might deem the "" haircuts "" for private holders of Greek debt a "" voluntary "" act by the creditors , although senior Brussels officials admit they are not sure how to persuade the banks to volunteer for losses .
Although everyone knows the clock is ticking on the urgent need for a new bailout , the vicious dispute over the detail is unresolved , will probably not be fixed at a flurry of meetings and summits over the next week , and may have to wait until 11 July , when it is crunch time for Greece .
Germany is increasingly isolated and the fallout from a year of culture clashes over Greece and the euro has done immense , probably lasting damage to the EU .
"" It 's been a real political stress test for Europe , "" said a senior EU official .
"" There is support fatigue in the north and reform fatigue in the south .
If it lasts a lot longer , it will really erode the European project . ""
John Lipsky profile John Lipsky smiles and jokes easily in private meetings and in front of the cameras , but as an economist he raises few laughs , especially in Greece .
The 64-year - old interim boss of the International Monetary Fund is closely aligned with the Chicago school of economists whose adherence to free and unregulated markets in the 90s is largely blamed for the financial crisis .
In the 1990s , as chief economist at first Salomon Brothers and then JP Morgan , he rode the stock market boom and lectured countries on fiscal rectitude .
He has made clear he is very different from his predecessor , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who voiced concerns about the lack of jobs created by western governments and the potential for social unrest .
In all his public pronouncements , Lipksy has read the IMF rulebook about cutting public spending to meet debt obligations .
Descended from Russian immigrants , Lipsky was born in Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
He spent 10 years at the IMF before joining Wall Street , then returned to the IMF in 2006 .
His mother saidtold her local newspaper that he took a large pay cut to go back to the Washington based IMF in 2006 .
He has a career chock full of international experience including two years of service as the IMF 's representative in Chile and three years as Salomon 's director of European economic and market analysis group .
He announced his intention to retire a day before Strauss - Kahn was accused of attempted rape .
A week later , he reluctantly agreed to run the organisation as interim boss .

2011-06-17,"Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn , below , told police he had diplomatic immunity shortly after he was detained in New York on accusations he tried to rape a hotel maid , court papers showed .
A redacted timeline of events showed that when police removed him from an Air France flight to Paris just minutes before it was due to depart New York 's John F Kennedy airport on 14 May he asked them : "" What is this about ? ""
When told detectives wanted to talk to him about "" an incident in the city at a hotel , "" , Strauss - Kahn was silent and then , about 15 minutes later , said : "" I have diplomatic immunity "" and asked to speak to the French consulate .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , is under house arrest in New York City and has pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , a criminal sex act , unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching .
He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted .
The former IMF chief , who resigned a few days after his arrest , does not have full diplomatic immunity but IMF rules granted him immunity limited to acts performed in his "" official capacity "" .
The IMF said Strauss - Kahn was in New York on private business .
At about 5.15 pm on 14 May during his transfer to the Manhattan special victims unit , which deals with sex crimes , from the airport , Strauss - Kahn said : "" I need to make a call and let them know I wo n't be at my meeting tomorrow .
These handcuffs are tight , "" he added .
Strauss - Kahn had been due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on May 15 and join euro zone finance ministers in Brussels the following day to discuss the bloc 's debt crisis and how to handle the economic meltdown in Greece .
Later , at the Special Victims Unit , Strauss - Kahn asked to call his lawyer , then asked police if he needed a lawyer .
A detective said he could but added he did n't know if Strauss - Kahn had diplomatic status . ""
No , no , no , I 'm not trying to use that , "" Strauss - Kahn then said .
At 10.55 p.m.
Strauss - Kahn was asked if he wanted to speak with detectives about the hotel incident , to which he replied : "" My attorney has told me not to talk .
I was ready to talk . ""
The timeline , which finishes at 9.50 p.m on 15 May , then shows he only spoke with police to ask for food .
The timeline was provided by prosecutors to New York supreme court judge Michael Obus and Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers on Thursday .
Prosecutors also indicated that they planned to give Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers scientific and medical reports , photographs and drawings and tapes and electronic recordings .
The next court date in the Strauss - Kahn case is 18 July .

2011-06-17,"Germany was forced to agree to bail out Greece for the second time in a year under strong pressure from the International Monetary Fund following the resignation last month of its head , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the Guardian has learned .
Under its acting chief , the American John Lipsky , the IMF has taken a more hardline stance .
The fund warned the Germans in recent weeks that it would withhold urgently needed funds and trigger a Greek sovereign default unless Berlin stopped delaying and pledged firmly that it would come to Greece 's rescue .
Senior officials and diplomats in Brussels confirmed that the IMF threat to pull the plug on its funding , in stark contrast to the more emollient line of Strauss - Kahn , had been defused because of a German climbdown .
As political turmoil continued in Greece on Thursday , with the prime minister , George Papandreou , scrambling to form a fresh government , the stage was being set for a political struggle between Europe 's powerbrokers over the fine print of the proposed new € 100bn - plus rescue of Greece .
Berlin is deeply at odds with France and with the key EU institutions – the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the European commission , the presidency of the EU , and the head of the eurozone , Jean - Claude Juncker , prime minister of Luxembourg – over the terms of a deal .
While conceding the need for the fresh bailout , Berlin is insisting that the banks and other private creditors holding Greek debt take losses as part of the rescue plan , which is expected to amount to € 125bn ( £ 110bn ) , or about € 90bn if the Germans succeed in forcing losses on holders of Greek bonds .
Although international stock markets enjoyed a calmer day on Thursday , Juncker believes that imposing losses on investors could trigger a European version of the Lehman Brothers bank collapse – a so - called "" credit event "" .
Juncker said : "" It 's a really ugly situation .
The [ German ] idea is dangerous .
It could provoke the gravest risk , that all three rating agencies declare a credit event and then there are big contagion risks for other countries . ""
Nout Wellink , a member of the ECB 's governing council , warned that the EU bailout fund would have to double to € 1.5tn if Greece does fail to pay its debts and spreads financial turmoil to other countries .
French president Nicolas Sarkozy goes to Berlin on Friday for a summit with German chancellor Angela Merkel , with the aim of stitching up a compromise .
Under Greece 's first € 110bn bailout , shared by the EU and the IMF , a fifth tranche of € 12bn is to be disbursed next month .
Publicly , the IMF had been threatening to withhold its share of the money unless Greece 's funding gap for 2012 is closed .
But Olli Rehn , the European commissioner for monetary affairs , said on Thursday that the EU and the IMF had agreed to throw Greece the € 12bn lifeline by next month to forestall a default .
Privately , sources said that Lipsky challenged the Germans on the fringes of a G8 summit in France almost three weeks ago , and demanded that Berlin guarantee Greece 's borrowing requirements and put a figure on the pledge .
The IMF ultimatum came a week after Strauss - Kahn , a former French presidential contender , resigned as IMF chief following his New York arrest on charges he denies of attempted rape and sexual assault of a hotel chambermaid .
Berlin blinked , according to participants in the negotiations , and 10 days after the IMF challenge , the Merkel government admitted for the first time that Greece would need a new bailout .
But it stoked further controversy by demanding that Greece 's private creditors take losses on their loans .
Before a series of crucial EU meetings starting this weekend , Berlin looks increasingly isolated in its demands , spelling trouble for Merkel at home , where the rescue of spendthrift eurozone countries is deeply unpopular .
Merkel 's junior coalition partner , the liberal Free Democrats , on Thursday reiterated the need for the banks to take some of the pain in the Greek crisis .
The rescue scenario is also hostage to developments in Greece , with European leaders anxiously eyeing the political turmoil in Athens and questioning whether Papandreou would be able to deliver on his side of the bargain : savage spending cuts and tax increases aimed at raising € 28bn , combined with a € 50bn privatisation programme .
"" We expect the Greek parliament to endorse the economic reform programme as agreed by the end of June , "" said Rehn .
"" We will not let the euro area face any kind of catastrophe . ""
The turmoil sent the euro tumbling to a record low versus the safe - haven Swiss franc , and intensified pressure on the region 's other lower - rated states , highlighted by weakening demand at a Spanish bond auction .
Senior officials in Brussels worried that time was running out .
Papandreou 's attempt to form a government , win a vote of confidence and then drive the austerity package through parliament could take longer than scheduled , jeopardising the planning in European capitals ."
2011-06-27,"François , Martine , Ségolène , Arnaud , Manuel et les autres ...
it could be the title of a film by Claude Sautet .
Less romantic , it 's the line - up for the French Socialist party primaries , a complex process starting on Tuesday .
The Socialist primaries were supposed to be an easy walkover for the party and public opinion 's favourite , IMF director general Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
The carefully staged return home of a man who seemed best suited to lead the country at a time of economic and financial turmoil , collapsed last month in a New York five - star hotel , where he is accused of sexual assault .
Instead of announcing his bid for the French presidency , DSK is fighting to avoid spending the rest of his life in a US jail .
His forced withdrawal did n't have the cataclysmic effect some commentators had predicted .
His fall from grace did n't affect the Socialist party 's standing with the French public , and did n't really benefit outgoing president Nicolas Sarkozy .
It just proved the media were wrong when they predicted the game was over before it had started .
The game is only starting , and is quite open – both within the Socialist party , France 's main opposition party , but also in the 2012 presidential race .
Today , no one would dare dismiss Sarkozy 's chances of success , even if his rejection by voters remains at an all - time low .
Before fighting Sarkozy , the Socialists will have to fight among themselves .
A friendly fight among comrades , of course , but the French left has proved in the past that friendly fire could be as devastating as the enemy 's .
The main contenders will be known with the announcement by the Socialist party boss , Martine Aubry , that she will run , ending a long and useless suspense .
She will join her predecessor at head of the Socialist party , François Hollande , as well as Ségolène Royal , the defeated socialist candidate who lost heavily to Sarkozy in 2007 , who both announced their bids .
Hollande was the surprise of the last few months .
When he declared his candidacy last March , after losing a few pounds , no one took him very seriously .
Even before DSK 's exit , he had established his credibility , and was credited by opinion polls of having the capacity to beat Sarkozy .
His handicap : not having ever been a member of a government – he was managing the Socialist party while his colleagues were running the country .
Aubry does n't have this credibility gap , as she has a better pedigree : several times cabinet minister , including prime minister Lionel Jospin 's number two in the late 1990s ; mayor of the northern city of Lille , which she has successfully transformed ; and leader of the Socialist party in a troubled moment of reconstruction .
On top of it , she 's the daughter of Jacques Delors , the respected former president of the European Commission , who gave up a chance to be France 's president to leave his daughter more space .
Programme - wise , there is n't much difference between Hollande and Aubry , both of them pragmatic socialists .
Leftwing voters in the primaries in October will have to decide : who will be best suited to face Sarkozy , who is a much better candidate than president ; who will be capable of attracting voters from the centre , a key to victory ; and who will be able to bring together the fragmented family of the left , greens included .
It 's a risky prediction , but Aubry seems to be in a better position to be that person .
Her reputation is ambiguous , due to her role in pushing for the infamous 35-hour week , which has left mixed feelings in the country ; but certainly her wide experience , with no equivalent among her rivals , is an asset when the country is facing deep economic , social and moral wounds .
Shall I dare to add that being a woman could also be an asset in the post - DSK era , when feminist issues are back in the forefront of public debate ?
When Hollande described himself as a "" normal man "" to differentiate himself from Strauss - Kahn 's high - profile lifestyle , he may have shot himself in the foot : who wants "" Mr Normal "" to lead their country in abnormal times ?
The stakes are high for French socialists .
They have to prove there 's life after DSK , that their political and moral standing is not affected by the disgrace of their would - be candidate , and that they can offer the country a way out of Sarkozy 's all but inspiring leadership and a real alternative to the populist temptation of Marine Le Pen ."
2011-06-28,"The Socialist party leader , Martine Aubry , has launched her campaign to be France 's first woman president by trying to soften her hard - left image and appeal to centrists disillusioned with Nicolas Sarkozy .
The 60-year - old former labour minister , best known for creating France 's 35-hour week , in a speech in her fiefdom of Lille focused on her "" dream "" to make France a more equal place , not the polarised and gloomy society she said had been left by Sarkozy .
Aubry entered the race after the dramatic exit from political life of former Socialist favourite Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who is facing attempted rape charges in the US .
She tried to appear more determined to lead the nation , after detractors suggested she lacked "" fire in the belly "" and had been reticent to run .
The French left is favourite in the polls to win the presidential election in spring 2012 , and Aubry 's bid marked the start of the Socialists ' first ever US - style primary race to select a candidate .
With Sarkozy 's low poll ratings beginning to modestly rise again , the Socialists must be able to broaden their appeal to the centre and right .
The favourite to win the primary vote in October is François Hollande , a former party leader and centrist who has appealed to the middle class .
But Aubry , traditionally placed more to the left , is catching up with him .
Aubry pointedly launched her presidential bid in Lille , where she is mayor and presents herself as close to the people .
She chose a local cultural centre , a dig at Sarkozy 's famed dismissal of culture and intellectuals during the previous presidential campaign .
Aubry , a fan of classical music and a culture expert , will be relying on the backing of key figures in film and the arts .
Crucially , Aubry 's stage set – a blue backdrop similar to those used by Sarkozy , French and European flags , with Socialist party logos or Socialist bigwigs – was designed to show she was above party politics and not confined by the creaking Socialist party apparatus .
She took a swipe at Sarkozy 's rushed and omnipresent style and his divisive policies that have pitted workers against the unemployed and the French against foreigners . ""
Behind what looks today like energy , but could be seen as restlessness , the reality is unfair policies that solely benefit the most privileged .
It is time that changed , "" she said .
"" I want to give back France its strength , serenity and unity . ""
The northern setting highlighted the Socialists ' biggest challenge for 2012 .
The party has lost the support of the working - class and the old industrial heartlands have recently seen staunchly leftwing areas switch to the far - right Front National .
Aubry also gave a nod to her personal political dynasty –
she is the daughter of Jacques Delors , the former Socialist finance minister and president of the European Commission – saying she had learned inclusiveness from her family .
Also expected to stand in the three - month primary race are Ségolène Royal , the defeated Socialist candidate in 2007 , and several outsider candidates , including the young MPs Arnaud Montebourg and Manuel Valls .

2011-06-29,"For many , the words "" French "" and "" feminism "" sound like a hilarious oxymoron .
But on 23 May , a few days after Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's arrest in New York , thousands of women gathered in Paris to protest against the sexism expressed by ( mostly male ) politicians and men of influence in the French media .
Women of all ages gathered , overcoming the differences that often opposed generations in the French feminist movement .
The scale of the rally was a reflection not only of how big the DSK scandal was but of the force with which French feminism has , over the past few years , risen from the ashes .
La Barbe ( "" The Beard "" – which also means "" enough ! "" or "" boring ! ""
in old French slang ) is emblematic of this resurgence .
Members of the collective appear regularly on the front pages , sporting their fake beards .
With 74 actions under its belt since its inception in March 2008 , and with offspring organisations in Nantes , Toulouse , Niort and even Mexico ( where they 're called Las Bigotonas –
The Great Moustaches )
La Barbe 's MO is to gatecrash high - level political , economic and cultural events every two weeks .
Women wearing fake beards take the stage and stand silently in front of the array of individuals in suits and ties to underscore the pervasive over - representation of men in places where important decisions are made .
They hand out an humorous flyers to the public , congratulating men on successfully keeping "" harpies and gossips "" out of their ranks and maintaining all power within their wonderfully firm male grasp .
On National French Heritage Day , when millions of French spill into the streets to visit monuments and sites of national pride , six women wearing fake beards quietly took the podium at the centre of the senate 's chamber , surrounded by busts of the great men of French history .
Beneath the gold - leafed dome , one of them read aloud from a text eulogising France 's founding fathers , ending with a rousing , "" Long live the France of our fathers , long live La Barbe ! "" before they were dragged away by senate police .
Confused by the activists ' gender , the policemen then stumbled over both male and female pronouns .
Creating confusion is an art at La Barbe .
Media - savvy from the start , La Barbe has thus cajoled the media into reporting on male supremacy .
The bearded activists have also been known to directly target the same media whose attention they solicit : le Nouvel Observateur , Liberation , RTL and RMC Radio , Radio France , Europe 1 , Telerama , France 2 and Telefoot 1 have all been victims of a La Barbe action .
In 2009 , La Barbe erupted on the set of Ce soir ou jamais , a popular talkshow on France 3 , a public television channel .
Six male philosophers were invited to dissect the true meaning of happiness .
A dozen members of La Barbe sneaked onto the set and encircled the panel while two of them took turns reading from an 1863 poem by Eugene Fromentin : "" Happiness is composed of three things on earth which are : sunshine , a woman , and a horse ! ""
They were forcibly ejected by a stunned host , but the message was widely heard : better to have whiskers if you want to be invited .
Over the past month , La Barbe 's actions included crashing Carrefour 's annual board of trustees meeting for the second time , and invading a high - level summit on fishing policy with a slogan that said "" Men and men first "" .
In May , La Barbe teamed up with more mainstream groups such as Osez le Feminisme ( Dare Feminism ) to demonstrate and circulate a petition entitled "" ils se lachent , elles trinquent "" ( men let loose , women pay ) that brought thousands of women of all ages into the streets .
The defence of DSK by the French establishment was heard by feminists as an expression of white male power in French society ."
2011-07-01,"The alleged attempted - rape victim , whose anonymity was protected by the US and British press , was quickly named and her address published in the French media .
She is a widow from the west African , former French colony of Guinea , with a 15-year - old daughter .
She had legal papers in the US and is being held under police protection away from her sparse flat in the Bronx .
She was described in her local community in New York as a good Muslim and hard worker .
She was born in a tiny hamlet in the mountains of Guinea where there was no running water or electricity , and is the youngest of six children .
The French press reported that she had undergone a forced circumcision aged around seven .
She was said not to have been taught to read or write as a child , attending only an Islamic school where she chanted verses .
As a teenager she had married a distant cousin in an arrangement organised by her father .
The groom had been married and widowed before , and died soon after marrying again .
It is unclear whether or not he died from Aids .
The young widow then left to join her sister in New York .
Blake Diallo , the owner of an African restaurant in Harlem , told the press he had spoken to her by phone and that she was deeply upset and said : "" A man has tried to do something very bad to me . ""
He said she had not known who Dominique Strauss - Kahn was , and he had had to tell her himself .
Diallo at first called himself the hotel maid 's "" brother "" before the press deduced he was in fact a friend .
He said the word "" brother "" was a generic African way of talking about a friend ."
2011-07-01,"The events unfolding in the case of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the IMF accused of sexually assaulting a hotel chambermaid , are both surprising and surprisingly not surprising .
The New York Times first reported claims that there were serious problems with the prosecution relating to the credibility of Strauss - Kahn 's accuser , who is originally from Guinea .
On Friday allies of the one - time French presidential hopeful welcomed this speculation , expressing hope for his swift return to the political scene .
But the collapse of this case is not the worst thing that could happen : that would be for us all to retreat into our corners , to retrench our polarised positions .
What is important is what we learn from this global episode , and what dialogue it leads us to .
This is a stream of the questions running in my head all morning .
How do you fight a rape case if you have lied in your past ?
How do you fight a rape case if you have been sexually active ?
How do you fight a rape case as a woman who wants a future in journalism , politics , banking , international affairs ?
How do you fight a rape case and ever hope to be taken seriously again or be perceived as anything other than a raped victim ?
How do you fight a rape case as a woman in places like Congo where there are no real courts and no one is held accountable ?
How do you fight a rape case as an illegal immigrant with no rights in that country ?
How do you fight a rape case if you still believe rape is your fault , if you do n't even know what rape is , if you are afraid of upsetting your boyfriend / husband , or afraid of getting him in trouble because he will be more violent to you ?
How do we get men to stop raping lesbians or independent or highly sexual women as a "" corrective act "" rather than addressing the forces and powers they are truly angry at ?
How do we get men to understand the impact of rape : how the external bruises are internalised and remain for ever ?
How do you speak out against rape and not be called a man hater , a gold digger , a slut ?
How do you convince women to speak out when their character is called into public question ?
How do you speak out against incest or childhood sexual abuse if your mother is sleeping with the man who is abusing you , and you know she loves that man or will not believe you ?
How do you speak out against the adored , handsome , powerful , charming company president / caring psychotherapist / honoured history professor / visionary film director when you risk being despised by those around him ?
How do you speak out against the charismatic leader of the party or country when to do so jeopardises the standing of the party , the country itself , and could let the opposition take power ?
How do you press charges for sexual harassment and not worry about losing your job , or being seen as weak or unable to protect yourself or hang with the guys and "" take a joke "" .
When do we stop separating how we treat women from our vision of a free , equal , just world –
ie how do you call yourself a socialist , an intellectual , a leader , a freedom fighter , an anti - apartheid , anti - racism , pro - earth champion , and not make honouring women a central part of that equation ?
How do we create a real dialogue between men and woman about violence : what it does , how it hurts ?
How do we stop saying that women who are opposed to violence hate sex ?
When do we stop seeing them as the same thing ?
The DSK scandal has rocked the world : it has brought into question issues of sex , power , race , class and gender .
It is not simply a matter of winning or losing this particular case .
The stakes are much higher .
This case is a defining moment , a signifier of the direction we move in – towards transformation or more abuse and loss ."

2011-07-01,"The lifting of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's house arrest amid the New York prosecution 's reassessment of its case for alleged rape has stunned France and revived hopes of his return to politics .
Allies of Strauss - Kahn , who had been the firm favourite to win next year 's presidential race against Nicolas Sarkozy , speculated that his political career could now be saved and he could play a crucial role in the election campaign .
Even before Friday 's court hearing , Socialists expressed their "" joy "" at press reports that prosecutors had questions about the alleged victim 's credibility .
The Socialist MP Jean - Marie Le Guen , a firm ally of Strauss - Kahn , expressed his "" immense joy "" , saying it was "" the end of the nightmare "" for the former IMF head , who would now "" be present in the presidential campaign "" .
He said it was too soon to speculate whether Strauss - Kahn could actually run for president himself .
But Le Guen spoke of his 's friend 's "" rehabilitation "" and said that anyone who had written off Strauss - Kahn should now count on someone who would soon be free and able to look the French public "" in the eye "" .
The Socialist party this week launched its primary race for a candidate on the basis that Strauss - Kahn 's political career was over .
Candidates must declare before July 13 and face a vote in October .
The Socialist Michèle Sabban said : "" If Dominique Strauss - Kahn is cleared , I ask the Socialist party to suspend the primary process . ""
Party spokesman Benoît Hamon said suspending the primary race was "" not the order of the day "" and everything would depend on what happened now in the American justice system .
Martine Aubry , the former Socialist party leader , had intended to back Strauss - Kahn for president before his New York arrest .
This week she declared she wanted to run for president herself .
She said on Friday that "" as a friend of DSK "" she felt "" immense joy "" at the reports .
"" I hope the American justice system will establish the whole truth and allow Dominique to emerge from this nightmare , "" she said .
But she refused to comment on her own presidential bid or whether the Socialist primary race could be changed .
The centrist Jean - Louis Borloo told French TV he did not know Strauss - Kahn 's emotional state but could not see why he could not run for president if cleared .
"" What 's stopping him coming back if he has the strength and desire ? ""
The former Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin described the news as a "" thunderbolt "" .
Jack Lang , the former Socialist culture minister , who had defended Strauss - Kahn throughout , told CNN that if the case were thrown out , the former IMF boss would return to France more popular than before .
He told French radio he had spoken to Strauss - Kahn and his wife , Anne Sinclair , on the day Aubry declared her presidential bid and when Christine Lagarde was appointed head of the IMF to replace Strauss - Kahn .
He said Sinclair had told him : "" It 's really unfair . ""
Bernard - Henri Lévy , the philosopher , who had also fiercely defended Strauss - Kahn , saying he was n't a "" Neanderthal "" , expressed his "" great joy for the man , his family , and for principle "" .
The Socialist Claude Bartolone said he would have loved to have seen the look on the face of Nicolas Sarkozy and the French right on Friday morning , because they had written off the Socialists on a "" moral level "" following the Strauss - Kahn affair .
Jean - Christophe Cambadélis , one of Strauss - Kahn 's closest allies , expressed caution , saying on his blog : "" Let 's allow the American justice system to take its course and DSK to tell his own truth . ""
The question remained whether the French media dissection of Strauss - Kahn 's general attitude to women in the wake of the case , as well as his expensive lifestyle , had tainted any chance of him running for office in France if the charges were eventually dropped .
Strauss - Kahn 's friends had said that he was a "" great seducer "" but that they did not think he was capable of rape .
Commentators had described a "" before and after DSK "" in France , with the case sparking an outpouring against French sexism and harassment disguised as "" gallantry "" , as well as a new openness about tackling rape .
Marine Le Pen , leader of the far - right Front National , said Strauss - Kahn was too "" discredited "" to return to the presidential race .
"" I have said and reiterate that Mr Strauss - Kahn is in my opinion someone who has a problematic relationship to women .
That has been written and said repeatedly , and in my view it disqualifies him from being a candidate for the highest function of our state . """
2011-07-01,"In extraordinary scenes outside a Manhattan courtroom , the lawyer for Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's alleged victim promised the maid would take her cause to the press amid fears that prosecutors may be preparing to drop the case .
Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , was freed from house arrest and had his bail dropped as it emerged that investigators had discovered that his accuser , a 32-year - old Guinean - born maid , had lied about a previous rape claim .
They also uncovered evidence that appeared to cast doubt on key elements of her account , and seemed likely to do deep damage to her credibility as a witness .
But her lawyer , Kenneth Thompson , repeated her account , including highly graphic details of the alleged sex attack , and said she now wanted to speak out in front of the press .
He said there were photographs of the victim 's "" bruised vagina "" and medical evidence of other injuries , and evidence of semen that the victim had spat out into the room . ""
He grabbed her vagina with so much force he hurt her , "" he said .
"" She is going to tell you what Dominique Strauss - Kahn did to her , "" Thompson said .
"" The victim will stand before you . ""
He went on to say that her story held up , despite astonishing revelations that she had lied to prosecutors about a whole series of events , including her movements after the alleged attack and her links to a possible drug dealer , as well as apparent evidence that she was seeking financial gain . ""
The only defence that Dominique Strauss - Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual .
That is a lie , "" Thompson said .
But the developments represented a huge boost to Strauss - Kahn .
In court with his wife , Anne Sinclair , he thanked judge Michael Obus as his previously strict bail conditions were lifted , in effect removing him from house arrest .
Though the court did not give him back his passport , Strauss - Kahn is free to travel around the US without bail conditions .
In a brief court hearing , prosecutors filed papers detailing some of the new findings .
Strauss - Kahn then walked out of the court and into a waiting car .
Strauss - Kahn 's arrest for attempted rape on 14 May led to him losing his job at the IMF and his position as a leading possible presidential contender for the Socialist party in France .
He was confined under effective house arrest in Manhattan and the episode prompted a bout of soul - searching in France as other people came forward with salacious and disturbing details of Strauss - Kahn 's apparently prolific womanising .
Legal experts believe the developments will now see the charges reduced to a misdemeanour , while the defence team push for them to be dropped altogether . ""
The next step will be a complete dismissal , "" said Benjamin Brafman , Strauss - Kahn 's lawyer .
The discoveries reflected a sudden lack of confidence that prosecutors would be able to convince a court about what the hotel maid said happened between herself and Strauss - Kahn in his room at the Sofitel .
After she alleged that he sexually assaulted her , New York authorities swept into action , arresting Strauss - Kahn as he waited to take off on a flight to Europe .
But now the court battle may not happen at all .
Prosecuting lawyers have concluded that the maid has lied repeatedly in their dealings with her .
A letter filed with the court detailed how prosecutors believe she lied over claims she was gang raped when she submitted a claim for political asylum in the US .
The letter said she had admitted to them the claims were not true .
The letter also said she did not tell the truth about her behaviour following the alleged assault by Strauss - Kahn .
Initially , she told investigators she had hidden after the attack until she saw her alleged attacker leave and then reported the assault to a supervisor .
But the letter said that was not true and in fact she cleaned a nearby room and then also cleaned the room in which the alleged attack took place .
The New York Times has also reported that police tape - recorded a telephone conversation between the woman and a man in prison on the day of the alleged rape in which she talked about the possible financial benefits that could come to her as a result of pursuing charges .
The investigation also found deposits made into her bank account totalling $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) over the last two years , some of which came from the man , a convicted drug dealer .
James Cox , law professor at Duke University , said : "" This has got to be the prosecution 's worse nightmare .
You do what you think is right and then your witness goes south on you . ""
He said the prosecution was right to act decisively and quickly on the case when the charges were brought and could not be blamed for the media furore that followed .
"" You can not have a chambermaid bringing allegations against an aristocrat like Strauss - Kahn without there being this kind of frenzy , "" Cox said .
But given subsequent developments he was surprised that the prosecution had not done more homework on their witness before making such strong statements about the case and the strength of its witness .
Others said the developments did not mean Strauss - Kahn would avoid all charges .
Professor John Coffee of Columbia Law School said : "" This does not exonerate him . ""
Strauss - Kahn had been expected to run for the French presidency after stepping down from his post as managing director of the IMF , one of the most important roles in world finance .
But after his arrest he was forced to resign from the IMF .
The job has just been filled by the French finance minister , Christine Lagarde .
These new developments could leave the way open for him to return to French domestic politics , with France 's former Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin describing the news as a "" thunderbolt "" .
The handling of the Strauss - Kahn case is likely to lead to criticism of New York prosecutors and questions over their handling of the case , especially the now notorious "" perp walk "" , which saw Strauss - Kahn paraded in front of press cameras ."
2011-07-01,"Reports that the New York prosecution case for alleged sexual assault against Dominique Strauss - Kahn could be close to collapse have stunned France and revived hopes that he may return to politics .
Allies of Strauss - Kahn , who had been the firm favourite to win next year 's presidential race against Nicolas Sarkozy , speculated that his political career would be saved and he could play a crucial role in the election campaign .
Even before a court hearing in New York on Friday at which Strauss - Kahn 's bail conditions may be relaxed , French Socialists expressed their joy at reports that New York prosecutors had serious questions about the credibility of his accuser .

He wrote on his blog : "" If the information coming out of New York is confirmed by the court hearing today , there 's reason for us to start smiling again .
But let 's allow the American justice system to take its course and DSK to tell his own truth . """
2011-07-02,"Whatever happened in suite 2806 of the Sofitel New York on 14 May between the wealthy aristocrat and the immigrant chambermaid – and lawyer Kenneth Thompson continues to claim his client was a victim of sexual assault –
it 's as if both parties have been found guilty and that can not be good for justice .
The initial rush to judgment of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , former head of the International Monetary Fund , potential French presidential candidate , with a reputation as a "" great seducer "" , and the exposure of his highly predatory proclivities is now matched by the current avalanche of information about the character , conduct and credibility of the 32-year - old maid who has accused him of rape .
The French media have stripped away her anonymity and published intimate details of her childhood and life .
Yesterday , the New York Times drew on a letter to the defence from prosecutors released on Friday and interviews with "" well - placed "" law enforcement officials to give in extraordinary detail the prosecutors ' investigation and the maid 's questioning over hours in the district attorney 's hopefully aptly named Public Integrity Unit .
The New York Times describes how the prosecutors ' view of "" a very pious , devout Muslim "" , the ideal witness ( since rape is the only crime in which a preferred requirement is that the alleged victim have an unrealistically unblemished personal history ) has emerged as a serial liar .
In question is her experience in her homeland of Guinea , her finances ( bank records allegedly show deposits of thousands of dollars ) , her immigration status , her actions after the alleged attack and the company she keeps .
A phone call to her jailed boyfriend conducted in "" a unique dialect of Fulani "" was recorded .
She is alleged to have said words to the effect : "" Do n't worry , this guy has a lot of money .
I know what I am doing . ""
Her lawyer points out that in the conversation , his client also sticks to her original story of the circumstances of the alleged assault .
In the UK , much of this information would be deemed sub judice and not offered up for public consumption for fear of damaging the chances of a fair trial .
In the US , the scales of justice do not seem so well protected .
The case has also exposed a not unfamiliar tale of how men of power and influence may have integrity in office , but there is little osmosis of that virtue into their private lives : the personal is not political .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn has had his bail conditions removed and he is released from house arrest .
It remains to be seen whether he will be exonerated .
Meanwhile , his accuser may have her day in court but not as expected .
She could face a charge of perjury and jail .
Everyone has so far paid a price .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn has lost his job and , for now , an opportunity to lead his country .
But for the loyalty and resources of his wife , Anne Sinclair , he could also have lost his liberty and his marriage .
In tandem , the new life the woman from Guinea has tried to build in the US for herself and her 15-year - old daughter has been utterly demolished .
For both the accuser and the accused , the presumption of innocent until proved guilty is buried somewhere deep in the rubble ."
2011-07-02,"The extraordinary battle over the sexual assault allegations against Dominique Strauss - Kahn has now moved away from the court and into the field of public relations , with fresh and damaging stories appearing yesterday in New York newspapers about the woman at the heart of the allegations .
In the wake of dramatic developments on Friday , when prosecutors admitted they had uncovered lies told by his hotel maid accuser , the fight over exactly what happened in the hotel room of the former International Monetary Fund chief will take place in the media as much in the courtroom .
The maid 's lawyer , Kenneth Thompson , fired the first shots by declaring that his client would shed her right to privacy and soon go to the media to tell her story .
He then repeated her version of events in front of hundreds of journalists and live on TV , with references to her "" bruised vagina "" and a description of how she spat Strauss - Kahn 's semen over the floor and walls of his room after the alleged assault . ""
The victim will stand before you , "" he told the news conference .
Certainly , there would be a huge appetite in the global media for a set - piece interview with the 32-year - old Guinean - born woman .
It would represent a potentially damaging PR experience for Strauss - Kahn and his expensively assembled team of lawyers , who have a lot of expertise in waging celebrity trials .
It might also encourage Strauss - Kahn 's team to consider a plea deal on lesser charges in order to halt the damaging wave of publicity , and pave the way for Strauss - Kahn to return to French politics , and perhaps even campaign for next year 's presidential elections .
But the PR battle has another side .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers have sought advice from a leading Washington consultancy , TD International , which is run by former CIA officers and American diplomats .
Sources close to Strauss - Kahn 's team have been leaking gossip and information to New York reporters .
Yesterday the conservative tabloid newspaper the New York Post blared out a story alleging that the maid was a prostitute placed at the Sofitel by her labour union .
The story was sourced only to someone close to Strauss - Kahn 's defence and presented no evidence to back the claims .
The union involved called the story "" absurd "" .
The New York Times has also been leaked sensitive information about the maid and her phone calls to various people in jail that has not yet been presented in court .
The details , which include claims she talked about potential financial gain from the case , could also damage the accuser 's story .
However , at the same time Strauss - Kahn did not help his public image by celebrating his first night of freedom with a fancy meal of pasta and truffles at a high - end Italian restaurant in Manhattan .
Faced with that sort of PR gaffe , experts believe that even Friday 's legal developments have still left him with a serious image problem .
"" When the debate is between those who accuse you of rape and those who defend you as a mere disgusting cad , your image problems have not emerged from critical care , "" wrote New York Times blogger and columnist Michael Powell .
Both sides are playing a high - stakes media image game as the sexual assault case has essentially become a "" he said/ she said "" tussle and turned into a battle over reputation .
Many legal experts believe that could be damaging to future trials where rape allegations are raised .
Defendants , already traumatised by their experiences , could be reluctant to go to trial out of fear that their personal lives would be pored over by defence lawyers keen to sully their character rather than fight a case on the facts .
"" It is going to mean that women are less likely to report an attack if all their past life is going to be put under the microscope , "" warned Professor John Coffee of New York 's Columbia Law School .
But the real target of both sides in the case is not the general public .
It is the prosecution lawyers and their boss , the Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance .
Thompson said he believed Vance was wavering in his prosecution of the case after Friday 's revelations , in which it was revealed that the maid had lied about a previous rape claim , had links to suspected drug dealing and money - laundering and gave an inaccurate account of her behaviour after the alleged assault .
"" We believe the DA is laying the foundation to dismiss this case and we do n't agree with that , "" Thompson said .
"" The DA has an obligation to stand up for this rape victim . ""
Vance has denied any such plans , though Strauss - Kahn 's team have vowed to move to have all the charges dropped .
Instead legal experts believe an initial step in the coming weeks might be to try to persuade Strauss - Kahn to plead guilty to a much lesser misdemeanour charge , which will carry little penalty and be akin to some form of confession of sexual harassment .
However , legal sources said Strauss - Kahn 's team were not currently interested in a plea deal .
The case is turning into a major headache for Vance , whose office is already reeling from a disastrous attempt to prosecute two New York policemen for an alleged rape against a drunk woman in Manhattan 's East Village .
That ended with the rape charges being dropped and the head of Vance 's sex crimes unit eventually stepping down .
With the Strauss - Kahn case , Vance is staring at a toxic mix of class and race in another high - profile sex case .
Pitting one of the most powerful white men in the world against a poor , black , female asylum seeker was never going to be straightforward , but with the credibility of the witness undermined , it is becoming a minefield .
Prosecution lawyers , especially those facing a defence team like that assembled by Strauss - Kahn , tend to fear putting a witness whose past claims can be shown to be false on the stand .
The fact that she has admitted falsifying elements of a previous claim of rape is seen as especially damning .
"" The evidence is growing that she ca n't be trusted , "" Coffee said .
"" That can change the perception of a jury . ""
Experts have compared the situation with the infamous Duke University rape case in 2006 , when young , white , student lacrosse players were accused of rape by a poor , black stripper they had hired for a party .
The allegations eventually collapsed as the accuser 's testimony was shown to be false and it led to the disbarment of the district attorney who brought the case .
"" It 's no wonder that prosecutions back off when the witness starts to look unreliable , "" said James Cox , a law professor at Duke University .
That possibility has angered Thompson , who insists that his client has not changed the essential story of her assault even as the veracity of her statements about her past have collapsed .
That story , he says , is backed up by forensic evidence of a violent sexual assault which includes photographs of her bruised genitals and medical testimony of an injured shoulder , as well as torn clothing .
"" From day one the victim has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss - Kahn committed against her .
She has described that sexual assault many times … and she has never changed a single thing about that account , "" he said ."
2011-07-02,"French Socialists were in chaos as key figures speculated whether Dominique Strauss - Kahn could return to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential race next year , throwing the party into another round of instability and internal ego - clashes .
Strauss - Kahn was the clear favourite to win the 2012 presidential election before he was arrested for allegedly attempting to rape a New York hotel maid in May.
He is no longer under house arrest , but still faces seven charges ranging from attempted rape to sexual assault .
If he is cleared or charges are dropped , supporters such as former culture minister Jack Lang suggested he could return to France more popular than ever before .
Strauss - Kahn 's possible return has thrown the Socialist party 's primary race into disarray .
The party had presumed his presidential hopes were dead and opened its selection process for another candidate last week .
Candidates must declare by 13 July for an October vote , but Strauss - Kahn 's next hearing is scheduled for 18 July .
Current front - runner François Hollande was the first to declare this weekend that he had "" no problem "" with pushing back the declaration date until the end of August , allowing Strauss - Kahn to return from New York if charges were dropped quickly .
But the party 's interim leader , Harlem Désir , snapped back that there did n't seem to be "" any reason "" to move the deadline .
The row has weakened Martine Aubry , who declared her presidential bid last week , but had a pact with Strauss - Kahn and could be pressured to stand aside for him .
All depends on whether the prosecution maintains its case and goes to trial or quickly drops charges against Strauss - Kahn , and if so how the French public and opinion polls perceive him .
Even while the charges still stand , some French supporters presented him as an innocent victim , hero and martyr .
Left - wing philosopher Bernard - Henry Lévy spoke of a noble man who had been the victim of a "" spiral of horror and calumny "" .
He told Le Parisien that Strauss - Kahn had been "" lynched "" by the "" friends of minorities "" in the US .
He said that because the victim was "" poor and immigrant "" she had been presumed innocent , and because Strauss - Kahn was "" powerful "" he had been presumed guilty .
Sylvie Pierre - Brossolette , political editor of the weekly Le Point , felt "" anything is possible "" .
A returning Strauss - Kahn might be seen by the French as "" hero "" mistreated or "" humiliated "" by the American justice system .
Much would depend on whether French left voters still saw him as a "" saviour "" against Sarkozy , she wrote .
But while many Socialists felt DSK could return triumphant if totally cleared , others worried about the stain the case would leave on French politics and the damage done by revelations about his private life and his attitude to women .
Since his arrest , a French taboo has been broken and Strauss - Kahn 's behaviour towards women , deemed "" libertine "" by his friends , has been raked over .
Socialist Anne Mansouret , who said she regretted dissuading her daughter , journalist Tristane Banon , from pressing charges over an alleged sexual assault in 2002 , had said Strauss - Kahn had a "" problem "" with women which could be seen as a sickness .
Strauss - Kahn seemed not to be worried about his political image on Friday night when he went out for a $ 100 bowl of pasta with friends , casting aside the controversy in France that he should tone down his image of "" champagne socialism "" .
Socialist MP Marisol Touraine , a key DSK ally , said she hoped for Strauss - Kahn 's "" rehabilitation "" but warned that he would not be able to return to a "" status quo "" in France as if nothing had happened .
Gérard Collomb , the mayor of Lyon and Strauss - Kahn supporter , warned that Strauss - Kahn should first "" rebuild himself "" before a possible return to the presidential race , warning that no one emerged from such a case "" unscathed "" .
Pollsters cautioned that Strauss - Kahn 's return would be shaped by whether the American justice system cleared him or whether charges were dropped , leaving doubts .
Pascal Perrineau , of Paris 's Institute of Political Science , said that if Strauss - Kahn was cleared of all suspicion , his return to France could still be complicated .
"" If a strong doubt persists over his behaviour , and even if that behaviour is n't as criminal as was once suggested , a return [ to politics ] seems really very difficult , "" he told Reuters .
Gerald Bronner , a sociologist at Strasbourg university , said : "" This case has allowed another image of Strauss - Kahn to be put forward in French public opinion .
The public was n't informed of the slightly libertine side of his personal life . ""
Jean Veil , Strauss - Kahn 's French lawyer , said : "" He will speak once he 's in France and cleared of all suspicion . """
2011-07-03,"France is divided over Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's possible return to public life , with 49 % of voters saying they would like to see him back on the political scene .
But even his allies concede that he would be returning to a country that is much changed .
The feminist uproar against machismo , sexism , harassment and what one commentator called the "" misogynist reflexes "" of France sparked by Strauss - Kahn 's arrest in May shows no signs of abating .
In the seven weeks since the Socialist presidential hopeful was charged with attempted rape and sexual assault , French society has undergone massive soul - searching in its attitudes to women .
It was not the DSK case itself that sparked feminist street demonstrations but comments by the French elite , perceived as belittling both rape and women .
Caroline de Haas , head of the group Osez le Feminisme , said : "" The DSK affair showed that women were fed up with inequalities and machismo of French society . ""
That anger will continue , she warned .
More than 40 feminist groups on Sunday held the biggest conference on women 's rights in a decade , with 600 activists present .
Some said interest in the feminist cause had been boosted by the DSK affair , which had sparked a surge in calls to rape - counsellors in France .
Others hoped that doubts over the credibility of the New York maid in the case would not put off other women from reporting rape .
According to a poll for Le Parisien newspaper , 60 % of leftwing sympathisers want a political comeback by Strauss - Kahn , the Socialist once tipped to beat Nicolas Sarkozy and win the 2012 presidential election .
Pollsters are now expected to dissect whether , regardless of the outcome of the case , his popularity among Frenchwomen will have fallen steeply , as some commentators predict .
Although free from house arrest , Strauss - Kahn still faces charges of attempted rape and sexual assault .
Both sides accept a sexual encounter took place in his New York hotel suite on 14 May –
his lawyers say it was consensual , the hotel maid 's lawyers say it was a brutal sex attack .
Stéphane Rozès , head of the political consultants CAP , said whether Strauss - Kahn could return would depend on whether he was cleared of all charges and specifically "" what explanation is given by the judge "" .
He said France had been "" traumatised "" by the case , but one clear change in French life had been a new confidence among women to speak out about sexism and allegations of sex crimes .
He said perception of Strauss - Kahn 's political competence had not changed among voters but his perceived "" presidential standing "" had been dented among both women and men .
However , France would not now begin judging politicians "" based on their private lives "" , he argued , unless their behaviour was criminal .
But Le Monde on Sunday showed some taboos had been broken , running a portrait of Strauss - Kahn with personal details that would have been unthinkable two months ago : former advisers and MPs dissected his philandering , womanising and what the paper called a "" fatality of temperament "" , "" taste for pleasure and risk "" and a confidence he would n't get caught that verged on "" amorality "" .
The paper detailed how when an adviser warned him about a 2003 story about involvement in an orgy at a swingers ' club he replied : "" You 're just jealous . ""
In April , he had told reporters from Libération : "" Yes , I like women , so what ? ""
The paper said very few of his advisers dared warn against his thrill - seeking .
Chantal Jouanno , the sports minister who admitted that French politics was so sexist that she dare not wear a skirt in parliament , told Europe 1 radio : "" He has n't presented a very positive image , between his taste for luxury and other subjects . ""
The attitude towards alleged sex crimes in French politics seems to have been transformed .
Last week saw parliamentary immunity lifted from Georges Tron , the former civil service minister whom President Nicolas Sarkozy forced to resign over sex assault allegations not long after Strauss - Kahn 's arrest .
Tron has now been charged with rape and sexual assault relating to allegations that he attacked women who worked for him in his role as mayor in Draveil , south of Paris , for Sarkozy 's UMP .
The women said they were emboldened to come forward after the Strauss - Kahn affair .
Tron denies the accusations . ""
Without the psychodrama of New York , would Tron 's accusers have spoken out ?
And would Nicolas Sarkozy and [ the prime minister ]
François Fillon have ejected a personality who had become a nuisance ? "" asked the political writer Bruno Dive in Sud Ouest .
This week the Socialist party will decide whether to expel the senator Jacques Mahéas , who was convicted of sexual harassment last year .
Socialist politician Pierre Moscovici said that Strauss - Kahn was not yet considering a political future in France but was trying to restore his honour after "" worldwide humiliation "" ."
2011-07-03,"The prosecution of Dominique Strauss - Kahn is in jeopardy because of "" major holes in the credibility "" of his accuser .
This is a typical defence .
A woman who reports rape is expected to have a virginal past to qualify as a credible rape victim .
Often more resources are spent investigating the woman than the man she is accusing , especially if he is rich and powerful and she is not .
Several women we work with who reported rape have been put under covert surveillance , with hidden cameras and phone tapping , their sex lives scrutinised .
Some were accused of being bad mothers , of being either promiscuous or loners looking for attention , of hating men or being desperate to catch one .
Most were working class and/or women of colour .
The question , however , is relevance .
Kenneth P Thompson , the woman 's lawyer , points to forensic medical evidence that supports the woman 's account of what happened .
He dismisses minor contradictions as the result of hours and hours of exhausting interviews .
The best lawyers money can buy say DSK 's accuser lied in her immigration application , is a prostitute and is involved in drug - dealing .
How is this relevant to her allegation of rape ?
They say that she never told the authorities about suffering female genital mutilation in her asylum claim , but has since spoken of it .
Some media are suggesting that she may now face deportation .
We see dozens of asylum - seeking women every month who have been raped in their home countries .
Women are accused of lying if they did n't tell the authorities every single detail when they first arrive .
But many are deeply traumatised .
Which of us would confide in a man in authority when we enter a foreign country of which we know little or nothing ?
Far from embellishing and exaggerating sexual violence , most women applying for asylum minimise it , avoid it , hide it .
That is typically what victims do who have suffered rape and other types of torture – they can hardly bear to revisit the pain and the humiliation ; some are actually unable to find words to describe what happened to them .
But why is a woman 's credibility relevant to a charge when that of the accused is not ?
Does that mean a rape charge can be dismissed ?
Other women with much more social power have accused DSK of being a sexual predator , of abusing his position as one of the most powerful men in the financial world and of attempted rape .
So this is what victims of rape face : a criminal justice system where prejudice and politics may shape the investigation and any trial – and even determine the outcome .
This high - profile case first inspired relief among women , particularly among rape survivors , as if a long - buried wound was finally coming to light .
One in four women in the UK suffers rape ; over 90 % of rapes are never reported ; and of those reported only 6.7 % result in a conviction on a charge of rape .
On the SlutWalk march people cheered at the "" We are all chambermaids "" placards .
And at our protest outside the Crown Prosecution Service last Friday , over half a dozen women spoke out about the catalogue of obstruction they had faced when trying to get their rapist prosecuted .
There was a protest of hotel maids in uniform outside the court where DSK appeared in New York , mostly immigrant women of colour .
They felt strongly about the allegations because they know well the unwanted advances of the rich and powerful whose toilets they clean .
If the prosecution against DSK is dropped , the age - old myth that women , not men , lie about rape will prevail once more .
But women 's fury – in New York , in Paris , in London , everywhere – at our inability to get justice on rape , and at the sex , race and class bias of the law , can no longer be repressed ."
2011-07-03,"Rape victims around the world may be more fearful of reporting their experiences as a result of the apparent implosion of the case against the against the former IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn , UK women 's groups warned .
Campaigners warned that doubts about the credibility of the New York hotel worker who accused Strauss - Kahn of sexual assault on 14 May may make victims fear that only "" perfect victims "" could report rape and receive justice , and may lead to fewer women reporting sexual attacks . ""
The message that this case gives is that , as a society , we still carry notions of a what a perfect rape victim should look like , and what ' real rape ' is , "" said Holly Dustin , manager of End Violence Against Women .
"" Rape victims can be less than perfect , they can have insecure immigration status , they can be prostitutes – and they can still be raped .
This sends the message to women around the world that unless you are a perfect victim the system will eat you up and spew you out . ""
The case , which centres on allegations that Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted a hotel chambermaid after she entered his room to clean , appeared to be imploding after new and damaging stories appeared in New York newspapers about the woman at the heart of the allegations .
Reports on Friday suggested that prosecutors believe they have uncovered lies told by the 32-year - old Guinean - born woman and that she cleaned two rooms , including that of Strauss - Kahn , after the alleged attack , rather than reporting the incident to her supervisor immediately as she originally stated .
After Strauss - Kahn hired a team of private investigators allegations also emerged that she made a phone call soon after the alleged rape attempt to a man in prison for drugs violations , in which she talked about possible financial gains to be made from pressing charges , and that she had received cash deposits into her bank account over the past two years .
Questions were also raised about her asylum application to the US .
Dustin said the fallout from the fresh allegations could have a negative impact on potential jurors in rape cases , the media and the general public .
"" Women will look at how this woman has been treated and think their credibility will be attacked in the same way .
It reinforces those notions about what a rape victim needs to be to see justice . ""
Rapes were already severely under - reported , she said .
"" The vast majority of rapes , around 80 - 90 % , of rapes go unreported in England and Wales , and of those reported rapes only 7 % result in convictions .
"" Fiona Elvines , operations co - ordinator at Rape Crisis South London , said although improvements had been made to the investigation of rape , there was still a lack of understanding of the impact of the crime on women who survived it . ""
Yet again another message goes out to the thousands of women in this country alone who are currently debating whether or not they should report the violence that has been perpetrated against them , that they will be the ones on trial , "" she said .
Strauss - Kahn 's bail , which included $ 1 m surety , electronic tags and 24-hour armed guards , has been removed since doubts emerged about the hotel worker 's statements .

2011-07-03,"I am sitting in my garden with a cup of coffee and a pile of newspapers , bringing you the stories I hope will be of interest .
I have my usual selection : News of the World
so I can see who is n't having sex with whom ; the Sunday Times for the reviews and supplement : Mail so I can shout about Liz Jones ; and of course the Observer for familiarity and good all - round news reporting .
One story leaps out at me – the Dominique Strauss - Kahn case ( he is facing charges of attempted rape of a maid in the hotel he was staying in ) .
The Times ( p17 ) asks : "" Will the ' rutting chimpanzee ' run for president ? ""
The report gives an account of the emerging evidence being used to undermine the credibility of the complainant , the most damning of which is the alleged false asylum claim , in which she put forward the case that she had been gang - raped in her home country of Guinea and coached to tell the story .
Whatever the truth of this case , it has to be acknowledged that rape complainants often have their reputation decimated by the defence .
It is a nasty strategy , and is one of the reasons so few women come forward to report rape and why so many accused are acquitted .
The Times reports on the prosecutor 's assertion that there is abundant physical evidence to support the maid 's case against DSK .
It goes on to consider whether DSK can still be considered a serious contender in the French presidential elections , and makes references to three other presidential contenders over the years who have risen from such allegations to maintain their political power .
The Observer examines the way in which the rape trial has almost been played out in the US media .
Many reporters have dug up all sorts of dirt on the maid .
There is no question that , if the case were to come to court , the prosecution would attempt to tear her apart .
It highlights the power differences between DSK and the maid .
The "" slur "" on the reputation of DSK amounts to the accusation that he is a "" great seducer "" as a compliment , whereas the accusations regarding the accuser , and the fact that her anonymity has been stripped by the French media , are anything
but .
The MoS has a tiny piece headed Strauss - Kahn maid is "" vice girl "" .
A "" source close to the defence team "" claims that the complainant sold sex to male guests at the hotel .
In true MoS style there is no counterbalance to the story .
The NotW does not cover the DSK case , which is surprising considering it is about sex , sleaze and accusations of prostitution – but it does , again surprisingly , run a story on the BBC gender pay gap .
Figures from the Screws ' own research found that "" there are twice as many men on more than £ 100,000 at the corporation , and men 's average pay is £ 41,816 , while it is only £ 36,827 for women "" .
Quoting feminist campaign the Fawcett Society , and citing the case of Miriam O'Reilly , the piece is a breath of fresh air for a newspaper normally firmly on the side of the sexists .
Returning to the Observer , its front - page scoop about a leaked letter from communities secretary Eric Pickles – in which he warns that Cameron 's welfare policies , seen as barbarian and heartless by any fair - minded folk , will risk making up to 40,000 families homeless – is a fine piece of reporting .
Hopefully this exposé will help bring about a U - turn on one of the government 's more heartless policies affecting struggling families .
Let 's end with a bit of gay bashing from the MoS.
"" Why was ' Mr G - A - Y Porn Idol ' guest at No 10 party ? ""
the headline screams .
The story is about one of the guests , the nightclub owner Jeremy Joseph , at the PM 's annual No 10 reception held for "" prominent members of the gay community "" .
The "" scandal "" is that Joseph hosts events that include audience members stripping off as part of an act at his weekly Porn Idol events at Heaven nightclub .
An MoS reporter attended last week 's event , ahem , undercover and was obviously appalled at the lewdness of the whole shebang .
I have to confess that I am somewhat relieved to have turned down an invitation to the event ( the No 10 reception , that is ) , on account of loathing the current administration .
Who knows , if I had attended some type of scandal may have emerged about me ?"
2011-07-04,"The Dominique Strauss - Kahn scandal took an astonishing new twist when a French writer announced she was filing a lawsuit against the former head of the International Monetary Fund for attempted rape and he responded by saying he would sue her for defamation .
Tristane Banon 's lawyer said the legal proceedings would centre on the behaviour of Strauss - Kahn when she went to interview him in a Paris apartment in February 2002 .
Banon , who was 22 at the time , later spoke about the alleged assault on French TV and described Strauss - Kahn , then a leading member of France 's Socialist party , as acting like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's name was censored out of the broadcast .
The alleged incident went largely unreported in France until he was arrested in New York in May and accused of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a hotel chambermaid .
The 62-year - old politician , who had been tipped to be the next French president , denied the charges .
His passport was confiscated and he was put under house arrest by a US judge .
After questions were raised about the credibility of evidence given by the chambermaid , Strauss - Kahn was released without bail on Friday , but his passport was not returned .
The apparent collapse of the case against him led some colleagues to suggest he could make a political comeback in France .
In an exclusive interview with the French magazine L'Express , Banon said : "" I can no longer hear that I am a liar because I have n't made a legal complaint .
For eight years I have carried the weight of this incident alone , hearing rumours and lies about me . ""
She said she did not want to give evidence in support of the New York chambermaid because "" I do n't know anything about her case .
If she lied about certain things , that does n't necessarily mean she lied about the rape .
For me it has become unbearable .
And today , to see Strauss - Kahn no sooner free than eating in a luxury restaurant with friends makes me ill .
"" For once I want to have control over what is happening to me .
I want to be heard because perhaps , finally , there 's a chance I will be listened to . ""
She added : "" I want only one thing .
That he [ Strauss - Kahn ] returns to France with his presumption of innocence so we can go before the court .
"" At the time of the alleged incident , Banon was reportedly dissuaded from taking legal action by her mother , Anne Mansouret , who is a local councillor for his Socialist party .
Mansouret later admitted she regretted talking her daughter out of making a complaint . ""
Tristane Banon will file a complaint for attempted rape in Paris , "" Koubbi said .
"" These acts are extremely serious .
These events were combined with a violence that was absolutely striking for these kinds of situations .
"" Koubbi would not say whether the timing was affected by developments in New York .
After being told of Banon 's intention to launch a lawsuit , Strauss - Kahn 's Paris lawyers said he would sue for slander .
In a statement published in Le Parisien they said Strauss - Kahn had "" heard about Mme Tristane Banon 's intention to make a legal complaint against him "" and described her claims as "" imaginary "" .
Under French law , attempted rape charges can be brought up to 10 years after an alleged attack , whereas sexual assault charges expire after three years .
In the television programme , broadcast in 2007 , Banon accused Strauss - Kahn of leaping on her , wrenching open her bra and trying to unbutton her jeans .
The writer , who was a close friend of Strauss - Kahn 's daughter Camille , said she was forced to fight him off .
"" It finished badly ... very violently ...
I kicked him , "" she said .
"" When we were fighting , I mentioned the word rape to make him afraid , but it did n't have any effect .
I managed to get out . ""
Explaining why she had not pressed charges , Banon said "" I did n't want to be known to the end of my days as the girl who had a problem with the politician . ""
Mansouret told journalists she regretted having dissuaded her daughter from legal action , but had done so because she believed Strauss - Kahn 's behaviour had been out of character and because of close links with his family .
Strauss - Kahn 's second wife was Banon 's godmother .
Mansouret said he was "" an otherwise warm , sympathetic and extremely talented man "" , but the attack had left her daughter depressed and traumatised .
"" My daughter , despite the passing years , is still shocked by these facts .
Her life was completely upset by this affair and she was depressed for a long time . ""
Before Koubbi 's announcement , France was divided on whether it wanted Strauss - Kahn , a former government minister , back in public life .
A poll released on Monday found that 51 % of French people thought Strauss - Kahn no longer had a political future , versus 42 % who thought he did .
Another poll published on Sunday in Le Parisien showed 49 % wanted Strauss - Kahn to return to French politics ."
2011-07-04,""" We will have to keep an eye on him .
But not in his bedroom .
"" On 13 May , I wrote those words about Dominique Strauss - Kahn , claiming French voters could separate private life from politics .
Two days later , the former IMF head was arrested after he had allegedly sexually assaulted a maid in New York .
When the French heard that the accuser 's credibility was in question , it took only a few hours before journalists asked : could he come back ?
Could he run for president ?
Two months ago DSK was seen as the most likely to beat Nicolas Sarkozy at the next presidential election , and so the public , which had thought him guilty for a month and a half , was ready to change its mind very quickly .
Nobody in France went as far as saying the Sofitel maid was "" a hooker "" , like the New York Post did , but a potential political comeback has already been discussed ; the leftist newspaper Liberation asked "" DSK , back ? "" on its front page .
Uneasiness among Socialists since his arrest has shown how important to the party DSK 's candidacy was .
The Socialists have not provided a French president since François Mitterrand left office in 1995 .
They desperately need a candidate who can win .
DSK had everything : a key member of a major political party ; finance minister ; a member of the national assembly ; and a political representative in Sarcelles ( a Paris suburb , and one of the poorest areas in France ) .
He helped the government pass crucial measures and managed the IMF during one of the worst financial crises of our modern economy .
He also attracted voters disappointed by Sarkozy , and some centrist sympathisers who wanted to vote for a candidate that could reach the second round of presidential elections .
The deadline for the registration for the Socialists ' October primaries , which ends with the selection of the next Socialist presidential candidate , is 13 July .
The timetable for primary nomination could be extended , depending on what happens when DSK returns to court on 18 July .
Candidate François Hollande has said he would not be against it .
According to a poll published by Le Parisien , 49 % of French citizens and 60 % of Socialist sympathisers would like to see DSK back on the political scene .
French voters may want him back , but his image seems nonetheless to have been damaged by these proceedings .
All the coverage that the scandal prompted ended the taboo that existed among journalists surrounding coverage of the private sphere .
His intimate life was discussed in detail everywhere in the media , and this could impede his candidacy now .
All the Socialists I talked to on Friday were pleased with the news but remained cautious .
Christophe Borgel , one of DSK 's closest allies , who declared he would support Socialist party head Martine Aubry a few days ago , told me he did n't even want to talk about a possible candidacy : "" I am happy , it is good news for his friends and family . ""
But many feel it is way too soon to talk about a comeback ; to appear eager for his return could reflect negatively on the party – voters would ask themselves why it needed him so badly .
Anne Mansouret , mother of Tristane Banon , the French author who claimed she had to fight Dominique Strauss - Kahn off physically in 2003 , has dropped her candidacy .
In a blogpost on the French website Rue89 , she explains that she was tired of being "" the woman who embarrasses the Socialist party "" .
Within the party , everybody saw her as the one who caused trouble for the only candidate that could have won against Sarkozy , she says .
The possibility of a DSK - Aubry ticket has nevertheless already been discussed in Socialist circles , and it would make Aubry 's candidacy way stronger .
Knowing he is not off the hook yet , the Socialist party will , however , have to be cautious .
The DSK case might weaken the left once more , and not only within the party .
The far right is also a beneficiary :
Marine Le Pen , president of the populist Front National , was quick to blast DSK as a symbol of a discredited old political class .
Both as a political "" outsider "" and as a woman in politics , Le Pen could gain most from the scandal .
After the fierce debates about rape , violence and sexism , could women still vote for him ?
Sylvie Kauffmann , editor at Le Monde , told the New York Times that she could n't .
If not guilty , he would still be the man who had sexual intercourse with a maid – an encounter that went pretty badly – before having lunch with his daughter .
If he happened to be involved in the election , women could think that , after all , politicians do n't respect them .
Personally , I would now choose not to vote for him either , although I said I could two months ago ."
2011-07-04,"US investigators are still examining whether a forceful sexual encounter took place between former IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn and a maid , despite questions about her credibility .
The woman 's lawyer says the authorities have sufficient physical evidence to proceed with the case , including proof that she was assaulted , and Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance confirmed that the investigation would continue until "" all relevant facts "" had been uncovered .
Lawyer Ken Thompson said on Friday that the authorities had photographs of bruises sustained by his client , as well as other physical evidence supporting her claims .
But many legal experts believe the case is set to collapse after revelations that the 33-year - old woman had repeatedly lied to the authorities about her past .
She is also said to have discussed making money out of her accusations , although police say an investigation predating the latest revelations did not produce any evidence to support this .
James Cox , a law professor at Duke University , said that even if more evidence was to emerge in the woman 's favour , the number of lies she had told prosecutors would make it hard to convince the jury that she is a credible witness .
He believes the case looks almost certain to be dropped .
"" It 's very hard to go forward when your witness has been so discredited .
My hunch is that if he was n't such a high - profile figure , these charges would have been dropped already . ""
Fresh allegations about the woman 's private life surfaced in New York tabloids over the weekend , amid claims that senior US prosecutors clashed about the veracity of her story from the outset .
The rumours were unsourced and came after a week of attacks on the woman and her story .
It emerged last week that the former IMF boss has taken advice from TD International , a public relations firm that counts former CIA agents among its employees .
The prosecution case imploded last week when it emerged that the alleged victim had changed her story about the attack after testifying to the grand jury , opening up potential perjury charges .
She originally testified under oath that she was attacked in room 2806 , Strauss - Kahn 's suite , between 12 pm and 12.30pm .
She said she left the room looking for help after the attack .
He left the Sofitel near Times Square at around the same time .
The woman later changed her story to say she cleaned another room after the attack and then went back to Strauss - Kahn 's room .
But timed room - key evidence from the hotel is believed to support her original story and a hotel supervisor has said she had seen the woman , distraught , outside Strauss - Kahn 's room at around 12.30 .
The supervisor took her back to Strauss - Kahn 's room to find out what had happened .
Thompson , the woman 's lawyer , was unavailable for comment on Sunday .
"" The victim here made some mistakes , but that does n't mean she 's not a rape victim , "" he said on Friday .
He accused the district attorney 's office of "" laying a foundation "" for dismissing the case , and said that district attorney Vance was "" afraid "" of proceeding with it after losing two other recent high - profile cases : one against two police officers charged with rape and the other against individuals implicated in a blaze at a Deutsche Bank building that killed two firefighters .
Vance did not respond to the detail of the allegations , but said : "" We have and always will treat victims of sexual assault as a priority . """
2011-07-04,"The case against Dominique Strauss - Kahn looks set to collapse amid talk of blackmail , lies and corruption .
Supporters of a hotel worker who accused one of the world 's most powerful men of sexual assault argue that suggestions that she lied to immigration officials – among other things – should have no relevance .
He either assaulted her or he did n't .
This is true but , having just sat on a jury in a sexual assault case , I realise how important "" substantial credibility issues "" are for the 12 people called to sit in judgment on another human being and understand why the case that led to the resignation of the head of the IMF and raised the issue of rape up the international agenda may be called off altogether .
This is not going to be about the Strauss - Kahn case as such – the situation is still fluid , no one knows what happened or what is still to be revealed .
Nor will it be about the jury deliberations for the case I sat on , which , it has to be said , compares to the DSK case in the way a game of tennis on the beach compares to the Wimbledon final .
This is n't to downgrade the experience of the victim but the fact is there was no physical violence , no DNA evidence , nor so much as a local newspaper reporter involved .
Compare this with the way the world 's media dredged up allegations of prostitution and drug dealing in relation to the alleged victim – and a string of previous worrying sexual encounters in the case of the accused over the Sofitel incident .
When my jury found the accused guilty , his sentence was community service .
Strauss - Kahn has already spent five days on Rikers Island .
Yet there were similarities that have made me both rethink the nature of justice and better understand the enormous hurdles faced by prosecutors , not exclusively but especially in sexual assault cases .
In my case a former partner of the victim let himself into her flat in the early hours of the morning –
he even had a key – to find her sleeping on the couch .
Both sides agreed up to this point , but they differed about what followed .
Scared and shocked , she said he forced her legs open and talked of oral sex before leaving .
He said he spent an hour chatting , saying before he left , "" Good job
I 'm not a rapist . ""
Even without bruised vaginas and spat semen , this case made me realise afresh what a truly horrible experience it is for any victim of sexual assault to stand up there and have to discuss these things .
Seriously , is it any wonder so few women do so ?
As the allegations centred on what took place between the two people late at night – as they often do – the judgment had to be made on the basis of who the jury most believed .
In other words it was a classic case of "" he says , she says "" that highlighted a fundamental principle of law , that the jury must be "" sure , beyond reasonable doubt "" .
In the witness box , the accuser was articulate and forceful , sticking to her story even as the prosecution tried to make out that she was a sad and jealous woman who had wanted sex .
The accused , in contrast , was a dreadful witness , smirking and seeming to find the whole thing funny .
His mobile phone went off at one point while he was under oath .
Yet , there were still doubts .
The judge had to be asked via a special note for the definition of "" absolutely , 100 % sure "" .
Nobody disagreed that the victim seemed credible .
But what if she was half asleep and sort of imagined it ?
She did admit to still caring for him after all .
Jurors are asked not to speculate , although they can use their experience and knowledge of the world ( prejudice ? ) to infer meaning based on the evidence they hear , which is by its nature partial .
How can you be sure of what happened between two human beings if you were not , well , there at the same time ?
Finding someone guilty of any crime is a real and terrible burden even in minor cases like this .
Yet , to allow men to behave as if women are their chattels to do with as they wish is also a crime .
Each allegation , each case , is unique .
In my experience in that jury room , I gained an enormous respect and admiration for a system that sees 12 people drawn at random and from all walks of life try to discuss and reason with each other over the acts of others .
Yes , it 's frustrating and frankly sometimes the views of others ( I sat on two cases in total ) left me baffled , but I prefer it over the views of one person , even a judge , any day .
The responsibilty of the job means that doubts over either story are important .
Again , I 'm not making a judgment in the DSK case –
how can we ?
–
I 'm simply saying that those who argue that we should ignore any relevant prior behaviour entirely – in this case alleged lies over sexual assault to immigration officials should also ignore the string of allegations about DSK 's behaviour towards women .
Anything else would not be equality .
We may object to the treatment of the woman in the centre of the DSK case but we can not doubt that proof , if there is any , that she has lied to authorities in the past over earlier sexual encounters do matter .
To say otherwise suggests that no man , nor woman either , would receive a fair trial .
The odds may be stacked against women , who have to come forward and relive horrifying events in which they were the victim , against often more physically and materially more powerful men .
But , juries can work this out for themselves .
That , at least , has to be our only hope ."
2011-07-05,"The possible return of Dominique Strauss - Kahn to the French presidential race has plunged the Socialist party into a fresh round of infighting , overshadowing its internal contest for a candidate .
Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the IMF , was the Socialist favourite to beat Nicolas Sarkozy and win the 2012 presidential election before he was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel maid .
His political allies hope that charges against him will be dropped this week after doubts were raised over the hotel worker 's credibility .
But rifts are emerging between those who want him to return to Socialist politics and party leadership figures who claim he is unlikely to run for president .
The Socialists have been thrown into disarray by a lawsuit from the French journalist Tristane Banon who alleges Strauss - Kahn attempted to rape her during an interview in 2003 .
Banon and her mother , a Socialist councillor , claim François Hollande , the then Socialist party leader , knew full details of the alleged attack .
Hollande styles himself as the squeaky clean "" ordinary guy "" of French politics and is currently the frontrunner in the internal Socialist race for a presidential candidate .
But his campaign has been overshadowed by questions about the Banon case , what he knew and whether he should have acted .
He denied any in - depth knowledge of the allegations , saying : "" I absolutely want to put an end to all these controversies , rumours and hawking . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's key ally , the Socialist MP Jean - Marie Le Guen , slammed Banon 's legal complaint as "" opportunistic "" , adding : "" Visibly Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's return does n't suit some people . ""
Another Strauss - Kahn supporter , Pierre Moscovici , deemed the Banon case "" mysterious "" and likened it to a "" soap opera "" .
Martine Aubry , the former Socialist leader who recently launched a bid to be France 's first female president , is now struggling to emerge from the shadow of the man known as DSK .
She insisted she would not now pull out of the race in favour of Strauss - Kahn .
She also suggested to journalists that Strauss - Kahn told her by phone he would n't come back to run for Socialist presidential candidate .
Benoit Hamon , the party spokesman , said a Strauss - Kahn return to the presidential race was "" the weakest "" of all probabilities .
This infuriated DSK allies who think he still has a chance at the Elysée .
The latest poll shows that even if all charges are dropped against Strauss - Kahn , a majority of French people neither want him to stand nor think he will stand .
The poll for the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur found that 54 % of French people do not want him to run in the Socialist primary race and more than 63 % do not think he will run .
Even though a majority of Socialist sympathisers would like him to run , most of them think he wo n't .
The most hostile towards him were women voters - who were never among Strauss - Kahn 's biggest supporters .
The Socialist party primary vote takes place in October .
Candidates must declare by 13 July , although Strauss - Kahn could get around this deadline if he decides to run ."
2011-07-05,"Following the scandal that engulfed Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the International Monetary Fund has tightened up the standards of behaviour expected from its managing director .
The IMF has instructed new MD Christine Lagarde to observe the "" highest standards of ethical conduct "" , as she began her tenure today .
Lagarde 's terms of appointment include a section laying out the conduct expected of her by the IMF .
This , apparently for the first time , includes clear instructions on the ethics expected .
The letter says : "" As managing director , you are expected to observe the highest standards of ethical conduct , consistent with the values of integrity , impartiality and discretion .
You shall strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in your conduct . ""
The terms of appointment also state that Lagarde must participate in the ethics training programme provided by the Fund 's ethics adviser .
When Strauss - Kahn was appointed in November 2007 no explicit reference was made to ethics .
Instead , he was urged to "" avoid any conflict of interest , or the appearance of such a conflict . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's tenure at the IMF came to an abrupt halt in May , when he resigned after being arrested and accused of sexual assault in New York .
He was released on bail last week following claims that his accuser had lied to police , a move which prompted a French journalist and writer to announce she would file her own lawsuit alleging attempted rape .
Lagarde will receive a salary of $ 467,940 ( £ 290,000 ) a year plus an allowance of $ 83,760 to suppport "" a scale of living appropriate to your position "" .
Her pay will rise in line with the US rate of inflation ."
2011-07-05,"The hotel maid at the centre of the attempted rape case against the former head of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , is suing the New York Post for libel after the newspaper accused her of working as a prostitute .
The lawsuit was filed against the Post and five of its journalists after a stream of articles over the weekend that claimed she had engaged in sex work both in the Sofitel hotel where Strauss - Kahn had been staying at the time of the alleged assault and afterwards when the maid was under the protective care of New York police .
The legal action , reported by Reuters , says that "" all of these statements are false , have subjected the plaintiff to humiliation , scorn and ridicule throughout the world by falsely portraying her as a prostitute or as a woman who trades her body for money and they constitute defamation and libel per se . ""
The prosecution case against Strauss - Kahn is in deep crisis after the admission made last week by the Manhattan district attorney 's office that there were "" major holes "" in the woman 's account of events .
The prosecutors agreed to release Strauss - Kahn from house arrest but said they continue to investigate the allegations of a forcible sexual attack .
Prosecutors said last week they believe the alleged victim , a refugee from Guinea , lied over claims she was gang raped when she submitted a claim for political asylum in the US .
She has also lied about her taxes and investigators found deposits made into her bank account of $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) over the past two years , some of which came from a drug dealer .
But as the main case flounders , it has been joined by a flurry of legal action on the sides .
A French writer , Tristane Banon , has now filed a criminal complaint in the French courts that alleges Strauss - Kahn tried to rape her in 2003 while she was conducting an interview with him .
Banon told L'Express that "" I ca n't take it anymore hearing that I must be lying because I have n't filed suit "" .
Strauss - Kahn has dismissed her claim as "" imaginary "" .
The maid 's libel action suggests that the New York Post had published defamatory articles "" in an apparent desperate attempt to bolster its rapidly plunging sales "" .
In one weekend report , the paper accused the 32-year - old of demanding payment from Strauss - Kahn after having sex with him in his hotel room .
A separate report alleges that she continued to work as a prostitute in a hotel in Brooklyn while under the safekeeping of the district attorney 's office .
The lawsuit says that the reports were published by the Post even though the newspaper knew they were false or should have known that they were false .
The unravelling of the Strauss - Kahn prosecution has been accompanied by an extraordinary spate of leaks to the New York media .
In the latest , the New York Times revealed details of the account given by the maid to staff at St Luke 's Roosevelt Crime Victim Treatment Center just hours after the alleged attack .
According to paper , the maid said that as soon as she entered his room Strauss Kahn had pushed her on to the bed and began to assault her .
She freed herself only to be attacked again .
A director of the rape crisis centre that drew up the report has expressed intense unhappiness about the leaks .
Susan Xenarios , a director , said they were "" outrageous . ""
"" We have been in operation for 35 years and this has never happened before .
Everything is leaking it seems , "" she said .
"" There are days when I feel psychotic about this . ""
Xenarios said she was fearful of the impact all these leaks would have on other victims .
"" I am very concerned that it will have wider ramifications . ""
She said Strauss - Kahn was a person of "" extreme international power .
I do n't know how that factors in .
The whole thing is very disturbing "" .
In France , the possible return of Strauss - Kahn to the French presidential race has plunged the Socialist party into a fresh round of infighting .
The latest poll showed that even if all charges are dropped against Strauss - Kahn , a majority of French people neither want him to stand nor think he will stand ."
2011-07-06,"With the criminal case of Dominique Strauss - Kahn all but completely unravelled , it is easy to second - guess the prosecutors and turn the matter into an example of all that is wrong with the American justice system .
In fact , the case likely says more about how the system works , than how it does n't .
Recall the circumstances faced by prosecutors at the time of Strauss - Kahn 's arrest .
A hotel maid reports a rape by a foreign national who is , at that moment , seated on an airplane about the leave the United States for his home country .
She gives experienced prosecutors a detailed and compelling account of a crime .
She is a young immigrant who came to the US seeking political asylum .
He , the alleged perpetrator , is a wealthy and powerful foreign official .
She is physically bruised and there is DNA evidence corroborating her allegations of sexual activity .
Early accounts also indicated that Strauss - Kahn had left his mobile phone at the hotel , indicating to prosecutors that he may have rushed to the airport .
That is what the Manhattan district attorney 's office knew at the time that they had to decide whether to attempt to prevent Strauss - Kahn from leaving the country and , perhaps , forever shielding himself from prosecution .
He is immediately arrested and , within several days , indicted by a New York grand jury .
Although the judge initially holds him without bail , he is released on house arrest after three days and allowed to await trial in a $ 200,000 a month TriBeCa townhouse .
In cases of rape , the entire prosecution often turns on a credibility battle between the accuser and the accused .
Where , as here , the defence admits to sexual contact , much of the forensic evidence becomes all but irrelevant .
While signs of forcible sexual conduct , such as bruises or other evidence of a struggle , are still important in building a case , ultimately , one facing a defence based on consensual sexual contact is the most difficult to prove .
Add to this equation that rape victims are often reluctant to come forward , and in the hours immediately after an attack are frequently so traumatised that their statements may contain omissions and inconsistencies ; gauging the credibility of a potential rape victim is n't easy .
Faced with this limited information , and no exculpatory evidence from the putative defendant , prosecutors had to make a call knowing full well the ramifications of their decision and the torrent of criticism that would follow if the case did not hold up .
Now , some six weeks later , prosecutors have come forward , as they are legally obliged to do under US law , and provided the defence and the court with evidence of the alleged victim 's false statements and inconsistencies .
According to prosecutors , the hotel maid lied in connection with her application for political asylum and concealed certain income .
She also may have made damaging statements to a boyfriend that suggest a financial motive behind her allegations .
Once prosecutors turned this damaging evidence over , Strauss - Kahn was immediately released from house arrest .
And , although she still stands by her story , in a case that is all about credibility , hers is likely damaged beyond repair : dismissal of the charges is now all but inevitable .
So , was Strauss - Kahn wronged ?
If she lied about the assault , then certainly so .
She remains subject to criminal prosecution for making false statements and could be deported as well .
But did US prosecutors act unreasonably ?
Was this decision , as some have suggested , the result of the misguided ambitions of a newly - elected district attorney ?
Likely not .
Prosecutors did what was right and they did so promptly .
In forthrightly exposing the credibility issues with the key witness , prosecutors effectively drove a stake into the heart of their own case .
While it would certainly have been preferable if prosecutors had had more time to investigate the background of the accuser before arresting Strauss - Kahn , circumstances dictated otherwise and there is nothing about this case to suggest that it was ever influenced by anything other than the facts .
No system of justice is failsafe .
We need look no further than the alarming frequency with which we read about wrongly convicted individuals who are freed years later after DNA evidence exonerates them .
Prosecutors , like judges and juries , can make mistakes .
But here , all the evidence suggests they acted fairly , honestly and without regard for the status of the accuser or the accused .
That is the way the system is supposed to work ."
2011-07-06,"Doubts over the "" credibility "" of the victim have put the Dominique Strauss - Kahn rape trial in doubt , as if it 's only good girls who can ever be raped .
This is a perennial problem in the prosecution of rape trials , and a difficult one to dismiss completely .
But a lot can be learned from this debacle .
The allegations against Strauss - Kahn brought forth a number of other allegations of sexual misconduct .
One woman , Tristane Banon , says she is going to press charges over an alleged assault against her in 2003 , during which , she says , Strauss - Kahn behaved like "" a rutting chimpanzee "" .
He has vigorously denied the allegations , but
whatever the truth about that case , it is important for women , even when they feel there is no chance of a prosecution , even when they are not sure themselves they wish to pursue a prosecution , to report sexual attacks .
If their attacker is a serial offender , then they may find that their own experience adds to a pattern of evidence , or may in future be recognised as such .
Sexual attacks are often serial , which is why it is so important that complaints are formally made , and efficiently recorded , however little evidence there may be for a single incident ."
2011-07-07,"Relations between the maid in the Dominique Strauss - Kahn case and the New York district attorney 's office appear to have irreparably broken down after her lawyers accused the office of leaking damaging information about her .
Kenneth Thompson , representing the unidentified alleged victim of a sexual assault by the former IMF head , is calling for Cyrus Vance to quit the case .
In a letter addressed to the chief prosecutor , Thompson wrote : "" District Attorney Vance , we ask in earnest that your office voluntarily recuse itself from the Strauss - Kahn case and that you appoint a special prosecutor . ""
The extraordinary request is an indication of the dire state of the prosecution case .
Vance has stated there were "" major holes "" in the maid 's account of events at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan where the alleged attack took place .
Strauss - Kahn 's legal team met lawyers from the office on Wednesday to discuss how to resolve the case .
Hours before Vance made his declaration to the Manhattan court last week , a story ran in the New York Times detailing problems with the maid 's testimony .
Thompson accused Daniel Alonso , a senior member of Vance 's team , of having planted the leak with the newspaper .
In his letter , obtained by Reuters , Thompson said quotes given in the Times article were almost identical to language used by Alonso to Thompson at around the same time .
In the article , it was revealed that the maid had telephoned her boyfriend , who is held in an prison in Arizona on drugs charges .
The Times said that in the conversation , recorded by police , she said words to the effect of "" Do n't worry , this guy has a lot of money .
I know what I am doing . ""
Thompson said "" virtually the same words "" had been used by Alonso to him just hours earlier .
Thompson went on in his letter to complain that the office had failed to categorically deny a story in the New York Post alleging that the maid has been a prostitute . ""
Such apparent leaks by members of your office is , without question , an abrogation of the duties and responsibilities of the prosecutor . ""
Vance is caught in a case that could define the success or failure of his term as chief prosecutor in the city .
On the one hand he is obliged to share serious doubts about the alleged victim with the courts and with the defence ; on the other hand he can not be seen to be discriminating against a poor apparently defenceless woman in favour of a very rich and powerful man ."
2011-07-10,"Martine Aubry , a challenger for the Socialist ticket in next year 's French presidential election , has threatened legal action over allegations that her husband is an Islamist and denounced rumours that she has suffered from alcoholism .
Politicians on the left have long warned that the 2012 French presidential race risked descending into a battle of personal smear campaigns .
Charges of attempted rape against the former Socialist frontrunner Dominique Strauss - Kahn in New York and a new legal complaint over an alleged attempted rape in France , as well as stories on his wealth and pursuit of women , have intensified the scrutiny of presidential hopefuls .
Aubry , the Socialist leader and mayor of Lille , threatened to sue websites which did not remove references to her husband , the lawyer Jean - Louis Brochen , as an "" Islamist "" or "" Salafist "" .
In 1993 , before France 's law banning religious symbols in schools , Brochen defended schoolgirls threatened with exclusion for wearing headscarves and a Jewish boy who wore a skull cap .
Brochen , a staunch secularist , has said it was a lawyer 's role to defend all sorts of cases .
The Journal du Dimanche reported that Aubry made telephone warnings to people she suspected of slandering her husband or spreading rumours that she had fought alcoholism or suffered health problems .
These included a former minister under Jacques Chirac and a senior figure at the Elysée .
The paper said one former government minister had said in private , without producing proof , that Aubry had undergone two detox treatments for alcohol use in a clinic in the south of France .
Socialists suspect the Elysée and Nicolas Sarkozy 's ruling rightwing UMP party of stoking gossip against Aubry .
This charge was rejected outright by Nadine Morano , minister for learning and vocational training , who said Aubry was portraying herself as a victim to detract from the shortcomings of the Socialist campaign .
In recent days , Aubry has repeatedly dismissed the rumours .
Le Monde reported that on a Turin trip , Aubry joked to media : "" You all know I swig whisky hidden under my djellaba [ north African loose robe ] .
"" The former rightwing prime minister Dominique de Villepin , who also has ambitions to challenge Sarkozy for the presidency , said rumours about Aubry were "" scandalous "" and "" foul "" and warned that no one should play dirty politics .
The latest poll , for Ifop , found that 46 % of French people felt the Socialist François Hollande was most capable of beating Sarkozy , followed by Aubry on 27 % ."
2011-07-20,"Lawyers representing the two women who claim Dominique Strauss - Kahn tried to rape them have met for the first time in New York , raising the prospect that they will join forces to strengthen their cases against the former IMF boss .
David Koubbi , representing Tristane Banon , the young French writer who alleges Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her in 2003 , flew from France on Tuesday for the meeting with Kenneth Thompson , lawyer for the hotel maid whose accusations against the former head of the IMF led to his arrest in May.
The pair met in the offices of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance , who is heading the case against Strauss - Kahn .
Details of their discussions are not known .
According to Le Figaro newspaper , Vance plans to summon Banon to give evidence against Strauss - Kahn in a US court .
The affair threatens to further poison France 's political scene , with news that police have questioned François Hollande , the man who has replaced Strauss - Kahn as the frontrunner to be the Socialist party 's presidential candidate , about what he knew of the alleged attack on Banon .
Afterwards , speaking to police , Hollande suggested he had been the victim of political dirty tricks aimed at implicating him in the attempted rape investigation .
"" This is an affair that has nothing to do with me .
I asked to be heard [ by the police]because there is a political operation aimed at getting my name in the press .
I now consider that I have nothing to do or say in this affair and I will take action against all those who seek , at one moment or another , to make this a political affair , "" he told journalists .
Hollande has denied allegations by Banon 's mother Anne Mansouret , a Socialist party regional representative , that he knew of the assault on her daughter .
He said Mansouret had called him and spoken of an "" incident "" between Strauss - Kahn and Banon , but gave him no detail whatsoever .
Banon only launched her lawsuit against Strauss - Kahn after it appeared the American case was falling apart .
Hollande 's rival for the Socialist nomination , party secretary Martine Aubry , said she hoped the Banon affair would not be used against him . ""
At a time when certain people are using a private matter in which the law is involved , namely that of Tristane Banon , to attack François Hollande , I would like to react to this new turn to express my support for François Hollande , "" she said in a statement .
The seven charges against Strauss - Kahn by the American prosecution have looked shaky ever since the Guinean - born maid 's credibility was questioned after it was found she had made false statements to immigration authorities when applying to stay in the US .
News of the three - hour meeting came as a shock in France , where Koubbi has repeatedly insisted he did not want the two cases linked . ""
Neither Tristane Banon nor I want to be used by the American justice system , or give any support whatsoever to the idea that the two cases are linked in any way whatsoever , "" he said after Strauss - Kahn 's arrest .
"" If they want the support of Tristane Banon it will be categorically refused . ""
Earlier this month he again stressed his opposition to the cases being linked .
"" There are two cases , clearly , and each case has to be treated in isolation according to the laws of the country concerned , "" he told Paris Match magazine .
After meeting Vance and Thompson , Koubbi did not comment on his volte face .
Strauss - Kahn is now facing two separate attempted rape allegations either side of the Atlantic .
In America , he is accused of assaulting a 32-year - old hotel chambermaid when she arrived to clean his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York in May , hours before he was due to fly to France to launch his bid to become president in next year 's elections .
Police arrested him on an Air France flight as it was preparing to take off for Paris .
In France
Banon claims she was forced to flee after he tried to rape her when she went to interview him for a book she was writing , in February 2003 .
She says the former government minister locked her in a Paris flat and leapt on her like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" .
Strauss - Kahn has denied attacking the maid and was released from house arrest earlier this month after questions were raised about her credibility .
He has also denied attacking Banon , now 32 .
His Paris lawyers have launched a countersuit against the writer for defamation .
American prosecutors will not be able to use Banon 's case to discredit Strauss - Kahn 's character but must prove its "" pertinence "" to the case .
After the meeting in New York , Thompson said : "" I just want justice for the victim .
I want her to be able to tell the world what Dominique Strauss - Kahn did to her in a hotel room .
That is important . ""
The truth is that she was sexually assaulted in that room , and the truth matters … and we want Dominique Strauss - Kahn to be held accountable . """
2011-07-21,"French journalists ' attention in recent weeks has been shifting from aimless speculation to the very strong public mobilisation against sexism , which followed the arrest of Dominique Strauss - Kahn and the affair 's many developments .
This public outcry did not intend to comment on what did or did not happen in New York – as long as the judicial system does not decide , no one in France can say – but to do away with the flood of misogynistic discourse prompted by the news , made in private or in public , which some believe belong to France 's so - called "" Gallic culture "" .
But contrary to what our editorial writers and commentators may think – remember , those people were never passionate about gender equality in the first place –
it was n't only back in May , when the DSK news broke , that gender issues were part of the French public debate .
Such discussions were well under way in the months preceding the scandal .
Indeed , several large - scale protests have taken place in the past two years to bring women 's rights to the table , making it an unavoidable topic for all citizens .
In 2009 , the government tried to eliminate public funding allocated to Family Planning , the national association for sexual and reproductive health .
A petition launched by the organisation was signed by 150,000 people .
The government caved in , but people realised that women 's rights , including those gained in the 1970s , were no longer safe .
Several feminist associations and magazines were launched , attracting young people eager to end inequality .
In 2010 an immense social mobilisation rejected the pension reforms proposed by the right .
Indeed , retired women receive on average 40 % less than men , and no action to seriously address this injustice was to be found is the law proposals .
In all marches , the millions of demonstrators and protesters – men and women – repeated feminist slogans which were at the heart of their demands for true equality in the workplace .
Times are changing in France .
While we have often heard it said that feminism was outdated and belonged in the past , we have recently seen a profound resurgence of a yearning for equality and a widespread ras - le - bol when it comes to sex - based discrimination .
These issues have invited themselves into the public space and , for the 2012 presidential election , they intend to stay .
In France , 80 % of casual workers are women , the wage gap amounts to 27 % ; 80 % of household tasks are performed by women , and we only have 18.5 % women in the national assembly .
If we want the entire society to change , we will have to undertake ambitious measures .
There are absolutely no illusions harboured by the women 's movement when it comes to the right 's ability to rally against this cause .
On pensions , access to abortion or public services serving early childhood , the right never ceases to attack these social protections upholding the rights of women .
Any attempt to seek equality comes from the left .
This is where any significant change will come from .
Because the left has always fought for the emancipation of individuals , it can carry the feminist torch and provide an effective outlet for collective mobilisation in favour of women 's rights – but only if it has the necessary will .
Much remains to be done .
Many feminists like myself have chosen to side with presidential hopeful Martine Aubry in the primaries organised by the Socialist party .
By putting social issues at the heart of her candidacy , she is demonstrating a commitment to collective progress that will advance women 's rights – and therefore the rights of all .
By speaking out against widespread part - time work ( too often , by default , the most common type of work offered to women ) , or in support of the opening of childcare places , she shows her willingness to turn legislative texts into reality , making gender equality a matter of priority .
This week , when faced with the crisis in Greece , Aubry brought together all the leaders of the European left and proposed to put political action back on the map to serve the public interest .
She is against the notion that political decisions should be dictated by private interests .
These are essential conditions for advancing women 's rights in France , Europe and worldwide ."
2011-07-24,"The hotel worker allegedly attacked by Dominique Strauss - Kahn has spoken out for the first time , revealing her identity and detailing her alleged attack .
Nafissatou Diallo , whose identity had been protected until she decided to speak , gave interviews to Newsweek magazine and ABC news detailing her alleged attack by the former International Monetary Fund boss .
The case against Strauss - Kahn appeared close to collapse last month after Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance said Diallo had lied about her background .
In the Newsweek interview , Diallo , 32 , stands by her account of the attack and criticises the former French presidential hopeful .
"" I want him to go to jail .
I want him to know there are some places you can not use your power , you can not use your money , "" she said .
Diallo said she hoped God punishes him .
"" We are poor , but we are good , "" she said .
"" I do n't think about money . ""
According to Diallo , she entered Strauss - Kahn 's room in the Sofitel New York hotel on the morning of 14 May to find him naked . ""
Oh , my God , "" Diallo said .
"" I 'm so sorry . ""
"" You do n't have to be sorry , "" she claims he said .
She claims he then attacked her , grabbing her breasts .
He was like "" a crazy man to me "" , she said .
Diallo said she was afraid of losing her job and of hurting Strauss - Kahn , 62 , who is shorter than the 5 ft 10 in cleaner .
She goes on to recount in graphic detail the alleged attack .
"" I push him .
I get up .
I wanted to scare him .
I said , ' Look , there is my supervisor right there . '
But he said there was nobody out there , and nobody was going to hear . ""
After a struggle she said Strauss - Kahn forced her to have oral sex .
Strauss - Kahn 's semen was found in the hotel room and on Diallo 's uniform but his lawyers have denied that a forced sexual encounter took place .
They have also questioned Diallo 's links to Amara Tarawally , a convicted drug dealer who put money in accounts owned by Diallo .
The New York Times reported US authorities had recorded Diallo telling Tarawally words to the effect of , "" Do n't worry , this guy has a lot of money .
I know what I 'm doing . ""
But Newsweek reports prosecutors did not have a full transcript of the call , which had been conducted in a dialect of Fulani , Diallo 's language .
The actual words are somewhat different , sources told Newsweek .
Guinean Diallo has also been accused of lying about her past in order to get a US visa , and of fiddling her taxes .
In an interview with ABC to be aired this week , Diallo acknowledged "" mistakes "" but said they should not stop Vance 's office from going forward . ""
God is my witness I 'm telling the truth .
From my heart .
God knows that .
And he knows that , "" she said .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyer , William Taylor , told Newsweek : "" What disgusts me is an effort to pressure the prosecutors with street theatre , and that is fundamentally wrong . """
2011-07-27,"It is a curious feature of American justice that Nafissatou Diallo , the accuser of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , has given an interview to ABC news , as well as to Newsweek .
Thanks to media convention she had the right to anonymity in the US , as she would have had in the UK .
She waived it : had that happened here , however , it still would have been sub judice , whether she was anonymous or not , so to interview her would almost certainly have been contempt of court .
It is therefore , from a British perspective , strange to see someone arguing their case publicly , before it 's been adjudicated .
The details that are supposed to have caused the case to collapse – firstly , her immigration status , secondly , her conversation with a drug dealer who may have been her boyfriend , thirdly , her changing the order of events after the attack – are sketchy .
As Holly Dustin , manager of End Violence Against Women , said , "" rape victims can have insecure immigration status … and they can still be raped "" ; I would think her asylum claim was as good as irrelevant .
The alternative is to say that if you 're a migrant who fled an ambiguous situation , if you can get into another country , good luck with that – but you forfeit your rights under the rule of law .
The conversation she had in which she purportedly made compromising remarks to a drug dealer has n't been properly translated .
And as for the order of events following the alleged attempted rape : she initially said she 'd waited in a corridor to collect herself ; it then transpired she 'd gone into a room , DSK 's lawyers say to clean it ,
Diallo 's lawyers say to collect her stuff .
But even if she did clean it , how can you possibly adjudicate on what an honest person would do in the minutes following a sexual attack ?
Still , it 's understandable that with a crime in which it 's one person 's word against another , the credibility of the accuser takes on greater importance than it would otherwise .
What is not understandable is the fact that Diallo 's credibility – which is undermined here by hints about her trustworthiness in a range of situations rather than any evidence about her sexual behaviour – comes under so much more scrutiny than Strauss - Kahn 's .
Indeed , where people do mention the politician 's reported priapism , it is in his defence : he could have any woman he wanted , so why would he try to rape anybody ?
There is , as we all know , a case being brought against him for the same offence by Tristane Banon , in France .
And yet in some quarters that is n't considered enough to dent his word , while Diallo 's word is wrecked , not just with an inconsistency , but even when her version of events deviates from what we might have expected .
I went to France shortly after DSK 's arrest , and many people were shocked that I would even dignify the accusation with a conversation . ""
En France , nous avons la présomption d'innocence , "" they explained slowly , as if to a person from a country without courts .
But presumption of innocence is only extended to the accused .
The accuser surely deserves it as well , since a false claim of rape is also a crime .
So the only thing to presume in a rape accusation is that you do n't yet know : yet it is taken as the respectable course to presume that the accused is still innocent .
Similarly , when a charge of sexual assault is made , everything the accuser says is picked over for inconsistency and improbability .
This is an extreme example , but it 's a real question from someone I interviewed in Paris : "" She claims he forced her to give him head , twice .
But what does that even mean ?
Just sticking it in twice , or two full cycles of fellatio ?
"" All the accused has to say is : "" It was consensual .
"" Nobody says : "" What exactly made her consent to sex with you ?
What was your killer move ?
Do you have a really good line , or do you just do it with your eyebrows ?
"" I do n't even think this is pure , unadulterated sexism , a more discreet version of sharia law , in which a man is just taken to be more trustworthy than a woman .
There is a legal angle , where we all know that circumstantial evidence is not enough ; that tittle - tattle wo n't convict anyone ; and that even past crimes of exactly the same , or a very similar nature , have to be excised from the process of adjudication , in the interests of fairness .
A past crime from the accuser , however , even if it has nothing to do with the case in hand , is enough to torpedo their credibility .
Anything could do for Diallo now : if she were found to have a speeding fine , or to have ever been a prostitute , or to be a pickpocket .
Just imagine how minor an infraction would be enough to destroy any chance of her being taken seriously .
And yet , for Strauss - Kahn , a tabula rasa .
There is a myth that the Strauss - Kahn affair highlights the differences between American / Anglo - Saxon puritanism ( the possible 72-year sentence was fixed on as evidence of a tendency to overreact ) and French "" passion "" .
In fact , beyond a few technicalities about arrest procedure , there is less difference between them than they suppose : in the US , you might get a bit closer to a prosecution , but the rules are the same .
To be a credible rape victim you need to be innocent beyond imagining , not to mention beautiful ; to be a credible rapist , you have to be so vile , so rebarbative , that it would be impossible for you to get laid any other way .
Diallo said when she found out who DSK was she was frightened for her life : if it had happened in Guinea , with "" a powerful man like that "" , she would have been killed .
In the brave western way , nobody has to silence a complainant so crudely .
Incredulity is enough .

This article was amended on 29 July 2011.The sentence beginning : "" And as for the order of events ... "" omitted to make clear that the charge is "" attempted rape "" .
This has been corrected ."
2011-07-28,"The hotel maid who accused Dominique Strauss - Kahn has been unfairly portrayed as a money - grubbing opportunist , her lawyer said .
Kenneth Thompson revealed that he and his client , Nafissatou Diallo , 32 , had spent most of Wednesday with prosecutors going over tapes of phone conversations she had with a fellow Guinea immigrant , now in a US jail , 24 hours after the alleged sexual assault .
Contrary to reports , Thompson said , they did not show her seeking to profit from her accusation .
On Thursday Diallo told an audience at a cultural centre in Brooklyn that the past two months had been filled with lots of tears from her and her teenage daughter .
She said her daughter had asked her to be strong . ""
I promise her I 'm going to be strong for you , and every other woman in the world , "" she said .
Visibly nervous , Diallo told reporters she wanted to "" let people know a lot of things they say about me is not true "" .
It was her first public appearance since breaking her silence in interviews with ABC and Newsweek .
It is nearly unheard of for an alleged sex assault victim to speak publicly before the end of court proceedings .
Diallo and Thompson met with prosecutors on Wednesday for nearly eight hours , their first meeting since the Manhattan district attorney 's office publicly announced doubts about her credibility because of lies on her asylum application and the tapes .
Thompson said the recordings established that Diallo 's focus was on what had happened to her , not on Strauss - Kahn 's wealth or stature – refuting what earlier this month an anonymous law officer was quoted telling the New York Times : "" She says words to the effect of , ' Do n't worry , this guy has a lot of money .
I know what I 'm doing ' .
"" It followed other reports that Diallo , not identified at that point , had lied about her experiences in Guinea .
The leaks led to wide speculation that the case against the former IMF chief , who had been a likely candidate to run to be France 's next president , could be dropped .
Thompson said the conversations , which had to be translated from Fula , a West African language , had been reported incorrectly and in fact backed up her allegations , showing that Diallo , just over a day after the alleged assault , had described what happened to her in very similar terms to the account she gave investigators shortly beforehand .
According to Thompson , Diallo 's first conversation with the jailed man did not mention Strauss - Kahn 's wealth at all .
Instead she told him "" someone tried to rape me , and that he 's a powerful , big man "" .
In a later conversation she mentioned Strauss - Kahn "" is powerful and rich "" , Thompson said , but then in isolation from that statement , "" I know what to do , "" which seemingly meant only she had alerted the authorities and would hire a lawyer .
"" Her primary focus was on what happened to her , how she was coping with the fact that she had almost been raped , "" Thompson said .
"" Information has been put out there about Ms Diallo that now I know was false .
She never was scheming to take DSK 's money , and that 's a fact .
"" Manhattan prosecutors have declined to comment on the recordings .
Diallo admits lying to get asylum – saying she was gang - raped in Guinea – but says this was done so she could stay in the US .
In a TV interview on Monday , Diallo said that she had found Strauss - Kahn naked in the hotel suite and attempted to leave , but he grabbed her .
"" I want justice .
I want him to go to jail , "" she told ABC News .
"" I want him to know you can not use your power when you do something like this . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers are fighting an equally vocal battle to pressure prosecutors into dropping the case , insisting that any sex was consensual and calling the Diallo interviews an "" unseemly media circus "" .
The next court hearing is on 23 August , when it is likely that prosecutors will say whether they will press ahead with the case ."
2011-07-29,
2011-08-01,"In France , the scandal surrounding Dominique Strauss - Kahn has unfortunately overshadowed a momentous celebration , the 140th anniversary of La Commune , mother of all rebellions .
It only lasted two months and ultimately failed , yet its resonance has proved unequal , inspiring generations of thinkers , public policy makers , philosophers , economists and dreamers .
La Commune started on 18 March 1871 and ended in a bloodbath on 28 May.
With the first ( 1792 - 99 ) and the second ( 1848 - 52 ) republic as models , La Commune meant to go further .
And it did , with the most audacious public policies France had ever known .
Insurrection sprang from Paris to put an end to Napoleon III 's second empire , which had declared war against Prussia three months earlier .
Eventually , an armistice was signed in Versailles with a transitional government .
Then came the general elections in February 1871 .
While the country elected a conservative assembly , Paris voted for radical republican leftists .
Paris , which had heroically fought against the Prussian army and bitterly suffered from famine during the winter 1870 - 71 , thought little of this new assembly which , in fear of revolutionary contagion , had moved the government 's quarters from Paris to Versailles .
Soon , artisans , shopkeepers and workers – about 25 % of the Paris population at the time , most of them ardent republicans , die - hard patriots and anticlerical Jacobins – went on strike .
They did n't want their hopes and ideals to be confiscated by yet another generation of royalists and bonapartistes .
In Versailles , the government felt the heat coming from Paris and one night sent troops to get hold of 227 canons stored in Belleville and Montmartre .
Sleepy but impassioned Parisians stopped the troops and persuaded them to side with the people .
Two generals were shot down and it was the beginning of the insurrection .
Wealthy Parisians from the western arrondissements fled the capital .
A few days later , Parisians organised their own government , La Commune , whose 70 members represented the whole socialist and republican spectrum .
Seventy new publications emerged in just two months , among them Le Cri du Peuple , and the feminist La Sociale .
They were followed by a series of progressive political measures : vacant apartments were given to poor families ; municipal canteens were set up to feed the poor ; a minimum revenue was established for all workers ; private firms were required to have workers ' delegates who met every fortnight ; civil partnerships were created ; church and state were separated ; a feminist movement , L'union des Femmes , asked for women workers to be paid the same as male workers and obtain pay equality for school headmistresses ; freedom of press was proclaimed ; civil servants were appointed by popular vote ; illegitimate children were recognised equal in rights with other children ; education was secularised .
As if implementing these new laws was n't enough , the Paris Commune also had to fight the French army that was stationed all around the capital .
Then , as the Versailles government made peace with the newly created Germany , Bismarck insisted that Paris 's uprising had to be crushed .
On 21 May 1871 the Versailles government 's army managed to break into Paris .
A bloodbath ensued .
The Versaillais shot down anyone who opposed them : 20,000 Communards were slaughtered without trial in a week ; another 10,000 were sent to prison and 5,000 more sent to labour camps in New Caledonia ,
an island in the south Pacific La Commune may have only lasted 70 days , but this laboratory of social and political experimentation , of citizen exaltation , of audacity and courage , paved the way for a better future and translated republican ideals into concrete social and economic goals .
Visionary public policies that were created in this period , such as civil partnerships , the separation of church and state , pay equality , freedom of the press , trade union representation within private firms and a minimum revenue , have now all been accepted and made into laws , some only very recently .
If La Commune teaches one lesson , it is that insurrection is the most sacred of rights and that what is required in politics is , as Danton said : "" De l'audace , encore de l'audace , toujours de l'audace "" ( "" Audacity , still more audacity , and audacity for ever "" ) ."
2011-08-21,"Prosecutors are expected to drop sexual assault and other charges against Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former International Monetary Fund director , at a court hearing on Tuesday .
Lawyers representing Strauss - Kahn 's accuser , Nafissatou Diallo , say she has been summoned to a meeting with prosecutors in New York on Monday which they believe to be a sign that at least some of the charges , including the most serious , will be abandoned .
Diallo alleged that Strauss - Kahn , 62 , attempted to rape her after she went to clean his hotel suite .
The former IMF chief has said that the sexual encounter with Diallo was consensual and has accused her of attempting to extort money .
Diallo 's lawyers believe the Manhattan district attorney 's office will ask the court to drop the charges because her credibility as a witness was eroded after it was revealed she lied on an application for asylum in the US about being raped by soldiers in her native Guinea .
"" My interpretation of that letter is they are going to announce they are dismissing the case entirely , or some of the charges , "" Diallo 's lawyer , Kenneth Thompson , told the New York Times .
"" If they were not going to dismiss the charges there would be no need to meet her .
They would just go to court the next day to say , ' We 're going to proceed with the case . '
"" Thompson criticised the decision : "" The tone of the letter is consistent with the unfair way the Manhattan district attorney 's office has treated Ms Diallo throughout this process .
It 's as if she is the defendant and Strauss - Kahn is the victim . ""
The former IMF chief is still facing a civil suit filed by Diallo a fortnight ago seeking damages for a "" violent and sadistic "" attack ."
2011-08-22,"French Socialists are paving the way for Dominique Strauss - Kahn to return to politics if – as expected – charges of sexual assault against him in New York are dropped on Tuesday , leaving him free to fly home .
Leading members of the Socialist party said a political comeback could be "" envisaged "" if the 62-year - old former head of the IMF wished to take part in next year 's presidential campaign .
Strauss - Kahn was widely tipped to become the next president of France before he was arrested and charged with attacking a maid in a New York hotel four months ago .
Over the weekend , lawyers for Strauss - Kahn 's accuser , Nafissatou Diallo , said she had been summoned to a meeting with prosecutors in New York ahead of a court hearing on Tuesday .
Diallo 's lawyers said they were expecting prosecutors to tell her they were dropping the case .
Although DSK , as he is known in France , missed the July deadline for taking part in the Socialist party 's election to select a candidate , the man who replaced him as favourite –
François Hollande – opened the door on Monday for his return to politics .
Speaking on French radio , Hollande said Strauss - Kahn 's return to politics "" could be envisaged "" .
He told France - Inter Radio : "" Whatever has been said , a man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss - Kahn can be useful to his country in the months and years to come . "" .
Asked whether Strauss - Kahn could take part in the Socialist primaries , he replied : "" That depends on him . ""
Jean - Christophe Cambadélis , a friend of DSK , said it was too early to say what Strauss - Kahn would do .
"" It 's possible the charges will be suspended and Dominique Strauss - Kahn will be cleared , "" he said .
"" This will be justice , because I believe he is innocent of the facts of which he is accused . ""
If he is cleared , let him reconstruct himself after the injustice that has been done to him . ""
Asked if Strauss - Kahn could hypothetically ask for the July deadline for candidates to be set aside and stand in the primaries , a party spokesman said : "" It 's complicated . ""
He added : "" He would need the agreement of all six candidates .
It 's a very hypothetical situation . ""
Several party heavyweights , including Cambadélis and Pierre Moscovici , had previously suggested the deadline for candidates to declare should be delayed to allow DSK a chance to stand if cleared .
Just as Strauss - Kahn 's arrest in May threw the French left into a state of shock and chaos , so his eventual return will almost certainly sow doubt and confusion when the Socialists gather for their annual party conference in the seaside resort of La Rochelle on Friday .
Many of DSK 's closest supporters have since thrown their weight behind one of the six declared primary candidates .
Hollande 's closest rival is Martine Aubry , who had concluded a secret agreement not to run against Strauss - Kahn for the party nomination before his arrest .
The word most used in French newspapers and magazines on Monday was "" blanchi "" , which literally translates as whitened .
As if to emphasise the point , Strauss - Kahn was pictured on the front page of France Soir wearing a whiter - than - white summer T - shirt .
The newspaper referred to his "" nightmare summer "" , adding that DSK "" intends to leave the United States with his head held high "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's biographer , Michel Taubmann – who is in regular contact with him – told France Soir : "" He does n't want to rejoice too quickly .
But for the first time we 've spoken about other things than the case . ""
Even if he is set free , Strauss - Kahn is still facing a possible investigation in France where journalist and writer Tristane Banon , 32 , has accused him of attempted rape .
She claims he jumped on her and behaved like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" when she went to interview him in February 2003 .
A preliminary inquiry is being carried out by the prosecutor 's office to see if there is a case to answer .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers have denied the claims and described the allegation as "" fantasy "" .
Concentrating on the New York allegation , France Soir added : "" The former presidential favourite is beginning to anticipate his return to home and , one day , to political life . ""
However , Jérôme Sainte - Marie , deputy director of the Paris - based opinion pollsters CSA , said the French may not be so willing to welcome him back with open arms .
He told the Guardian : "" Anything can happen , but I think there 's little chance he will be able to return to high level politics .
It will be hard to turn back the clock . ""
According to CSA polls , before 13 May Strauss - Kahn was in a strong position to win next May 's presidential election against Nicolas Sarkozy .
His popularity in the country stood at 50 % , with 30 - 35 % of those asked saying they would vote for him in the first round of the presidential election and 60 - 65 % saying they would vote for him in the second round , giving him a clear victory .
His popularity fell to 26 % in June but rallied to 32 % in July when doubts about the credibility of his accuser led to him being released from house arrest .
His figures then dropped to a new low of 25 % this month .
There was little difference in the opinions of men and women .
Sainte - Marie said : "" The fact that 25 % of people still have a good opinion of him after all we have learned is surprising , but he was enormously popular to start with . ""
The moral aspect of this does n't matter very much at all .
French people do n't care about the sex or sentimental lives of their politicians – what does matter is a lack of credibility , a lack of seriousness , particularly at a time of financial storms . ""
Sainte - Marie said the French had "" learned too much "" about DSK , who before the incident in the Sofitel in New York had a reputation as a "" chaud lapin "" ( hot bunny ) and womaniser . ""
French people want someone reliable as president , and however brilliant he is they are not prepared to accept someone who can not control himself or who puts his personal appetite before affairs of state , "" Sainte - Marie said ."
2011-08-23,"The sexual assault prosecution of Dominique Strauss - Kahn had not even been dropped before the French Socialist party celebrations began .
Martine Aubry , who may be the party 's candidate against Nicolas Sarkozy in nine months ' time , described the New York court 's decision as an "" immense relief "" and declared that "" we were all waiting for this , for him to finally be able to get out of this nightmare "" .
François Hollande , Mme Aubry 's main rival , agreed that "" a man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss - Kahn can be useful "" .
And Harlem Désir , the party 's interim general secretary , expressed satisfaction at a "" happy outcome "" .
What kind of world do these leaders of the Socialist party live in ?
No one who reads the original prosecution complaint against Mr Strauss - Kahn and the New York prosecutors ' 25-page request for the case to be dismissed could possibly make such reckless remarks .
Yesterday 's dismissal did not find that no sexual encounter occurred between the ex - head of the IMF and the hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo .
There was reliable forensic evidence of a real and rapid encounter , and Ms Diallo quickly reported the incident .
The case ended because it had become a "" he - said - she - said "" dispute and because Ms Diallo 's reliability as a witness had collapsed .
As the prosecutors put it : "" The nature and number of the complainant 's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt , whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant . ""
The outcome , as so often in rape cases , should cause not "" immense relief "" but immense unease .
To drop the case against Mr Strauss - Kahn was nevertheless the right legal decision .
But it does not justify the wholly inappropriate tone of vindication expressed by so many French Socialists and it does not justify the tendency of so much of the French governing class to debate the DSK affair as a purely political event devoid of moral content .
Mr Strauss - Kahn is entitled to the presumption of innocence , but he has not been exonerated , as a commentator on French television falsely claimed last night .
He has been freed on a technicality , albeit a vital one .
Mr Strauss - Kahn 's modernising roles in the often difficult debates in the post - Mitterrand Socialist party and , more recently , his work as an innovative head of the IMF in crucial times deserve real credit .
But his public career is over .
It should not be resuscitated .
He can not again command the respect required by a senior minister , let alone a head of state .
One Berlusconi is enough .
A rehabilitation of Mr Strauss - Kahn would dishonour the French left .
The Socialist party has enough problems without humiliating itself in such a disturbing manner ."
2011-08-23,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , one of France 's leading politicians , walked free from a New York courtroom after a judge dropped charges against him for allegedly sexually assaulting a hotel maid .
The move brings to an end a dramatic legal tussle that has gripped both sides of the Atlantic and could resurrect the former French presidential hopeful 's seemingly dead political career in France .
Prosecutors for Manhattan 's district attorney Cyrus Vance told justice Michael Obus of State Supreme Court in Manhattan that they could not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt because of serious credibility issues with Nafissatou Diallo , the hotel housekeeper who had accused Strauss - Kahn , the former chief of the International Monetary Fund , of sexually assaulting her .
In court Joan Illuzzi - Orbon , the assistant district attorney , called Diallo 's testimony "" surreal "" and said she lied to prosecutors on numerous occasions , even denying she had made statements previously witnessed by several law officials .
Obus told the packed court he would comply with a request from the prosecution to throw out the case : "" The indictment is dismissed .
"" There was initially some confusion after lawyers for Diallo appealed against the judge 's decision not to appoint a special prosecutor .
That appeal was quickly dismissed .
After the judgment Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers praised the decision but attacked the fact that the case had gone so far .
Benjamin Brafman said : "" This was not a forcible encounter … This case was treated as a crime when it was not . ""
Brafman also spoke of the toll the process had taken on the accused .
He called it a "" horrific nightmare "" and said Strauss - Kahn and his family had handled the ordeal with "" class "" .
Another defence lawyer , William Taylor , attacked Strauss - Kahn 's treatment by the US justice system and the media .
"" What a tragedy in the life of Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
This is not about wealth nor power nor race …
There was a collective rush to judgment by not only law enforcement but also by the media , "" said Taylor .
Such sentiments cut little ice with the large groups of protesters gathered outside court .
Many were against Strauss - Kahn , waving placards and chanting slogans such as "" DSK !
Shame on you ! ""
As Strauss - Kahn left the building , one woman screamed at him : ""
You dirty bastard !
You dirty bastard ! ""
Outside court Ken Thompson , Diallo 's lawyer , attacked the ruling . ""
No man , no matter how much power , money and influence he has , has a right to sexually assault a woman , "" Thompson said .
"" We are disappointed that District Attorney Vance apparently does not believe in equal justice under the law and has denied an innocent woman a day in court . ""
Michael Greys , co - founder of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement , was furious at the dismissal .
"" American justice is not blind , "" he said .
"" Race and class still play a part .
This was a case of a millionaire against a poor black woman with no education . ""
Rudy Dent , another Diallo supporter said the decision was down to "" plantation politics . ""
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , was arrested in May after Diallo , 32 , said he had forced her to perform oral sex when she arrived to clean his suite at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
The French Socialist party veteran was arrested on a plane scheduled to fly to Paris .
Strauss - Kahn has never contested the fact that a sexual encounter took place but has denied claims it was forced .
He should soon be free to return to France , where the authorities are investigating claims that he tried to rape a French journalist , Tristane Banon , in 2003 .
His lawyers have dismissed her accusations as "" fantasy "" .
Her lawyer David Koubbi , who travelled to New York to see prosecutor Cyrus Vance and meet Diallo , said he was dismayed by the decision to drop the sexual assault charges against Strauss - Kahn .
"" I regret this outcome .
I regret it for Nafissatou Diallo because I believed what she said , "" he said .
"" I spoke to Tristane on Monday evening by telephone then during the night , then this morning [ Tuesday ] .
"" She is in a fighting mood .
She is n't ready to let this drop .
But she feels sorry for what has happened to Nafissatou Diallo because she also believed her . ""
He added : "" The credibility of my client is not , and has never been , called into question because of this . ""
The office of the Manhattan district attorney initially called Diallo 's statement "" compelling "" , stressing that she had provided "" very powerful details "" .
Her story was buttressed by forensic evidence : his semen was found on her uniform and her lawyer said doctors had taken photographs of her bruised vagina .
But the case started unravelling after prosecutors said Diallo had lied to them and other US officials about her past , including giving a false account of having been gang - raped in her native Guinea .
Diallo told interviewers she had used the false story to get herself and her daughter a chance of a better life in the US .
There were also discrepancies in what happened after the alleged attack .
She told a grand jury she had stayed in the hallway outside Strauss - Kahn 's room after the attack when evidence showed she had actually returned to his room , and to another one , before consulting her boss .
It then emerged she had discussed Strauss - Kahn 's wealth in a recorded phone conversation after the supposed attack .
In her defence , Diallo 's lawyers said prosecutors were misinterpreting the conversation , conducted in Fulani , her native language , and that her account of the assault during the call had not differed .
A court document filed on Monday by prosecutors contained a devastating and detailed account of how Diallo had misled investigators .
"" In virtually every substantive interview with prosecutors , despite entreaties to simply be truthful , she has not been truthful on matters great and small , "" the document said , adding that the cumulative effect of Diallo 's misleading statements would prove "" devastating "" at any jury trial on the case .
"" If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt , we can not ask a jury to do so , "" the document said .
The battle between Diallo and Strauss - Kahn was not fought entirely in the courts , with media coverage probably causing lasting damage to his career .
As Vance 's team appeared to turn against her , Diallo went public .
She gave up her anonymity to air her side of the story in Newsweek and on ABC .
Diallo repeated the details of the attack and said that while she had made some mistakes , these should not dissuade prosecutors from fighting her case .
She then sued Strauss - Kahn on 8 Augustin civil court , a move that legal experts said made Vance 's position even more difficult : the Frenchman 's lawyers claimed the suit proved she was out for money .
However , the civil case is continuing , is unaffected legally by the dropping of criminal charges , and has a lesser burden of proof .
Diallo 's lawyers will have to prove merely that it was "" more likely than not "" that Strauss - Kahn committed an assault .
Ron Kuby , a criminal defence and civil rights lawyer , said Vance and Diallo had badly mishandled the criminal case .
"" From the beginning Cyrus Vance did everything wrong that it was possible to do wrong , and for the worst possible reasons , "" he said .
"" It was a tragedy of error and hubris . ""
However , the embattled DA has the support of his respected predecessor , Robert Morgenthau , who has defended his actions and decisions in the case .
"" The most important attribute I looked for in hiring junior prosecutors was a strong ethical sense .
The recent actions from the district attorney 's office show me that these attributes are alive and well , "" he said ."
2011-08-23,"The French writer and journalist who claims Dominique Strauss - Kahn attempted to rape her eight years ago is more determined than ever to bring him to justice , her lawyer said on Tuesday .
Tristane Banon claims the former IMF chief sexually assaulted her when she went to interview him for a book she was writing in 2003 .
Banon , 32 , who was friends with Strauss - Kahn 's daughter Camille and is a goddaughter of his second wife , described his behaviour as "" like a rutting chimpanzee "" .
Her lawyer David Koubbi , who travelled to New York to see prosecutor Cyrus Vance and meet Nafissatou Diallo , said he was dismayed by the New York prosecutor 's decision to drop the sexual assault charges against the politician .
"" I regret this outcome .
I regret it for Nafissatou Diallo because I believed what she said , "" he said .
"" I spoke to Tristane on Monday evening by telephone , then during the night , then this morning [ Tuesday ] .
She is in a fighting mood .
She is n't ready to let this drop .
But she feels sorry for what has happened to Nafissatou Diallo because she also believed her . ""
He added : "" The credibility of my client is not , and has never been , called into question because of this . ""
Banon 's allegations are the subject of a preliminary inquiry that Koubbi said had "" not yet been completed "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's Paris lawyers have dismissed her accusations as "" fantasy "" .
"" The DSK affair in France has only just begun , "" Koubbi said , adding that the "" self - congratulatory "" statements from members of Strauss - Kahn 's Socialist party who defended their former presidential hope , showed a "" crass indecency "" ."

2011-08-23,"Maybe one day , in the pitiless light of hindsight , it will become clear why a woman 's false statements about her immigration status , made years ago , were deemed more pertinent to an accusation of attempted rape than the vaginal bruising she allegedly incurred during the encounter itself .
To be fair , it was not just the fact that Nafissatou Diallo made false claims about her background that undermined her credibility to the point that on Monday the Manhattan district attorney decided to tell the judge to drop the charges Diallo made against Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
There were other factors , and not just those proffered by Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein , who argued – wrongly – that economists do n't commit sex crimes , and , of course , friend to all famous male victims of the American justice system , Bernard - Henri Lévy .
He insisted – also wrongly – that "" grand hotels "" always send in "" a cleaning brigade "" .
Diallo has been shown to have told lies in her life , certainly .
None of these lies , though , had anything to do with her version of what happened in room 2806 in the Sofitel , a version that has been backed up by forensic evidence ( see footnote ) .
First , her lie about her immigration status was that she had been – gotcha !
–
gang raped .
But the reason she lied then was that she thought it would help her gain political asylum .
Her motivation for doing so now is decidedly less clear .
The much- repeated story about her telling a friend on the phone that she was planning to bilk Strauss - Kahn has since been rubbished by her lawyer as a poor translation , and anyway , her actions since suggest she is the world 's worst blackmailer .
When she waived her right to anonymity , she not only gave the defence more material to mine for inconsistencies but gained no money and risked – heck , guaranteed – damaging her personal reputation and employment prospects for life .
Moreover , she sure wo n't be able to try that ol' rape accusation trick on any other unsuspecting man .
She did not think this plan through .
Her recall ( under great emotional stress , whether she was lying or not ) of the chronology of what happened precisely after the alleged assault altered slightly and that was offered up as further proof of her unreliability and , as far as I know , there is no definitive guide to how anyone behaves after a sexual assault .
A French attorney told the Guardian on Monday that "" It 's not that he [ the DA ] does n't believe her , it 's that he does n't believe her to be a good victim . ""
A woman who gets intoxicated can be raped .
Prostitutes can be raped .
And a poor woman who has told lies can be raped .
In fact , it is often the women who "" do n't make good victims "" who are most at risk because they are the most vulnerable , and it is these women who are least likely to be listened to .
Diallo 's past proved to be more incriminating than Strauss - Kahn 's , a man with an infamously predatory reputation towards women , and who has since been accused of another sexual assault by a French writer .
In an interview with the Swiss magazine L'illustré , a former mistress of Strauss - Kahn said that Diallo 's description of how he grabbed her "" encouraged me to believe this woman "" .
But all too often in rape cases , the principle of presumption of innocence for the accused tips into assumption of guilt for the accuser .
Rape accusations – like abortions , or becoming a single mother – are not something most women do for a lark , squeezing them in between mani - pedis and Pilates or , in the case of Diallo , cleaning another man 's toilet .
That Diallo lied about a rape in order to gain asylum in America where she has since been so humiliated by a "" sexual encounter "" is just one of the bitter ironies here .
Despite the efforts of the DA and Strauss - Kahn 's defence team , a trial most certainly did happen : it just happened to be a trial of the accuser rather than the accused .
Strauss - Khan has denied the allegations , and what occurred in room 2806 will never be known .
What has been proved , on an international scale , is that only women who have led lives as sheltered as Rapunzel and have memory recall as robotic as computers are capable of being raped .
The rest are money- grabbing sluts with vaginal bruising .
The F - bomb is a Linguistic Bingo election winner While Linguistic Bingo may lack the drama of a good game of Cluedo , it can be at least as instructive as The Game of Life .
It involves predicting words that will be uttered during an event – prime ministerial press conferences after national rioting ( "" society "" , "" single mothers "" , "" punish "" , etc ) , say , or Celebrity Big Brother ( "" me "" , "" me "" , "" me "" ) – and ticking them off accordingly .
So with the US presidential election underway , let 's rack up the Linguistic Bingo .
Maybe it will distract from the homophobia and misogyny that is now such a cornerstone of the Republican party 's campaign strategy .
There 's "" job creation "" , a cod - English term which apparently sponsors Michele Bachmann , judging from her fondness for it .
Then there are all the predictable ones , such as "" economy growth "" , "" immigration disaster "" and "" take our country back "" .
( Did these people never watch Sesame Street ?
Learn to share , GOP ! )
But , easily , the word to listen out for most of all is "" folks "" .
Oh boy , American politicians – Democrats and Republicans – love dropping the F - bomb !
It conjures up simple , humble people who probably look like they 've stepped out of American Gothic .
It is the Plumber Joe of vocabulary , shorthand to prove the speaker is really in touch with the concerns of Real America , no matter how many houses they have .
And in an election in which millionaire and billionaire GOP candidates are asking rural America to vote for them to keep their taxes low , this word – spoken through expensively whitened teeth – is a surefire Linguistic Bingo winner .

The following was printed in the corrections and clarifications column on 5 September 2011 : An article about the dropping of a sexual assault case against the former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss - Kahn said that the complainant 's version of events had been backed up by forensic evidence .
To clarify , the document filed by the Manhattan district attorney 's office recommending that the charges against Strauss - Kahn be dismissed said that although physical and other evidence conclusively established that he had engaged in a sexual encounter with the complainant it did not prove that their encounter was forcible or non - consensual and failed to corroborate certain aspects of the complainant 's account"
2011-08-24,"The spectacular collapse of the rape case against Dominique Strauss - Kahn has prompted a bout of soul - searching in France amid fresh debate over how clean the former presidential hopeful has emerged from his American "" ordeal "" .
As Strauss - Kahn celebrated his victory and prepared to collect his passport from police in New York , friends and supporters in France declared him blanchi – literally whitened – cleared and vindicated after accusations that had blackened his name and stymied his attempt to become the next president of France in 2012 .
Others , even those from the traditional left , believe that the Socialists ' one - time "" providential man "" will fly home less blanchi and more a grubby shade of grey .
Commentators veered between outrage at Strauss - Kahn being paraded in handcuffs after his arrest in May and admiration for the US justice system 's dealing with the case rapidly and letting him go .
The philosopher Daniel Salvatore Schiffer , a Strauss - Kahn defender , described the court 's decision as "" courageous and honest "" and said it had allowed the emergence of "" if not the truth , which we will probably never know … at least impartiality . ""
But Le Monde pointed out that Strauss - Kahn , 62 , who was forced to quit as head of the International Monetary Fund , had not been "" totally whitened "" as the case had been dropped because of a lack of witnesses or proof that the "" hasty sexual relations "" between him and chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo were forced .
On the eve of the Socialist party 's summer conference in the seaside town of La Rochelle , where six rival candidates for the presidential nomination will gather this weekend , some felt the return of the left 's former champion was an unwelcome distraction .
Most of his supporters are now backing other candidates , including frontrunners François Hollande and Martine Aubry .
Hollande has spoken of Strauss - Kahn 's economic expertise being "" useful to his country "" but nobody is seriously suggesting the rules of the primary election be altered to allow him to stand .
Le Monde believed the events in New York had put paid to Strauss - Kahn 's 2012 presidential ambitions , having "" lifted a veil on aspects of his personality , his relations with women and with money "" . ""
Like most French male politicians he felt protected by our tradition of respect for private matters , "" it wrote , adding that he was the "" victim of his own carelessness "" .
An editorial by essayist Pascal Bruckner in the newspaper , headlined "" The DSK affair reveals a sad image of America "" , highlighted the cultural chasm between French views of sex and relationships and those of "" Les Anglo - Saxons "" .
Bruckner described a sheriff on a Florida beach ordering him to cover his naked two - year - old daughter , as an example of the US 's "" problem with sex "" , which he described as "" twisted puritanism "" resulting from the alliance of "" feminism and the Republican right "" .
France 's national philosopher , Bernard - Henri Lévy , who outraged many with a string of outbursts in which he described the treatment of his friend in America as "" utterly grotesque "" because he was "" not some commoner "" , was equally outspoken .
In an extraordinary interview with Nice Matin newspaper he described the chambermaid 's defence as "" a masquerade "" and said her lawyer had "" reached the summits of obscenity "" .
Many French papers have contrived to portray Strauss - Kahn as the victim of a mendacious , money - grabbing woman and a foreign legal system .
A front - page cartoon in Le Monde after Diallo 's lawyers launched a civil suit against Strauss - Kahn showed her vacuuming bank notes from DSK 's pockets .
The affair also led to qualms about Strauss - Kahn and his heiress wife Anne Sinclair 's "" gauche caviar "" lifestyle .
That they were paying more than £ 30,000 a month for a Manhattan townhouse , £ 170,000 a month for detectives and lawyers and had produced more than £ 3.5 m in bail guarantees sat uneasily with some Socialists .
Another stain yet to be blanchi is the attempted rape investigation Strauss - Kahn faces in France .
The journalist and writer Tristane
Banon claims he assaulted her when she went to interview him in 2003 , accusing him of behaving like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" , allegations his lawyers have dismissed as "" fantasy "" .
"" Sex , lies and a case dismissal , "" wrote the tabloid France Soir . ""
But DSK has n't yet completely finished with the justice system .
""
Strauss - Kahn seemed in no hurry to return home .
On Tuesday night he celebrated his victory at L'Artusi , a fashionable restaurant in Manhattan 's West Village , with his wife and daughter .
Lawyers said he intended to spend his first full day of freedom retrieving his passport from prosecutors and might then head to Washington , where he has a townhouse in Georgetown .
"" I 'm looking forward to going back to France very soon , "" Strauss - Kahn said outside the $ 50,000-a - month Tribeca townhouse he rented while facing the assault charges .
Ken Thompson , Diallo 's lawyer , told CNN his client was "" devastated "" by the verdict . ""
She has told the truth about what happened in that hotel room .
She ca n't understand why Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance would abandon her .
She and her daughter have been crying through the night , "" he said .
Diallo intends to pursue her civil action against Strauss - Kahn but his lawyers are confident that they can fend that off too . ""
She does n't have much , if any , chance in a civil case .
The same difficulties , the same lies will come back to haunt her in a civil case , "" said his attorney William Taylor .
Vance refused to answer questions about whether he would bring perjury charges against Diallo .
He is facing political fallout for his handling of the case .
Senator Bill Perkins , a Democrat representing Harlem and a vocal supporter of Diallo , said the case had been "" mishandled "" .
Before the decision he wrote that if the charges were dismissed , it would be "" a travesty for all rape victims and for ' due process ' . """
2011-08-26,"As the French Socialist party gathered for its conference on La Rochelle waterfront , the souvenir postcard stand still featured a pile of black - and - white portraits of a grinning Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
But delegates seemed to be avoiding them .
Days after a New York prosecutor dropped all the charges against Strauss - Kahn for allegedly attempting to rape an immigrant hotel maid , the one - time saviour of the French left remained far from welcome among his own party 's grassroots .
"" I 'm terrified he 'll turn up here , "" whispered a 50-year - old regional councillor from rural south - west France , who did not want to be named .
"" If he wants the party to win next year 's presidential election , he 'll stay well away , "" she added .
"" This whole Strauss - Kahn affair is far from over .
Politically , he 's fried .
I do n't know how he could come back knowing what we now know about his behaviour .
Whatever the truth about these allegations , the whole party was blackened by this saga , its credibility was put on the line .
"" Only three months ago , Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund and a former French finance minister , was tipped to beat Nicolas Sarkozy in the presidential election in 2012 .
His hopes of being nominated as the Socialist 's candidate next year are now utterly dead .
But released from bail , Strauss - Kahn has said he is desperate to return to France and "" normal life "" as soon as possible .
He has been given back his passport and this weekend flies to Washington , where his millionaire TV journalist wife will put their townhouse on the market before , as expected , they return to Paris in around a week .
First , Strauss - Kahn is expected to visit the IMF to say goodbye to his former staff .
He had also considered speaking out about his views on the global financial crisis to claw back his economic prestige , but all this has been postponed to avoid overshadowing the Socialists ' conference .
Strauss - Kahn has also promised to publicly explain himself to the French , but whether this will happen remains uncertain .
Any account of events that took place in the Sofitel hotel room on 14 May would be difficult , given the public outrage about aspects of his private life .
The French feminist backlash has not abated , and many continue to question how a nine - minute encounter in a hotel room between two complete strangers , a powerful man and a poor hotel worker , could have been consensual .
Strauss - Kahn will not have an easy landing in France .
A poll on Friday found 80 % of people do not want him to play any role in the Socialist primary race to choose a presidential candidate .
If the party elite confidently rushed to proclaim their joy and relief after the New York case was dropped this week , it illustrated how far they are from public feeling .
French voters are sceptical over the confusing and unresolved affair .
Strauss - Kahn 's private life and treatment of women has been pored over , his reputation tarnished .
The French justice system also continues to investigate a complaint by the writer Tristane Banon , who said Strauss - Kahn tried to rape her during a 2003 interview .
A court in the Bronx in New York is still to examine a civil case for damages by the hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo .
Her lawyers have now also filed a complaint in France alleging that an official in Sarcelles , where Strauss - Kahn was once mayor , attempted to bribe one of their witnesses .
They said a French woman contacted them with evidence about Strauss - Kahn 's behaviour to support their case .
Her family was then contacted by an official close to Strauss - Kahn 's camp who asked "" how much "" she wanted to keep quiet .
An inquiry for witness bribery was opened in France this week .
Amid this backdrop , Socialist party activists in La Rochelle were jittery about what role Strauss - Kahn might try to play in the open primary race .
The vote will take place in early October and the frontrunners , two former party leaders , François Hollande and Martine Aubry , are currently trying not to live up to the cut - throat war of personal attacks the party is famous for .
Socialists fear any public comments or position taking by Strauss - Kahn will alienate voters , particularly women , and bring a new round of ego battles that the party is trying to calm .
Jean Lemarié , a former France Telecom worker , Normandy councillor and party activist for 30 years said : "" Judicially and politically , Strauss - Kahn ca n't come back .
All that we 've learnt about his personality and behaviour these past three months , party activists and the party do n't like that .
But he could play a role as an adviser behind the scenes , or even publicly . ""
"" He 's dead , politically , "" lamented one 61-year - old socialist activist who said it was a "" big loss "" for the party . ""
Finally , we had found someone who could present a moderate - left programme without scaring the right .
Someone who could win .
But he ca n't make a come back politically before the civil case is over . ""
"" If he had been found innocent by a jury , things would be easier , "" said another activist of the prosecutors ' decision to drop charges based on doubts over the credibility of the hotel maid .
"" What we point out is that he has not actually been cleared by a court , the charges have been dropped on a technicality , "" said Patricia Perennes , an economist and activist who was at the La Rochelle
stand for the feminist group Osez Le Féminisme .
But Gerard Tourette , a former post office worker and activist in Averyon , was banking on French voters ' short memories , claiming that perhaps not now but in a few years , Strauss - Kahn could be back .
"" We 'll need him as an adviser in the primary race .
His expertise will be useful .
But I do n't want him to speak publicly , everything that 's happened means he 'll have to stay in the shadows .
In the future , I could see him as a minister , or senator , even head of the senate . """
2011-08-27,"On the first night of Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's house arrest in New York , his wife , Anne Sinclair , sent out for dinner .
The couple were in a luxury Tribeca pad while he awaited trial on charges of sexual assault and the attempted rape of a hotel chambermaid .
After Strauss - Kahn 's sojourn in the notorious Rikers Island jail , the 63-year - old Sinclair , who had been a TV star in France , was determined that her husband should have some proper food .
So she telephoned the upmarket Landmarc bistro nearby and ordered £ 150 worth of steak and salads .
Posterity does not record how she asked for the steak to be cooked .
Still , it might be fair to assume that given the steely tenacity with which she has faced down the most tumultuous episode in her marriage so far , Ms Sinclair probably wanted it bloody or , as the French would have it , saignant . ""
She is a woman with a lot of character , a lot of force , "" says Renaud Revel , the author of Madame DSK :
Un destin brisé , a recent biography of Sinclair . ""
She has an extremely resilient temperament .
I have known her , on and off , for 25 years and I have a lot of respect and admiration for her .
What I found , while researching the book , was that she has an impeccable reputation , both professionally and personally .
She 's very loyal , very straight , she does what she says , she does n't cheat .
"" Unlike , it seems , her errant husband .
For years , Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has been trailed by a swarm of women claiming to have been seduced by him .
In 2008 , the socialist politician Aurélie Filipetti said that Strauss - Kahn had made a "" very heavy , very insistent "" attempt to bed her and that she "" arranged to never find myself alone with him in a closed space "" .
Then there was a European journalist who claimed Strauss - Kahn would give her an interview only if she spent the weekend with him , and French writer Tristane Banon , whose legal complaint against him for attempted rape is still being investigated by the Parisian authorities .
Even his allies admit that Strauss - Kahn is "" le grand séducteur "" .
Behind the scenes at the IMF there was concern that his sexual predilections were , in the words of one former colleague , "" an addiction "" .
Yet , throughout , his wife has stood by him : a dignified , silent , supportive presence .
When a close friend , over lunch , had the temerity to suggest she should consider leaving Strauss - Kahn , Sinclair is said to have stormed out .
According to Revel , when her husband was arrested in May after a Guinean chambermaid working in the Sofitel New York hotel made an allegation of attempted rape , Sinclair was shopping for shoes on the rue Saint - Honoré .
She received a call from her husband while getting ready for a friend 's birthday party in which Strauss - Kahn spoke of a "" serious problem "" .
Immediately , Sinclair is said to have rung Stéphane Fouks , the head of a publicity firm and a friend , for advice .
But it was only when she was in a taxi , returning from the party at around midnight , that her phone rang again
and she learned the exact nature of that "" serious problem "" .
Her reaction was not , as one might expect , one of anger .
Instead , she stayed up until dawn , calling everyone she knew in New York to ensure top - level legal representation for her husband .
Then she flew out to be with him and promptly posted $ 1 m bail in cash and a further $ 5 m insurance bond .
She is said to have told friends : "" Listen , I have maybe 20 years left to live .
I want to live them by his side . ""
In an official statement , she declared : "" I do n't believe for a single second the accusations of sexual assault by my husband .
I am certain his innocence will be proven . ""
Last week , after three months of legal toing and froing , that certainty was rewarded .
When prosecutors dropped all charges against Strauss - Kahn , the couple emerged from the courtroom to make their way through the waiting journalists .
Sinclair , dressed in her trademark black , hair pushed neatly behind her ears , allowed herself a small but noticeable smile .
As ever , she was standing by her man – to the bafflement of many on this side of the Channel .
"" It 's interesting because there is a cultural divide , "" says Agnès Poirier , a French cultural commentator .
"" It looks quite Anglo - Saxon to say , ' My husband or wife cheated on me , I ask for a divorce . '
For the French , it 's a bit immature .
If you love someone , you accept their weaknesses . ""
But surely , with Strauss - Kahn , it goes beyond an occasional weakness ?
"" It 's true that , as we say in France , she 's had to ' swallow a lot of snakes ' since being married to Dominique Strauss - Kahn , "" acknowledges Poirier .
"" He seems to be a serial cheat .
But perhaps she 's in love !
Love works in mysterious ways , but here are two extremely bright people and I think she 's in love with his intelligence , as he is with hers . ""
Anne Sinclair was born Anne - Élise Schwartz in New York to French - Jewish parents who had fled the Nazis during the Second World War .
The family , who later changed their name to Sinclair , returned to their native France in the 1950s and their daughter went on to study politics at the elite Sciences Po ( Paris Institute of Political Studies ) before graduating in law from the University of Paris .
Her first job was as a radio presenter for Europe 1 , where she met and fell in love with Ivan Levaï , the political chief of the station , whom she later married .
In the 1970s , she moved into television , working her way up steadily in the industry , earning her stripes as an interviewer .
From 1984 to 1997 , she hosted 7/7 , a weekly political show that had one of the largest audiences in France .
She interviewed Mikhail Gorbachev , Jacques Chirac , Bill Clinton , as well as Madonna and Sharon Stone .
Sinclair became one of the most recognised journalists in France .
For the Daily Beast , the former editor - in - chief of French Vogue , Joan Juliet Buck , wrote : "" With her curly black hair , blue eyes , pale skin and curves , she gave off an aura of relaxed sexuality … she was , in a way , Oprah for French guys : a thinking minority woman with a great rack who could understand them and make them famous . ""
But she was more than that .
For a generation of young French women , Sinclair was an inspiration , someone who had made it to the top of a male - dominated profession on her own terms .
An extensive profile in the French magazine Télérama in 2003 talked to former colleagues , including secretaries and assistants , and found not one person with a bad word to say about her .
She was "" adorable "" , "" funny , "" "" affectionate , "" "" charismatic "" and "" maternal "" .
Her friend , Catherine Clément , the French philosopher and novelist , called her a "" real Yiddish mama "" .
It is rare in an industry as bitchy as television to find such consensus . ""
In contrast to a lot of women in TV , she has no ego , "" explains Revel .
"" She 's transparent [ in her dealings ] .
The French adore her for it . ""
Sinclair met Strauss - Kahn , then the president of France 's finance commission , when she interviewed him in 1989 .
Despite both being married ( Strauss - Kahn was on his second wife and had four daughters ; Sinclair had two sons with Levaï ) , it was love at first sight .
The couple divorced their spouses and married in 1991 .
"" There was an immediate closeness , "" Sinclair recalled in an interview with Paris Match .
"" It was like we 'd come from the same village , as if we 'd known each other always . ""
Six years later , when Strauss - Kahn became the French finance minister , Sinclair gave up her career in order to avoid a conflict of interest .
From the beginning , says Revel , Sinclair was "" ambitious for him .
She always considered his political destiny to be the Elysée "" .
She was able to provide the connections and the money to fund his campaigns – Sinclair , the granddaughter of art dealer Paul Rosenberg who represented Picasso , is an heiress and owns a priceless art collection .
The couple have two apartments in Paris , a house in Marrakech and a house in Washington DC 's Georgetown district , from where Sinclair writes an influential blog ( suspended since May ) .
Before his arrest in New York , the French polls put Strauss - Kahn , who was about to declare his candidacy , 20 points ahead of Nicolas Sarkozy for the 2012 presidential election .
Sinclair was deemed twice as popular as Carla Bruni - Sarkozy .
According to friends cited in New York magazine , Sinclair "" always wanted to prove that , more than 75 years after Léon Blum became France 's first Jewish prime minister , the French would again be willing to elect a Jew "" .
This time , it would have been as president .
For the moment , that ambition has been put on hold .
But it would be a mistake to undermine Sinclair 's determination .
Her support of Strauss - Kahn comes not out of weakness , but from a fierce loyalty and an ironclad conviction of the rightness of her actions and beliefs .
If she ever decided to enter politics , she would be a real force to be reckoned with ."
2011-09-04,"Four months ago he was the man tipped to become the next president of France .
On Sunday , Dominique Strauss - Kahn returned to Paris , his political career in tatters after being arrested and charged with the attempted rape of a New York hotel maid .
To some he comes back "" blanchi "" – whitened – after the sex charges were dropped because of doubts about the credibility of the maid who was found to have lied in her immigration application to the United States .
To others , he is less a returning hero and more a political embarrassment at a time when his colleagues in France 's Socialist party are trying to come up with a credible candidate to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in next year 's presidential election .
Strauss - Kahn also faces questioning by Paris police about allegations he attempted to rape Tristane Banon , a young French novelist and journalist , when she went to interview him in 2003 .
The former head of the International Monetary Fund was given star treatment when he stepped off an Air France flight at Charles de Gaulle airport on Sunday morning , flanked by his wife , the former television presenter and heiress Anne Sinclair .
Riot police kept back crowds of journalists and supporters as the couple beamed and waved before driving to one of their homes in the French capital , on the chic Place des Vosges , where they were forced to push through another media scrum to reach the front door .
The last time Strauss - Kahn , 62 had boarded an Air France flight from New York to Paris , on 13 May , he was pulled out of first class by police shortly before take - off .
Officers were investigating claims he had forced the maid , Nafissatou Diallo , 32 , whom he had never met before , to perform oral sex in his suite at the Sofitel in the city a few hours earlier .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers argued the sex – which lasted approximately seven minutes between the time Diallo entered the room and Strauss - Kahn phoned his daughter to say he was on his way for lunch – was consensual .
French commentators were outraged when Strauss - Kahn was paraded by New York police wearing handcuffs after his arrest and then thrown into jail for almost a week .
He spent six weeks under house arrest in a Manhattan property reportedly costing $ 50,000 ( £ 30,800 ) a month , before being released on bail .
Prosecutors finally dropped the case a fortnight ago saying they no longer trusted the maid , a Guinean immigrant , who is suing Strauss - Kahn in a civil case .
Strauss - Kahn has never spoken publicly about the New York scandal or about Banon 's rape allegation , which his lawyers have described as "" pure fantasy "" .
The French prosecutor has ordered a preliminary inquiry before deciding whether Strauss - Kahn should be put under formal investigation .
Banon 's mother , Anne Mansouret , told Associated Press that his return was "" a good thing for my daughter 's complaint because he will have to answer to police "" .
But she described it as "" profoundly indecent "" that he was returning to a homecoming like "" a star "" .
Strauss - Kahn has been painted as a brilliant economist and politician in France .
However the Socialists , who at first welcomed the release of their one - time presidential hope , have been distancing themselves from him .
Martine Aubry , contender for the Socialist 's presidential primaries in October , caused a storm when she told Canal+ television last week : "" I think the same thing as many women regarding Strauss - Kahn 's attitude towards women . ""
Michel Rocard , a former Socialist prime minister , told the same station : "" The man obviously has a mental illness , trouble controlling his impulses .
He 's out of the game .
It 's a shame .
He had real talent , that 's true . ""
An IFOP poll carried out 10 days ago found that about two - thirds of French voters did not want Strauss - Kahn to return to a high - profile role in politics .
However , Strauss - Kahn still has a hardcore of fans : Gregoire Vandevelde , a former student of the one - time economics professor , belted out "" Dominique ! Dominique !
accompanied by a Verdi opera on a portable stereo at the airport .
"" I support him completely , "" he told journalists . ""
He is brilliant , full of humour and very competent [ and ] warm with his students . """
2011-09-12,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn has been interviewed by French police investigating a second attempted rape allegation .
The former head of the International Monetary Fund was questioned on Monday morning by officers carrying out a preliminary inquiry into allegations he attacked the novelist and journalist Tristane Banon when she went to interview him in 2003 .
Banon , now 32 , claims Strauss - Kahn , 62 , leapt on her and behaved like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" , accusations his lawyers describe as "" fantasy "" .
Strauss - Kahn was quizzed by police just over a week after he arrived back in France from New York .
Charges that he had sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a New York hotel maid , Nafissatou Diallo , were dropped after questions about her credibility were raised when it was revealed she had lied to immigration officers in order to stay in the United States .
Diallo is now bringing a civil suit .
In a statement , Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers said he had asked to be interviewed by police as a "" witness "" in the Banon case .
Friends of the former socialist presidential hopeful said he wanted to "" close the [ Banon ] affair "" .
The prosecutor 's office has until next month to decide whether to formally put Strauss - Kahn under investigation .
In a recent message on her Facebook page , Banon said she was full of "" nausea "" since Strauss - Kahn 's return to France .
According to reports , several women protested outside his home in the chic Place des Vosges in Paris at the weekend , demanding that he does not return to politics ."
2011-09-18,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn insisted there was no "" aggression or constraint "" involved in his sex with a hotel chambermaid who accused him of attempted rape , but admitted he was guilty of a "" moral fault "" .
In his first public explanation of events leading up to his arrest in New York in May and imprisonment on charges – later dropped – of attacking the woman , Strauss - Kahn swung from punchy to contrite .
The chambermaid , Nafissatou Diallo , a single mother from Guinea , had , he insisted , "" lied about everything "" .
"" That 's what the prosecutor 's report says .
You have to read it carefully , "" he told news presenter Claire Chazal , a friend of his wife , the former television star and wealthy heiress Anne Sinclair , during the prime - time 8 pm news programme on TF1 .
Several times during the interview , the former head of the IMF , dressed in a black suit , white shirt and navy tie , waved what he said was the report from the New York prosecutor , Cyrus Vance , justifying why the charges against him were dropped .
Strauss - Kahn had denied forcing Diallo , 32 , to perform oral sex in his hotel suite in the seven minutes after she arrived to clean the room and he left to have lunch with his daughter , insisting that the relationship was consensual .
"" There was nothing violent , no constraint , no aggression , nothing criminal about what happened ; that 's what 's the prosecutor said , not me , "" he said at the beginning of the 23-minute interview , and repeated shortly afterwards .
He added : "" What happened was not only inappropriate , it was more than that , it was a fault ; a fault towards my wife , my children , my friends , but also a fault towards the French people , who placed in me their hope for change . ""
Asked if he had paid for sex with Diallo , he replied , "" No . ""
"" It was worse than a weakness , it was a moral fault of which I am not proud .
I regret it infinitely .
I have regretted it every day for the last four months
and I do n't believe I have finished regretting it , "" he said .
"" The prosecutor 's report – and you have to read it attentively – accuses me of nothing that caused injuries .
There is no trace of violence or injury either on her on me . ""
Asked why he thought Diallo had made the accusation , he said : "" That is for her to say .
People have put forward various hypotheses : the financial hypothesis … "" "" Nafissatou Diallo lied about everything .
It 's not me saying that – it 's in the prosecutor 's report .
She did n't just lie about her background – that was n't important –
she lied about the facts .
"" Waving the report , he insisted : "" It 's written here in his report that she ' presented so many versions of what happened , we can not believe her … every interview we had with her she lied ' . ""
He said it was ' surreal ' – that was the word he used , ' surreal ' – to see at each interview that she went back on what she had said the interview before .
The whole story she invented was a lie . ""
Before the interview , Diallo 's New York lawyers , who have filed a civil suit on her behalf , went on the attack . ""
If Mr Strauss - Kahn thinks that people in France will really believe that he was able to convince Ms Diallo , who had never met him before and did not know that he was in the room , to engage in sexual acts with him within a matter of minutes , then he should describe how that happened , "" Diallo 's lawyers said in a statement .
On Sunday night , Strauss - Kahn said the French might find it "" curious "" that when criminal charges had been dropped , someone could still bring a civil case , but added : "" That 's the way it is in the United States . ""
Asked how he had felt being paraded by the New York police in handcuffs , he said : "" I was afraid .
I was very , very afraid .
When you are in a crunching machine like that [ the US justice system ] , you have the impression it is crushing you to death .
I felt ground under its heel , humiliated , and I was n't able to say a word .
I have suffered a violent experience .
"" Some in France have suggested that Strauss - Kahn , the man seen as the opposition socialists ' hope of ousting Nicolas Sarkozy in next year 's presidential election , was a victim of a conspiracy .
Asked if he agreed , he again waved the prosecutor 's report .
"" We will see , "" he said .
"" We will see . ""
After this point , Strauss - Kahn became less combative and defiant and more reflective , almost emotional .
He praised his wife as an "" exceptional woman "" whom he was lucky to have at his side .
"" She would not have supported me if for one second she thought I was not innocent , "" he said .
Strauss - Kahn justified spending £ 35,000 a month on a town house while released on bail , saying he had no choice : "" It was that or returning to Rikers Island , "" he said , referring to the the notorious New York prison where he was held for several days after his arrest .
The former French government minister is facing a second allegation of attempted rape in France .
Writer and journalist Tristane
Banon claims he jumped on her like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" when she went to interview him in February 2003 .
Strauss - Kahn described the 32-year - old Banon 's accusation as "" imaginary and slanderous "" and said he was taking legal action against her .
He also denied that he had a problem with women , as claimed by Piroska Nagy , a Hungarian economist who worked at the IMF and who had a brief affair with Strauss - Kahn in 2007 .
In a letter to the IMF afterwards , Nagy , who was married , suggested he had used his power to have a relationship with her .
"" I was damned if I did , and damned if I did n't , "" she wrote , adding that Strauss - Kahn was "" a man with a problem that may make him ill - equipped to lead an institution where women work under his command "" . ""
Au contraire .
I respect women , "" Strauss - Kahn insisted to Chazal .
Strauss - Kahn admitted he had wanted to stand in the presidential elections , but said he would not comment on the current Socialist party primary campaign to select a replacement candidate .
Chazal moved on to safer ground with questions about the current financial crisis , during which Strauss - Kahn appeared to perk up and regain the stridency he had shown at the beginning of the interview .
Asked what the future held , he refused to rule out a return to politics , saying he had "" devoted his life to being useful to the people "" .
"" We will see , "" he concluded ."
2011-09-21,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's attempt to win back the hearts of the French has sparked a new round of in - fighting on the left .
The former head of the International Monetary Fund , once tipped as the only socialist who could beat Nicolas Sarkozy in next year 's presidential election , has stoked tensions among the leading figures in his party 's primary race .
In a TV interview on Sunday watched by 13.4 million people , Strauss - Kahn made a series of subtle political digs , followed by off - the - record comments that set members of the Socialist party against each other .
It is an ego battle the party wanted to avoid as it prepares for the October 9 vote to chose its candidate for president .
Strauss - Kahn 's TV appearance deliberately left the way open for a return to politics , despite recent polls showing most French are against his immediate return to public life .
Criminal charges against him for the attempted rape of a New York hotel maid were dropped last month , but he still faces a civil case in New York and another allegation of attempted rape in France .
His TV appearance showed how far he could still overshadow the party 's primary candidates , particularly the frontrunner , François Hollande , a former first secretary of the Socialist party , and Martine Aubry , the current leader and mayor of Lille , who is polling in second place .
Strauss - Kahn shot Aubry in the foot by calling her his "" friend "" then confirming that they had had a political "" pact "" at the start of this year .
Daniel Cohn - Bendit , co - president of the European Greens group , dubbed it a poisonous "" serpent 's kiss "" .
Under the alleged pact , which pre - dated the sex - attack allegations , Aubry and Strauss - Kahn reportedly agreed not to oppose each other for the presidency .
Aubry has always denied any pact was struck , not wishing to look like a substitute candidate who stepped in at the last minute when Strauss - Kahn 's career lay in tatters over the New York case .
Recently she distanced herself further from Strauss - Kahn , saying : "" I feel the same way as a lot of women about Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's attitude to women . ""
After his TV comments , she was called dishonest by Hollande 's supporters , and another contender , Ségolène Royal .
Aubry , on the campaign trial , insisted : "" I 'm not a substitute "" .
Then the French cultural magazine Les Inrockuptibles reported that Strauss - Kahn had told journalists off the record that he felt Hollande would win .
Aubry 's ally , Anne Hidalgo , deputy mayor of Paris , shot back that she was sick of the Strauss - Kahn
"" overdose "" in the media .
Harlem Désir , the interim party leader during the primary contest and an Aubry supporter , said Strauss - Kahn was "" no longer an actor in French political life "" .
The row showed how much Strauss - Kahn influences internal party rivalry .
His legal battles are still centre stage in France .
The writer Tristane Banon , who has filed a legal complaint for attempted rape in 2003 , appeared on TV this week saying she had been very lucky that he had not succeeded in raping her and that other alleged victims of Strauss - Kahn had contacted her .
She said : "" Yes , I 've been contacted by these women , but they 're afraid .
I can understand that .
They 've seen my life turn into a nightmare and they do n't want to suffer the same fate …
If [ my case ] makes judicial progress , I think other women will speak out . ""
Strauss - Kahn has denied attempting to rape her .
Banon has called for a demonstration outside the justice ministry this Saturday to protest against the fact that "" violence against women is still not taken seriously in France "" .
A small sample analysis by the Mediascopie Institute found the French public remain unconvinced by Strauss - Kahn 's assertion that there had been no violence or constraint in his sexual encounter with the New York hotel maid , or that he respected women ."
2011-09-26,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn has asked a New York judge to dismiss a civil suit filed by the hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault .
The high - profile criminal case against Strauss - Kahn collapsed last month after prosecutors told the court they could not trust hotel worker Nafissatou Diallo 's testimony beyond reasonable doubt .
Strauss - Kahn was forced to resign as managing director of the IMF after he was arrested in May while trying to board a plane to Europe and charged with the sexual assault and attempted rape of Diallo in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
Diallo had filed a civil law suit against the ex - IMF boss before the criminal case collapsed .
While the criminal case continued , judge Douglas McKeon gave the one - time French presidential candidate until 26 September to respond .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers are arguing that their client was immune to such suits under international law .
McKeon will now now consider the application .
Diallo , a 32-year - old Guinean immigrant , maintains in her civil suit against Strauss - Kahn that she was subjected to a "" sadistic "" attack .
She is seeking unspecified damages from the millionaire economist .
DNA evidence of a sexual encounter was recovered by the police , and Strauss - Kahn has argued that he had consensual sex with Diallo .
Earlier this month , in his first interview since the trial collapsed , Strauss - Kahn said there was no "" aggression or constraint "" involved , but admitted he was guilty of a "" moral fault "" .
Strauss - Kahn faces legal woes on both sides of the Atlantic , despite the collapse of the criminal case .
This week he is expected to meet Tristane Banon , a French writer who has accused him of attacking her during an interview him in 2003 , when he was a senior figure in the opposition Socialist party .
He has strenuously denied the accusations .
French prosecutors are deciding whether to bring charges against Strauss - Kahn and the meeting is set to take place before a judge ."
2011-10-09,"Political commentators , particularly English ones , had no difficulty calling this party unreconstructed , doomed to a life - term of opposition .
Its lead candidate , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , dropped out of the sky faster than Icarus , after the former head of the IMF was accused of attempting to rape a chambermaid in New York , and conventional wisdom had it that the French Socialist party would be landed with the also - rans .
An unpopular rightwing president in Nicolas Sarkozy was getting another lucky break .
But conventional wisdom was wrong .
More than 2.5 million people who paid a minimum of € 1 and signed a form saying they shared the values of the left voted on Sunday in France 's first open primary election for a presidential candidate .
The televised debates between the six candidates have not degenerated into slanging matches , as many predicted they would , and the first debate got 5 million viewers – more than the French remake of MasterChef .
In other words , the idea to throw open the doors to a debate , which has traditionally been the preserve of the backroom , has been a political success .
It has given a national platform to younger candidates – Arnaud Montebourg and Manuel Valls – who would otherwise have struggled to get the airtime , and it has allowed the frontrunners , François Hollande and Martine Aubry , to grow in stature .
The two - round primary – the second is in a week 's time – will have done much to consign the image of a party dominated by political barons to the past .
That said , there is still a mountain to climb for a party that last held the presidency a generation ago and which has spent most of the last decade recovering from the shock of being defeated by a far - right candidate in 2002 .
Mr Hollande 's campaign centred less on ideological differences , which are anyway hard to define ( the centrist Strauss - Kahn voted on Sunday for Ms Aubry , the architect of the 35-hour week ) , than on personality .
Mr Hollande could only have styled himself as the ordinary guy who goes to work on a moped after five years of Latin drama with Mr Sarkozy at the helm .
Normality means staying calm and carrying on .
The political ambition of such a pitch lies well beyond his own party .
As the ever - astute Jacques Chirac inferred , the centre - right might well prefer Hollande to their own man .
Ms Aubry 's campaign has centred on housing , health and education and comes across as steely and in control .
Ségolène Royal will pick up votes for the fightback she 's conducted since her failed 2007 bid , but it is above all this for which she will be remembered .
The number of voters have done more than confer legitimacy on the winning candidate .
They may have turned elegant losers into ambitious and capable contenders .

This article was amended on 10 October 2011 to update the number of voters in the primary to more than 2.5 million , according to the Socialist party .
The original gave an earlier figure , 1.5 million ."
2011-10-13,"The French writer who has accused Dominique Strauss - Kahn of attempting to rape her when she went to interview him has written a book in which she appears to refer to him as a "" baboon "" .
Tristane Banon , 32 , described the former IMF head as behaving like a "" rutting chimpanzee "" during the alleged attack at an unfurnished Paris apartment in February 2003 .
Strauss - Kahn has described the allegations , which are under police investigation , as "" imaginary "" .
Banon 's book , Le Bal des Hypocrites ( The Hypocrites ' Ball ) , described as a 128-page "" novelisation "" of events in her life , would appear to be the latest salvo in a vitriolic battle of words between the young woman and the veteran politician , once tipped to become the next president of France .
Banon does not directly name Strauss - Kahn , but describes a man who lured her to his flat and who she claims she had to fight off as he forced his fingers into her mouth and his hands into her jeans , as the "" pig "" or "" baboon "" .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , has admitted to police investigating Banon 's claims that he made a pass at Banon and tried to kiss her , but denies any violence .
He has lodged a countersuit for defamation .
After Strauss - Kahn , once the French Socialist party 's presidential hope , was arrested and accused of the sexual assault and attempted rape of a New York hotel maid in May , Banon spent several weeks deciding whether to press charges .
When the US case against Strauss - Kahn collapsed in August because of doubts about the credibility of his accuser , Nafissatou Diallo , she made a formal complaint to the Paris prosecutor .
Strauss - Kahn returned to France , but his hopes of leading the country were finished .
In her book , an extract of which was published by Paris Match magazine , Banon writes of feeling sick when the man , assumed to be referring to Strauss - Kahn , was being hailed as the next president before his arrest in New York .
"" It was nine o'clock that Saturday morning
and they were talking about the baboon on the television .
He is a superhero , a Messiah , saviour
… capable of everything .
He would revive the country , lower taxes , understand the weakest and bring happiness and calm to each French household .
"" They showed pictures of him ; in action in the four corners of the world .
Superman .
When I saw him his stare made me freeze , the television screen could not protect me , his smile was only for me , it forced its way into my stomach and the image only disappeared when I threw up my lunch .
Suddenly his message on my telephone came back to me : "" So , I scared you ? "" .
That was eight years ago .
"" The years have passed , but nothing has completely effaced the memory . ""
Banon , whose mother , Anne Mansouret is a Socialist politician and god daughter to Strauss - Kahn 's ex - wife , first revealed the alleged attack on a French TV chat show in 2007 .
"" I eventually spoke about it
but I was too smiling when I did .
I should have cried so that people understood the real ravages it had caused , "" she writes . ""
But alcohol had given my cheeks a rosy tint and , like Molière
, I wanted to laugh about what had made me cry inside . ""
Banon says the show 's other guests had waited until the cameras and microphones were off to say : "" We knew , but
… "" ""
But what ?
Nobody must make any waves , and above all not let the public know .
Only the elite must know , only those of the elite know how to hold their tongues . ""
In response to why she had not complained to the police at the time , Banon writes : "" Put yourself in my place . ""
It was widely reported that Banon 's mother had dissuaded her from going to the police telling her she would be known for the rest of her life as "" the girl who had a problem with the politician "" .
Banon wrote that her decision in June to make an official complaint for "" attempted rape "" , which is under preliminary investigation , was "" taking the combat to the enemy "" .
In the book , published on Thursday , she also expresses shock that supporters have abandoned her . ""
How many promised to give evidence if , in future , they were called to do so ?
How many assured me of unwavering support ?
How many , suddenly disappeared the moment they were asked to sign a written declaration , when they had to photocopy their identity card to authenticate the statement ? ""
The Paris prosecutor 's office is examining Banon 's accusation of attempted rape against Strauss - Kahn to decide whether there is a case for him to answer ."
2011-10-17,"A year ago François Hollande would have thought himself lucky to have finished third in the race for the Socialist party 's nomination for presidential candidate .
He was coming last in the polls .
He was easily outshone by the undeclared frontrunner Dominique Strauss - Kahn and nor did he stand much chance against his successor as party boss , the po - faced but competent Martine Aubry .
A year on , his rivals are dust , and Mr Hollande – several kilos lighter , better suited , and with fewer wisecracks – has just walked off with a stunning victory .
Not only did he beat Ms Aubry by over 373,000 votes but , this being the first time the party held an open primary , some 2.8 million people participated in the election .
Too easily dismissed for his Billy Bunterish qualities , Mr Hollande is the undisputed champion of his party .
Unity has not always been a strong point for the Socialists .
Lionel Jospin 's claim to be the party 's candidate in 2002 was so disputed that many on the left voted for the Cameronian François Bayrou .
This act of defiance in the first round of voting was supposed to send a message to the party leadership .
Unfortunately someone got the wattage wrong .
The electric shock was so strong , it let the far - right leader Jean - Marie Le Pen through to the second round .
In 2008 Mr Hollande 's former partner Ségolène Royal launched herself on a profoundly misjudged trip , in which she floated free from her party in a balloon fuelled by her own ego .
Compared to either , Mr Hollande now has the best chance to become president in a generation .
His opponent Nicolas Sarkozy has come up recently in the polls but , even so , 63 % of those asked still disapprove of his performance .
This is a substantial , perhaps insurmountable hurdle to jump for a man who has made so many enemies in his own party , let alone outside it .
Mr Sarkozy will attack Mr Hollande for being a nonentity , for not having held a single ministerial post , for being a perpetual backroom boy unaccustomed to the pressure of making real decisions .
But Mr Sarkozy will find it more difficult to convince France that his own record as leader stands scrutiny .
The bombing of Libya does not cut it , and nor will saving the euro .
A president whose name will for ever be associated with his love of bling - bling jewellery , his £ 10,000 Rolex , and millionaire friends who say that anyone not wearing such a watch by the age of 50 is a failure , is ill - placed to claim custodianship of the low - paid and unemployed .
A rightwing tenancy of the Élysée Palace lasting 17 years has left an enormous appetite for change .
By not pretending to be France 's saviour , but a normal guy grappling with its challenges , Mr Hollande deserves to succeed where his more arrogant predecessors have failed ."
2011-11-11,"He is keeping a low profile in Paris , has grown a white beard , and polls show he is the least popular politician in France .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , forced to quit as head of the IMF and shelve aspirations to become the next French president , had hoped to find solace in France after criminal charges were dropped against him in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel cleaner .
But he is dominating the front pages again after his name was linked to a high - profile investigation into an alleged prostitution ring at a luxury hotel in Lille .
The Hotel Carlton affair centres on allegations of pimping at top hotels in the northern French city , where women from France and massage parlours in Belgium were allegedly supplied for hotel customers and local officials .
Eight people are under formal investigation , including a senior police officer , a local barrister and businessmen .
Five have been imprisoned as the inquiry continues .
The investigation raises questions about the links between police and business figures and the underworld of sex work in France and Belgium .
Prostitution involving people over the age of 18 is not illegal in France but pimping and living off the benefits of it is .
The affair took a new turn after Strauss - Kahn 's name came up in statements made to investigators , according to a series of leaked transcripts published in the French media in recent weeks .
Businessmen were alleged to have paid women to travel to Paris and the US to take part in "" soirées "" with Strauss - Kahn at his own request , including when he was head of the IMF and tipped to become the next French president .
Le Monde reported that one senior French police officer had travelled twice to Washington DC last year with businessmen , including the head of a Lille - based construction firm , to accompany a group of women who worked in massage parlours in Belgium to see Strauss - Kahn .
The former head of the IMF was said to have received three visits from the group in Washington .
The last visit ended on 13 May , the day before he was arrested over the attempted rape of a hotel maid in New York .
The senior Lille police officer and two businessmen deny involvement in prostitution .
The first evening organised for Strauss - Kahn was said to have taken place at a luxury Paris hotel in 2009 .
One sex worker , whose testimony was published by the weekly Le Point , described being accompanied by businessmen on the train from Lille to Paris to meet Strauss - Kahn , who was wearing a bathrobe , and others in a duplex hotel apartment with a pool .
She said she was paid € 900 ( £ 770 ) by a businessman on the way back to Lille that night .
Other alleged encounters took place in 2010 .
A Belgian sex worker in her 30s , known as Jade , told the French newspaper , Nord Eclair , she was taken to Washington for an encounter with Strauss - Kahn in a hotel in January 2010 and paid by businessmen on her return to France .
She said Strauss - Kahn showed her around the IMF building and posed for a photograph with her in his office the next day .
But the saga took another twist this week when French media , including Liberation and Le Point , published text messages allegedly sent by Strauss - Kahn to a businessman in the case , which are being investigated by police .
In one message , Strauss - Kahn , then head of the IMF , asked if the man wanted to accompany him to a "" magnificent "" swingers club in Madrid , suggesting he bring "" material "" – thought to mean women .
In another , he said he was taking a girl , "" une petite "" , to clubs in Vienna and would the man like to come with a "" demoiselle "" , or "" Miss "" .
A few days later he asked if the "" suite with pool "" had been booked .
The text messages do not explicitly refer to prostitution .
Strauss - Kahn issued a statement through his lawyers on Friday demanding to be interviewed by investigative judges in the case as soon as possible , and denouncing a "" media lynching "" .
The statement said Strauss - Kahn was ready to "" explain himself "" not before the tribunal of public opinion but "" in front of those running the judicial inquiry "" .
Last month , his lawyers urged judges to interview him so he could answer what he deemed "" hasty and malevolent "" accusations .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyer , Henri Leclerc , told the Guardian he had no comment to make on the case .
He said his client had not yet been interviewed by investigators .
If Strauss - Kahn had consenting , paid - for encounters with sex workers aged over 18 , it would not be a crime in France .
But the publication this week of text messages to one businessman mentioning meetings with other top Socialists , raised questions about whether the men could expect political access or favours in exchange for providing what one had termed "" girlfriends , meaning prostitutes "" for him .
One businessman in the case said he paid for flights and costs .
He is believed to have spent thousands of euros of company money on organising soirées for Strauss - Kahn , putting receipts marked with the initials DSK through his expense accounts .
He told investigators Strauss - Kahn had not paid for anything .
The French media questioned Strauss - Kahn 's behaviour during a period in which he was tipped to become the next president of France . ""
The net is tightening around DSK , "" said the daily Le Parisien on Friday ."
2011-11-28,"Tabloid kiss - and - tell stories about film stars and footballers usually bore me .
But political conspiracy theories have a similar pornographic quality I find harder to resist , even though I know they 're usually bad for me – and probably untrue .
So Saturday 's front page of the Financial Times , normally worthy to a fault , was an unexpected treat : the Dominique Strauss - Khan affair presented as a high - level political honey trap to destroy his presidential ambitions .
Perhaps .
There are holes that can be picked in the account .
But on a scale of one to 10 , I 'd rate it a six .
Yes , I know we 've heard it all before in several versions since that fateful Saturday morning , 14 May 2011 , when the New York hotel maid , Nafissatou Diallo , entered the presidential suite ( 2806 ) at the Sofitel hotel at 12.06pm , there to encounter – both sides agree this bit – a naked head of the IMF emerging from the shower .
But , as you may not yet have heard , Edward Jay Epstein 's account of what happened next is different .
You can read it behind the FT 's subscription wall here , read Paul Harris 's account for the Observer here or the full version – for free – here in the estimable New York Review of Books ( NYRB ) .
And here 's a follow - up New York version I found online .
As an investigative reporter , Epstein is too old a hand – he 's 76 for heaven 's sake – to draw firm conclusions without firmer evidence .
But he has seen various records from the Sofitel 's security systems and obviously talked to a lot of people , including policemen and lawyers in New York .
Lots of people have axes to grind in a case which – you may recall – eventually fell apart on Diallo 's alleged unreliability as a witness .
But the essential points he raises include these : •
DSK 's missing BlackBerry
, never found , was already suspected of being hacked , and was disabled at 12.51 on the day in question , less than half an hour after he left the Sofitel to meet his daughter for lunch and catch a flight to Paris as part of his preparation to become the Socialist candidate to contest the 2012 French presidential elections .
•
Diallo twice visited another room ( 2820 ) on the same floor of the hotel , before and after the alleged assault , but did not tell investigators or a grand jury about the second visit ; nor will the hotel say who had been staying there .
Other staff also entered room 2806 , according to electronic key records .
•
A series of telephone calls took place between the hotel management and corporate HQ in Paris before the police were called or the maid taken to hospital ; one could have been to the security chief of Accor , parent company of the Sofitel hotel chain , who was heading to watch a football match with the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , at the time •
Two hotel executives involved in the unfolding drama did a little dance and high - fives when they thought they were out of sight of CCTV cameras .
No , it does n't make a conspiracy .
That 's why this stuff is often soft porn we should avoid .
It 's been denounced by the hotel , by Sarkozy 's ruling UMP – clearly the folk in the frame since at least DSK 's BlackBerry message had ( allegedly ) been read in UMP HQ – and others you 'd expect to deny it .
Those who might have helped Epstein have kept their heads down .
The high - five execs have said they were discussing sport , like they do all the time .
One of their teams had won .
But you have to take conspiracy theories one at a time .
Occasionally they turn out to be true .
At this stage I should draw your attention again to Epstein 's biography .
As this brief Wiki entry suggests he 's what in our trade we call a "" grassy knoll "" man
—
ie , he believes the murder of President John F Kennedy on 22 November 1963 in Dallas ( 48 years ago last week , but unremarked ) was a conspiracy yet to be unearthed .
There remain odd features to that killing , especially the shooting dead of Lee Harvey Oswald , the official assassin , in police custody , so I keep an open mind on it .
Epstein is a serious fellow with lots of books to his credit , though he is also part of the high - end New York media scene that Tom Wolfe would be mocking if he was n't part of it too .
Try this sample of narcissistic idiocy , even though it 's written by Michael Wolff , Obama 's biographer and a good writer .
It involves Christopher Hitchens in a row with Epstein at the kind of event I 'd only attend as a fly on the wall .
Back to DSK .
So much has since come out that no one can seriously pretend he is n't a man who has a problem with women .
Hugh Grant was wrong when he told the Leveson inquiry last week that the French manage privacy better than we do : they do , but in ways that protect the rich and powerful , allowing them to misbehave .
DSK would n't have got away with it here .
His sperm is mingled with Diallo 's saliva on the Sofitel 's carpet and – did I hear this right ?
– also on the walls .
The walls ?
He 's 62 , for heaven 's sake !
Given that Strauss - Khan was involved – allegedly – in a vice - ring drama in Lille , and that there have been other claims and a civil case in New York , it 's hard to see him ever fully clearing his name , let alone making a comeback , even if a major plot was uncovered and , much harder , proved .
But in muddying the waters there is plenty to be salvaged by DSK , by Sarko 's official Socialist opponent next year –
the uncharismatic François Hollande – and by the large section of French society which mistrusts its own intelligence agencies ( with some good reason ) and positively despises US justice and wider society .
I guess the US district attorney 's office in New York would like to recover some dignity too after the collapse of its high - profile investigation .
It also has to be pointed out that , if this was a honey trap , DSK leapt into it with an abandon which would make Bill Clinton look like General De Gaulle .
Both sides at the Sofitel agree there was some sort of sexual encounter , DSK asserting it was consensual , as consensual as you can get in seven minutes .
But if any kind of entrapment was even half - established it would be up there with the major plots .
Dallas was a literal assassination , but the Watergate burglary and cover - up of 1972 - 74 which rescued , then destroyed , Richard Nixon 's presidency from imagined foes was a real one .
By 1984 it was being alleged that Jimmy Carter , the Democrat elected in 1976 , lost in 1980 because of the October Surprise , a deal cooked up between Reagan Republicans and the theocratic hostage - takers of Tehran to hand the 52 Americans back only after Carter had lost office – and to be paid for the help in US arms .
Absurd ?
Yes , but not quite so absurd after it emerged in 1986 that the arms embargo had indeed been breached to finance weapons purchased for the Nicaraguan contras , a rightwing insurgency against the Sandinista regime so loathed in Washington .
One of the troubles with conspiracies is that they 're untidy : who is Nicaragua 's president in 2011 ?
Why , Daniel Ortega , the Sandinista leader who was president from 1985 to 1990 , ousted by a US - backed alliance , but now in office again since 2006 , a friend of Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez .
The US is not all - powerful , it never was .
Nor is the French intelligence service which , like ours , has some murky skeletons in its cupboard .
How serious would the plausible contours of a plot now look ?
Quite serious , I 'd say , because the French banking system is under pressure and its politics discredited in ways quite different from ours , potentially more serious than , say Rupert Murdoch 's footsie with the politicians and police .
The far right is better established in France too .
More often than not , conspiracy is a symptom of decay .
On the radio on Monday morning a well - placed commentator asked if it could be conceivable that "" an old - established party "" like Sarko 's UMP could connive in bringing down a political rival , with a host of people involved .
That 's always a good point – as it is with the 9/11 conspiracy theories which survive despite the evidence – but for the record the UMP is so old that it was established by Jacques Chirac as long ago as 2002 .
Ex - president Chirac is currently on trial ( he 's too sick to attend ) for misappropriating public funds .
There always comes a moment with conspiracy theory when one 's head gets dizzy and it 's time to stop ."
2011-12-27,"Abel Ferrara , the iconoclastic director of Bad Lieutenant and The King of New York , is working on a film about political sex scandals partly inspired by the one that engulfed Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former International Monetary Fund chief and one - time French presidential hopeful .
According to website Deadline , Ferrara , who was worked intermittently in recent years but maintains a powerful reputation as a film - maker with a unique vision , is in talks with Gérard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani to star in the project , which is still in the early stages of development .
The screenplay , by Ferrera and Christ Zois , may also include elements from the lives of other politicians , such as Bill Clinton and Silvio Berlusconi , who found themselves embroiled in sex scandals .
"" One thing we do know is that there 's a common desire amongst Depardieu , Adjani and Ferrara to work together , "" says producer Vincent Maraval of Wild Bunch films .
"" But like every day in this business , we have to see if there 's a film there .
Today , the only reality is that they are writing something inspired by Strauss - Kahn that will focus on addiction and politicians .
It 's more that the Strauss - Kahn scandal itself . ""
Interviewed on the subject by French paper Le Journal Du Dimanche , Depardieu refused to be drawn , saying only : "" In general , I 'm very good at playing characters that I do n't like or do n't resemble .
"" Ferrara 's newest film is 4:44 Last Day
On Earth , which chronicles the events of the final 24 hours before a global apocalypse and stars Willem Dafoe .
It played in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September ."
2012-01-18,"The launch of a French edition of the Huffington Post has been marred by controversy over its choice of editorial director , Anne Sinclair : the one - time TV journalist who is married to Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the IMF .
Sinclair , who was a star TV political interviewer in the 1980s , is to head Le Huffington Post , the first foreign - language spin - off of the US news and opinion site , which goes live next week .
But some in the French media have raised questions over a possible conflict of interest .
Strauss - Kahn was widely tipped to become the next French president before his arrest last May over the alleged attempted rape of a New York hotel maid .
Criminal charges were dropped but a civil case is pending .
The saga destroyed Strauss - Kahn 's IMF career and ended his presidential hopes .
Strauss - Kahn still dominates headlines in France because his name has been linked to a high - profile investigation into an alleged prostitution - ring centred on a luxury hotel in Lille .
He has yet to be interviewed by investigating judges in what is known as the "" Hotel Carlton affair "" .
Strauss - Kahn has started a gradual process to return to public life with a recent speaking engagement in China .
Some question how a site run by Sinclair , who has stood firmly by her husband , would cover the issue of Strauss - Kahn in the news .
The couple recently sued several French media outlets over reports speculating on the state of their marriage after the Hotel Carlton affair .
The respected media blog of the news weekly L'Express , quoting an unnamed editor at Le Monde , said : "" Anne Sinclair is no longer a journalist .
Since she publically compared the DSK affair to the Dreyfus affair she 's an interested party .
"" The French Jewish soldier Alfred Dreyfus 's false conviction for treason divided 19th - century France .
Pierre Haski , founder of Rue89.com , one of France 's leading news websites , told the Guardian : "" The choice of Anne Sinclair divides opinion .
On one hand , the site wanted a big personality who could be a kind of standard - bearer .
On the other , this is someone who is at the heart of one of the big affairs in French news at the moment .
If Le Monde publishes a big investigation into Strauss - Kahn and the Carlton Affair , as it did recently , will this be referenced on the Huffington Post site ?
Will the site run comment on Strauss - Kahn 's comeback efforts ?
Even though Sinclair is a totally legitimate journalist , this is a conflict of interest issue .
"" The French Huffington Post is a joint venture , with a 34 % stake held by the group which owns the French daily , Le Monde .
But staff at the paper protested at Le Huffington Post 's planned prominent use of Le Monde 's logo , namely its strapline "" Le Huffington Post with Le Monde.fr "" .
Some journalists warned that the paper 's editorial independence could appear compromised .
Le Monde executives held emergency talks with journalists ' representatives this week and agreed to clarify the relationship .
"" This is an economic partnership , not an editorial partnership , we wanted that made clear .
Anne Sinclair will be running her own totally separate editorial team , "" said Adrien de Tricornot , a journalists ' representative from Le Monde 's Société des Rédacteurs .
Sinclair was a regular fixture of Sunday evening French TV in the 1980s , drawing millions of viewers with her interviews with politicians and celebrities .
After marrying Strauss - Kahn , she gave up her job as a television journalist when he became finance minister in 1997 .
"" I 'm neither a saint nor a victim , I 'm a free woman , "" Sinclair told French Elle on Wednesday .
Asked whether it was possible to be feminist and still give unconditional support to her husband , she said : "" Unconditional support does n't exist .
One only supports someone if one decides to .
No one knows what goes on in the intimacy of a couple and I refuse anyone the right to judge mine .
I feel free in my judgments and actions , I make life decisions in all independence . ""
Some French media reports pointed out that the PR for the Huffington Post launch was being run by Strauss - Kahn 's chief press adviser , who works for the publicity firm , Euro RSCG .
The Huffington Post , which is owned by AOL , will not step into a void in France but take over from Le Monde 's participative blogging site , Le Post , which has around 2 m visitors per month .
However , the news website market in France is intensely competitive , with highly innovative news and investigative journalism pure - player sites springing up in the past five years to counter a weak and diminishing French press .
"" It 's a competitive market .
People have been doing blog platforms and aggregation for years now .
I 'm not sure the Huffington Post is bringing anything new to the French media landscape , "" said Haski , whose site Rue89 was recently bought by the Nouvel Observateur group for € 7.5 m ( £ 6.2 m ) ."
2012-02-06,"Gerard Depardieu is set to take the lead role in Abel Ferrara 's Dominique Strauss - Kahn - inspired film about political sex scandals , the maverick US film - maker has told a French newspaper .
Ferrara , the iconoclastic director of Bad Lieutenant and King of New York , told Le Monde his movie would be shot in New York , Washington and in France : "" In all spots of power in fact : it 's a film about rich and powerful people . ""
Depardieu has been tipped to take the lead since December last year , when news of the project first broke .
Ferrara also confirmed that Isabelle Adjani will play his wife .
Ferrara 's producer , Vincent Maraval of Paris - based Wild Bunch , last year denied reports that the project was close to entering production after earlier appearing to suggest the opposite .
"" Vincent does n't want to talk about the project , that 's normal , he 's the producer , "" Ferrara told Le Monde . ""
But I 'm the director !
No one can stop me from talking about my movie . ""
Earlier reports suggested Ferrara 's film might also include elements from the lives of other politicians , such as Bill Clinton and Silvio Berlusconi , who have found themselves embroiled in sex scandals .
Interviewed on the subject by Le Journal Du Dimanche , Depardieu refused to be drawn , saying only : "" In general , I 'm very good at playing characters that I do n't like or do n't resemble .
"" Ferrara 's latest film is 4:44 Last Day on Earth , which chronicles the events of the final 24 hours before a global apocalypse and stars Willem Dafoe .
It played in competition at the 68th Venice International Film festival in September ."
2012-02-20,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , is to be questioned on Tuesday by French police investigating an alleged prostitution ring .
Investigators in Lille are probing a suspected prostitution ring in the northern French city , where women from France and massage parlours in Belgium were allegedly supplied for hotel customers and local officials .
Those under investigation in what has been dubbed the Hotel Carlton affair , after the expensive Lille hotel where some of the meetings took place , have included a senior police officer , a local barrister and businessmen .
Strauss - Kahn , who was forced to quit his position at the IMF and shelve aspirations to become the next French president last year , has been keeping a low profile since his return to France after sexual assault charges against him in New York were dropped .
French police have questioned prostitutes who said they had sex with him during 2010 and 2011 at a luxury hotel in Paris , a restaurant in the French capital and also in Washington DC , where Strauss - Kahn lived while he was head of the IMF .
Two men with ties to him have also been put under preliminary investigation in France on charges including organising a prostitution ring and misuse of corporate funds .
His name surfaced in the investigation last Autumn and his lawyer has asked that Strauss - Kahn be allowed to tell his side of the story .
One of his lawyers has said that the former French presidential hopeful never knew that the women at orgies he attended were prostitutes . ""
He could easily not have known , because as you can imagine , at these kinds of parties you 're not always dressed , and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman , "" Henri Leclerc told French radio station Europe 1 in December .
Strauss - Kahn was charged by New York police in May with making a hotel maid perform oral sex .
He has said the sexual encounter was "" inappropriate "" but not violent .
The case collapsed in August because of doubts about the credibility of his accuser , Nafissatou Diallo , although she says she was truthful about the encounter and is pursuing her claims in a lawsuit .
In a separate case last October , French prosecutors refused to pursue an allegation by a young French writer of attempted rape by him .
The Paris prosecutor 's office dropped the investigation into writer Tristane Banon 's claim that Strauss - Kahn tried to rape her during a 2003 interview for a book the then-23-year - old was writing , saying they could n't send him to trial because it happened too long ago ."
2012-02-21,"If life had gone according to Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's best laid plans , he would now be en route to becoming the next president of France .
Instead , the socialist politician and former head of the International Monetary Fund spent Tuesday sitting in a police interrogation room in north - east France being quizzed about a prostitution ring and allegations of fraud .
It was the latest devastating humiliation for Strauss - Kahn , once hailed the French left 's "" providential man "" , who suffered a dramatic fall from grace in May 2011 when he was charged with sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid .
In just nine months , the 62-year - old veteran politician has been publicly embroiled in three sex scandals , though he has protested his innocence in each and has not been charged with any offence .
Still , with just two months to the first round of France 's presidential election , the country 's socialists – whose candidate François Hollande is presenting himself as "" Monsieur Normal "" – could be forgiven for feeling they have had a lucky escape .
At 8.55 am on Tuesday , Strauss - Kahn turned himself into police as summoned .
Lest anyone forget that he was no ordinary suspect , however , he arrived at the gendarmerie in the city of Lille in a chauffeur - driven limousine with blacked - out windows .
As the car arrived , officers struggled to hold back a scrum of journalists .
Strauss - Kahn was then taken into police custody , similar to an arrest by appointment , to be quizzed about his alleged links to an illegal prostitution ring and the misuse of company funds .
He is being interrogated over several libertine soirées , or orgies , he took part in at a luxury hotel and restaurant in Paris and in Washington while IMF chief .
The parties , at which Strauss - Kahn – or DSK as he is known – has admitted having sex with various women , were allegedly organised by high - level police and business contacts from Lille with whom he had links .
Strauss - Kahn has always insisted he never paid any prostitutes ( paying prostitutes for sex is not illegal in France ) .
The police inquiry hinges on whether Strauss - Kahn knew the women being invited to the parties were prostitutes and if he was aware they were being paid for by a major French construction company , as alleged .
Eight people , including a Lille police commissioner , have been arrested and put under investigation – the equivalent of being charged – in what has become known as the "" Carlton Affair "" after the luxury Lille hotel where the alleged prostitution ring was based .
Strauss - Kahn , who is married to former television presenter Anne Sinclair , now French editor of the Huffington Post , who has stood by him through the scandals , has admitted infidelity with a number of women .
He insists he never knew those he had sex with at the parties at the centre of this latest investigation were prostitutes and has denied any wrongdoing , describing the allegations against him as "" malevolent insinuations "" .
He can be held for 48 hours after which he is expected to be formally put under investigation or released .
A year ago , Strauss - Kahn was riding high in the opinion polls and was being widely backed to beat President Nicolas Sarkozy in the two - round presidential election this spring .
He was forced to abandon his political ambitions and resign from his IMF post after he was pulled off an Air France flight as it was about to leave New York in May and accused of forcing hotel chambermaid Guinean - born Nafissatou Diallo to perform oral sex at the Sofitel in New York .
The politician claimed the sex was consensual and involved no "" aggression or constraint "" .
The case against him crumbled over concerns about Diallo 's credibility as a witness after she was found to have lied on her immigration application .
Strauss - Kahn returned to France to further allegations and police questions over an accusation by author and journalist Tristane Banon , 32 , that he had tried to rape her when she went to interview him in 2003 for a book she was writing .
Prosecutors found prima - facie evidence of a sexual assault but said the alleged attack had passed the time limit and dismissed the case .
Strauss - Kahn 's defence team has at times taken an unusual tack ; in December his lawyer Henri Leclerc told the French radio station Europe 1 that the politician had no idea the women at the centre of the latest investigation were prostitutes . ""
He could easily not have known because , as you can imagine , at these kinds of parties you 're not always dressed , and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman , "" Leclerk said .
Lawyers in the US , where DSK , as he is known , faces a civil action brought by Diallo , will be watching events in France closely ."
2012-02-21,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has been formally placed under arrest by French police investigating an alleged prostitution ring .
The 62-year - old socialist politician turned himself in at 8.55am on Tuesday in the northern French city of Lille and is being held for questioning over allegations that he aided the procurement of prostitutes and benefited from fraud .
Detectives want to ascertain whether Strauss - Kahn , a former French presidential hopeful , knew that the women he had sex with at orgies in Paris and Washington were prostitutes and if he was aware how they were paid .
It is alleged the money came from the corporate funds of a major French construction company .
Strauss - Kahn is expected to either be put under formal investigation – the equivalent of being charged – or released after 48 hours .
Eight people , including two Lille businessmen with links to Strauss - Kahn and a police commissioner , have already been arrested in the case , known as the Carlton affair after the luxury Lille hotel at the centre of the alleged prostitution ring .
Paying for prostitutes is not illegal in France but procuring them for another and using company funds to pay for them could lead to formal charges .
Strauss - Kahn insists he never knew the women were prostitutes and has denied any wrongdoing . ""
He could easily not have known , because as you can imagine , at these kinds of parties you 're not always dressed , and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman , "" his lawyer , Henri Leclerk , told French radio Europe 1 in December .
Strauss - Kahn 's political hopes disintegrated in May 2011 when he was arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel chambermaid .
Strauss - Kahn claimed the sex was consensual and involved no "" aggression or constraint "" .
The case against him crumbled over concerns about the maid 's credibility as a witness .
Last October , prosecutors in France dismissed a 23-year - old French writer 's claim that Strauss - Kahn tried to rape her in 2003 during an interview for a book , saying the case had passed the time limit ."
2012-03-01,"In 2007 , the Oxford Union invited Nick Griffin , leader of the far right BNP , and
Holocaust denier David Irving to discuss free speech .
Now Cambridge has decided that whatever Oxford can do , we can do more controversially .
So , on 9 March , we 've got Dominique Strauss - Kahn coming – he of the current prostitution ring allegations , and the dropped sexual assault case in New York .
Er , and we heard he does economic stuff too .
When a university society takes a step like this , we students have to wonder why .
Is it for "" titillation of its membership "" , as a petition put out by the university 's Women 's Campaign suggests ?
Katie Lam , president of the Cambridge Union , says the reason is more prosaic – the union "" has been inviting Strauss - Kahn since early 2010 , before his IMF resignation "" , and only recently received a positive answer .
She also stresses the organisation 's impartiality : "" As far as the union is concerned , all it is and all it can be is a completely neutral forum for free speech . ""
So the timing is simply chance ? ""
Yes . ""
But Lam 's insistence that people are invited "" regardless of ideology or personal history "" is not going down well with students .
Student union women 's officer Ruth Graham points out that since the invitation to Strauss - Kahn was first issued , his profile "" has changed as a consequence of these revelations "" and argues that his presence on campus would "" legitimise his role in public life at a time when he is yet again being questioned by the police "" .
Her campaign to disinvite him has so far attracted over 600 signatures .
Yet universities exist to open our minds .
If we ca n't listen to controversial speakers during these three hallowed years , when can we ?
The LSE last year decided to host two speakers with controversial views about Muslims , saying that "" the likelihood that offence would be caused was not in itself a reason to prevent the event from going ahead "" .
I write a feminist column for Varsity newspaper ;
I 'm unsettled that a man with such an undeniably warped attitude to women is coming to speak .
And yet there 's no doubt the man can economise ( or whatever the verb is ) .
From a purely economic perspective , he 's worth listening to .
Universities , are small and tightly - bound communities , and students have real power in preventing people speaking .
At Oxford , Griffin and Irving were blocked from the hall by protestors and forced to debate in smaller , separate rooms .
Late last year , protestors disrupted a Cambridge event at which David Willets was due to speak , shouting until he departed .
In the aftermath , opinion was sharply divided between those who supported the protest against tuition fees , and those who felt the demonstrators had prevented others from engaging in a reasonable debate with the minister .
Freedom of speech is a double - edged sword .
If the tuition fees rise has proved anything , it 's that students can get moving when we really feel strongly about something .
The question is whether students who cherish their own right to protest should also allow DSK his opportunity to speak ."
2012-03-09,"Student protesters fought with police outside the Cambridge Union on Friday as Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund who resigned over allegations that he had sexually assaulted a New York hotel maid , addressed the university 's famous debating society .
The 62-year - old former French presidential hopeful , invited to speak on the European economy , slipped into the building by a side door and photographers were pushed aside by security guards minutes before up to 200 students arrived at the union building .
Protesters claimed inviting Strauss - Kahn to speak at the Cambridge Union could be seen as legitimising sexual violence , while others defended the right to free speech .
Demonstrators waving placards reading , "" DSK not welcome here "" , and chanting , "" No more violence , no more rape "" marched through the city centre before gathering outside the building for speeches .
Two people were arrested , one for assaulting a police officer and one for breach of the peace .
Security at the debate was intense , with everyone body - searched and no phones or recording equipment allowed .
Earlier , a 700-name petition to "" Disinvite DSK "" had failed to sway the Cambridge Union Society , which said Strauss - Kahn had been invited before the allegations that led him to quit the IMF .
A "" no press "" policy was decided after discussions with Strauss - Kahn , it said .
DSK , as he is known in France , quit the IMF last May amid claims that he sexually assaulted a maid , Nafissatou Diallo , 32 , at a hotel in Manhattan .
He denied the allegation .
US prosecutors dropped criminal charges against him in August , but Diallo is pursuing a civil action against him .
The pre - trial hearing is to be held on 28 March , when Strauss - Kahn is due to be summoned by judges in France over allegations concerning a suspected prostitution ring .
The Socialist party veteran has also been accused by a French writer , Tristane Banon , 32 , of attempting to rape her in 2003 , but French prosecutors decided there would be no charges because sufficient evidence was lacking for a rape prosecution .
On another potential charge , sexual assault - where prosecutors said they saw the evidence as more likely grounds for a charge - France 's three - year time limit for prosecution had by 2011 passed .
Strauss - Kahn was flanked by four security guards and remained near the exit of the debating chamber , but he looked confident as he began by apologising , saying he understood the event had brought with it "" some emotion "" .
Only towards the end of his lecture on global finance was he questioned about the sexual allegations , when a man asked if he could explain why Diallo had allegedly suffered "" vaginal bruising "" after the encounter .
Strauss - Kahn said : "" The reality is I spent a week in prison and after a month and a half the case was dismissed . ""
He added : "" What do you want ? ""
Asked about the student protest , he said : "" That 's their freedom .
They can do what they want .
I think they are wrong . ""
The student union women 's officer , Ruth Graham , said the protesters were "" concerned about legitimising Strauss - Kahn by allowing him such a prestigious platform "" and there were worries that his presence could "" perpetuate a culture where victims of sexual violence are ignored "" .
The Cambridge Union Society refused to rescind its invitation , citing the right to free speech .
"" The society has been inviting him to address our members for several years , given his economic knowledge as then head of the IMF and his experience of French politics , "" it said in a statement .
Its president , Katie Lam , 20 , said the union was not deliberately courting controversy .
Just hours before Strauss - Kahn 's arrival , Diallo 's lawyer , Douglas Wigdor , addressed a separate protest debate on sexual violence organised by the student union women 's campaign .
Wigdor said he was "" flabbergasted "" at the invitation , which was "" an affront to all victims of sexual crimes "" .
Strauss - Kahn 's PR team were "" using the prestigious university to further his PR means "" .
He said he believed the economist and politician was "" orchestrating this because , in my view , he wants to make a comeback "" .
He said Strauss - Kahn had given no explanation about what happened in the hotel room , other than to say it was consensual .
Wigdor said : "" The history of Cambridge and the history of the union are now interspersed with Strauss - Kahn .
I do n't blame Strauss - Kahn .
I blame the union .
"" Diallo had been left "" physically and emotionally scarred "" , he claimed , saying no "" white upper- or middle - class woman in New York "" would have been treated as Diallo , an African immigrant , had been .
Diallo sent a message of support to the protesting students , saying they had provided her with "" further motivation to see justice is done "" and that Strauss - Kahn was "" held accountable for his actions "" .
Banon also sent a message of support , saying the protest and petition "" allowed me to believe a little more in humanity "" .
The union said its invitation did not imply support or endorsement for Strauss - Kahn , adding that its speakers were selected regardless of their ideology , background or personal history .
Individuals were chosen if they were deemed to be "" interesting people whom our members would want to hear speak and whom they would like a chance to challenge and question , "" it said .

This article was corrected on 14 March 2012 because the original said it was because the time limit for a rape charge had elapsed that French prosecutors decided against launching proceedings against Dominique Strauss - Kahn .

2012-03-09,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , former head of the International Monetary Fund – who faces civil action over sexual assault allegations by a New York hotel maid and questions over alleged links to a prostitution ring in France – will be greeted by protesting students ahead of his planned address to the Cambridge Union Society on Friday night .
The university student union 's Women 's Campaign has invited the lawyer representing Nafissatou Diallo , the New York maid , to address a separate debate on the case just hours before the French politician is due to speak on the global economy .
Douglas Wigdor , Diallo 's attorney , is set to speak at the university 's law faculty before the planned demonstration outside the union building .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , known as DSK in France and a former French presidential frontrunner , quit as head of the IMF last May amid claims , which he denied , that he sexually assaulted Diallo .
Criminal charges against him were dropped by US prosecutors in August .
Diallo is now pursuing civil action for monetary damages .
A petition "" Disinvite DSK "" , begun after he accepted the invitation to address the union , attracted more than 700 signatures .
The Cambridge Union Society said it would not be rescinding its invitation .
In a statement it said : "" The society has been inviting him to address our members for several years , given his economic knowledge as then head of the IMF and his experience of French politics . ""
He was not invited after or as a result of the circumstances surrounding his departure from the IMF .
We would like to add that the purpose of the union is to provide a neutral platform for free speech . ""
Campaigners have accused the society of displaying a "" callous desire "" to "" exploit gender crime allegations in the service of controversy "" .
In its response the union said its invitation did not imply support or endorsement for Strauss - Kahn , adding that its speakers were selected regardless of their ideology , background or personal history .
Individuals were chosen if they were deemed to be "" interesting people whom our members would want to hear speak and whom they would like a chance to challenge and question "" , it said .
Ruth Graham , Cambridge student union 's women 's officer , said Wigdor was looking forward to sharing his views on the case .
The protesters plan to debate sexual violence against women at the lunchtime event , then march on the union building .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn were dropped when prosecutors for Manhattan 's district attorney , Cyrus Vance , told justice Michael Obus , of the state supreme court that the case could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt because of serious credibility issues with Diallo .
The French Socialist party veteran was arrested in May after Diallo , 32 , claimed he had forced her to perform oral sex when she arrived to clean his suite at the Sofital hotel in Manhattan , claims he denies .
He was later arrested on a plane scheduled to fly to Paris .
The pre - trial hearing in the civil case is to be held on 28 March , the same day Strauss - Kahn is due to be summoned by judges in France over allegations concerning a suspected prostitution ring .
He has also been accused by French writer Tristane Banon , 32 , of attempting to rape her in 2003 .
Prosecutors decided there was prima facie evidence of a sexual assault but there would be no charges as the time limit for prosecution had passed .
In a statement , the university 's Women 's Campaign said choosing to give Strauss - Kahn an opportunity to speak on the economy , while ignoring the allegations and ongoing investigations facing him , sidestepped the issues in a way that "" feeds an existent culture of silence and shame around rape , in which alleged perpetrators are given a platform mostly denied to survivors of sexual violence "" . ""
Dominique Strauss - Kahn is a powerful global figure who has been accused of a string of sexual offences and is still under investigation for his role in a prostitution ring , "" said Holly Dustin , director of the End of Violence Coalition , in a statement issued by the Women 's Campaign . ""
By inviting him to speak , the Cambridge Union risks colluding with attitudes that condone or trivialise violence against women . ""
Graham said : "" This is an opportunity for students and people in the local community alike to make a public , vocal stand against Strauss - Kahn being welcomed into our city .
By protesting we show that the women who have come forward and reported rape and sexual assault are listened to , and are not forgotten , and we show that we will not be complicit in Strauss - Kahn 's rehabilitation campaign back into public life . ""
On Thursday night activists defaced the Cambridge Union Society building with paint , posters and chalk with slogans including "" This house supports rape culture . ""
A 20-year - old man and 21-year - old woman were arrested ."
2012-03-09,"Following a petition by Cambridge university Women 's Campaign , a group of protesters will later this afternoon meet outside Greater St Mary 's Church in Cambridge .
They are marching to the Union Society to demonstrate against a speaker 's event invitation to Dominique Strauss - Kahn , and I will definitely be joining them .
I think that an institution like the union has a responsibility to reject a speaker with a record of serial misogyny , in the same way that I feel that they would have a responsibility to reject a speaker with a record of serial racism .
For me , DSK 's behaviour certainly fulfils the former category : take , for example , the case of journalist Tristane Banon , of which the prosecutor said in a statement contained "" facts that could be qualified as sexual assault "" .
In addition to this , his international renown as a womaniser speaks volumes .
But perhaps most distressing is his approach to the allegations made by Nafissatou Diallo .
The issue is n't whether or not Strauss - Kahn raped Diallo , our focus rests with his argument that previous lies told by the maid invalidate any future claim of suffering sexual violence - a stance the prosecutors also effectively took when they later dropped charges .
For me and many others , attendance of the protest is part of a wider rejection of the cultures of misogyny and rape apologism .
The protest is particularly directed against the treatment of Diallo 's attempt to make rape allegations , as this mirrors a persistent , international trend : the trivialisation of sexual crimes and accusations .
This is a theme all too prevalent in England , where the conviction rate for reported rapes in England and Wales is 6 % on the full charge of rape .
Part of the event later on will be an inclusive platform to discuss these issues .
The Union Society argues that their invitation extends to an economist , and that his personal life is irrelevant .
They reject the Women 's Campaign belief that DSK 's reputation is as much based on his notorious misogyny as his economic involvement .
While the personal life of Strauss - Kahn should not be subject to our judgement , by treating numerous women appallingly , DSK has forced the situation .
The campaign has been condemned by some for allegedly repressing freedom of speech .
Indeed , the Union Society defends his invitation on these very grounds .
I 've always been a staunch defender of freedom of speech , but I do understand that there is a difference between systematic oppression and the provision of a platform .
For the public , the union is often assumed to represent Cambridge , not least because of confusion with the Student 's Union – a separate body .
Thus the invitations offered by the union make a significant statement .
Access to such a platform should be managed responsibly .
Freedom of speech does not equate to a right to a powerful platform .
I 've found the Women 's Campaign quite an empowering platform myself .
It has engaged with the theme of International Women 's Day 2012 – connecting women , inspiring futures .
The demonstration is set to provide an inclusive space to talk about issues from rape apologism to cultures of misogyny .
Far from oppressing freedom of speech , I feel like the overwhelming support for the campaign has given voice to those many who live without a direct line to the media .
What started as a small - scale campaign has snowballed , bringing issues of sexism and sexual crime in to the national sphere .
In addition , some protesters are also using the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the IMF .
While some individuals have felt the need for direct action , separate to the official protest , I particularly respect the campaign 's ability to create a strong response without having impinged on the Union Society 's rights .
Despite the retention of the invitation , I feel like the campaign has won a wider victory .
Before the protest has even started , we 've brought issues that are so often overlooked to a broad audience .

This article was amended on 14 and 19 March 2012 .
The original referred to a conviction rate of 6 % for rape .
This is the proportion of reported rapes in England and Wales that end in a conviction on the charge of rape itself ( as distinct from lesser assault charges ) .
The article has been clarified accordingly .

But "" , the report went on , "" French prosecutors decided there would be no charges as [ by 2011 , when the accusation became public ] the time limit for prosecution had passed "" .
The prosecutors in fact said that for a rape prosecution , sufficient evidence was lacking .

2012-03-26,"A French judge has charged the former head of the International Monetary Fund Dominique Strauss - Kahn over his alleged links with a prostitution ring .
In a surprise hearing – two days before he had been officially summoned – the veteran French politician was placed under formal investigation and told he faced further questioning on charges of "" complicity in aggravated and organised prostitution "" and "" misuse of company assets "" .
Investigators want to establish if Strauss - Kahn knew the girls he has admitted having sex with during "" libertine "" parties in various cities including Paris and Washington , were paid .
Strauss - Kahn , 62 , has denied having any such knowledge and denied any wrongdoing .
He was "" mis en examen "" , the French equivalent of being charged , after being held in police custody and quizzed for two days in February over an alleged high - class prostitution ring centre on the luxury Carlton Hotel in the northern city of Lille .
The charges carry a maximum 20 year jail term .
The orgies , at which Strauss - Kahn – or DSK as he is known – has admitted having sex with a number of women , were allegedly organised by high - ranking police officers and business contacts from Lille with whom he had links .
However , he has always insisted he never paid any of them and did not know they were prostitutes .
Paying prostitutes for sex is not illegal in France but procuring them is .
The police inquiry in what has become known as the "" Carlton Affair "" also hinges on whether Strauss - Kahn knew the girls were being paid for by a major French construction company , as alleged .
A total of eight people , including a Lille police commissioner , are under investigation in the affair .
This time last year , socialist Strauss - Kahn was being widely tipped to beat Nicolas Sarkozy in next month 's presidential elections and become the next leader of France .
His political ambitions were shattered when he was arrested in New York on charges – later dropped – of sexually assaulting Guinean - born hotel chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo .
Diallo is now bringing a civil case against the French politician , which is due to open in New York on Wednesday .
Strauss - Kahn has always denied wrongdoing and claimed the sex was consensual and involved no "" aggression or constraint "" .
After Strauss - Kahn was released just after 10 pm , a police source told French journalists the former government minister had informed them he could not possibly have imagined the young women he was introduced to were prostitutes as some were "" presented by police officers "" .
At an earlier hearing his lawyer Henri Leclerc told the French radio station Europe 1 : "" He could easily not have known because , as you can imagine , at these kinds of parties you 're not always dressed , and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman . """

2012-03-28,"From petty thieves and fine - dodgers to drunk - drivers and outright murderers , "" diplomatic immunity "" has been the cry of a rogues ' gallery of accused international miscreants plunged into hot water overseas .
Former IMF boss Dominique Strauss - Kahn is the latest to try to claim its protection in his bid to get a civil case brought by the New York hotel maid he is alleged to have assaulted struck out .
A look at the history of those claiming the status puts the one - time French presidential hope in a league with some rum fellows , red - faced diplomats and a Burmese ambassador who took immunity to a shocking extreme , or so the story goes .
Mexico :
BlackBerry thief
In one of the more bizarre incidents of diplomatic immunity being claimed , a Mexican press attaché sought to evade the law after being caught with the BlackBerrys of several White House staffers .
The theft took place in 2008 during a bilateral get - together in New Orleans .
After the devices had been placed on a table outside the meeting room , Rafael Quintero Curiel picked up a handful and headed to the exit .
He made it to the airport before authorities picked him up .
After initially denying the theft , he owned up after being shown video footage of him being caught red - handed .
Claiming immunity , he headed back to Mexico where he was promptly sacked .
Libya : London police murder The murder of police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 resulted in the UK cutting all diplomatic ties with Tripoli .
No one was prosecuted over her death , and embassy staff claimed diplomatic immunity before being deported .
The young police officer was shot during a demonstration against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi , and the bullet was thought to have come from inside the building .
Last year , it was reported that prosecutors had named junior diplomat Abdulmagid Salah Ameri as a suspect .
He would have to be stripped of any immunity if charges were to be brought .
United States : killings in Pakistan Already shaky relations between Washington and Islamabad were dealt a further blow in January 2011 by the killing of two Pakistanis by CIA operative Raymond Davis .
The US citizen claimed the pair were trying to rob him at the time of the incident .
But despite claims of diplomatic immunity , Davis was initially jailed over charges of murder and illegal weapons possession .
He was eventually released after paying off the relatives of the dead men under a deal that the families said they were forced to accept .
Zaire : rent at the UN Poverty - stricken Zaire attempted to avoid paying rent at the home of its UN mission by citing diplomatic immunity .
By early 1992 , the African nation – known now as the Democratic Republic of Congo – owed $ 400,000 to a private landlord in Manhattan .
The issue made its way to the New York courts , which eventually ruled against the central African nation , ordering US marshals to seize the premises if the Zairians failed to pay up .
US : road charges in London Penny - pinchers at the US embassy in London
have deprived Londoners of more than £ 5.5 m in congestion charges , and the figure continues to grow .
In a long - running dispute , the US claims the charge is a tax , and as such diplomats are not liable to pay it .
London mayors Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson have both taken a dim view of the US 's reluctance to pay up .
In an exchange over the money owed , Johnson reportedly reminded President Barack Obama that British diplomats stump up for US bridge tolls , and as such their trans - Atlantic cousins should do likewise with the C - charge .
Burma : ambassador murders
But perhaps the most egregious use of diplomatic immunity goes to the former Burmese ambassador to Sri Lanka who reportedly murdered his wife before burning her body in his backyard – in full view of spectators and police .
The 1979 incident is recalled by Gerald Hensley , former vice dean of the diplomatic corps in Sri Lanka , who himself heard it secondhand from a Cuban counterpart .
"" The story was she had started an affair with a band leader , and when she came back late one evening he shot her .
The next morning he was out in Cinnamon Gardens , a suburb of Colombo , carrying logs for the fire , "" said Mr Hensley , who also served as New Zealand 's high commissioner to Singapore as well as a posting in Washington , DC .
Neighbours recognised that the Burmese diplomat was making a funeral pyre and informed Sri Lankan police when he then dumped his wife 's body on top .
"" It caused quite a stink , "" Hensley said , adding : "" The ambassador said it was Burmese territory and they could n't enter .
In the end he was removed by the Burmese government and nobody seems to know what happened to him . """
2012-03-28,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's claim to immunity from being sued are "" completely baseless "" , lawyers for the hotel chambermaid he is alleged to have sexually assaulted said on Wednesday .
Attorneys for the former head of the International Monetary Fund asked a court in New York to dismiss the lawsuit , citing an international convention that the sitting judge noted had not been ratified by the US , with terms not backed by the IMF itself .
At the end of a two - hour hearing at Bronx supreme court , lawyers said alleged victim Nafissatou Diallo would not be denied her day in court and vowed that Strauss - Kahn would have to face justice .
The session came just hours after lurid details relating to Strauss - Kahn 's alleged links to a prostitution ring in Lille were leaked to the press .
According to a transcript of police questioning , reproduced in part by Le Monde , the married former IMF boss admitted to attending a string of orgies around the world .
But he insisted that he did not know the female participants were paid to be there .
He also is said to have admitted to using terms including "" equipment "" and "" luggage "" to describe woman .
On Monday , prosecutors handed down a preliminary charge of "" aggravated procurement in an organized gang "" in relation to a vice investigation centring on the French city of Lille .
Strauss - Kahn 's French lawyer said his client engaged in "" libertine "" acts but denied any criminal wrongdoing .
The civil case being heard in New York is separate from the French criminal inquiry .
Lawyers for Diallo said they were watching developments over in Europe , but Strauss - Kahn 's US attorney said it had no bearing on the lawsuit .
The civil proceedings relate to 33-year - old hotel employee 's claim that the French politician attacked her last May as she attempted to clean his room at New York 's Sofitel hotel .
She alleges that Strauss - Kahn ran at her naked , molested her and forced her to perform oral sex on him .
The claims led to a criminal investigation against the IMF boss last year and his house arrest in Manhattan .
But charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment were eventually dropped , with prosecutors citing "" substantial credibility issues "" with the alleged victim .
At the beginning of civil proceedings , Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers tried to argue that the case be struck out as their client has immunity under international law .
But Judge Douglas McKeon repeatedly pointed out to them that the framework they were arguing under – 1947 's Convention on Privileges and Immunities of Specialised Agencies – had never been ratified by the US .
Furthermore , the judge said that an annex to the document submitted by the IMF showed that the international body itself did not sign up to the "" absolute immunity "" it provided for .
"" As I read it , the IMF adheres to its own immunity and declined to sign on to the absolute immunity that you claim the specialised agencies convention provides , "" he told Amit Mehta , one of Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers .
In its own founding documents , the IMF provided for immunity for a senior executive working in an official capacity , the judge said .
Straus - Kahn was not in New York on official business , it was noted in court .
Douglas Wignor , for Diallo , told the court that neither the IMF nor Strauss - Kahn himself had argued for immunity during the last year 's criminal case , in which the defendant pleaded not guilty .
"" It was not in his interest to do so , "" Mehta countered .
Wignor went on to argue that Strauss - Kahn had already stepped down from his post by the time the lawsuit was filed , and as such was not covered even if the IMF had claimed immunity for its former head .
The plaintiff 's lawyer concluded his arguments by asking the judge to "" confirm what everybody else has said , that DSK does not have immunity . ""
He added : "" Diallo will get her day in court and have a jury trial in this case . ""
Judge McKeon adjourned the session to consider his verdict .
Outside court , Kenneth Thompson , Wignor 's co - counsel , said : "" Dominique Strauss - Kahn thinks he is above the law .
His claim of immunity is completely baseless . ""
His client was still suffering both mentally and physically from the alleged attack , Thompson said .
Thompson added that they were not interested in "" trying to settle this case "" , only in getting Strauss - Kahn to a New York courtroom to face their allegations .
But William Taylor , Mehta 's co - counsel , implied that financial concerns were the real motive behind the lawsuit . ""
Oh course it is about money , "" he said .
Neither Diallo nor Strauss - Kahn were in court to hear the legal arguments .
Asked about his client 's mood , Taylor said : "" He is in good spirits .
He sends his regards . """
2012-03-28,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers will return to a New York courtroom to try to get a civil case over an alleged sexual assault dismissed – days after Strauss - Kahn was told of separate charges in his native France .
Wednesday 's session is to focus on whether the former head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is protected under diplomatic immunity from being sued by the chambermaid he is alleged to have assaulted in an upmarket Manhattan hotel suite .
It is thought that neither Strauss - Kahn nor his accuser , Nafissatou Diallo , will attend the hearing , which takes place Wednesday afternoon in Bronx supreme court .
Diallo , 33 , claims Strauss - Kahn , a one - time French presidential hope , attacked her last May as she attempted to clean his room at New York 's Sofitel hotel .
She alleges that Strauss - Kahn ran at her naked , molested her and forced her to perform oral sex on him .
The claims led to a criminal investigation against the IMF boss last year and his house arrest in Manhattan .
But charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment were eventually dropped , with prosecutors citing "" substantial credibility issues "" with the alleged victim .
The investigation revealed that the hotel employee had lied about her initial account of what happened inside the hotel room and discussed the incident with a jailed boyfriend , reportedly suggesting that there was "" money to be made "" .
Lawyers for Strauss - Kahn have maintained that their client is innocent , suggesting that the encounter was consensual .
But in interviews given as the criminal case fell apart , Diallo insisted that she was the victim of an attempted rape and , vowed to hold Strauss Kahn to account , leading the way to civil proceedings .
The session is likely to focus of complex legal argument relating to whether the 62-year - old Frenchman is shielded from lawsuits by means of his former position as head of an international body in a host nation .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers have said that their client is eligible for immunity under a 1947 United Nations agreement that protects high - ranking employees of "" specialised agencies "" , including the IMF , from prosecution .
At the time of the hotel incident in New York , Strauss Kahn was carrying diplomatic papers .
He claimed immunity after being escorted off an Air France flight and arrested shortly after the alleged attack .
But the IMF did n't back the claim , stating that he was in New York on personal and not official business .
Likewise , lawyers for Diallo have denied claims that he is covered .
The issue did not form part of Strauss - Kahn 's defence in the criminal case that was dismissed last year .
As the civil case against him plays out in New York , across the Atlantic focus has turned to potential criminal charges over his alleged connection to a hotel prostitution ring .
On Monday , prosecutors handed down a preliminary charge of "" aggravated procurement in an organised gang "" in relation to a vice investigation in the French city of Lille .
Strauss - Kahn 's French lawyer said his client engaged in "" libertine "" acts but denied any criminal wrongdoing .
The former IMF chief was released on bail but barred by a judge from speaking publicly about the case ."
2012-04-22,"Those who watched Dominique Strauss - Kahn at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund a year ago say he played a blinder .
Although he was to leave Washington under a cloud shortly afterwards , DSK impressed with his no - nonsense approach to his fellow Europeans .
The IMF 's managing director asked Jean - Claude Trichet , then president of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , and Christine Lagarde , at the time France 's finance minister , who they thought they were kidding when they insisted there was no problem in the eurozone .
The case put by Trichet and Lagarde was that the single currency as a whole had low levels of debt , had no current account deficit in aggregate and was not contributing to the imbalances in the global economy .
Strauss - Kahn told them to face up to the fact that the single currency was being eaten away by the sovereign debt crisis .
A year on and not much has changed .
Lagarde is now doing DSK 's old job at the IMF and perhaps has a better understanding of what he was on about .
The fund has rattled the tin for contributions to a bigger firewall to cope with future crises , and has got some but not all of its members to stump up .
Greece has had a second bailout and the decisive action by the ECB prevented a whole raft of eurozone banks from going belly up at the end of last year .
As in the spring of 2011 , the Europeans arrived in Washington for the half - yearly meeting of the IMF professing that all was well , and that the benefits of structural reforms would eventually become apparent in the members of the eurozone that needed to improve their competitiveness .
Be patient , they said .
Few were convinced by this flannel .
Indeed , there was not an awful lot of sympathy for the Europeans , particularly from the emerging world , which wondered why poor countries should be asked to contribute to a bailout fund for the world 's richest continent , particularly since they were simultaneously being told that the eurozone 's problems were behind it .
Many also remember the hard line taken by the Europeans during the sovereign debt crises of the 1990s .
Yet there was concern as well as irritation .
The global economy is still moving forward painfully slowly , and there is a risk that contagion spreading from the eurozone could again halt this process .
The upward pressure on Spanish bond yields in recent weeks illustrates deep and lingering concerns about Europe 's problems .
It was quite a shock for the markets last week to discover just how dependent Spanish banks were on the ECB for funding , and there is justifiable anxiety about the fragility that would be exposed by a fresh and highly probable fall in Spanish property prices .
What markets are looking for is a convincing story about how countries such as Italy and Spain , let alone Greece and Portugal , dig themselves out of the mess they are in .
They have yet to get one .
Traditionally , the sort of structural adjustment programmes imposed by the IMF involve a big currency devaluation to make a country 's exports cheaper .
Because this also makes imports dearer , the package also includes domestic austerity to prevent the benefits of increased competitiveness being frittered away through higher inflation .
This remedy – the one that was used in the 1990s for Mexico and during the Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 – is not available for countries inside the eurozone .
But if devaluation is ruled out , so sadly are all the other possible cures : fiscal transfers or a willingness by Germany and the other rich countries of northern Europe to accept higher inflation than those in the south .
Instead , Greece , Portugal and Ireland are being forced to grind out improvements in competitiveness through austerity and structural reforms alone .
This will take many years , and in the meantime slashing wages and pensions is killing the domestic economy .
This matters because markets are worried about rising levels of national debt as a proportion of national output .
If national output goes down because of permanent recession , the debt - to - GDP ratio worsens and countries end up chasing their tails .
This is the sort of conundrum that would no doubt have tickled Lewis Carroll .
Markets take fright at high budget deficits and rising debt levels and demand severe belt - tightening .
When the belt - tightening has the desired effects , markets demand to know where the growth is going to come from .
There was not the remotest suggestion in Washington last week that anybody knows how to solve this conundrum .
Lagarde talked airily about developing "" more and better Europe "" but lacked a convincing explanation for how this would come about .
The IMF supports common eurobonds that would take the pressure off the weaker nations , and would like money to be channelled directly into eurozone banks from Europe 's bailout fund , rather than the money needing to go to sovereign states first .
Both ideas are strongly resisted by the Germans .
The danger , therefore , is that the time bought by the ECB 's emergency action is wasted .
The economic data from Italy and Spain over the coming quarters is almost certain to be abysmal , and pressure from the financial markets is likely to intensify despite the fact that both the eurozone and the IMF now have bigger firewalls .
Both Lagarde and George Osborne noted last week that the firewalls on their own will not be sufficient to end the crisis .
The comparison with three years ago when the newly created G20 met in London could hardly be starker .
At that time , there was collective action to ease both monetary and fiscal policy to prevent a second Great Depression .
That mood of unity quickly dissipated , however .
As a tentative recovery began , countries started to go their own way , fears about the debts incurred in the fight against recession surfaced and orthodox thinking returned .
The G20 is now a shadow of what it was designed to be –
it is both toothless and divided .
The only sign of collective action is in Europe , obsessed as it is with austerity .
There is no sign of a credible and coherent plan to boost employment and growth , and thus no compelling narrative for the markets .
In the end , the expectation is that Germany 's commitment to the European project will prove so unbreakable that it will swallow its doubts about fiscal transfers , eurobonds and direct lending to troubled banks .
Eventually , Germany may be forced to become the equivalent of an IMF for Europe , providing the money for bailouts in return for structural change .
For this to occur , though , there will need to be a real threat that the single currency will break up .
The crisis would have to get worse through a combination of stupidity and complacency .
As things stand , that is precisely what is going to happen ."

The former head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , has accused political enemies linked to Nicolas Sarkozy and his ruling UMP party of destroying his bid for the French presidency by choreographing the scandal that erupted last year when he was accused of assaulting a New York hotel maid .
In an exclusive interview published by the Guardian , Strauss - Kahn stated that he believes the highly public undoing that followed his encounter with the housekeeper in the Sofitel hotel 's presidential suite , and his imprisonment on charges of attempted rape , were orchestrated by his political opponents .
While he does not believe the incident with Nafissatou Diallo was a setup , he said the subsequent escalation of the events on 14 May into a criminal investigation that destroyed his chances of winning the presidency had been "" shaped by those with a political agenda "" and that "" more was involved here than mere coincidence "" .
Strauss - Kahn , 63 , alleges that he was put under surveillance by French intelligence weeks before he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting Diallo .
He accuses operatives linked to Sarkozy of intercepting phone calls and making sure Diallo went to the New York police , thus sparking an international scandal . ""
Perhaps I was politically naive , but I simply did not believe that they would go that far …
I did n't think they could find anything that could stop me , "" Strauss - Kahn told investigative journalist Edward Jay Epstein .
Epstein 's ebook on his investigation of the scandal , Three Days in May , is published by Melville House on Monday .
Strauss - Kahn 's accusations come at a highly sensitive moment in French politics , days before the final round of the presidential election , which until his downfall last year he had been tipped to win .
The vote will be held on 6 May , with polls showing the Socialist François Hollande beating the rightwing incumbent Sarkozy .
At the time of his arrest on 14 May last year , Strauss - Kahn was polling ahead of Hollande for the Socialist nomination , for which he planned to declare the following month , and was in the lead against Sarkozy for the presidency itself .
He had no doubts , he told Epstein , that he would take occupancy of the Elysée Palace .
Strauss - Kahn 's allegations are based on his own studies over the past 11 months – aided by a private detective service , Guidepost Solutions – of the Sofitel 's CCTV footage , electronic key card and mobile phone records .
The intensity of his research shows the extent of his belief that he was the victim of dirty tricks – though his critics would dismiss it as paranoia .
Strauss - Kahn remains in considerable difficulty over his sexual history .
All charges against him were dropped by New York prosecutors in August 2011 after they found Diallo to be an unreliable witness , and he has consistently portrayed the encounter with her as consensual .
But Diallo continues to press her claim for damages in the civil courts , alleging that she was attacked by him as she went about her housekeeping duties .
A judge in Manhattan is due to rule on Tuesday on whether or not Strauss - Kahn can claim diplomatic immunity in the case .
The scandal has also put the spotlight on Strauss - Kahn 's lifestyle and attitude to women .
In text messages sent to associates who participated in sex parties he attended – one of which was held in Washington just a day before he went to the Sofitel –
he reportedly referred to women as "" material "" .
The Sofitel incident has severely dented Strauss - Kahn 's reputation in France , where he remains in total retreat from the political scene .
When he returned to Paris after the charges were dropped , polls showed the majority of the country did not want him to return to politics .
Feminist groups led street protests about sexism in French society , furious at the language some French figures had used to describe the Strauss - Kahn case .
His recent appearances at public events in Cambridge in the UK , and Brussels have been marked by protests from women 's rights activists .
Sarkozy , who had been key in appointing Strauss - Kahn to the IMF , has repeatedly used his name to attack the Socialists .
In a recent rally at Cyr - sur - Loire , he said : "" I wo n't take lessons on morality , particularly not from a part of the left that wanted to put Mr Strauss - Kahn in the Elysée . ""
Last month , Strauss - Kahn 's troubles deepened further when he was charged with "" aggravated procurement in an organised gang "" – the legal term for pimping – in relation to his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring .
The case centres on allegations that his business associates organised prostitution at the Carlton hotel in Lille .
He declined to talk to Epstein about the new allegations , saying he was under legal restrictions .
Strauss - Kahn 's direct accusation that he was a victim of a trap are based on a complicated web of factors .
He says that long before the Sofitel events , he became convinced that he was being tracked by French intelligence .
On the morning of the Sofitel incident , he told Epstein , he received a text message on the BlackBerry he used for IMF work and personal emails from a friend in Paris .
She warned him that his communications were being intercepted and that an email he had sent to his wife , Anne Sinclair , had been discovered by a sympathiser inside the UMP party headquarters in Paris .
Such were his fears , he went to the length of encrypting all his seven phones to scramble his messages , though he removed the software shortly before the Sofitel events after he found that all the devices began to stop working .
"" I took the threat seriously , "" he said .
He also emphasised to Epstein a celebratory dance performed by a couple of Sofitel employees that was caught on the hotel 's CCTV footage soon after Diallo made a 911 call to New York police leading to Strauss - Kahn 's arrest .
It is not known why the men were rejoicing , though Strauss - Kahn said he did not believe the "" victory dance was a coincidence "" .
The Sofitel said : "" We have co - operated fully with authorities and have no further comment at this time . """
2012-04-27,"( This is a French translation of a Guardian story about Dominique Strauss - Kahn ) L'ancien chef du Fonds Monétaire International ( FMI ) , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , a ouvertement accusé ses ennemis politiques , affiliés à Nicolas Sarkozy et son
parti
l'UMP , d'avoir
détruit sa candidature à la présidence française en chorégraphiant le scandale sexuel qui a éclaté l'année dernière quand
il a été accusé d'avoir agressé l'employée d'hôtel Nafissatou Diallo à New York .
Dans sa première interview pour un journal depuis sa déchéance publique en mai dernier , publiée par le Guardian aujourd'hui , Strauss - Kahn a déclaré
qu'il croyait que le scandal qui avait suivi sa rencontre avec la femme de ménage de l'hôtel Sofitel à New York , et son emprisonnement sous l'inculpation de tentative de viol , avaient été orchestrés par ses ennemis politiques .
Bien
qu'il ne pense pas
que sa rencontre avec Nafissatou Diallo
ait été un piège , il soutient que l'escalade ultérieure
aux événements
qui ont eu lieu dans
la suite présidentielle de l'hôtel le 14 mai 2011 , ainsi que l'enquête criminelle qui a suivi , ont détruit ses
chances de gagner la présidence française
et ont été "" façonnées par ceux qui ont un agenda politique "" et qu'il s'agissait de "" plus qu'une simple coïncidence "" .
Strauss - Kahn , qui a 63 ans , allège qu'il a été mis sous surveillance par le service de renseignement français des semaines avant son arrestation pour après avoir prétendument agressé Diallo sexuellement .
Il accuse également des agents liés à Sarkozy d'avoir intercepté des appels téléphoniques et fait
en sorte que
Diallo aille à la police de New - York ,
ce qui aurait déclenché la nature internationale du scandale . ""
Peut - être que
j'étais politiquement naïf , mais je ne croyais tout simplement pas qu'ils iraient aussi loin ...
Je ne pensais pas
qu'ils pouvaient trouver quoi que ce soit pour m'arrêter "" ,
a - t - il dit dans une interview de plus de deux heures avec le journaliste d'investigation
New - Yorkais Edward Jay Epstein pour le Guardian .
L'enquête de Epstein sur le scandale ,
Three Days in May , est publiée en format e - book par Melville House ce lundi .
Ces fortes accusations de la part de Strauss - Kahn arrivent à un moment
très sensible de la scène politique française , tombant quelques jours avant le second tour de l'élection présidentielle pour laquelle ,
jusqu'à
sa chute publique l'année dernière , Strauss - Kahn avait
été pressenti le vainqueur .
Le scrutin présidentiel aura lieu
le 6 mai , avec les derniers sondages en date présentant le socialiste François Hollande devançant le candidat de droite , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Au moment de son arrestation le 14 mai , les sondages présentaient Strauss - Kahn comme vainqueur face à Hollande à l'investiture socialiste , pour laquelle il envisageait de déclarer sa candidature le mois suivant ,
et était egalement en tête face à Sarkozy pour la présidence elle - même .
Il ne faisait aucun doute , a - t - il dit à Epstein , qu'il allait s'emparer de l'Elysée .
Les allégations de Strauss - Kahn sont basées sur ses propres études au cours des 11 derniers mois - qui ont été aidées par un service de détectives privés , Solutions Guidepost , ainsi que les images télevisées à circuit fermé de Sofitel , une carte - clé électronique et des dossiers de téléphonie mobile .
L'intensité de sa recherche montre l'étendue de ses convictions :
selon ses propos , il a été la victime des coups tordus – même si ses détracteurs rejetteraient ses dires comme de la paranoïa .
Les accusations restent ceci - dit à prouver
, et Strauss - Kahn continue d'être
en difficulté considérable par raport
à son histoire sexuelle .
Toutes les accusations
contre
lui ont été abandonnées par les procureurs de New York en août 2011
après avoir établi
que Diallo était un témoin peu fiable ,
et il a toujours insisté
sur le fait que sa rencontre avec elle était consensuelle .
Celle - ci cependant continue à demander sa demande de dommages - intérêts devant les juridictions civiles , allégant qu'elle a été brutalement attaquée alors qu'elle s'occupait du nettoyage .
Un juge de Manhattan doit décider mardi prochain si Strauss - Kahn peut invoquer l'immunité diplomatique dans cette affaire .
Le scandale a également mis l'accent sur le style de vie de Strauss - Kahn , ainsi que son attitude envers les femmes .
Dans des SMS envoyés aux associés qui ont participé à des orgies auxquelles il a assisté
, do nt une qui a eu lieu
à Washington juste un jour avant son arrivée l'hôtel Sofitel , Strauss - Kahn
a fait allusion à des femmes comme du "" matériel "" , selon la presse française .
L'incident du Sofitel a gravement écorné la réputation de Strauss - Kahn en France , où il reste en
retrait total de la scène politique .
Après son retour à Paris une fois les accusations abandonnées ,
les sondages ont indiqué que
la majorité du pays ne voulait pas
de son retour dans la vie politique .
Des groupes féministes ont organisé des manifestations , pointant du doigt le sexisme lattant de la société française .
Ces groupes étaient furieux quant au langage utilisé par certains commentateurs pour décrire l'affaire .
Les récentes apparitions de Strauss - Kahn lors
d'événements publiques à Cambridge au Royaume - Uni , ainsi qu ' à Bruxelles , ont été marquées par des protestations de militants supportant les droits des femmes .
Sarkozy , qui avait joué un rôle clé dans la nomination de Strauss - Kahn au FMI , a utilisé à plusieurs reprises son nom pour attaquer le parti socialiste .
Dans un récent rallye politique à Cyr - sur - Loire , il a dit : "" Je ne vais pas prendre des leçons sur la morale , et surtout pas venant
d'une partie de la gauche
qui voulait mettre Strauss - Kahn à l'Elysée . ""
Le mois dernier , les ennuis de Strauss - Kahn se sont aggravés quand il a été accusé de "" proxénétisme aggravé en bande organisée "" – le terme juridique pour proxénétisme – en relation à son implication présumée dans un réseau de prostitution .
L'affaire repose sur des allégations selon lesquelles ses associés d'affaires entretenaient un réseau de prostitution à l'Hôtel Carlton de Lille .
Strauss - Kaha refusé d'aborder ses nouvelles allégations avec Epstein , disant
qu'il était soumis à des restrictions juridiques .
Les accusations directes de Strauss - Kahn , selon lesquelles il
a été victime d'un piège posé par Sarkozy , sont basées sur un réseau complexe de facteurs .
Bien avant les événements Sofitel , il était convaincu qu'il était suivi par les services d'intelligence français .
Le matin de l'incident Sofitel , a - t - il dit à Epstein , il avait reçu un texte d'un ami
à Paris sur le BlackBerry qu'il utilisait pour son travail au FMI , ainsi que pour ses e - mails personnels .
Elle l'avertissait que ses communications avaient été interceptées , et qu'un courriel envoyé à sa femme Anne Sinclair avait
été découvert par un sympathisant
à l'intérieur du siège
du parti UMP à Paris .
Ses craintes étaient telles qu'il était allé jusqu'à encrypter tous ses sept téléphones pour brouiller ses messages .
Il avait cependant enlevé le logiciel peu de temps
avant les événements Sofitel , après avoir découvert que les dispositifs ne fonctionnaient plus . ""
J'ai pris la menace au sérieux "" , a - t - il dit .
Il a également abordé la "" danse de célébration "" esquissée par un couple d'employés Sofitel , qui a été filmée grâce aux images de vidéo - surveillance de l'hôtel peu de temps après l'appel de Diallo
à la police de New - York , appel qui a conduit à l'arrestation de Strauss - Kahn .
Il n'est toujours pas su pourquoi les hommes se réjouissaient , mais Strauss - Kahn a déclaré
qu'il ne croyait pas que "" la danse de la victoire ait été une coïcidence ) .
"" L'hôtel Sofitel a déclaré : "" Nous avons pleinement coopéré avec les autorités et n'avons pas d'autres commentaires à ce moment . """
2012-04-27,"The Pavillon de la Reine is a luxury hotel in the heart of the Marais in Paris .
It carries an air of a 19th - century establishment , with its crisp and elegant decor designed to attract globetrotters in their quest for a quiet and discreet place of rest .
It is here , on Friday 13 April , that I arranged to meet Dominique Strauss - Kahn for his first major newspaper interview since his downfall .
For a man who has spent years operating at the highest levels of French and global politics , he clearly retains an ingrained habit of punctuality , arriving precisely at the appointed time – 11 am – walking over and shaking hands with a firm grip . ""
Thank you so much for your interest in this case , "" he says .
Strauss - Kahn is much smaller than I had expected , about 1.7 metres ( 5 ft 7 in ) .
Impeccably dressed , he was wearing a dark suit and loafers , and an open - necked blue shirt that showed off a deep tan set against white hair and deep set eyes .
Though I 'd never met him before , he was instantly recognisable .
We sit in sofas in a corner of the hotel lobby , and for the next two and a half hours , over double espressos , we discuss what amounts to one of the most public and extreme falls from grace of any major public figure in recent times .
Eleven months earlier , on 13 May 2011 , Strauss - Kahn had stepped out of a yellow New York cab in front of the Sofitel , another high - end hotel , in midtown Manhattan .
CCTV footage that I have obtained and studied in the course of writing a book on the Sofitel scandal , Three Days in May , shows him entering the hotel , sporting a rain coat and pulling a black suitcase behind him .
At that moment , he was a man at the very top of his game .
He was one of the most powerful and respected politicians and economists in the world .
A former French economics minister , he was presiding over the 178-nation International Monetary Fund .
The next day he would be departing New York on his way to Berlin to see the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , to try and enlist her support for a plan he had devised , codenamed "" Comprehensive "" , to head off the impending disaster of a Greek default on its sovereign debt default . ""
If Germany backed it , the other European governments would follow , "" he explains in our interview .
Otherwise , the crises "" would quickly spiral out of control and spread to Spain , Italy and other Eurozone countries . ""
He was also poised to announce his candidacy for the French presidency .
"" I planned to make my formal announcement on 15 June and I had no doubt I would be the candidate of the Socialist party , "" he says .
Nor were there any doubts in his mind about his chances of winning the election , as he obtained his key card for the Sofitel 's aptly named presidential suite .
( He had not solicited the upgrade to the $ 3,000-a - night suite but it was the sort of royal treatment he had received from the hotel before and to which he had become accustomed , entitled even , paying only the $ 525 rate for an ordinary room . )
Polls at the time suggested he was nearly 20 points ahead of the incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy and he had more than a fighting chance to replace him as occupant of the Elysée Palace .
Presidential ambition
As things turned out , he would not reach Berlin , nor would he run for president .
Instead , over the next few days he would be arrested , made to do the "" perp "" ( perpetrator ) walk and charged by a grand jury with sexual assault .
By August 2011 when the New York prosecutors decided that the only witness against him , a maid at the Sofitel , had not been reliable and dropped all charges , the scandal had so sullied his reputation that his leadership of the IMF as well as his French presidential ambitions were at an end .
I was expecting to find a depressed Strauss - Kahn given his downfall and the fact that three weeks before we met he was charged with complicity in a French prostitution ring .
But as we begin to discuss what happened at the Sofitel he is strikingly upbeat .
He makes it manifestly clear to me that he now believes that his public undoing did not occur in isolation from his plans to challenge Sarkozy and his centre - right UMP party in the 2012 French elections .
Strauss - Kahn says there is considerable evidence that he had been under surveillance in the days immediately before his stay at the Sofitel and that the unfolding drama there had been orchestrated in such a way as to derail his presidential ambitions .
The events had been "" shaped by those with a political agenda "" into an international attempted rape scandal , he tells me .
When he was taken off an aeroplane destined for Paris at JFK airport and put in handcuffs on suspicion of having attempted to rape the Sofitel maid
Nafissatou Diallo , he said he had no idea what was going on .
But over the past 11 months he and a private detective service he 's hired , Guidepost Solutions , have been carrying out their own studies of the hotel 's closed circuit videos , electronic key swipe records , mobile phone records and other evidence that reveals a great deal of behind - the - scene activities at the French - owned Sofitel .
Even Strauss - Kahn 's arrival at the hotel was odd .
He did not call ahead to notify it of the time when he would be arriving , nor tell his office at the IMF .
Yet to his surprise he was met by a hotel doorman .
My research has uncovered CCTV footage that shows a hotel employee , the chief engineer Brian Yearwood , rushing out of the hotel with a phone pressed to his ear shortly before the then IMF chief 's arrival .
I ask Strauss - Kahn whether he has any idea who was on the other end of the call .
He gestures no .
On the film , Yearwood seems to appear just before Strauss - Kahn goes inside the hotel , and as soon as the latter leaves , he seems to follow the same route .
These near - encounters , which would continue the next day , may have been pure coincidence , or Yearwood may have been tasked by the hotel to make sure that the guest 's arrival , and departure , went smoothly .
But how did he , or the person on the phone , know when Strauss - Kahn 's cab was arriving ?
( I requested an interview with Yearwood , but he , like all other Sofitel employees I approached , declined to speak to me . )
The director of safety and security at the Sofitel , John Sheehan , held the same title for its parent company , Accor , which is a part of the France - based Accor group .
On the day of the Diallo incident , Sheehan was off work but was in frequent touch with Yearwood , exchanging no fewer than 13 text messages with him between 10.21am and 10.35am , according to mobile phone records that I have studied .
Sheehan headed to the Sofitel after 1.03pm on the 13 May having received a call and while en route , according to his phone records , he called a 646 number ( Manhattan area code ) belonging to Accor .
Sheehan 's ultimate superior is René - Georges Querry , a well connected former chief of French police anti - gang units , who was now head of security for Accor group .
Before joining in 2003 , Querry had worked closely in the police with Ange Mancini , who then became Sarkozy 's intelligence co - ordinator .
At the time that Sheehan was making his call to the 646 number , Querry was arriving at a football match in Paris where he would be seated in Sarkozy 's presidential box .
Querry denies receiving any information about the unfolding drama at the Sofitel at this time , or until after Strauss - Kahn was taken into custody about four hours later .
The Sofitel said that it had co - operated fully with authorities and had no further comment .
Then there was the question of the IMF chief 's BlackBerry and mobile phones .
Strauss - Kahn tells me that he had long been suspicious that his communications were being intercepted by his political opponents in France .
There had been many blatant signs , he says , such as the discovery made by someone sympathetic to him who had been working inside the headquarters of the UMP .
He or she discovered a copy of one of Strauss - Kahn 's emails to his wife , Anne Sinclair , stuck inside a photocopying machine .
Strauss - Kahn says that he had been sufficiently worried that he was being tracked that in the spring of 2011 he instructed his security staff to set up a sophisticated encryption system for his seven phones so that his conversations could not be snooped on .
"" I took the threat seriously , "" he tells me with a look of frustration .
But then , one by one , all his encrypted phones began to break .
He was so frustrated that before he came to the US last May he had the encryption removed from all his devices .
It puzzles me that he had decided to remove the encryption even when he was anxious about being followed , and even though some of the emails he was sending related to his personal life including , we now know , his attendance of sex parties .
I ask him had n't he been concerned that removing the encryption would leave him vulnerable to surveillance by intelligence services ?
"" I had to make calls , "" he replies with a shrug .
But he does acknowledge that he may have underestimated the dangers of his communications being intercepted by Sarkozy 's people . ""
Perhaps I was politically naive but I simply did not believed that they would go that far …
I did n't think they could find anything that could stop me . ""
The "" they "" to whom he is referring is clearly in the context of our conversation operatives working for Sarkozy .
Inside the room
The exact nature of what happened inside the presidential suite of the Sofitel on the morning of 13 May 2011 will never be known because there are no witnesses other than Strauss - Kahn and Diallo , a 32-year - old from Guinea in West Africa .
Both parties agree there was a sexual encounter .
The then IMF head says it was consensual .
Diallo by contrast holds that he dragged her first to the bedroom and then to the end of the interior corridor across from the bathroom where , after molesting her , he forced her to perform oral sex on him .
Strauss - Kahn does not want to go into detail about the encounter , though he does not deny it took place .
He claimed he was just getting out of the shower and rushing to meet his daughter for lunch , set for 12.30pm .
When he stepped out of the bathroom , still naked , he says he was surprised to see a woman in a housekeeper 's uniform looking directly at him .
He tells me that from his perspective , it did not look as if she had come to clean the suite . ""
I am certain that she had no cleaning equipment , there was no cleaning cart , "" he says .
They had a brief exchange of words and gestures , from which he surmised that she was offering him a sexual service , he says .
What followed , he insists , was consensual , though that conflicts with Diallo 's account to police that he brutally , sexually attacked her .
She is suing him in the New York civil courts .
In the more than two hours we speak , it becomes clear that Strauss - Kahn is convinced that his downfall was choreographed by his political enemies .
They may not have gone so far as to set up the encounter with Diallo , he now accepts , but he believes they did play a role , through intercepted phone calls , in making sure that the hotel maid went to the police and thus turned a private tryst into a public scandal .
The media in France has recently reported , based on interviews with French intelligence officers , that he had become a target of the country 's intelligence service in 2011 .
I ask him whether he believes the targeting of him by French intelligence , the interception of his calls , and the surveillance in New York are related .
"" It would appear that more was involved here than mere coincidence , "" he replies , with characteristic understatement .
He also blames French officials for the fact that he had to languish in jail in New York and had to undergo the public humiliation that brought .
He thought he would be released immediately on bail – as would be normal for someone as prominent as he was .
But later that day the deal was abruptly terminated .
It has been reported in the French press that the New York prosecutor , Cyrus Vance , had received information bearing on the case from one or more French officials .
At the bail hearing , the assistant district attorney said that unverified "" additional information [ was ] being provided on a daily basis regarding [ Strauss - Kahn 's ] behaviour and background . ""
Partly on the back of that intervention , he spent a week in jail – another huge blow to his global reputation .
The only area Strauss - Kahn is unable to discuss , owing to legal restrictions , is the prostitution case in which he was recently charged .
Before arriving in New York last year he attended about six sex parties , beginning in 2009 , including two in Washington , at which some of the women were prostitutes .
He did not pay any of these women , he says , though that would have been legal under French law .
He is charged instead with "" aggravated pimping "" .
In the course of French police investigations into a sex ring centred on the Carlton hotel in Lille , in which Strauss - Kahn was not involved , detectives found out about the sex party in the W hotel in Washington ; they also discovered that prostitutes had been brought to it ; and that he had sent text messages , requesting to know from the parties ' organisers , whether there would be "" material "" provided – his codeword for women .
Those charges are still pending , hence his inability to discuss them .
That he took such breathtaking risks – knowing that he was about to put himself forward as a French presidential candidate , and suspecting as he did that he was under surveillance from his opponents – speaks of a certain sense of invulnerability .
The party at the W hotel took place on 12 May – a day before he checked in at the Sofitel .
That makes one wonder about his mindset .
Was it that , as a man of huge international renown used to being courted around the world , he perhaps felt he was invincible , a Master of the Universe ?
If he had any of that sentiment , it has been thoroughly tested over the past 11 months .
It 's striking though that he still speaks with notable confidence .
Despite everything that has happened , he still harbours hopes of a return to public life as an economist .
He recently addressed an economic gathering in Kiev , Ukraine , on the consequences of globalisation and he continues to be deeply engaged in other issues that absorbed him while at the IMF .
One of his great regrets was that in the end he never did get to meet Merkel and put to her his plan for saving Greece .
"" I am not entirely sure that I could have convinced her , "" he says , but he believes that he might have persuaded her to back him , and with Germany 's help the Greek crisis could have been nipped in the bud .
"" Now we will never know , "" he adds wistfully .
Edward Jay Epstein is an investigative journalist and an author of 15 books .
His new book , Three Days in May : Sex , Surveillance and DSK , is published next week by Melville House"
2012-04-28,"The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has decried claims that his associates ruined the political career of Dominique Strauss - Kahn by choreographing the scandal that followed the former International Monetary Fund chief 's sexual encounter with a New York hotel maid .
Speaking at an election rally in central France , Sarkozy challenged Strauss - Kahn to take legal action over his allegations that his political enemies orchestrated the downfall that cost him the Socialist party 's presidential nomination .
"" I say to Mr Strauss - Kahn , explain yourself with judicial authorities and spare the French people your comments , "" Sarkozy told supporters in the city of Clermont - Ferrand . ""
In the midst of an electoral campaign , Mr Strauss - Kahn starts to give morality lessons and indicate that I am the one responsible for what happened to him .
It 's too much . ""
Strauss - Kahn said in an interview published in the Guardian last week that he believed the highly public undoing that followed his encounter with the hotel housekeeper Nafissatou Diallo and his subsequent imprisonment on charges of attempted rape were the work of individuals linked to Sarkozy and his ruling UMP party .
He said he did not believe the incident was a setup , but the escalation of events into a criminal investigation that destroyed his chances of winning the presidency had been "" shaped by those with a political agenda "" and that "" more was involved here than mere coincidence "" . ""
Perhaps I was politically naive , but I simply did not believe that they would go that far …
I did n't think they could find anything that could stop me , "" he said .
The 63-year - old alleged that he has been placed under surveillance by French intelligence weeks before his arrest .
He accused operatives linked to Sarkozy of intercepting phone calls and making sure Diallo went to the New York police , thus generating an international scandal .
Strauss - Kahn was forced to resign from the IMF in the wake of the incident .
With his political ambitions in tatters , he ceded the Socialist nomination to his rival François Hollande .
With the elections a week away , opinion polls put Hollande 10 percentage points clear of Sarkozy , who is facing a backlash over economic stagnation and high unemployment .
•
This article was amended on 29 April 2012 to make clear that Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's comments were not made to the Guardian , but in an interview that was published in the Guardian ."
2012-04-29,"The French Socialist party has distanced itself from Dominique Strauss - Kahn after he made comments published in the Guardian alleging that political enemies linked to Nicolas Sarkozy 's rightwing party helped discredit him when he was accused of the attempted rape of a New York hotel housekeeper .
François Hollande , the Socialist candidate for the French presidency , who polls predict will win the runoff election against Sarkozy on 6 May , said on French TV that Strauss - Kahn – who once hoped to become the left 's next president – "" no longer has a role in political life "" and had no business returning to it .
Hollande had already declared he would run against Strauss - Kahn in the Socialist primary race last year when Strauss - Kahn 's political career was cut short by allegations he had assaulted and attempted to rape the New York hotel worker Nafissatou Diallo .
Charges against Strauss - Kahn were eventually dropped , with prosecutors citing "" substantial credibility issues "" with the alleged victim .
But Diallo 's lawyers lodged a civil case against Strauss - Kahn over what they said was a "" violent and sadistic attack "" , and a judge will rule on Tuesday on whether he can claim diplomatic immunity .
Strauss - Kahn , whose lawyers said the encounter with Diallo was consensual , is now considered a political pariah in France .
Last month he was bailed and placed under formal judicial investigation for "" aggravated procurement in an organised gang "" – the legal term for pimping – in connection with his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring centred on the Hotel Carlton in Lille .
Socialists sought to draw a line under an embarrassing situation this weekend after several key party figures were invited to a birthday party in central Paris and swiftly left when they found Strauss - Kahn had also been invited .
The Socialist MP Julien Dray had invited Hollande 's campaign director Pierre Moscovici , the communications director Manuel Valls and Hollande 's former partner Ségolène Royal to a drinks party in a bar .
But they reportedly left upon learning that Strauss - Kahn was to be among the guests .
Royal , who attended with her daughter , said she walked out as soon as she heard Strauss - Kahn was expected , and it was "" out of the question "" for her ever to meet him face to face , "" in the name of women 's rights and respect due to women "" .
Valls said Strauss - Kahn "" has exited the campaign , he has no reason to come back into it "" .
Jean - Marc Ayrault , tipped as a possible Socialist prime minister if Hollande wins , dismissed the Strauss - Kahn case as "" a private affair subject to legal procedure "" .
Earlier on Saturday Sarkozy told a campaign rally in Clermont - Ferrand : "" I say to Mr Strauss - Kahn , explain yourself with judicial authorities and spare the French people your comments . ""
Sarkozy 's foreign minister , Alain Juppé , dismissed outright any suggestion of manipulation in the New York case , stressing the seriousness of the later prostitution investigation .
"" If it was a plot it would have been particularly clumsy .
It would have been better to wait for the Carlton , "" Juppé said .
In an interview published by the Guardian , Strauss - Kahn told the American journalist and author Edward Jay Epstein that he believed the public undoing that followed his encounter with the New York hotel worker was the work of individuals linked to Sarkozy and his party .
He did not say the incident with Diallo itself was a setup , but said the escalation of events into a criminal investigation that destroyed his chances of winning the presidency had been "" shaped by those with a political agenda "" and that "" more was involved here than mere coincidence "" .
Epstein 's ebook on his investigation of the scandal , Three Days in May , is published by Melville House on Monday .
On Sunday , Strauss - Kahn 's entourage said he had not given an interview to the Guardian and it was a "" montage "" from Epstein 's book . ""
This book written in indirect style does not contain any direct quotes from Strauss - Kahn , "" a source close to him told Agence France Presse .
In a statement , the newspaper said : "" The Guardian stands by its story about comments made by Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
The comments were made to investigative journalist Edward Jay Epstein during a two - hour interview with Mr Strauss - Kahn in Paris on 13 April .
All comments attributed to Mr Strauss - Kahn in the interview and accompanying news story were made to Mr Epstein on 13 April .
Naturally Mr Epstein included in his account of the interview background material from his book on the DSK affair , a short extract of which the Guardian published online .
We note that Mr Strauss - Kahn does not dispute the substance of any of the comments reported by the Guardian . ""
The timing of the Guardian 's publication was determined only by the 30 April publication date of Mr Epstein 's book . """
2012-05-01,"A New York judge says a hotel maid 's lawsuit claiming that former French presidential contender Dominique Strauss - Kahn sexually assaulted her can proceed to trial .
Bronx state supreme court justice Douglas McKeon ruled Tuesday in the civil case .
His decision was first reported by the New York Post .
The maid says Strauss - Kahn tried to rape her in his Manhattan hotel suite in May.
Strauss - Kahn has denied doing anything violent during the encounter .
Prosecutors dropped related criminal charges last year .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers argued he has diplomatic immunity because of his former post as head of the International Monetary Fund ; he resigned shortly after his arrest .
They also said the suit should be dismissed .
Lawyers for the maid , Nafissatou Diallo , say the immunity argument relies on a United Nations agreement the US did n't sign .
In a 12-page decision , first reported by the New York Post , McKeon wrote : "" Confronted with the well - stated law that his voluntary resignation from the IMF terminated any immunity which he enjoyed , Mr Strauss - Kahn threw [ legally speaking that is ] his own version of a ' Hail Mary ' pass . ""
His judgement means Diallo 's case can now proceed .
Strauss - Kahn may be forced to return to New york to answer the case .
"" We said all along this was a delay tactic , "" Diallo 's lawyer Douglas Wigdor told the Post .
"" We 're pleased with the judge 's decision and look forward to holding Strauss - Kahn accountable for the despicable act he committed . ""
There was no immediate comment from Strauss - Kahn 's legal team ."
2012-05-23,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn 's accuser in a sexual assault lawsuit has filed new claims that the alleged attack amounted to gender violence .
Strauss - Kahn was arrested in May 2011 after maid Nafissatou Diallo said he tried to rape her and forced her to perform oral sex in his Manhattan hotel suite .
The married Strauss - Kahn , 63 , has said what happened was consensual but represented a "" moral failing "" .
Manhattan prosecutors later dropped the criminal charges , saying they had developed concerns about Diallo 's credibility .
Strauss - Kahn lost his job as head of the International Monetary Fund and his bid to run for the French presidency .
Diallo , in a civil sexual assault case against Strauss - Kahn , is saying his alleged actions reflected a pattern of misogynistic behaviour .
New York City recently passed a law against gender - based violence and there have been other allegations made against Strauss - Kahn by women .
Diallo 's lawyers wrote in her latest claim : "" Strauss - Kahn 's conduct towards women generally is , and more specifically his sexual assault of Ms Diallo was , motivated by a gender - animus and a misogynistic attitude . ""
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers had no immediate comment .
Diallo , 33 , insists she told the truth about the encounter and is now pressing her claims in civil court .
So is Strauss - Kahn , who filed a $ 1 m defamation claim against her last week , saying she had sullied his reputation with a "" malicious and wanton false accusation "" .
Soon after his arrest in New York , the French writer Tristane Banon accused Strauss - Kahn of attempting to rape her during an interview in 2003 , a claim he called imaginary and slanderous .
Prosecutors said they believed the encounter qualified as a sexual assault but the legal timeframe to pursue her complaint had elapsed .
Then French authorities lodged preliminary charges of alleged aggravated pimping , claiming Strauss - Kahn was involved in a hotel prostitution ring including prominent figures and police in the northern city of Lille .
Lille prosecutors have said they are looking into an allegation that Strauss - Kahn might have been involved in a rape during a sex party in a Washington hotel in 2010 .
In response to the French investigation , Strauss - Kahn has acknowledged being involved in "" libertine "" activity but said he was unaware of anyone being paid for sex .
His lawyers have said he "" never committed violent acts nor had any relation whatsoever without the consent of his partners "" .
Diallo 's lawyers allude in Tuesday 's filing to all those allegations , as well as to an affair Strauss - Kahn had with an IMF subordinate .
The agency 's board concluded in 2008 that the relationship was consensual but that he had shown poor judgment ."
2012-05-29,"Christine Lagarde , the IMF boss who caused international outrage after she suggested in an interview with the Guardian on Friday that beleaguered Greeks might do well to pay their taxes , pays no taxes , it has emerged .
As an official of an international institution , her salary of $ 467,940 ( £ 298,675 ) a year plus $ 83,760 additional allowance a year is not subject to any taxes .
The former French finance minister took over as managing director of the IMF last year when she succeeded her disgraced compatriot Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who was forced to resign after he faced charges – later dropped – of sexually attacking a New York hotel maid .
Lagarde , 56 , receives a pay and benefits package worth more than American president Barack Obama earns from the United States government , and he pays taxes on it .
The same applies to nearly all United Nations employees – article 34 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961 , which has been signed by 187 states , declares : "" A diplomatic agent shall be exempt from all dues and taxes , personal or real , national , regional or municipal . ""
According to Lagarde 's contract she is also entitled to a pay rise on 1 July every year during her five - year contract .
Base salaries range from $ 46,000 to $ 80,521 .
Senior salaries range between $ 95,394 and $ 123,033 but these are topped up with adjustments for the cost of living in different countries .
A UN worker based in Geneva , for example , will see their base salary increased by 106 % , in Bonn by 50.6 % , Paris 62 % and Peshawar 38.6 % .
Even in Juba , the capital of South Sudan , one of the poorest areas of the world , a UN employee 's salary will be increased by 53.2 % .
Other benefits include rent subsidies , dependency allowances for spouses and children , education grants for school - age children and travel and shipping expenses , as well as subsidised medical insurance .
For many years critics have complained that IMF , World Bank , and United Nations employees are able to live large at international taxpayers ' expense .
During the 1944 economic conference at Bretton Woods , where the IMF was created , American and British politicians disagreed over salaries for the bureaucrats .
British delegates , including the economist John Maynard Keynes , considered the American proposals for salaries to be "" monstrous "" , but lost the argument .
Officials from the various organisations have long maintained that the high salaries are a way of attracting talent from the private sector .
In fact , most senior employees are recruited from government posts ."
2012-06-07,"A new book about Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former International Monetary Fund chief and one - time French presidential hopeful , claims that his moneyed lifestyle , sexual risk - taking and unabashed pursuit of women was so well known in Parisian political circles that some , including the current president Francois Hollande and former president Nicolas Sarkozy , never thought he could run for president .
Strauss - Kahn 's political career and presidential ambitions ended in May 2011 when he was arrested over the alleged attempted rape of a New York hotel worker , Nafissatou Diallo .
Criminal charges were dropped but Strauss - Kahn now faces a civil case in New York .
Currently under formal investigation for complicity in pimping in a separate French prostitution - ring scandal , Strauss - Kahn has said he had no doubt that he would have been the Socialists ' presidential candidate for the 2012 election race .
But a book by senior Le Monde journalists Raphaëlle Bacqué and Ariane Chemin , Les Strauss - Kahn , depicts a politician who during a political career spanning decades took risks in his private life , pursued women he met through work , sometimes bombarding them with messages , openly attended Paris swingers ' clubs while serving in government and was spotted by police in compromising situations .
"" You know very well that Dominique ca n't be president , "" Sarkozy allegedly told one advisor .
The right - wing president , who many years earlier had seen Strauss - Kahn send a deluge of messages to one of his press aides , had warned him about his behaviour around women before he began his post at the IMF in Washington .
But the writers said Sarkozy had also protected Strauss - Kahn , telling aides that security services ' notes on his behaviour should remain private .
The book revealed that it was Sarkozy 's eldest son , the 26-year - old rap producer Pierre Sarkozy , who woke him by telephone to inform him of Strauss - Kahn 's New York arrest having spotted the news on Twitter while surfing the net in the early hours .
Hollande , who long before Strauss - Kahn 's New York arrest , had launched his own battle against him to be the Socialist presidential candidate , is described in the book as knowing Strauss - Kahn 's "" weaknesses "" and deliberately distancing himself from him .
The book said the political journalist Valerie Trierweiler , now Hollande 's partner , had also , years ago , been on the receiving end of one of Strauss - Kahn 's comments to women .
Spotting her amid a group of journalists in parliament , the then MP had said : "" And how is the prettiest journalist in Paris ? ""
To which she replied dryly , "" I thought that was Anne Sinclair ""
— a reference to Strauss - Kahn 's famous journalist wife .
The authors said Hollande had felt that Strauss - Kahn 's moneyed lifestyle was too close to Sarkozy 's criticised "" bling bling "" image and that he was too cut - off from the realities of everyday French voters to be chosen as Socialist presidential candidate .
During the Socialist primary race , Hollande 's self - styled "" normal "" image was designed as much to distinguish himself from Strauss - Kahn as Sarkozy .
Strauss - Kahn , who has denied the New York allegations , is currently bailed and under formal investigation in France for alleged aggravated pimping in an organised group , relating to a prostitution ring centred around a luxury hotel in Lille .
He has acknowledged being involved in "" libertine "" activity , but denied pimping charges saying he was unaware that anyone was paid for sex .
The Lille case took a turn earlier this month when a prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation into allegations of rape .
The prosecutor 's office said it was looking into the allegation that Strauss - Kahn may have been involved in a rape during group - sex at a Washington hotel .
The French daily Liberation reported that two Belgian sex workers questioned in the Lille inquiry described Strauss - Kahn as using violence during sex at the Washington hotel .
The paper cited leaked transcripts of a witness testimony to Belgian police , with one sex - worker claiming that another man held her hands down while Strauss - Kahn assaulted her .
Strauss - Kahn denies any violence took place .
The women in question have not filed legal complaints , but French law allows for an investigation even without a formal complaint ."
2012-10-02,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , will not face a criminal investigation over the alleged group rape of a Belgian sex worker after French prosecutors dropped their preliminary inquiry .
Strauss - Kahn , once a Socialist French presidential hopeful , remains under formal investigation in France over alleged complicity in a pimping operation as part of an inquiry into a prostitution ring centred on the luxury Carlton hotel in Lille .
Police are examining whether sex workers were procured for orgies with Strauss - Kahn and flown across the world to him while he was head of the IMF .
During police interviews for the Carlton case , two Belgian sex workers had described group sex in December 2010 at a Washington hotel with Strauss - Kahn and others , while he was head of the IMF .
One detail in their testimony caught the attention of investigators .
The witness statements suggested a sex worker had said no to certain sex acts , but that her wrists were held down and the acts went ahead .
The sex worker in question , now 26 , had said in her witness statement to Belgian police : "" I did n't shout , but I clearly said in a raised voice that I did n't want to . ""
Although the woman did not file a legal complaint for rape , French officials opened their own preliminary inquiry to establish whether rape charges could be brought against Strauss - Kahn and other men present .
The French prosecution service said on Tuesday that after a preliminary inquiry , the issue would not be pursued .
The sex worker had written to judges saying that she had consented to the sex act and would not file a complaint .
Le Monde reported that in her letter , the sex worker had said that if her hands were held down , it was because it was a "" sex game "" and she had initially "" refused "" but had then "" accepted without force "" .
The Carlton hotel prostitution inquiry continues and Strauss - Kahn is still being formally investigated over pimping .
His lawyers have said he denies involvement in pimping , saying he did not know women at the orgies were sex workers and that he did not pay them .
He has denied any violence .
Strauss - Kahn is a political pariah in France since his arrest over the alleged attempted rape of a New York hotel worker in May 2011 .
Criminal charges against him were dropped by prosecutors , citing concerns about the credibility of the accuser .
But the hotel worker , Nafissatou Diallo , is currently pursuing a civil case against him in New York ."
2012-10-15,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn is out defending his virtue .
He says he is only guilty of lust and not of turpitude , that the international sex parties that were thrown in his honor ( quite apart from the accusations that he attacked a hotel maid in New York ) have a long tradition among men of a certain rank .
This raises two interesting questions : can a politician , even a French politician , actually try to explain and justify sexual desire ?
And how different is the sex that powerful people have from what
you and I have ?
The first has to do with public relations and reputation management : Strauss - Kahn is trying out a form of mea culpa that 's audacious , or barmy , in its violation of all the rules about how to talk publicly about sex – especially when you are asking to be forgiven for it .
The second opens a real - life window , a first - person account even , into the kind of secret societies and working conspiracies that many people have long believed exist at the highest reaches of power .
The Strauss - Kahn sex life , according to a report in the New York Times of an interview Strauss - Kahn gave to the French magazine Le Point , even involves Freemasons .
In essence , Strauss - Kahn is making an Eyes Wide Shut defense .
The 1999 Stanley Kubrick film attempted to link power and sex , high - class social rituals and eroticism .
This was eroticism as might exist in the minds of fashion - conscious social climbers : wealthy people going to elegant dinners and having sex with each other , in masks .
Strauss - Kahn 's version is very close to this ; says the New York Times about the DSK parties : "" The exclusive orgies called "" parties fines "" – lavish champagne affairs costing around $ 13,000 each – were organized as a roving international circuit from Paris to Washington by businessmen seeking to ingratiate themselves with Mr Strauss - Kahn . ""
In the description of one source cited by the Times : "" There was a rhythm to the gatherings , with everyone dressed for a sit - down dinner …
Then over time , couples separated , ' kisses were exchanged between one woman and another and between a husband and the wife of a friend ' until the guests ' all ended up nude . '
"" Strauss - Kahn 's defense falls back on the peculiarly French , noting his country 's history of "" libertinage "" .
But it is also something of a white paper about the culture of male desire – or , at least , that of powerful men .
He admits to the proud place that lust occupies in his life and outlines its extensive rituals and activities .
Rather innocently , he says that he "" long thought that I could lead my life as I wanted , and that includes free behavior between consenting adults .
There are numerous parties that exist like this in Paris , and you would be surprised to encounter certain people .
"" This is quite a breakthrough in contemporary political discourse .
Certainly , politicians in sex scandals in the US and UK and , I would have to believe , in virtually every other modern country ( save , perhaps , for Italy ) never , never admit to enjoying sex , or pursuing it for any reason other than helplessness .
Indeed , it seems like another strange wrinkle in the many odd wrinkles in the Strauss - Kahn story that he would think this would be a point of public sympathy : extreme roguishness .
It seems , too , to be another demonstration of his extraordinary arrogance – that he would think overt honesty would help him .
But perhaps truth is the point .
It is not just the truth about the kinks of desire , or of the fact that the more successful you become , the more opportunity you have to indulge your kinks .
But that the world of the paranoid does , in fact , exist .
That insiders cavort .
That , as the financial world teetered on the edge of the collapse , the former head of the IMF participated in "" secret soirees with lawyers , judges , police officials , journalists and musicians that start with a fine meal and end with naked guests and public sex with multiple partners "" , according to the New York Times account .
But then again , this may be as much Strauss Kahn 's erotic fantasy as it is other people 's paranoid fantasy . ""
Mr Strauss - Kahn and a few friends gathered in a private basement club , carpeted in purple and black tiger stripes , "" says the Times of an account of the parties given by a Belgian sex club owner who helped organize them .
Indeed , Strauss - Kahn "" energized by Viagra "" , a word for which the Times offers a hyperlink , apparently tried to hit on the sex club owner 's companion .
Strauss - Kahn sees himself , in other words , as a libertine .
Others might see him merely as a cheese ball , more Vegas than Paris .
There is , of course , Strauss - Kahn 's paranoia , too .
He sees himself as a victim of other secret forces , a view supported by the journalist Edward Jay Epstein 's account of how French security forces may have stalked Strauss - Kahn to a sex party in Washington and then on to his fateful encounter in the hotel room in New York .
Indeed , there is more than a small sense that Strauss - Kahn might be offering his tale of libertinage as both a way to neutralize this as a weapon in the hands of his enemies , and also as a warning to them that he yet knows more secrets than he is telling .
From the beginning of the Strauss - Kahn story , it has seemed that , through it , we might learn something more about the real personality and unvarnished desires of the powerful – even of their true evil .
But just as the story seems set , it turns : the testimony of the hotel maid in New York is discredited , other accusers undermined , accusations recanted .
We do n't know if it 's a tale for a pulp novelist – or one for Balzac .
Certainly , the New York Times , for one , seems to lack the language to talk about sexuality and power : "" Whether his downfall will have a lasting impact on the culture of sexual privilege and impunity for powerful men in France remains uncertain …
"" There is something the Strauss Kahn story wants to tell us .
But while tantalizing , the meaning is yet obscure ."
2012-12-10,"A hotel maid who claims she was brutally sexually assaulted by Dominique Strauss - Kahn has settled her civil action against the former IMF chief for an undisclosed sum , in a move that allows her to "" move on with her life "" , lawyers said .
In Bronx supreme court on Monday , a judge announced that an agreement had been reached just minutes before the session started , adding that the amount – which is rumoured to be as much as $ 6 m – remained "" confidential "" .
It brings to an end a lengthy New York court battle for the man once tipped to become French president , having earlier seen criminal charges of attempted rape dropped .
Nonetheless , Strauss - Kahn 's legal woes are not completely behind him –
he is yet to hear if prosecutors in France will be allowed to pursue charges of aggravated pimping related to an alleged prostitution ring in France .
A court is due to rule in that case on 19 December .
The lawsuit settled in New York on Monday relates to claims by Nafissatou Diallo , a 33-year - old former housekeeper at the upmarket Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
She says Strauss - Kahn attacked her on 14 May 2011 as she attempted to clean his room .
Diallo alleges that Strauss - Kahn ran at her naked , molested her and forced her to perform oral sex on him .
The claims led to a criminal investigation against the IMF boss last year , and to his house arrest in Manhattan .
But charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment were eventually dropped , with prosecutors citing "" substantial credibility issues "" with Diallo .
Despite the collapse of a criminal investigation , Diallo continued to pursue Strauss - Kahn through the civil courts , leading to a counter defamation suit by the former IMF head .
At first , Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers tried to claim that their client had diplomatic immunity him from being sued .
But that failed , with the courts dismissing his claims of protection .
A settlement in the case was widely expected ahead of Monday 's hearing .
Strauss - Kahn 's New York attorneys had previously acknowledged that talks had taken place .
But they dismissed as "" flatly false "" a French newspaper 's report that the amount agreed to was a payment of $ 6 m to Diallo .
In court on Monday , judge Douglas McKeon confirmed that a deal had been struck , but not the amount .
"" Ten minutes ago we reached a settlement in this case , which was put on the record , "" he said during a brief session .
He added : "" The amount of the settlement is confidential . ""
McKeon also confirmed that a claim against the New York Post – which had reported that Diallo had worked as a prostitute – had also been settled .
Again , the terms were not discussed in open court .
Diallo sat through the court proceedings accompanied by her legal representatives .
Dressed in a snow - leopard skin print headscarf and emerald blouse , she made no statement while in the courtroom .
But in brief comments on the steps of the Bronx supreme court , Diallo , who was born in Guinea and who is the mother to a teenage girl , thanked her supporters .
"" I just want to say I thank everyone that supported me all over the world .
I thank everybody ; I thank God , "" she said .
Her attorney , Kenneth Thompson , said Diallo was a "" strong and courageous woman who never lost faith in our system of justice "" .
"" With this resolution , she can now move on with her life , "" he added .
Strauss - Kahn was not in court .
Nor did his legal representatives offer any comment after it was announced that settlement had been struck , other than to thank the court .
Monday 's hearing marks an apparent end to Strauss - Kahn 's New York legal battles .
But it has come at cost for the 63-year - old .
As well as losing his job at the IMF , it ended any realistic chance Strauss - Kahn had at a run at the French presidency as further lurid details of his lifestyle later emerged .
In addition , it led to a raft of other sexual allegations being made against him and likely contributed to his separation from his wife , French journalist Anne Sinclair .
Next week , Strauss - Kahn will hear if a separate attempt to get charges levied against him by French prosecutors thrown out has been successful ."

2013-02-22,"Another day , another scandal related to Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
This time , Paris is seething with the expertly - orchestrated news that law philosopher Marcela Iacub has written a book on her seven - month fling with Dominique Strauss - Kahn . ""
Une liaison dangereuse "" , as Libération stated it today on its cover .
The book is called Belle et Bête ( Beauty and Beast ) and hits the bookstands on Wednesday .
Iacub has given one and unique interview in this week 's Nouvel Observateur .
She says that she will not comment any further .
A handful of reviewers invoked Kafka 's Metamorphosis as a comparison , as well as the style and prose of Michel Foucault , Michel Houellebecq and Catherine Millet .
They all insist that Iacub 's book is far from being yet another voyeuristic essay on the personal travails of a celebrity , but is a true objet d'art , literature in its most noble sense .
Iacub , a distinguished law philosopher and columnist for Libération and a researcher at France 's prestigious National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) , is known for her highly counter - intuitive and singular take on news and social matters .
An original and unpredictable voice , she is the author of essays on sexual freedom , maternity , filiation , and animals ( she seems to be particularly fond of pigs ; they grace the cover of four of her books ) .
This is perhaps why Iacub has , in her interview with Le Nouvel Obs , described DSK as "" half man , half pig "" . ""
DSK the man is vile , whereas DSK the pig is creative and marvellous , but like all pigs , he 's unyielding .
DSK is an artist of the sewers , a poet of filth and abjection . ""
She says that all the details of their liaison , the chronology , places , and dialogues are true but that she had to resort to fable as a genre in order to describe their sexual relationship .
"" If those scenes are factually inexact , they are however emotionally true .
You sometimes have to lie to tell the truth .
Truth is not reality . ""
According to Iacub , DSK owes his demise to his lack of empathy . ""
He is no rapist .
For that matter , he is not even a nasty man .
He is , however , selfish and insensitive .
His lack of interest towards other people makes him prone to make terrible mistakes of appreciation .
He 's undeniably a brilliant analytical mind , extremely quick intellectually , but has no intelligence of the heart . ""
While the head of the IMF struck Iacub as a rather very rightwing politician , the sybarite in him was a true revolutionary , copulating equally with the poor and the ugly , the beautiful and the powerful .
She said : "" a pig does n't know propriety , does n't try to please , he takes what 's on offer without thinking of consequences , he has no master , no vanity and could n't care less about hierarchy and social order .
The pig is man 's most beautiful facet "" .
In extracts published by Le Nouvel Obs , Iacub writes : "" You were old , you were fat , you were short and you were ugly .
You were macho , you were vulgar , you were insensitive and you were stingy .
You were selfish , you were brutal and you had no culture .
And I was mad about you "" .
And later on : ""
Even in the heat of passion , when I 'd have happily traded my future for just an hour in your arms , I never ceased to see you the way you truly were : a pig .
My compassion for those animals , too often vilified , triggered my interest in you .
You were persecuted , the perfect scapegoat .
I felt the urge to take up your defence . ""
Strauss - Kahn and his estranged wife Anne Sinclair may have threatened to sue Iacub for invasion of their privacy , but France has a long tradition of justifying all moral transgressions in the name of art , talent and intelligence .
Next episode on Wednesday ."
2013-02-26,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn has failed to have a kiss - and - tell book by an old mistress banned but won a court order insisting a card outlining his objections should be individually placed inside every copy of the book sold .
The French former chief of the International Monetary Fund , who was forced to resign after a sex scandal in New York , gained a partial victory following a court hearing just 24 hours before the sexually explicit book in which he is described as "" half man , half pig "" was to be released .
He also won € 50,000 ( £ 43,700 ) in damages from the author , his former lover Marcela Iacub , and from her publisher , as well as a further € 25,000 from the news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur , which was also ordered to devote half its front page to the court order as punishment .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers had asked for € 100,000 in damages from each party and a full front - page publication of the ruling .
Iacub 's book Belle et Bête , which can be translated as Beauty and Beast or Beautiful and Stupid , was written after the author 's seven - month affair with DSK , as he is known , between January and August last year after his political career had been destroyed .
Although Iacub did not name Strauss - Kahn in the book and has claimed some of its more graphic sex scenes were "" fiction "" , she told Le Nouvel Observateur that he was indeed the book 's protagonist .
The disgraced former minister , who was the Socialist Party 's presidential hope , was forced to resign as head of the IMF in 2011 after being arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid .
He denied the charges and was later cleared after doubts were raised over Guinean - born Nafissatou Diallo 's credibility when she was found to have misled officials in her immigration application .
However , DSK was forced to settle a civil case with Diallo , reported to be more than $ 1 m .
On Tuesday Strauss - Kahn turned up at the Palais de Justice in Paris to express his "" shock "" at what he described as a "" despicable and false "" book .
The 63-year - old said he was horrified by the "" dishonest "" way in which the intimacy of his private life had been attacked by someone who was "" out to make money "" .
"" Is anything allowed in the pursuit of gain ? "" he said , claiming the book was tantamount to "" shooting a man already down on the ground "" and had devastated his private life , his family and his children .
Strauss - Kahn 's lawyers read an email from Iacub to him claiming she had been manipulated by "" colleagues "" , and that she was suffering a guilty conscience because she had "" made believe I was in love with you , mad about you "" .
The court was told the message , which she asked DSK to delete , concluded : "" I 'm sorry .
"" Iacub 's lawyers told the court she could not remember the email and that she stood by her work , taking "" full responsibiliity "" for a book of "" love and passion "" .
She was "" manipulated by no one "" , her defence lawyer said .
In a letter to Le Nouvel Observateur DSK attacked the magazine for publishing extracts from the book saying it "" made him sick "" .
His estranged wife , heiress and broadcast journalist Anne Sinclair also wrote an open letter to the left - of - centre publication .
"" How could you stoop so low ?
You have given credit to the manoeuvres of a perverse and dishonest woman driven by her fascination for the sensational and the lure of money , "" she wrote .
Last week the magazine revealed Iacub visited Sinclair while writing the book .
"" It was n't a very loyal thing to do , but there were things I did n't understand about DSK 's psychology
… the conversation with Anne Sinclair was fundamental , "" Iacub said .
"" She was very kind , but I understood at what point that she was convinced that she and her husband – because I remind you that they have still not divorced – are part of a caste of masters of the world . ""
She said something , that I report in the book : ' There 's nothing wrong in getting a blow job from the cleaning woman . '
"" But for her , the world divides into masters and servants , between the dominant and the dominated , and it 's normal .
This terrified me a bit , as if we were still living in a society under the ancien régime . ""
As he left the Palais de Justice on Tuesday , Strauss - Kahn said : "" I just want one thing , to be left alone . ""
Strauss - Kahn is under investigation for his role in a vice ring in northern France involving a network of prostitutes in northern France , but has consistently denied any wrongdoing ."
2013-02-26,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has sought an injunction against a kiss - and - tell book by a former lover who described him as "" half man , half pig "" .
The disgraced politician , forced to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) after being arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid , said he was "" shocked by the despicable and false "" work .
Belle et Bête ( a title that can be translated as Beauty and Beast or Beautiful and Stupid ) was written by Marcela Iacub , who had a seven - month affair with Strauss - Kahn last year .
It is due to be published on Wednesday .
In a court hearing on Tuesday morning , Strauss - Kahn , 63 , often referred to as DSK , said he was "" horrified "" by the "" dishonest "" way in which his private life had been exposed by those with only "" commercial interests "" and claimed it was tantamount to "" shooting a man who is already on the ground "" .
He claimed Iacub , 48 , and her publisher Stock are guilty of an attack "" on the intimacy of a private life "" , and wants a card saying as much inserted in each copy of the book as well as a ban on further distribution and damages .
In her explicit book , the Argentinian - born Iacub does not name Strauss - Kahn , but has publicly stated the protagonist featured in it is the former politician .
The court heard that she admitted , in an email to her former lover , that it "" troubled "" her conscience that she "" had to make believe I was in love with you , mad about you "" .
"" I 'm sorry , "" she concluded .
Strauss - Kahn told the court : "" I am horrified by the means used to obtain this [ book ] … is anything allowed in order to make money ? ""
He said the book had caused "" devastation "" to his private life , his family life and the "" psychology of [ his ] children "" .
"" I 'm a very much out of my depth with this business , "" he admitted .
According to Jean Veil , his defence lawyer , DSK has suffered a "" true manipulation … and a real trap "" .
Books are rarely banned in France .
In 1996 a French court banned a book by the former doctor of the Socialist president François Mitterrand , detailing the French leader 's battle with cancer .
It was republished in 2005 after a ruling by the European court of human rights .
In her book , extracts of which were published in last Thursday 's edition of the left - of - centre news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur , Iacub recounts her relationship with Strauss - Kahn from January to August 2012 , describing him as "" half man , half pig "" .
In a letter to Jean Daniel , one of the founders of the weekly news magazine , DSK said he was "" disgusted "" and railed at the "" behaviour of a woman who seduces in order to write a book , and who boasts about her amorous feelings in order to exploit them financially "" .
He said it was an "" operation that makes one sick "" .
As well as the ban , he is seeking € 100,000 ( £ 86,000 ) in damages and costs from Iacub and her publisher , and the same amount from Le Nouvel Observateur , which he also wants ordered to publish a full front - page apology .
Strauss - Kahn 's estranged wife , the heiress and former television journalist Anne Sinclair , also wrote an open letter to Le Nouvel Observateur .
"" How could you stoop so low ?
You have given credit to the manoeuvres of a perverse and dishonest women driven by her fascination for the sensational and the lure of money , "" she wrote .
Iacub visited Sinclair while writing the book , but did not tell her of her plans for the book .

Strauss - Kahn was the Socialist party hopeful to become president when he was arrested in New York and accused of sexually assaulting a hotel cleaner , Nafissatou Diallo , in May 2011 .
He was later cleared of criminal charges after doubts were raised over the Guinean - born Diallo 's credibility after she was found to have misled officials in her immigration claim .
In December Strauss - Kahn was reported to have paid more than $ 1 m ( £ 650,000 ) to Diallo to settle a civil claim .
The former politician is under investigation for his role in the organisation of a vice ring involving a network of prostitutes in northern France .
He denies any wrongdoing .
The court is expected to make its decision on the book at 19.30 ( Central European Time ) on Tuesday ."

… love it !
Has a remake just come out ?
No , you 're thinking of Disney 's The Beauty and The Beast , based on the French fairytale La Belle et La Bête .
I 'm talking about Belle et Bête , or Beauty and Beast .
It 's rather different .
How different ?
Well , the Disney movie is about a sweet - natured girl who falls in love with an enchanted prince despite his disfigurement .
This is a memoir - cum - novel by lawyer and essayist Marcela Iacub , in which she denounces her former lover , the disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who owns no magic furniture or tableware .
I see .
So less romantic , basically .
Basically .
The book describes how last year Iacub had a seven - month affair with an unnamed public figure , whom she later identified as Strauss - Kahn .
The man is described as "" king of the pigs "" , "" an artist of the sewers , a poet of filth and abjection "" and is graphically described in several fictionalised sex scenes .
Some people would find that flattering .
Strauss - Kahn did n't .
He and his wife sued Iacub for invasion of privacy , along with Le Nouvel Observateur , a magazine that published extracts .
They demanded damages , a front - page apology and the suppression of the book .
And they kind of won .
Kind of ?
They got damages , a half - page apology , and a ruling that a card explaining their point of view must be inserted into every copy .
But the book has been published anyway ?
It has .
The magazine said it was art , you see .
Those French , eh ?
If they 're not careful they 'll get a reputation as a bunch of incorrigible shagger - intellectuals .
And it 's ironic , all this , because Iacub and Strauss - Kahn only met in the first place because she wrote several articles defending him against rape charges , which were later dropped .
Ironic , but as you say , not very romantic .
No .
Strauss - Kahn told journalists outside the court : "" I just want one thing ...
"" I thought that was the problem ! "" ... to be left alone . ""
Do say : "" If those scenes are factually inexact , they are , however , emotionally true .
You sometimes have to lie to tell the truth .

Do n't say : "" Tell that to the judge . """
2013-05-16,"The first images from a feature film inspired by the Dominique Strauss - Kahn scandal and directed by the American Abel Ferrara , have been released , two years after the former head of the IMF was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel worker .
The trailer for Welcome to New York is a frenzied and explicit rampage through the champagne , orgies and debauchery behind a French power figure at the highest levels of Washington before his arrest over attempted rape .
The Strauss - Kahn figure is played by Gérard Depardieu in what appears to be such a scathing performance it could help rehabilitate the actor 's own image in France , where he caused a storm this year by taking Russian nationality in a row over tax .
"" It is a [ Strauss - Kahn ] only Depardieu could play , "" said a commentator on the French state radio France Info .
Depardieu , who took no fee for the film and paid his own airfare to New York for the filming , last year told Swiss TV that Strauss - Kahn was "" very French , arrogant , smug –
I will do it because I do n't like him "" .
The millionaire French journalist Anne Sinclair , who divorced from Strauss - Kahn this spring , is played by Jacqueline Bisset .
A few minutes of the film will be shown in the industry section of the Cannes film festival as it looks for global distributors .
Ferrara , whose films , such as The Driller Killer , Bad Lieutenant , and King of New York , are notorious for dark and unflinching violence , nudity and drug use , was said by some to be the perfect director for a feature film inspired by the case .
Isabelle Adjani , a French actor whose name was at one point attached to the project , said of Ferrara : "" He 'll go where it hurts .
With him , there 's no risk of political correctness . ""
Strauss - Kahn , who was then the Socialist favourite to be next French president , was arrested in New York in May 2011 over the alleged sex attack on Nafissatou Diallo , an immigrant hotel worker .
Charges of attempted rape , sex abuse , forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment were eventually dropped , with New York prosecutors citing substantial credibility issues with the alleged victim .
Diallo 's lawyer , Kenneth Thompson , said the district attorney had "" denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case "" .
Her lawyers lodged a civil case to sue Strauss - Kahn over what they said was a violent and sadistic attack that left her life "" in shambles "" .
Last year Strauss - Kahn and Diallo reached an out - of - court settlement for an undisclosed sum .
Strauss - Kahn maintained that the sexual encounter was consensual , saying in a TV interview that he "" regretted his moral error "" .
He remains under formal investigation in France , in a Lille case , known as the Carlton affair , in which sex workers were allegedly procured for orgies he attended .
Police are examining whether sex workers were procured and flown across the world to him while he was head of the IMF .
If the case goes to court he risks trial over a charge of "" aggravated pimping in an organised gang "" .
Strauss - Kahn has denied knowing that any of the women were sex workers .
Vincent Maraval , the co - head of Wild Bunch , which is distributing the film Welcome to New York told Screen Daily in Cannes : "" There 's a dozen lawyers working on the project .
Every scene shot is validated by lawyers , even the improvised ones – everything is checked .
There is also an error and omission insurance so that everyone we sell the film to is insured against possible legal action . ""
The characters in the film are given fictional names .
He said the film was a "" Shakespearian "" look at a fall from grace , the running theme in all of Ferrara 's work .
Maraval added : "" He could n't care less about Dominique Strauss - Khan or French politics .
What he 's interested in is what it means to be publicly disgraced for an addiction , in this case a sexual one , and what the implications are for a couple who 've been living in denial .
When the issue is out in the open does it bring them together or tear them apart ? """
2013-07-26,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , is to go on trial on charges of pimping in connection with an alleged prostitution ring at a luxury hotel in the northern French city of Lille Magistrates in France decided on Fridayto press ahead with charging the former Socialist minister in spite of calls by the state prosecutor for the case to be dropped .
Strauss - Kahn , 64 , a former French presidential candidate , has admitted attending the "" libertine "" parties and having sex with a number of women .
However , he has always insisted he did not know that some of them were prostitutes .
The case , known as the Carlton affair after the luxury hotel where the orgies were said to have taken place , centres around allegations that businessmen and police officials in Lille operated a vice ring supplying women for sex parties .
This affair , which came to light in late 2011 , is the last of a series of inquiries into Strauss - Kahn since his arrest in New York in May 2011 where he was accused of trying to rape a hotel maid .
The charges in the US were eventually dropped because of doubts over maid
Nafissatou Diallo 's credibility after she was found to have lied on her immigration claim , but Strauss - Kahn was later forced to pay her substantial damages reported to be in the region of $ 6m(£3.9 m ) .
Two subsequent cases against the former French finance minister have also been dropped .
An allegation of sexual assault against writer Tristane Banon in Paris in 2003 did not result in criminal charges because it had passed the legal time limit .
In October last year , French prosecutors decided to drop an inquiry into allegations of gang rape at a hotel in Washington after one of the women involved who had made the claim retracted her evidence .
The state prosecutor had recommended that the Carlton affair charges against Strauss - Kahn be dropped on the grounds of a lack of evidence .
Magistrates decided otherwise ; they put aside a charge of "" aggravated pimping as part of an organised gang "" , but maintained the lesser charge of "" aggravated pimping as part of a group "" .
He is facing trial along with 12 other defendants .
In France pimping can cover a wide range of crimes including aiding or encouraging prostitution .
A trial is expected to take place next year .
If convicted , Strauss - Kahn could face up to 10 years in prison and a € 1.5 m ( £ 860,000 ) fine .
The former IMF chief has vehemently denied all allegations against him and described them as "" dangerous and malicious insinuations and extrapolations "" .
"" It will all come out publicly before the tribunal and everyone will realise that there is nothing in this case , "" Henri Leclerc , one of Strauss Kahn 's lawyers said on Friday .
Leclerc said the legal team was "" under no illusions "" about the "" relentlessness shown by the investigating magistrates "" and claimed Strauss - Kahn was being targeted because of his high profile . ""
This decision is based on an ideological and moral analysis , but certainly not on any legal grounds .
We 're sending someone to court for nothing , "" said the lawyer .
After an earlier hearing into the Carlton affair , Leclerc told the French radio station Europe 1 that Strauss - Kahn could not have known whether the women at the parties were prostitutes . ""
As you can imagine , at these kinds of parties you 're not always dressed , and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman , "" Leclerc said .
Strauss - Kahn had been a frontrunner as the Socialist party 's candidate to become French president in last year 's election before his arrest in New York .
He was forced to resign from his job as IMF chief and his third wife Anne Sinclair , a wealthy heiress and former television presenter , divorced him .
At the Cannes film festival in May , Strauss - Kahn was pictured with a new girlfriend , Moroccan - born Myriam L'Aouffir , 45 , who works in the internet and social media department at France Television ."
2013-09-11,"One of the longest - serving district attorneys in New York City history has lost his battle for re - election , beaten by a challenger in an acrimonious race tainted by allegations of cronyism , racism and selective prosecutions .
Charles Hynes , the long - term incumbent , lost the Democratic nomination for Brooklyn district attorney to Kenneth Thompson , a lawyer best known for representing the maid in the sexual assault scandal involving former IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Hynes , 78 , has the support of the Republican party but said he will not run as a GOP candidate .
The race for control of one of the largest district attorneys offices in the country was mired in vicious mud - slinging , amid accusations reported by the Guardian of sexual abuse cover - up in the borough 's ultra - Orthodix community .
Thompson , 47 , a former federal prosecutor , was able to draw on criticism over Hynes ' prosecution record – including his contentious handling of the sex abuse cases along with a forced review of more than 50 murder cases which relied on the problematic testimony of a retired NYPD detective – to portray his rival as out - of - touch .
Last week , flyers appeared in Brooklyn portraying Hynes as a chicken set to be killed before Yom Kippur ; competing ads in Jewish newspapers depicted Thompson as a snake .
Both candidates denied they had anything to do with either ad .
Hynes was a tough - on - crime figure throughout his two decade tenure , but critics accused him of being pressured by rabbis who did not want sex abuse cases handled by secular authorities .
He denies the allegations .
During the campaign , Hynes made several mis - steps in the media .
He was forced to apologise after being quoted in one Jewish newspaper comparing the Orthodox community to the mafia .
He told another Jewish newspaper that "" the black community , by and large , is mine . ""
Thompson , who is black , grew up in Brooklyn and became known for his work as an attorney on the Abner Louima case in 1997 as an assistant federal prosecutor .
He aimed his campaign at black voters , speaking out against the NYPD 's use of stop - and - frisk , in contrast to his rival .
Hynes , in turn , criticised Thompson for his lack of experience and for the outcome of the Strauss - Kahn case .
Prosecutors dropped the case over doubts over the credibility of the chamber maid , Nafissatou Diallo .
With 99 % of precincts reporting by Wednesday afternoon , Thompson had 55 % of the vote .
Hynes had previously secured the Republican party 's ballot line for the general election , but his campaign manager , George Arzt , said on Wednesday that he will not continue campaigning , according to the New York Times ."
2014-05-03,"To the French , the dramatic fall from grace of presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss - Kahn on charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid was "" the affair of the century "" .
They heard the story , read the book , followed the legal machinations , and now they can watch the film – due to be released straight to the internet .
Three years on , the sordid affair involving the ex - IMF chief is to resurface in a movie , Welcome to New York , starring Gérard Depardieu , released this month in the middle of the Cannes film festival .
The timing is deliberate .
The film failed to find funding in France after , producers say , the politician 's supporters closed ranks , and did not make it on to the official festival selections .
Now it will bypass cinemas and DVDS and be released to the public for € 7 via VOD ( video on demand ) .
Directed by American Abel Ferrara – best known for The Driller Killer , Ms. 45 , King of New York , Bad Lieutenant and The Funeral – the film focuses on the arrest of Strauss - Kahn in New York in May 2011 and his indictment for allegedly attacking a Guinean chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo .
After a long investigation , the charges were dropped amid questions about Diallo 's credibility and evidence which prosecutors said left reasonable doubt .
Although names have been changed in the film – DSK has become Monsieur Devereauxand Anne Sinclair , his heiress wife , played by Jacqueline Bisset , is called Simone –
the former politician 's lawyers are on standby to launch legal action .
The affair dashed Strauss - Kahn 's hopes of being the Socialist candidate in France 's 2012 presidential election – later won by François Hollande – and opened the floodgates to a series of legal cases .
An investigation , still ongoing , was launched into his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring and sex parties at hotels in Lille , Paris and Washington .
Depardieu , who is reportedly living as a French tax exile in Russia , has made no secret he does not like Strauss - Kahn , but said the film was not a biopic of the former politician .
"" It 's a story of power , solitude and decadence , "" he told journalists .
"" Even in his worst nightmares , Dominique Strauss - Kahn could not have imagined such a scenario , "" wrote Le Nouvel Observateur ."
2015-01-31,"On a damp day in the northern French city of Lille , where an early - morning flurry of snow has turned to drizzle , there is only one subject of conversation – and it is not the inclement weather .
The talk is of politics , power and pimping , and whether former presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss - Kahn was simply a man with an insatiable penchant for sex or – unlikely as it seems – a key figure in an “ international ” vice ring .
On Monday the former head of the International Monetary Fund will go on trial on a charge of proxénétisme aggravé , which translates as aggravated procuring for the purposes of prostitution .
The case is unprecedented in France , where strict privacy laws have until now largely prevented light being shone into the darker , sleazier corners of politicians’ personal lives .
It is also seen as a test of French voters’ broad - mindedness about their politicians’ sexual proclivities , and evidence of an austere new morality in a country that has long mocked “ Anglo - Saxon puritanism
” .
L’affaire du Carlton , named after a hotel at the centre of an alleged prostitution network , and its colourful cast of accused – including a police commissioner , the owner of a chain of brothels named Dodo la Saumure ( Dodo the Pimp ) , a barrister , two luxury hotel directors and several freemasons – make for a salacious tale .
The summary of allegations runs to 240 pages , but in short the prosecution claims Strauss - Kahn took part in , and may have even organised , parties held in Belgium , France and the US where female escorts were paid to have sex with guests , himself included .
While neither prostitution nor paying for sex are illegal in France and the French Sénat –
the upper house of parliament – rejected a government attempt to criminalise prostitutes’ clients last September , proxénétisme covers a wide range of crimes , including aiding , abetting , organising , encouraging or assisting in the prostitution of others .
This is the basis of the charge against Strauss - Kahn and his 13 co - accused , all of whom have denied the charges .
Strauss - Kahn , 65 , has admitted a penchant for “ libertine ” parties and having sex with a number of women .
He denies knowing that women were paid for their services and has described the charges as “ dangerous and malicious insinuations and extrapolations ” .
Supporters say Strauss - Kahn is the victim of what they describe as a new , feminist - led moral crusade and that , while his behaviour was ill - advised , it was not criminal .
Critics argue that the allegations are part of a pattern of abusive behaviour , and point out that Strauss - Kahn has been accused , though never convicted , of predatory sexual behaviour in France and the US on several occasions .
Even the local prosecutor , who advised dropping the case , argued that the evidence against Strauss - Kahn was flimsy .
The three judges – two of whom are women – ignored him and ordered a trial .
Few , if any , believe that Strauss - Kahn will be locked up , but over the next three weeks the man once widely expected to become French president will have his sexual proclivities paraded and examined in excruciatingly embarrassing detail .
“
Much time will be spent discussing whether this or that sex act is deviant or not , and what the girls involved in the case would or would not do if they were or were not prostitutes , ” said Didier Specq , retired court correspondent for the Voix du Nord local newspaper .
“
It ’s not a particularly important case in legal terms .
The involvement of DSK has given the case an importance out of all proportion to the accusations , and some of the accusations seem far - fetched to say the least .
This is about politics and media and about moral judgments .
”
After all , Specq added : “ Everyone knew DSK had a rampant sexual appetite .
”
Specq has written a book on the case called DSK chez les Ch’tis , ( Ch’tis being a nickname for those who live in France ’s most northerly region and featuring in the title of the recent hit film Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis ) .
“
It ’s true that French people have the impression they live in a very liberal society when it comes to sex .
This is the idea we have of ourselves , and it is n’t exactly correct , ” said Specq .
“
It ’s true the morals of the 1950s have long gone out of the window , but a new morality has come in by the back door .
”
Strauss - Kahn no longer has a political career to lose .
His presidential hopes came to an abrupt and definitive end in 2011 after he was removed from an Air France flight as it was about to leave New York and accused of forcing a Guinean - born chambermaid , Nafissatou Diallo , to perform oral sex at the city ’s Sofitel hotel .
While some in France still believe he was the victim of a honeytrap to prevent him running for president , the case stripped away some of the aura of impunity and untouchability surrounding Strauss - Kahn at home .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn were subsequently dismissed .
He later settled a civil lawsuit filed by his accuser .
The Hotel Carlton investigation had begun shortly before Strauss - Kahn ’s arrest in America and was initially a local affair .
Lille police had just set up a dedicated proxénétisme investigation team when they were tipped off that the hotel ’s head of public relations was bringing together “ well - connected men ” , and young girls who worked as prostitutes .
Arrests were made , searches and raids carried out , but the affair remained parochial until a number of women mentioned Strauss - Kahn ’s presence at swinger parties in Paris , Brussels and Washington , home of the IMF .
Christine Delphy , a feminist sociologist and writer , believes the Carlton trial shows attitudes are changing
but , she says , “ only marginally and very slowly ” .
“
I still hear people claiming the Sofitel incident was a conspiracy or blaming it on American puritanism and defending what DSK did with the ‘ private life’ argument , ” said Delphy .
“
This is France , a country where many white politicians asked how it was possible that a black , immigrant chambermaid dared to make a complaint against a powerful man , where Nafissatou Diallo was treated as a liar and a gold - digger .
A male commentator said what happened was simply a case of the master having his way with the servant .
“
The Carlton case may show there has been a small degree of change , but these macho attitudes have not changed much .
I ’d be astonished if there is a conviction .
”
Walking around Lille , Specq gives a guided tour of the trial hotspots , including the four - star Hotel Carlton in which , as it happens , Strauss - Kahn has never set foot , and the palais de justice into which he will step tomorrow , a concrete building whose very drab , grey austerity seems a stark reminder of a would - be president ’s fall from grace when the keys of the Elysée palace were within reach .
“
This story could have come straight out of Balzac , ” Specq said .
“
We can ask ourselves why a man who is so powerful has sexual relations so dangerous that could open him up to blackmail and pressure .
That ’s stupid , not criminal .
What is actually on trial here is Strauss - Kahn ’s morals .
”"
2015-02-02,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has gone on trial in Lille accused of pimping , in a case that threatens to expose the double life of the politician once tipped to be the next president of France .
Here ’s what we know about some of the other defendants .
René Kojfer
The 73-year - old sharp - suited former head of public relations at the Hotel Carlton in Lille was the first person to be investigated in the case .
He is accused of procuring women with the aid of his childhood friend , the self - proclaimed pimp Dominique Alderweireld , to supply sex workers to clients , businessmen and friends at the exclusive hotel in Lille .
Surveillance revealed that Kojfer would use the term “ dossiers ” when discussing finding prostitutes , and that he would often demand specifics such as a “ little Asian ” or something “ from an eastern country , like a Ukrainian ” .
He would also allegedly “ try out ” the women first himself , without paying , and recommend them to his contacts .
He denies all charges .
Dominique Alderweireld Alderweireld , also known as Dodo la saumure or “ Dodo the pimp ” , runs brothels just over the border in Belgium .
The 65-year - old is accused of sending sex workers from his establishments in Belgium to Paris and the US for DSK .
The portly , cigar - chewing owner of hostess bars said he had prepared for the case by getting his teeth whitened in Spain .
He has claimed that the women who work in his brothels are “ independent ” .
He once told Libération :
“
The girls are n’t there just for the money .
I do n’t put microphones in the bedrooms , but I know that some of them love it .
They have power over the men .
And they can watch television between clients .
”
His partner Beatrice Legrain , who also runs brothels , is also in the dock accused of supplying women to Strauss - Kahn .
She is alleged to have accompanied a sex worker to a soiree organised for Strauss - Kahn in Paris .
Both deny the charges .
Fabrice Paszkowski
A small businessman who was head of a medical supplies company in Lens , northern France , and active in the local Socialist party branch .
The 47-year - old is accused of attempting to curry favour with his mentor Strauss - Kahn by supplying sex workers for group sex , organising “ soirees ” , paying women and travelling with them to Paris and Washington to meet Strauss - Kahn , and taking part .
Text messages between Strauss - Kahn and “ Fab ” showed Strauss - Kahn referring to women .
In one text message , the then head of the IMF asked if Paszkowski wanted to accompany him to a “ magnificent ” swingers club in Madrid , suggesting he bring “ material
” – thought to mean women .
In 2010 , Strauss - Kahn texted Paszkowski before an arranged visit to Washington , asking : “
So , who will you have in your luggage ?
” Paszkowski replied : “ I have some very beautiful and new things for my trip to DC ! ! !
”
He denies the charges .
David Roquet
The 46-year - old is former head of a local franchise of a building company in northern France .
An acquaintance of Paszkowski , who allegedly had a similar interest in swingers parties and wanted to curry favour with Strauss - Kahn , he is accused of paying for sex workers and soirees for Strauss - Kahn and for putting though the costs – hotel rooms , restaurants , train and plane tickets – on his company expenses .
He denies the charges .
Jean - Christophe Lagarde
The 50-year - old senior Lille police chief was hoping for a top national post if Strauss - Kahn was elected president .
He met Paszkowski through his freemason network .
They soon realised they shared an interest in swinging and group sex .
Lagarde was a participant in soirees with Strauss - Kahn and numerous women , and is accused of putting Strauss - Kahn in contact with sex workers .
He denies knowing that the women at orgies were sex workers .
Some of the women told investigators that they were paid in front of him .
Lagarde travelled to Washington with women to meet Strauss - Kahn .
He denies all charges .
Emmanuel Riglaire The 46-year - old was once a high - profile lawyer at the Lille bar .
One woman witness in the case told investigators that when Riglaire represented her in a divorce and child - custody case , she could not afford to pay him and he suggested she pay with sexual favours .
The woman , who was sexually abused as a child and had had a difficult upbringing , said she was then introduced by Riglaire to Kojfer , who put her in contact with clients for prostitution .
The lawyer is also accused of introducing her to Roque , who took her to an orgy organised for Strauss - Kahn in Paris where she was paid to take part and , “ in tears ” , had a brutal sexual encounter with Strauss - Kahn .
He denies all charges ."
2015-02-02,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , will go on trial in Lille on Monday accused of pimping , in a case that threatens to expose the double life of the politician once tipped to be the next president of France .
The court is expected to hear how , while in Washington holding the most senior economic job in the world , Strauss - Kahn had group sex with prostitutes brought to him in Europe and the US , organised by French businessmen friends who wanted to curry favour with the man they thought would one day lead the country .
Details from court papers filed by the investigative magistrates and reported by several French papers referenced more than 15 “ soirées ” between 2009 and 2011 in which Strauss - Kahn was described as the instigator and “ king of the party ” , and where he allegedly had multiple encounters with numerous women in scenes described by some witnesses as “ carnage ” or “ slaughter ” .
The judges who referred the case to court argued that it was impossible for Strauss - Kahn to be unaware the woman were paid .
They said that the encounters were organised around his busy international schedule , that he was the instigator and principal beneficiary and that the type of sexual practices involved and the lack of use of condoms suggested the women participating could only have been paid .
The encounters , involving sex workers from France and Belgium , took place in Brussels , Paris and three in Washington and New York .
The prosecution claim that two entrepreneurs from northern France flew women to the US for orgies involving Strauss - Kahn while he was at the IMF , picking up the bill themselves .
Their last visit ended on 13 May , the day before Strauss - Kahn was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel maid , Nafissatou Diallo .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn in the Diallo case were dropped by prosecutors , and he later settled a civil action with her .
That case marked the end of his political career in France .
He currently acts as a consultant , including to the Serbian government and the Russian Regional Development Bank .
Strauss - Kahn has vehemently denied all charges of pimping , describing them as “ dangerous and malicious insinuations and extrapolations ” .
At the time of the alleged offences , the former finance minister was tipped to be the next Socialist presidential candidate and was part of a celebrity power couple with his now - ex wife , the journalist Anne Sinclair .
He has admitted he took part in group sex but denied knowing that women at the orgies were prostitutes .
“
I challenge you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and a naked woman of the world , ” his lawyer , Henri Leclerc , said in 2011 .
Some sex workers said they had been instructed not to mention they had been paid ; others said it was impossible for him not to know .
One sex worker , whose testimony to investigators was quoted in the Journal du Dimanche , said that as an “ escort ” it was rare to meet someone who displayed such a lack of respect as Strauss - Kahn .
The investigating magistrates said the case was not a moral crusade , arguing there were concrete indications that Strauss - Kahn was the “ central pivot ” of sexual encounters that favoured prostitution .
Prostitution involving people over 18 is not illegal in France but pimping and living off the benefits of it is against the law .
The charge of proxénétisme aggravé , which translates as aggravated procuring for the purposes of prostitution , covers a wide range of crimes , including aiding , abetting , organising , encouraging or assisting in the prostitution of others .
It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
All 13 people in the dock with Strauss - Kahn , including small businessmen and a senior police chief , have denied the charges .
The case will be heard by three judges but no jury .
The case , known as the Carlton Affair , began in 2011 as an investigation into an alleged prostitution network at the Hotel Carlton in Lille .
Strauss - Kahn was not involved in any alleged activity at that hotel , but his name was mentioned by sex workers in interviews with investigators and the inquiry was widened .
His high profile and the others in the dock with him have made the case one of the trials of the year .
Those who will be in court with the former IMF leader include Dominique Alderweireld , a portly , cigar - chewing owner of hostess bars in Belgium who goes by the name Dodo the Pimp and said he had prepared for the case by getting his teeth whitened in Spain ."
2015-02-02,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has appeared in court in Lille charged with aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women .
Dressed in a black suit , Strauss - Kahn sat , arms folded , in the front row of the courtroom , alongside 13 others , 12 of whom also face pimping charges , including a former senior police chief and two businessmen alleged to have provided the one - time presidential hopeful with prostitutes for orgies in Europe and the US .
Strauss - Kahn stood , hands clasped , to hear the charge against him –
“ aggravated pimping ” , described as aiding and abetting prostitution , punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
The case threatens to expose the double - life of Strauss - Kahn , once tipped to be the next Socialist president of France , but now a political pariah .
The case against him is that , while head of the IMF in Washington , he had group - sex with prostitutes brought to him in Europe and the US , organised by French businessmen friends who wanted to curry favour with him .
The inquiry by two investigative judges who brought the case to trial had heard from several prostitutes and referenced over 15 “ soirées ” between 2009 and 2011 in which Strauss - Kahn was described as the instigator and “ king of the party ” , and where he allegedly had multiple encounters with numerous women in scenes described by some witnesses as brutal “ carnage ” or “ slaughter ” .
The investigative judges’ court petition argued that , because of the type of events and sexual practises , Strauss - Kahn could not have been unaware that the women were paid .
Strauss - Kahn has admitted he took part in group sex but has denied knowing that women at the orgies were prostitutes .
He has strongly denied pimping charges .
Henri Leclerc , Strauss - Kahn ’s lawyer , told the court his client was “ calm and confident ” , keen for the trial to take place , that “ justice be done ” and for him to be acquitted .
The case , which is known as the Hotel Carlton affair began in 2011 when police investigated the head of public relations at the hotel in the northern French city of Lille , who was believed to have procured prostitutes for friends and clients .
During the investigation into a possible prostitution ring at the Hotel Carlton , prostitutes began mentioning the name Strauss - Kahn at other soirées outside Lille and the inquiry was widened to the procuring of women for the IMF chief .
Those in the dock included two businessmen and a senior police - chief accused of organising orgies of prostitutes for Strauss - Kahn , travelling to Paris and Washington with them and taking part .
Also facing charges of supplying women to Strauss - Kahn is a man known as Dodo the Pimp , owner of brothels in Belgium .
During a pause in the proceedings , Strauss - Kahn chatted to Fabrice Paszkowski , a businessman friend who is alleged to have procured prostitutes , paid them and travelled with them to engage in orgies with the ex - IMF chief .
A lawyer for four prostitutes who testified to the inquiry asked the judges to hold the hearings in private , closed to the public , arguing that the women had found giving evidence traumatic .
The judges rejected the demand , meaning all of the three - week trial will be open to journalists .
Strauss - Kahn is to testify next week .
The trial comes four years after Strauss - Kahn was arrested in New York in 2011 over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel worker , Nafissatou Diallo .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn in the Diallo case were dropped by prosecutors , and he later settled a civil action with the woman ."
2015-02-04,"The Hotel Carlton pimping trial in Lille has heard of the power exerted by older men and business figures over destitute women in the northern French city , some of whom had been abused as children , and who found themselves passed around men in hotel rooms , apartments and as the “ dessert course ” at business lunches .
The trial is best known for one of its defendants , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , ex - head of the International Monetary Fund , who is accused of aiding and abetting prostitution by having group sex with paid women brought to him in Europe and the US by businessmen friends .
He strongly denies the pimping charge , admitting group sex but saying he did not know women at the orgies were prostitutes .
Before the trial turns its attention to Strauss - Kahn next week , judges have begun hearing the stories of prostitutes in Lille .
One of the women , known as Jade , was a prostitute as part of the Hotel Carlton network in Lille before later being taken by businessmen .
She says she was offered to Strauss - Kahn for orgies in Paris and Washington when he was head of the IMF
– encounters she described as “ carnage
” .
Described as having been the victim of child sexual abuse and having had a chaotic childhood , she told the court how she reluctantly turned to prostitution when she separated from her partner .
“
I opened the fridge , I knew there was going to be an inquiry into custody of the kids
and I saw that the fridge was empty .
”
She dialled the number on a small ad .
Her first encounter was a lorry driver .
“ I was scared to death .
”
She began to work in a brothel just over the Belgian border run by Dominique Alderweireld , also known as Dodo the Pimp , another defendant in the trial .
She worked at night in a basement room in the brothel with her baby asleep in a nearby room .
When she could , she would stop and get temping work .
At the club she met Rene Kojfer , 70 , the flamboyant head of public relations for the luxury Hotel Carlton .
He is alleged to have passed financially needy women around prominent men – including a dentist , police chief , lawyers and hotel bosses – in Lille for sex .
Referring to women as “ dossiers ” , he is said to have boasted of being able to “ try them out ” for free himself .
With Kojfer , Jade and two other women would be taken to a flat adjoining the hotel where they met men .
“
There were sandwiches , a bottle of champagne .
They had lunch .
We were their dessert .
”
The men would choose a woman each for sex , usually paid € 200 .
Once Kojfer said “ times are hard ” and paid only € 120 or “ a hotel bathrobe ” .
In tears , Jade described another business lunch at an Italian restaurant near Lille with various men , where Kojfer had brought women .
“
A young girl of 19 or 20 was drinking glass after glass .
I told her to stop .
She said : ‘ Leave it , it helps me forget.’ The young girl went to the toilet and she did n’t come back .
Everyone was going to the toilets
so I went to look .
”
She described seeing the girl slumped on the ground , passed out , her underwear and trousers around her ankles .
“
The waiter arrived with a box of condoms .
I do n’t know how many men had her .
I could n’t help her .
”
Strauss - Kahn was not present at any of these scenes in Lille .
It is suggested that Jade would later be taken by two different businessmen to “ soirées ” outside Lille with the IMF head .
After evidence in court , Jade spoke to La Voix du Nord .
“
You have to be damaged , in terms of body and self - esteem , to get to that point of abandoning your body and profiting from it .
It ’s not easy money .
It ’s quick money but it ’s not easy money .
The scars , the marks , the cigarette burns , the smells , the comments of clients , all that comes back .
”
She said she was angry with two different Lille businessmen for later taking her to meet Strauss - Kahn .
“
Me , I did n’t know who he was .
They did n’t warn me .
I ’m angry that they did n’t give me the choice to choose .
Very sincerely I would n’t have taken the risk to go with that man if I ’d known of the media earthquake .
”
She complained in court of having seen her real name appear in the media and wore a wig so the court artist ’s images would n’t identify her .
The court heard more about Kojfer ’s alleged procuring of women .
Once , aged 70 , he had met an 18-year - old in the street in Lille and groomed and had sex with her .
Surveillance showed him telling a contact on the phone .
“
It ’s a school girl , 18 .
A bombshell .
I ca n’t give you the “ dossier
”
[ code for girl ] straight away
but I ’ll put it aside .
”
He had introduced a 20-year - old victim of domestic violence into prostitution , telling the court he was “ helping
” her .
He was well connected to the local police .
One woman , who he had introduced to friends for paid sex , refused a sex act with him for free , so he called his friends in the vice squad on her .
All 14 people accused of pimping , and some of fraud , deny the charges ."
2015-02-10,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , denied committing any crime as he took the stand in a trial in the northern French city of Lille , charged with aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women .
He reaffirmed his long - standing defence that he was unaware that women who participated in orgies at hotels in Paris and Washington DC were sex workers , and said the frequency of those events had been wildly exaggerated .
“
When you read the criminal complaint you get the impression it was this frenetic activity , ” Strauss - Kahn said .
“
But it was four times a year , not more than that .
It was n’t this out - of - control activity .
”
Topless activists from the Femen protest group climbed on to the roof of Strauss - Kahn ’s car as the 65-year - old arrived at the courthouse , one of them with “ pimps , clients , guilty ” scrawled across her chest , before police pulled them away .
Strauss - Kahn , once tipped to be the next Socialist president of France , is answering a charge of “ aggravated pimping ” – aiding and abetting prostitution – which carries a possible 10-year prison term .
The case against him is that , while holding the most senior economic job in the world in Washington , he had group sex with sex workers specifically brought to him in Europe and the US , organised by French businessmen friends at his instigation .
The court is considering more than 15 “ soirees ” between 2009 and 2011 in which Strauss - Kahn was described by investigating judges as the central pivot , and “ king of the party ” .
Some of the women brought to these events for Strauss - Kahn described scenes of “ carnage ” or “ slaughter ” .
The investigative judges’ court petition argued that , because of the type of events and sexual practices , Strauss - Kahn could not have been unaware that the women were paid .
Strauss - Kahn has admitted he took part in group sex but has always denied knowing that women at the orgies were prostitutes .
He has strongly denied pimping charges .
Strauss - Kahn is likely to be questioned on Tuesday about the nature of the events , the identities of the women present , and the locations of the soirees – some took place in a flat he had rented in Paris .
A key issue in the trial is whether or not he knowingly made the flat available for prostitution .
Prostitution involving those over the age of 18 is not illegal in France but pimping , facilitating prostitution or living off the benefits of it is .
Two entrepreneurs from northern France who flew women to the US for orgies involving Strauss - Kahn while he was at the IMF have said they picked up the bill themselves , paying the women directly .
Their last visit ended on 13 May , the day before Strauss - Kahn was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel worker , Nafissatou Diallo .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn in the Diallo case were dropped by prosecutors , and he later settled a civil action with her .
That case marked the end of Strauss - Kahn ’s political career in France , where he is now seen as a political pariah .
He currently acts as a consultant , including to the Serb government and the Russian Regional Development Bank .
The trial in Lille is the culmination of a high - profile inquiry known as the Carlton affair .
It began in 2011 as an investigation into an alleged prostitution network at Lille ’s Hotel Carlton .
Strauss - Kahn was not involved in any alleged activity at that hotel , but his name was mentioned by sex workers in interviews with investigators and the inquiry was widened .
Thirteen other defendants are accused of pimping , and some of fraud .
After opening last week , the trial has heard of the power exerted by older men and business figures over destitute women in the northern French city , some of whom had been abused as children , and who found themselves passed around to men in hotel rooms , apartments and as the “ dessert course ” at business lunches .

2015-02-11,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has been confronted in court by a second woman who said he subjected her to a sex act against her will .
Strauss - Kahn is on trial in Lille on a charge of “ aggravated pimping ” – aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women – which carries a possible 10-year prison term .
The case against him is that , while holding the most senior economic job in the world in Washington , he had group sex with prostitutes brought to him in Europe and the US , organised by French businessmen friends at his instigation .
He strongly denies knowing the women were prostitutes and maintains he thought they were swingers like himself .
He denies all pimping charges .
The court heard from Jade , a sex worker allegedly paid by business friends of Strauss - Kahn to attend group sex evenings .
Jade described how she had been booked to have sex with Strauss - Kahn at an orgy with him at a swingers’ club , The Tantra , in the Belgian countryside in autumn 2009 .
She told the court that on arrival at the club she saw a scene she described as “ butchery
” , with about 40 people “ all on a mattress on the floor
” .
She had been paid € 500 upfront by two businessman friends of Strauss - Kahn
but she said she did not want to take part in the group she saw having sex ,
so she had stayed at the bar .
Afterwards , a friend of Strauss - Kahn suggested Jade should give him and one of his girlfriends a lift back into Brussels – where Strauss - Kahn was staying for meetings – in her car .
Jade said that in the car she had chatted to Strauss - Kahn and his girlfriend , explaining to them that she worked under contract at a swingers’ bar where she was a stripper and that after her act she had sex on stage with a member of the audience whom she was allowed to choose herself .
She told the court that Strauss - Kahn said he would like to come to watch the act one day .
Jade said that because she had been paid by a businessman to have sexual relations with Strauss - Kahn , she felt obliged to honour her part of the deal and upon arrival in Brussels , went up to his hotel room with him and his girlfriend .
She broke down in tears in court as the judge asked her to detail what happened in the room .
“
When I turned my back to Dominique Strauss - Kahn
I was subjected to a penetration that I had n’t been asked if I accepted , ” she said .
“
To which I would have said no , because I did n’t want that .
”
She added : “ Every time I see his photo or meet him I relive that time , a time that ripped me apart inside because no other client would have dared to do that .
” Jade asked : “ Does this person think they can do anything … because I did n’t have the same status as him ?
”
She said she was in pain and
that “
I did n’t have time to say no .
”
Asked if she thought Strauss - Kahn had been aware she was a prostitute , she said : “ To inflict what he inflicted , he could n’t have had much respect for me .
I must have been an object for his consumption .
”
Jade said she did not want the sex act to be named in court , but Strauss - Kahn ’s barrister named it as “ sodomy ” .
Strauss - Kahn told the court he did not view his sexual encounter with Jade in the same way that she did .
“
I did n’t realise , ” he said .
“ I ’m not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners .
”
He said : “ I had no way of knowing she did n’t want it
…
It was n’t my intention , I ’m sorry it happened like that .
”
He was questioned by the judge who made reference to another woman , Mounia , who the previous day alleged that she was in tears and gesturing that she did n’t want to have anal sex with Strauss - Kahn but that when he realised her distress he smiled and went ahead anyway , “ with force ” .
Strauss - Kahn , who insisted on Tuesday that “
when someone says no , it is no ” , told the judge that he had regrettably discovered during this case
that he had “ a sexuality that was more rough than the average man
” .
He added : “ That in no way implies for me that there is any link with prostitution .
”
He said he behaved the same sexually with all women , whether it was an unwitting encounter with a prostitute or not .
He said the idea that his specific sexual preferences meant he needed recourse to prostitutes was “ completely absurd ” .
Questioned by one lawyer on his sexual behaviour , he shouted : “ I ’ve had enough ! ”
He said : “ My sexual practices , whether you appreciate them or not , do not concern this court .
”
He said he was not in court on any charge of perverted sexual practices .
In court , Jade insisted that Strauss - Kahn knew she was a prostitute , particularly after their conversation in her car when she talked about her paid job stripping and having sex in a club .
She said Strauss - Kahn was simply trying to convince the court he was naive by not knowing women presented to him were paid .
Strauss - Kahn told the court he did not know Jade was a prostitute and that being an erotic dancer did not mean someone was a prostitute .
Strauss - Kahn was asked by one lawyer about women who said in court papers that they had “ suffered ” during sexual encounters with him .
He replied that there were also many others quoted in the dossier who said he was “ courteous ” .
He added : “ People see things differently .
”
He said he could not tell if women were faking pleasure or not .
He told the court : “ Prostitution is an attack on human dignity .
I do n’t like prostitution .
” Jade told how some months after the episode in the Brussels hotel room , she was approached by the same businessman friends of Strauss - Kahn to travel to Washington to meet the IMF chief for sex .
She was offered € 2,000 .
She said she needed the money as she had a € 1,800 legal bill to pay .
Asked by the judge how she felt about returning to see Strauss - Kahn after the earlier exchange , she said : “ I had reservations , but I saw it in euros .
I said to myself I would have the strength to say I would n’t want certain things to happen again .
”
She said that in Washington , Strauss - Kahn and a girlfriend joined her in her hotel room for sex but that after “ the preliminaries ” it had turned into a “ fiasco ” when Strauss - Kahn had suggested another woman join them and that woman had not wanted to .
Jade said the atmosphere had soured and sex had not taken place .
While in Washington , Jade posed for a photograph with Strauss - Kahn in his IMF office .
His lawyer told the court that Strauss - Kahn did not know Jade was a prostitute and he would never have posed for that picture if he had known that she was .
The trial continues ."
2015-02-12,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has told a court how he rented a luxury flat in Paris under an acquaintance ’s name because he was married and wanted somewhere discreet to meet women for group sex .
Strauss - Kahn is on trial for alleged “ aggravated pimping ” – aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women – and could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted .
While leading the IMF in Washington , he allegedly had group sex with prostitutes specifically brought to him in Europe and the US , organised by French businessmen friends at his instigation .
He strongly denies knowing the women were prostitutes and maintains he thought they were just “ swingers ” , like himself .
He denies all pimping charges .
The judges in Lille focused on the apartment in a smart area of Paris because if Strauss - Kahn had made a private flat available for prostitution , this would fall under the crime of aiding and abetting prostitution .
Strauss - Kahn said private “
swingers’ evenings ” took place at the flat and that he was always present and participating , but insisted he was not the organiser of those evenings .
He has denied knowing , or suspecting , that there were any prostitutes or paid women at those events .
People who were at the events told the court they had not sensed the presence of any prostitutes .
Asked by a judge why the flat was rented under an opaque setup , Strauss - Kahn said : “ I was a politician , I was married .
I needed a discreet place to meet politicians , and to meet young women I wanted to meet .
”
The judge questioned Strauss - Kahn over a large number of text messages exchanged between 2009 and 2011 with his businessman friend , Fabrice Paszkowski , who is accused of recruiting paid women for group sex with him .
In one message in 2009 , Strauss - Kahn asked Paszkowksi if he wanted to accompany him to a “ magnificent ” swingers club in Madrid and bring “ material
” – meaning women .
Strauss - Kahn had told the investigation that the term “ material ” was unfortunate and ill - chosen , but that in other text messages he had referred to women by name and that there was no mention of prostitutes .
Paszkowski denies the charges and has told the court Strauss - Kahn did not know any women he introduced him to were paid .
Earlier this week , the court heard two women break down in tears describing how they were subjected to a sex act by Strauss - Kahn that they had not wanted or agreed to .
One said the ex - IMF chief had known of her distress but had smiled and gone ahead “ with force ” .
Strauss - Kahn told the court he had not been aware of the women ’s “ refusal ” and was sorry they viewed the events that way .
“
I ’m not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners , ” he said .
The trial continues ."
2015-02-13,"It is a saga of money , fame and destitute women ferried to luxury locations for sex with powerful men , against a backdrop of economic deprivation and social misery .
France has been shaken this week by harrowing testimony from a trial in Lille that not only put in the dock Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former International Monetary Fund chief and one - time French presidential hopeful , but also examined a much wider , depressing picture of poverty , women submitted to sex acts against their will and alleged pimps who referred to them as “ livestock ” .
In court , Strauss - Kahn , 65 , the one - time hero of the French left , flatly denied the accusation he aided and abetted the prostitution of seven women – a charge of “ aggravated pimping ” that carries a 10-year prison sentence .
He said he never knew or suspected there were any prostitutes among the many women brought to him by regional French businessmen friends for group sex , at what he termed “ festive afternoons ” in Europe and the US while he was head of the IMF .
But after three days of distressing testimony at a court in Lille – during which two prostitutes said Strauss - Kahn had subjected them to a sex act they did not want , and he self - assuredly explained his appetite for group sex and how his sexual style was “ rougher than the average man
” –
France began considering the wider implications of the vast trial known as the “ Carlton Affair ” , after the luxury hotel in Lille in which Strauss - Kahn has never set foot , but which was at the centre of the first investigation .
The grim stories of what the newspaper Libération called “ the terrible daily reality ” of prostitutes that emerged in the broader Lille trial have shocked France and could push the socialist government , which claims it wants to “ abolish ” prostitution , to resurrect its plans to criminalise paying for sex – a law that got through parliament but has stalled in the senate .
The court is trying 13 men accused of pimping , including Strauss - Kahn .
Most of the accused have no connection to the former IMF director .
But two businessmen and a senior Lille police chief are accused of recruiting and paying prostitutes for “ soirées ” with Strauss - Kahn in order to curry favour with him .
They deny the charges and say Strauss - Kahn never knew the women were paid because they kept it secret .
The testimony of the prostitutes , some of whom were sexually abused as children , has highlighted France ’s social and economic problems .
Destitute and jobless in the area around the northern city of Lille which has been hit by some of France ’s worst unemployment , some of the women went to work just over the Belgian border where brothels are tolerated by law .
Jade , who would later be recruited by businessmen to meet Strauss - Kahn in Belgium , Paris and the US , described how she worked at the Belgian “ Club Madame ” for Dominique Alderweireld , who refers to himself as Dodo the Pimp and is among the accused on trial .
She said 12 - 13 women slept in bunk beds in a kitchen and had to be available at all times .
She preferred a sleeping bag in the cellar , but slept dressed in her work outfit because if the front door rang in the night , they would all have to rush upstairs to be exhibited like “ meat on hooks ” .
She described working day and night , once while “ vomiting blood ” .
Surveillance showed Dodo the Pimp referring to the prostitutes as “ livestock ” .
In her cellar , Jade said she did n’t have a television so she did n’t recognise Strauss - Kahn when she was first taken to him , only seeing him in the press later and exclaiming : “ That ’s him with clothes on .
”
She spoke English , which came in handy at US immigration on a trip to see Strauss - Kahn in Washington , when border staff found it odd that the businessmen and Jade had come all that way for only a couple of nights .
Another detail in court was the seeming power trip of the businessmen who delivered women to Strauss - Kahn .
“
Ah , is n’t power great ?
”
one businessman allegedly said during one “ soirée ” where Strauss - Kahn was present .
Another , Fabrice Paszkowski – a Lille entrepreneur who Strauss - Kahn described as a very good friend – told one woman that he wanted to organise “ giant orgies at the Elysée ” , presumably when Strauss - Kahn became president of France .
One woman told the inquiry she felt women present at one group sex event were used as mere “ receptacles ” .
Another woman participant , asked about others suffering during the group sex , told the inquiry : “ It did n’t happen to me , but I did n’t need to do it to put food on the table .
”
An angry Strauss - Kahn , who said he never organised the events himself but was a guest , rebutted some women ’s description of the “ soirées ” as “ slaughter ” , “ killing ” and “ butchery
” .
He said other women present had described him as courteous .
He said the only time he spoke to an “ unabashed swinger ” about money was when he asked her if she wanted to come to Paris to see him and he would pay her expenses .
He said the suggestion that he had to be brought “ fresh meat ” by businessmen friends was a disgrace .
He insisted he never had sex with prostitutes because “ I prefer a party atmosphere before , during and after ” .
He told one sexual partner :
“
I have a horror of whores .
”
Asked by the judge if it was not odd that he would have sex with strangers – such as one woman who was in fact a prostitute , with whom he had sex minutes after meeting her in the basement of a French restaurant
– he said sex with strangers was “ the whole point
” of his “ swinging lifestyle
” .
Accused by Jade and another prostitutes of using force to subject them to a sex act they did not want , Strauss - Kahn said he had not noticed any refusal , and believed that “ no means no ” .
Strauss - Kahn ’s lawyers appear confident that he will be acquitted on the pimping charge .
The judges are likely to spend many weeks deliberating .
Even if observers feel there is little evidence to convict Strauss - Kahn of pimping , his public image has suffered .
He has been a political pariah since his arrest in New York four years ago over the alleged attempted rape of the hotel maid , Nafissatou Diallo , over which he settled a civil case after prosecutors dropped criminal charges .
An online poll for the rightwing paper
Le Figaro this week asked : “ Do you believe Strauss - Kahn when he says he did n’t know the women he met were prostitutes ?
”
About 11 % said yes , 88 % said no ."
2015-02-14,"With the sexual interests of Dominique Strauss - Kahn once again to the fore , as he defends himself in a French court against charges of pimping , one would have expected , by now , a ticking - off for the press by his old friend , the button - phobic philosopher , Bernard - Henri Lévy .
When Strauss - Kahn , then head of the IMF , was first accused of sexual assaults in 2011 , first by a hotel chambermaid , then by a young French woman , Lévy was swift with a counter - portrait .
“ Charming , seductive , yes , certainly ; a friend to women and , first of all , to his own woman , naturally , ” Lévy argued .
“
But this brutal and violent individual , this wild animal , this primate , obviously no
, it ’s absurd .
”
Politically , he said , the loss of this “ devoted and competent
” public servant would be a loss for the French left , also the entire world .
True , had it not been for the accusation of assault , Strauss - Kahn might well , now , be French president , although still , presumably , appearing in court on the later pimping charges .
Bret Easton Ellis also sympathised , tweeting : “ The unfolding case of Dominique Strauss - Kahn just reinforces my theory that men are no picnic but women are fucking CRAZY .
”
A year later , after Strauss - Kahn had been charged with involvement in a prostitution ring and police had investigated ( then set aside ) allegations of assault by a Belgian prostitute , the end of the Strauss - Kahn marriage made headlines and Lévy returned to the attack , with a defence of DSK ’s privacy .
“
Since keeping company with prostitutes is not yet a criminal offence in France , ” Lévy said , “ no one can adequately say what is really involved in the incrimination we have been unwillingly compelled to witness .
”
And what feminist “ worthy of the name ” , he asked , would applaud “ as a victory the fact that a prostitute goes to the police to denounce the sexual harassment to which she has been subject ” ?
As we await a third reprimand , we can only imagine the indignation that must afflict Mr Lévy as he sees his friend , who has now said he likes “ rougher than average ” sex , being accused by a series of prostitutes of forcing them into painful , non - consensual acts that , had this pimping case not come about , they might never have reported .
What feminist , “ worthy of the name ” , would applaud as a victory this evidence that Lille ’s prostituted women actually felt they had a right to agency in these encounters , despite having sold themselves for as much , maybe , as € 120 ( as opposed to an agreed € 200 , any complaints to Lille ’s chief of police , among the accused ) ?
To be fair to Mr Lévy , it is a tribute to the efforts of the pro - legalisation lobby that his difficulty in believing that prostitutes might not be a ) happy in their work , or b ) a matter of concern to feminists or c )
themselves feminist , is widely shared .
One of the recent “ safe space ” rows was attributed to a students’ union having coming out in favour of “ sex work ” , to the point that they preferred not to hear any arguments against this excellent career choice .
And much reporting of the Lille case has featured Lévy - style incredulity over delicacy among prostitutes , two of whom complained of being treated as , to use their word , an “ object ” by DSK .
He , on the other hand , favoured the term “ equipment ” for women ( whom he maintains , he did not know were prostitutes ) .
One of them , “ Jade ” , who said she sold herself to feed her children , became the subject of a droll report in an Irish paper .
Its correspondent was tickled by the idea of one of the “ shamed ” French prostitutes disliking the smell of her clients , or being too “ prudish ” , to , say , want to join an orgy , and so “ hygiene obsessed ” that she took showers before and after sex .
Jade emphasised : “
On ne choisit pas cette vie - là
” –
you do n’t choose that life .
She was asked if there were n’t some good sides : “ Non !
Il n’y a pas de bon côté .
”
For Strauss - Kahn ’s part , it never struck this fat old man as untoward that teams of young , attractive women should keep on turning up at his hotel rooms or lunch appointments , apparently willing to submit to his demands out of the purest lust .
In fact , he was angered by questions designed to suggest that he would only have used women so brutally if he knew they were prostitutes and not , as he insists , eager and gratis “ libertines ” .
“
I ’m starting to get fed up .
I ’m not on trial for sexual behaviour .
”
Even so , his particular habits may interest quite a few of his female former associates at the IMF , in the EU and in the French Socialist party , where this charming , seductive etc friend of women was once the favourite to end up the equal of Germany ’s foremost piece of equipment , as DSK presumably thinks of Angela Merkel .
To anyone who shares the EU ’s declared view of prostitution as a violation of human dignity , a man ’s use of prostitutes , including inadvertently , à la DSK , tells you as much about his attitude to women as , say , eating foie gras tells you about his attitude to geese .
You do n’t have to be very counterfactually minded to imagine him , while Mrs Merkel bangs on about Ukraine ’s borders , surreptitiously checking texts about a “ very beautiful new thing ” waiting back at his hotel .
Or perhaps snickering with fellow Europriapist , the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , who once , of course , called Mrs Merkel “ an unfuckable lard - arse ” .
Unless DSK was planning on restraint , if elected , France ’s socialists only narrowly escaped elevating a man who would have had to make presidential time , presumably with help from men such as “ Dodo
the Pimp ” ( a brothel owner who denies pimping charges ) , for catering and selecting pleasing “ equipment
” for unusually rough , libertine orgies in secret apartments .
Perhaps a quiet corner of the Elysée could have been reserved for this purpose .
If it had , it would have been entirely unexceptional and a private matter , of course , to French traditionalists such as Bernard - Henri Lévy and our own Max Mosley , the orgy enthusiast and Hacked Off agitator .
Government officials entrusted with due diligence already have quite enough on their hands what with insuring that people running sex inquiries are not close to anyone being inquired about , and establishing that potential finance tsars do not have a sideline in illegal offshore bank accounts , or that immigration ministers have no history of employing illegal immigrants .
Still , the conduct revealed in the Strauss - Kahn trial does suggest that public figures might also , ideally , come without a history of exploiting prostituted women .
With all that they imply about his respect for women , the insights into DSK ’s lifestyle , contrary to his and Lévy ’s protestations , constitute the strongest case for sexual behaviour being , occasionally , worth investigating since ( supposing we overlook Clinton ’s : “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman ” ) , Justice Caulfield asked , of Jeffrey Archer :
“ Is he in need of cold , unloving , rubber - insulated sex ? ”"
2015-03-20,"The maverick film - maker Abel Ferrara is threatening to sue the US distributors of his controversial film about the Dominique Strauss - Kahn scandal , Welcome to New York , to halt the release of a version made without his involvement for the American market .
Ferrara has issued a cease and desist letter to IFC films claiming the new version violates his contractual right of final cut and radically alters the “ political and moral content ” of the film .
French sales company Wild Bunch is also named in the notice .
Welcome to New York stars Gérard Depardieu as a potential candidate for the presidency of France who lives a life of debauchery and is arrested after being accused of raping a maid at his hotel .
The story closely mirrors events at the Sofitel New York hotel in 2011 involving former International Monetary Fund chief Strauss - Kahn which made headlines around the world .
“
As a film - maker and a human being , I detest the destruction of my film , ” said Ferrara in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter .
“
Behind all these entities are individuals ... who feel they can deny my contractual right of final cut , which is simply my freedom of expression .
”
He added : “ Some people wear hoods and carry automatic weapons , others sit behind their desks , but the attack and attempted suppression of the rights of the individual are the same .
I will defend the right of free speech ’til the end
and I ask all who believe , as I do , that they not support the showing of this film , on their networks , in their theatres , or wherever .
”
It is understood that the new version of Welcome to New York has been cut from 125 minutes to 108 minutes .
Ferrara appears to be most upset about the recutting of a central rape scene which now appears in flashback , potentially leaving the credibility of its victim open to interpretation .
“
The version being released in the US may lead viewers to think that maybe she imagined it , ” said the film - maker .
“
It does not respect the woman who was raped at all , and the fact that my name is on this film is a crime .
”
In the events of 2011 , charges of criminal sexual assault against Strauss - Kahn were dropped by US prosecutors .
Ferrara has been locked in a battle with Wild Bunch and IFC since last autumn , with Welcome to New York having debuted outside the official lineup during the Cannes film festival in May.
Wild Bunch says the Bad Lieutenant director was contractually obliged to deliver a cut which would meet strict guidelines for films rated R by the US censor .
When the film - maker failed to deliver , producers made their own edit .
“
This version has existed for eight months , has been released all over the world by distributors to whom we gave the choice between two versions , and all unanimously preferred the shorter version not only for commercial reasons but because they found it much better , ” Wild Bunch head Vincent Maraval told Indiewire earlier this month .
But Ferrara now suggests there was always a plan to make a new version without his permission and insists he was never aware he did not have final cut .
Meanwhile IFC has not made any public comment on the spat .
Welcome to New York has received mostly positive reviews , but was released via video on demand in France to escape what Maraval hinted at the time was a national instinct towards self - censorship .
Ferrara ’s film is slated for a US release , albeit in its controversially edited form , on 27 March ."
2015-03-23,"IFC Films , which is in dispute with Abel Ferrara over the US edit of his film Welcome to New York , has said the director refused to engage with the company in producing an R - rated version of his new film .
Ferrara threatened to sue IFC after it assembled a version of his film , based on the Dominique Strauss - Kahn scandal , without his involvement .
IFC has now accused the director of “ slinging mud and insults ” and claims it would have “ welcomed the opportunity to work more closely with him on the film , if he ’d been willing ” .
The film , which contains scenes of sex and drug abuse , stars Gérard Depardieu as a politician accused of rape .
It was screened in Cannes last year , to positive reviews .
But a new cut of the film has been put together for a global release and Ferrara claims it ’s a “ destruction
” that goes against his contractual agreement of a final cut .
“
Our contract with Wild Bunch [ the film ’s sales agent ] is for an R - rated version , ” the IFC Films statement reads .
“
We offered Mr Ferrara an opportunity to edit his own R - rated version of the film at our expense , but he did not respond .
“
After his threats of violence towards the IFC Center last September , we decided we could not risk showing the film there , but we offered to screen his original director ’s cut at the Anthology Film Archives theatre in New York .
It is our understanding that the theatre was in touch with Abel Ferrara , after which they declined to screen it .
“
Any edits made to the original version of Welcome to New York were made by Wild Bunch , since Mr Ferrara did not respond to our offer .
”
Wild Bunch head Vincent Maraval has suggested that Ferrara is intentionally stirring up a row to promote the film .
“
[ He is ] putting on a show like always and the press is following along , ” he told Deadline .
Maraval calls the cuts “ very minor ” although Ferrara believes they make an important and dangerous assertion about the core rape storyline .
“
The version being released in the US may lead viewers to think that maybe she imagined it , ” said the film - maker .
“
It does not respect the woman who was raped at all , and the fact that my name is on this film is a crime .
”
Ferrara apparently issued a cease and desist letter to IFC last week , although the company says it has not yet received it ."
2015-06-12,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the former head of the International Monetary Fund , has been cleared by a French court of “ aggravated pimping ” .
The one - time French presidential hopeful , who has described seeking “ recreation ” from the stress of world politics by having rough sex with strangers at orgies in Europe and the US , was found not to have promoted or profited from the prostitution of seven women .
The judges said Strauss - Kahn was not the instigator of the orgies with prostitutes .
Throughout his trial , he maintained he did not know that some of the women brought to him by businessmen friends at group - sex sessions were prostitutes , saying he thought they were merely swingers like himself .
The businessmen had told the women not to say they had been paid .
Strauss - Kahn ’s lawyer , Henri Leclerc , said the case against him had been “ totally empty ” , accusing investigating magistrates of a moral crusade with no legal foundation .
The wide - reaching trial in the northern French city of Lille revealed a saga of money , fame and women travelling to luxury locations for sex with powerful men against a backdrop of economic deprivation and social misery .
Known as the Carlton affair , the case began in 2011 as an investigation into an alleged prostitution network at Lille ’s Hotel Carlton , where women – described as “ livestock ” or “ dossiers
” – had been offered up as the “ dessert course ” at business lunches .
Strauss - Kahn was never involved in any alleged activity at the hotel , but when his name was mentioned by sex workers in interviews with investigators , the inquiry was widened .
Thirteen other men appeared in court on pimping charges , many with no connection to Strauss - Kahn , but the high - profile coverage of the case centred on the former IMF chief and how he sought to wind down from managing the fallout from the global financial crisis by having sex with strangers brought to him at orgies by businessmen keen to curry favour .
The trial exposed not only Strauss - Kahn ’s secret double life but also the harrowing accounts of some of the women with whom he had sex .
Between 2009 and 2011 , the years covered by the trial , Strauss - Kahn held the most senior economic job in the world in Washington , and he was convinced he would become the next Socialist president of France .
He invited TV crews to document his cosy and high - profile marriage to Anne Sinclair , an influential French journalist and feminist , who has since divorced him .
During his working day , however , he would send text messages asking a businessman friend to join him at a “ magnificent ” swingers’ club in Madrid and bring him some “ equipment
” , a term he admitted meant women .
While in Brussels for IMF meetings , he would be driven to the countryside at night for group sex with strangers on mattresses on the floor of a swingers’ club .
Throughout the trial , he said he never knew or suspected that there were prostitutes among the many women brought to him at the sessions .
The trial was marked by the tearful accounts of two destitute and vulnerable prostitutes who were among the women brought to locations in Paris , Brussels and Washington to have sex with Strauss - Kahn .
They likened the orgies to “ slaughter ” , “ killing ” and “ butchery ” .
The former IMF chief told the trial that he had regrettably discovered during the court hearings that he had “ a sexuality that was rougher than the average man
”
but that he believed
“
no means
no ” .
Mounia , a Lille sex worker whom court papers described as having been sexually abused as a child , broke down in tears as she told the court how , at an orgy in Paris , Strauss - Kahn had subjected her to anal penetration against her wishes .
She said that when he saw she was crying and in pain he smiled and went ahead “ with force ” .
Asked by the judge whether he had noticed her crying , Strauss - Kahn said : “
No , I would have found it chilling .
”
He said he did not have a precise memory of the woman , but that he had had no sense of refusal .
“
When someone says no , it ’s no ,
” he said .
Another prostitute , Jade , who was also sexually abused as a child , described the atmosphere at one Paris hotel orgy .
She said of Strauss - Kahn :
“
No one asked me my name , there was just a hand on my head to fellate him .
”
She later broke down in tears as she told the court how on a different occasion Strauss - Kahn had also subjected her to anal penetration against her wishes .
“
I did n’t have time to say no , ” she said .
Strauss - Kahn told the court he did not view his sexual encounter with Jade in the same way that she did .
“
I did n’t realise , ” he said .
“ I ’m not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners .
“
I had no way of knowing she did n’t want it
…
It was n’t my intention , I ’m sorry it happened like that .
”
Throughout the trial , Strauss - Kahn maintained the suggestion that he had to be brought “ fresh meat ” by businessmen friends was a “ disgrace
” .
He insisted he never had sex with prostitutes because “ I prefer a party atmosphere before , during and after ” .
As he told one sexual partner : “ I have a horror of whores .
” Prostitution involving people over the age of 18 is not illegal in France , but pimping and living off the benefits is .
Just as the Strauss - Kahn verdict came through , however , the French parliament voted in a second reading to criminalise prostitutes’ clients , making payment for sex punishable by a fine .
The bill must now return to the senate for a further reading .
Strauss - Kahn had told the court that group - sex sessions were rare “ recreation ” in his hectic schedule as IMF chief , taking place only four times a year because he had been very busy “ saving the world from catastrophe ” at the time of the US sub - prime crisis .
The two entrepreneurs from northern France who flew women to the US for orgies involving Strauss - Kahn ended their last visit on 13 May 2011 , the day before he was arrested in New York over the alleged attempted rape of a hotel maid , Nafissatou Diallo .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn in the Diallo case were dropped by prosecutors in New York , and he later settled a civil action with her out of court .
The case marked the end of his political career in France , where he is now seen as a pariah , and his acquittal on pimping charges in the Carlton case is not expected to change that view .
Strauss - Kahn ’s two businessmen friends and a police chief acquaintance
were also cleared of pimping charges on Friday .
Dominique Alderweireld , 65 – known as Dodo la Saumure or Dodo the Pimp , and who runs brothels in Belgium – was acquitted of sending prostitutes from his establishments to Paris and the US for Strauss - Kahn .
René Kojfer , 74 , the former head of public relations at the Hotel Carlton in Lille , was the only man to be convicted .
He was given a one - year suspended sentence for pimping – charges which had no connection to Strauss - Kahn ."
2015-06-12,"Dominique Strauss - Kahn may have been acquitted on charges of aggravated pimping , but he will forever be guilty in the court of public opinion in France .
Who would not have been shocked by the graphic descriptions of his violent behaviour towards the sex workers who described as “ carnage ” the brutal scenes which took place on mattresses strewn around the floor at his “ libertine ” evenings ?
I was almost physically sick when hearing their testimony during the trial in Lille in February .
The women roped in by the former IMF chief ’s flatterers had agreed to come along for organised orgies .
But who could forget the testimony of Jade , hardly a high - class escort who enjoyed the “ lifestyle
” but a sex worker from a modest background who received € 500 ( £ 362 ) for a night in a Belgian club with DSK ?
She described in intimate detail how she was sodomised – “ impaled ”
she called it – by Strauss - Kahn in 2009 when the Frenchman was at the height of his powers as a global political celebrity being tipped as a future French president .
No client had ever behaved in such a manner with her , she said .
“
Maybe that client thought that he could because he had a higher social status .
”
This same abuse of power was apparent two years later when he was accused of brutally sexually assaulting a chamber maid at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
Although the criminal case against him was subsequently dropped , his arrest shocked France .
To my amazement some French friends of mine agreed with the conspiracy theory that DSK ’s arrest in New York was a plot to prevent him running for the French presidency and defeating Nicolas Sarkozy .
At the time many French women I knew stuck to the traditional view that private life should remain private .
I was out on a limb when I said DSK was clearly a violent sex addict and
that instead of denying the charges he should have checked into rehab .
But mercifully attitudes have changed since then .
First of all because we know much more about DSK and what he describes as the “ rough sex ”
he has traditionally imposed on his sexual partners .
Most of these cases involved women who were in awe of him or on the lower rungs of the social ladder .
Some courageous women have stepped forward .
One was Tristane Banon who finally took him to court for attempted rape in 2011 in the wake of the Sofitel case over a long - rumoured incident in 2003 .
Banon , whose mother was a friend of Strauss - Kahn in the Socialist party , described him as behaving like a “ baboon ” when she went to interview him for a book she was writing .
Then there was a former girlfriend , Marcela Iacub , who wrote a novel in 2013 about her tempestuous seven - month relationship with DSK , in which he was described as “ half man ,
half pig ” .
He tried to get the book banned in France .
It is interesting to note how French television news reported the acquittal on Friday afternoon because their reports also focused on his violent treatment of women .
The consensus seemed to be that his political life is finished because of it , and indeed DSK himself is ruling out a return to politics .
But if support for the former French politician has evaporated amid the sordid revelations about his private life , so French attitudes have also evolved .
Consider the breathless reporting of President François Hollande ’s bitter separation from his partner Valérie Trierweiler and his dalliance with the actor Julie Gayet who is now reportedly ensconced in the Elysée palace .
Only a few years ago such reporting would have been taboo .
We only found out about François Mitterrand ’s mistress and illegitimate daughter when they were photographed at the late president ’s graveside .
Of course , there are plenty of people who still condemn the “ people - isation ” of the French press and its aping of the “ Anglo - Saxon ” style of celebrity reporting .
But the reality is that celebrity magazines peddling such stories sell like hot cakes in France .
What is troubling now is that Strauss - Kahn does n’t seem to have learned from his trials .
He and his fawning courtiers have naturally been claiming vindication after the verdict , which hinged on whether he knew the women were prostitutes .
But as far as the public record is concerned , he has never sought professional help over his violent sexual urges and is still in denial .
Far from hanging his head in shame , he was seen around town with a new girlfriend not long after his journalist wife Anne Sinclair left him in the wake of the Sofitel affair .
“ All that … for this , ” he said after the acquittal in Lille .
“
What destruction !
”
Come on , DSK , there ’s still time for you to get to rehab ."
2015-08-17,"The scandal surrounding former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn and his alleged sexual assault of a New York hotel maid is to be the subject of a new Hollywood film .
Described as a “ comedic dramatisation ” , The Libertine is being put together by Warner Bros and is based on a screenplay by newcomer Ben Kopit , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
The film follows Abel Ferrara ’s 2014 film Welcome to New York , which starred Gérard Depardieu as a character inspired by Strauss - Kahn and Jacqueline Bisset as his wife .
Strauss - Kahn was arrested in New York in May 2011 after being accused of a brutal assault by Nafissatou Diallo at a Sofitel hotel in Manhattan .
Kahn admitted there had been a sexual encounter , but insisted that it was consensual .
Criminal charges were later dropped by prosecutors , but Strauss - Kahn settled a civil action out of court in December 2012 .
The French economist ’s reputation took a further battering in June during the trial .
He was acquitted on pimping charges related to sex parties with prostitutes when he was head of the International Monetary Fund .
In a French court , Strauss - Kahn was found not to have promoted or profited from the prostitution of seven women and denied knowing that participants at “ swingers ” parties at Lille ’s Hôtel Carlton between 2009 and 2011 had been paid to attend .
Two of the prostitutes described being penetrated anally by the socialist politician after being brought to the hotel as the “ dessert course ” at business lunches .
They claimed they had been paid for by associates of Strauss - Kahn .
It is not known if the new film will include details of the later trial , but its title suggests Strauss - Kahn ’s attitude towards sex during his time as one of the most powerful men in France will provide the central focus .
No casting details for the film have yet emerged and Warner Bros have not yet appointed a director ."
2015-10-08,"The law firm that represented the hotel maid who said she was sexually assaulted by Dominique Strauss - Kahn and a woman from Delhi who said she was raped and beaten after hailing an Uber driver last December has filed a lawsuit against the controversial taxi app on behalf of two female passengers .
The passengers accuse Uber drivers of sexual assault , according to a court filing on Thursday .
In response to the suit , Uber said it had worked with law enforcement in both cases , and said “ both drivers have been permanently removed from the platform ” .
The suit , filed in US district court in San Francisco by Wigdor , a New York law firm , alleges that Uber targets its marketing toward women who have been drinking yet fails to protect female passengers by not adequately screening drivers and routinely hiring drivers with criminal histories .
“
What Uber does not share with riders is that making the choice to hail a ride after drinking also puts them in peril from the Uber drivers themselves , ” the complaint says .
“ By marketing heavily toward young women who have been drinking while claiming that rider safety is its # 1 priority , Uber is instead putting these women at risk .
”
The suit alleges that “ negligence , fraud and misleading statements ” led to the sexual assaults , which it says “ humiliated , degraded , violated and robbed [ the plaintiffs ] of their dignity ” .
The suit seeks unspecified damages and a permanent injunction against Uber to improve its safety measures .
“
It is our hope that this case sends a strong message to Uber that no woman should have to be physically violated because a company has decided to put profits over safety , ” said Douglas Wigdor , the founding partner at Wigdor , in a statement .
According to the suit , the first assault took place in Boston at around 2.30am on 8 February 2015 , after a friend of the first plaintiff , listed as Jane Doe 1 , ordered an Uber car .
The Uber driver first dropped off her friends , who lived together , the suit says , and then proceeded to travel off - route .
The driver began to grope the woman at a red light , according to the complaint .
He then forcibly kissed her .
She sent frantic texts to her friends , saying the driver was trying to “ rape ” her and asking them to “ call for help ” .
Eventually , the suit says , she managed to unlock the car door and escape .
The suit says the second woman , identified as Jane Doe 2 , was driven to a bar in Charleston with friends on 9 August 2015 .
According to the complaint , the driver followed them into the bar and after several hours offered to take them home .
After dropping off her male friend first , the Uber driver then drove the woman to a remote parking lot where he proceeded to “ viciously rape ” her , according to the filing .
After the attack , Jane Doe 2 escaped and called the police .
In a statement issued on Thursday , an Uber spokesperson said : “ Our thoughts remain with the victims of these two terrible incidents .
“ We proactively worked with law enforcement in Massachusetts and South Carolina at the time to share information and aid their investigations .
Both drivers have been permanently removed from the platform .
”
The taxi app is valued at more than $ 50bn , making it the most valuable of the new “ sharing economy ” tech companies .
But while investors have poured in money , Uber has been dogged by controversy .
Dozens of passengers from around the world have alleged sexual assaults by Uber drivers .
Cases have arisen in France , China , Canada and India , where a woman ’s allegation that she was brutally raped by her Uber driver set off widespread protests and led to a ban on the service in Delhi ."
2016-02-02,"Martin Shkreli , the pharmaceutical boss dubbed “ the world ’s most hated man ” after he increased the price of an HIV drug by 5,000 % , has hired Sean “ Diddy ” Combs’ lawyer .
Shkreli , who will appear in a New York court on Wednesday on charges of running a Ponzi scheme , announced on Tuesday that he has hired Ben Brafman , one of New York ’s best known lawyers whose clients have included Jay Z , Michael Jackson , Mafia boss
Salvatore “ Sammy the Bull ” Gravano and former International Monetary Fund boss Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Shkreli , who denies the charges , said he was “ excited ” about working with Brafman .
“
You know , his track record is impeccable , and I think we ’re going to put our best foot forward , ” Shkreli told Fox Business News on Tuesday .
“
We have a very good case to make
and I think we are going to win .
”
Shkreli is due to take the stand in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday over charges of securities fraud related to his time running hedge fund MSMB Capital Management and biopharmaceutical company Retrophin .
“
Obviously I think I ’m innocent and not guilty , ” he said .
On Thursday , Shkreli is due to appear before Congress to face questions about hiking the price of Daraprim , a life - saving drug often given to people with Aids or cancer , from $ 13.50 to $ 750 a pill overnight .
Shkreli , 32 , who has been dubbed a “ pharma bro ” , said he planned to “ insult ” and “ berate ” Congress , but would otherwise invoke his fifth amendment right not to testify .
“
They can ask me any question , ” he said .
“ ‘
What color is the sky?’ Fifth amendment .
It ’s nothing more than an advertisement for some congressmen who want to get some votes and some cheap publicity off my name .
What Congress is doing is just a ploy to embarrass me .
”
His comments came as lawmakers released excerpts from 250,000 documents showing how Shkreli sought to make his former company , Turing Pharmaceuticals , $ 1bn from buying up the 62-year - old anti - parasite drug on the cheap .
“
Very good .
Nice work as usual .
$ 1bn here we come , ” he said in an email to the company ’s chairman as he worked to buy Daraprim for $ 55 m in 2015 .
Shkreli said hiking the price of the drug , which is used to treat toxoplasmosis in people with HIV / Aids , cancer and other patients with compromised immune systems , would bring in an extra sales of $ 375 m , “ almost all of it profits ” .
“
Should be a very handsome investment for all of us , ” he said .
“
Let ’s all cross our fingers that the estimates are accurate . ”"
2016-02-19,"The International Monetary Fund has appointed Christine Lagarde for a second term as managing director after she rebuilt the Washington - based organisation ’s reputation following the sex scandal that engulfed her predecessor .
Lagarde , 60 , who was the only candidate , was backed by the UK , Germany , China , and her home country , France , to stay on for another five years .
She has led the IMF since 2011 and proved a strong contrast to her predecessor , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who was forced to resign after he was accused of attempted rape in a New York hotel .
The allegation was later dismissed .
During her first term , Lagarde won praise from developing countries for providing greater practical support for their efforts to recover from the financial crash and backing their demands for greater representation on the IMF board .
But the former French finance minister has clashed with the US Congress over its refusal to back reform and for her remarks in 2013 after the Obama administration was forced to implement spending cuts , which she considered “ excessively rapid and ill - designed ” .
Her reputation in Greece has also been battered by years of disputes over the country ’s financial bailout , which the leftist Syriza government believes has brought the nation to its knees .
The IMF ’s latest rescue mission runs out at the end of the month , by which time Greece is expected to make swingeing cuts to pensions , possibly sparking another dispute .
The organisation ’s executive board said her second term , which will start on 5 July , was the result of a “ consensual ” decision .
It sidestepped concerns that Lagarde ’s upcoming trial in France will prove a distraction during her second term .
She will defend an accusation of negligence over a € 400 m ( £ 310 m ) payout to businessman Bernard Tapie , who supported Nicolas Sarkozy in France ’s 2007 presidential race .
The dean of the board , the Russian Aleksei Mozhin , said : “ In taking this decision , the board praised Ms Lagarde ’s strong and wise leadership during her first term .
During turbulent times in the global economy , Ms Lagarde strengthened the Fund ’s ability to support its members with policy advice , capacity building , and financing .
“
She has also played a critical role in revitalising the Fund ’s relations with its global membership , including its emerging market and developing members .
”
Lagarde said : “ The global economy is undergoing a number of important transitions and we are focused on helping our membership navigate these successfully .
The Fund remains committed to its fundamental goal of helping to ensure global economic and financial stability through international cooperation . ”"
2016-05-10,"Hundreds of French politicians and equal rights activists have denounced the widespread sexual harassment of women in politics , five years after the Dominique Strauss - Kahn scandal provoked soul - searching and promises that sexism would be stamped out .
An End the Omertà petition , which criticises an alleged Mafia - style code of silence around harassment , was published on the front page of the daily Libération on Tuesday after the MP Denis Baupin resigned as deputy parliamentary speaker following allegations made against him by women in his Europe Écologie Les Verts ( EELV ) party .
Judges have opened an investigation into allegations that Baupin sexually harassed four women within the party .
Baupin has denied the allegations and his lawyers said he would launch defamation suits against journalists who carried out an investigation into the claims for Mediapart and France Inter .
When the French presidential hopeful Strauss - Kahn resigned from the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after his arrest in New York over the alleged attempted rape and sexual assault of a hotel worker , hundreds of women took to the streets of Paris to protest against the reaction by some in the French elite perceived to have belittled both rape and women .
Criminal charges against Strauss - Kahn in the New York case were later dropped by prosecutors , and he settled a civil action with the hotel worker .
At the time , French commentators said there would be a “ before and after ” the DSK affair and any kind of sexism and harassment in France would be stamped out .
But the petition in Libération said many women in French politics remained silent for fear of damaging their career or party .
The signatories described how women still had to set boundaries on not getting into lifts with certain politicians , or not staying at the office late if certain known harassers were present .
They said unwelcome sexual advances , from harassment to acts of outright aggression , continued .
“
It ’s time to speak out , to bring this impunity to an end , time for men to change their behaviour rather than for women to adapt to it , ” the petition says .
Exactly one year ago , Libération had published a separate tribune by 40 female journalists warning that sexism and harassment were still rife in French politics .
Baupin ’s wife , Emmanuelle Cosse , the French housing minister , who was previously head of the EELV party , said she was shocked by the allegations against her husband .
“
We are talking about acts of extreme seriousness and if they are proven , it must be dealt with by the courts , ” she told France Info radio .
Responding to suggestions by some in her party that she might have hushed up the allegations and not investigated them as party leader , Cosse said she had categorically not known about any of the claims until they appeared in the media on Monday .
She said she still trusted her husband , adding that she had been deeply affected by the allegations “ as a woman , as a wife , as a mother and also as a minister ” .
Baupin , 53 , resigned his post as a deputy speaker on Monday , saying he wanted to focus on fighting the allegations , which he vehemently denies .
Paris prosecutors said their investigation would focus on gathering statements from the alleged victims and that no criminal complaint had been lodged against Baupin .
The statute of limitations for harassment in France is only three years , which would exclude most of the incidents alleged by the four women , some of which date back 15 years .
An EELV spokeswoman , Sandrine Rousseau , told the Mediapart website and France Inter radio that Baupin made an aggressive pass at her in October 2011 outside a party meeting .
“ Denis Baupin appeared in the corridor outside …
He pinned me against the wall with his chest and tried to kiss me .
I pushed him away vigorously , ” she said .
Elen Debost , the deputy mayor of Le Mans in central France , alleged she had received sexually explicit text messages for several months in 2011 .
She said she did not realise the scale of the problem until approached by the media , and that “ a lot of people kept quiet so as not to harm his campaign ” .
The women came forward in part because they said they were outraged at Baupin appearing to take a stand against sexual harassment on social media .
Baupin ’s lawyer described the allegations as “ mendacious , defamatory and baseless ” ."
2016-05-11,"Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard are set to star in a new Dominique Strauss - Kahn - inspired drama for director Brett Ratner .
The pair , who previously co - starred in Michael Mann ’s 2009 thriller Public Enemies , will take on lead roles in The Libertine .
The story focuses on a French diplomat put under house arrest after accusations of sexual assault .
The script comes from Ben Kopit and will mark somewhat of a departure for Ratner , known for directing lighter fare such as Hercules and the Rush Hour franchise .
The plot closely mirrors that of Strauss - Kahn scandal .
The managing director of the IMF was put under house arrest after he was accused of assaulting a maid in 2011 .
The story has already inspired another film , Abel Ferrara ’s
Welcome to New York which starred Gérard Depardieu .
Depp will next be seen in the big budget sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass , coming off some of his best ever reviews for his performance in the true crime thriller Black Mass.
He will also reprise his role of Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean :
Dead Man Tell No Tales and has small roles in London Fields and Yoga Hosers .
Marion Cotillard , whose role in the film is as yet unknown , has two films premiering at this year ’s
Cannes film festival :
Xavier Dolan
’s
It ’s Only the End of the World and Nicole Garcia
’s
From the Land to the Moon .
She will also be seen opposite Michael Fassbender in Assassin ’s Creed , which is due for release in December ."
2016-08-27,"As financiers from RBS ’s Fred Goodwin to Northern Rock ’s Adam Applegarth and the IMF ’s Dominique Strauss - Kahn have demonstrated , senior bankers are quite as likely as , say , Boris Johnson and members of the SNP to embark on extramarital relationships , sometimes discovered before they move on , sometimes not .
Though given the superhuman abilities reflected in the bankers’ salaries , it should be emphasised that they are obviously many thousands of times better at conducting affairs than the average married person and would take their talents abroad if anyone questioned their rewards in this respect , with grievous consequences for the British economy .
António Horta - Osório , the CEO of Lloyds Banking Group , is entitled to ask why his recent sightseeing in Singapore , accompanied by the chief executive of the Russell Group , Wendy Piatt , was of such interest to Sun readers , that the paper revealed it , beneath the front - page headline : Lloyds Bonk .
That the bank is still 9 % state - owned can not amount to the public ’s right to CEO uxoriousness or not , anyway , at the same time that the once - dedicated shagger Boris Johnson is promoted to prime minister ’s understudy .
If anything , modern Westminster shows that , while not exactly compulsory , a furious extra - marital sex life is a tremendous way for a male public servant to create interest and progress his career .
On the left , John , now Lord Prescott , rose from shifty practitioner of the office knee - trembler to become one of the greatest moralists of the age , certainly a rival for John Major .
It remains only for women MPs to be rewarded , or pardoned , for the same enthusiasm , before the parliamentary sex scandal is redefined as the obvious stepping stone between backbencher and junior minister .
Though , as David Mellor ’s career reminds us , why stop there ?
As for any link between continence and competence , Horta - Osório ’s record , like Johnson ’s , speaks for itself .
Give or take a further 3,000 job losses , a fall in profits and a record fine for mishandled PPI claims , Lloyds bank is now in such excellent shape that Horta - Osório ’s latest pay deal , including a 6 % salary rise , was £ 8.5 m .
Having established that Horta - Osório had not claimed any Piatt - related costs of his trip on expenses , Lloyds told the Sun :
“ In this regard , the review found there were no breaches of the group ’s policy and there was no case to answer .
”
It continued : “ Lloyds has been returned to financial health over the last five years under the leadership of António , and is well - placed to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper .
”
But in another regard , it might have added , António had a little explaining to do .
Shortly after his arrival at Lloyds , Horta - Osório introduced a code of personal responsibility , one intrusive enough to satisfy the Sun , and designed to help Lloyds staff to “ strive to always do the right thing
” .
Incentives were included : “
We take any non - compliance with the codes very seriously .
”
I recommend the code ’s crystalline “ decision guide ” to any employee who is contemplating something that might not merely make them look exceptionally silly , but cost them their job .
For instance , a married employee might ask himself / herself : “ I would like to meet my girlfriend / boyfriend while on company business in Singapore , then take boat trips together , even though discovery would cause personal and professional agonies and raise unfair questions about my judgment and expenses .
What should I do ?
”
In this instance , the decision guide would lead the troubled employee straight to three questions : “ Am I leading by example ?
”
; “ Would Lloyds Banking Group be comfortable if my actions were reported externally ?
”
and ; “ Would I be happy to tell my colleagues , friends and family about my actions ?
”
If , like our fictitious employee , you answered no / not sure to one or more , then the code is clear :
“ Contact your line manager or a responsible senior leader in your business area for further advice and guidance .
”
The glaring omission here is how to proceed if you are already CEO of Lloyds and therefore have no line manager or responsible senior leader with whom to discuss your Singapore trip .
In earlier times , Mr Horta - Osório praised his wife ’s advice –
she recommended he take the Lloyds job –
but in this case , that , presumably , was contra - indicated .
Perhaps the careless code - writers thought it inconceivable that any leader brilliant enough to help Britain prosper would n’t also be enough of a genius not to breach his own regulations by taking an ostensibly adulterous mini - break on the Singaporean harbour front .
Such a gigantic talent would be sure to remain , judiciously , indoors .
One recalls that even Prescott was exposed only after his diary secretary ’s boyfriend went to the Daily Mirror .
It becomes clearer why , in what first resembled some grim , public - appeasing precedent , Mr Horta - Osório felt compelled to issue a staff memo much praised by PRs and trumpeted by the Sun as a “ grovelling apology ” .
On examination , there is little sign of accountability in Mr Horta - Osório ’s effort , which adheres strictly to the “ mistakes were made ” method of apology , so dear to politicians and bankers , that regrets , preferably in the first person plural , whatever unfortunate circumstances have mysteriously arisen .
More than anything it recalls those forced HBOS apologies : “ We are profoundly and I think unreservedly sorry at the turn of events .
”
In the current case , Mr Horta - Osório says : “
I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity
”
( ie , being found out ) ; he dwells on the company ’s “ major accomplishments ” ; he delicately alludes , as he must , to the code he has transgressed –
“ the highest professional standards
” .
From which it is but a short step to shared responsibility .
“
We must recognise that mistakes will be made .
I do n’t expect anyone to get everything all the time .
”
Quite .
It would be ridiculous to think that , in the lower regions of the Lloyds banking group , nobody on a fraction of his £ 8.5 m would impulsively do something , as prohibited by the Antonine Code , that they would be unhappy to tell their colleagues , friends or family about .
Perhaps it is not so unreasonable , however , for Mr Horta - Osório ’s co - workers , and even for the public , with its 9 % holding , to wonder if someone in such hilarious contravention of his code can be worth the full £ 8.5 m .
Can António , the star in his own revival of Measure for Measure , be the right person to lead by example ?
Either , as Mr Horta - Osório says , his “ personal life is obviously a private matter ” , and elements of his code are an outrageous imposition , in which case he ’s in the wrong , or his code is defensible and he is in the wrong for non - compliance .
“
I strongly believe you should link compensation with performance , ” he has said .
A merciful public might conclude that , if Mr Horta - Osório is not to join the blameless 3,000 staff now earmarked for disposal , he should continue in employment only on a salary that better demonstrates this link , £ 15,156 per year being both generous to him , and the same as a Lloyds customer service assistant ."
