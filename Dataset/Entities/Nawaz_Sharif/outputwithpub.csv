1999-01-04,"Pakistan 's prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , escaped an assassination attempt yesterday when a bomb exploded on the road leading to his palatial weekend retreat outside the Punjab city of Lahore .
Four people died in the blast , including a policeman .
Three others were wounded .
The explosion , which was audible for several miles , destroyed a bridge about two miles from Mr Sharif 's sprawling estate at Raiwind , about 12 miles from Lahore .
The prime minister , his family and his political entourage had been due to travel to Raiwind just minutes before the blast , and security forces had been placed along the route .
But Mr Sharif had not set out when the bomb exploded .
The information minister , Mushahid Hussain , said the blast was an act of terror , clearly aimed at Mr Sharif .
The weekend retreat , built during the two years since Mr Sharif became prime minister , has been surrounded by controversy .
His political opponents say he has spent millions of rupees in state funds to build roads to the farm house , which he visits at least once a week .
They also claim that the estate was built on the proceeds of corruption - a charge Mr Sharif denies . '
This was the normal time and route on which he used to travel on a Sunday to visit his parents , ' Mr Hussain said . '
But the prime minister was delayed today because of meetings in Lahore . '
He said it was too early to assign blame for the explosion .
But earlier yesterday police in Lahore blamed Indian agents and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , a political force in the southern province of Sindh which fell out with Mr Sharif late last year .
Police raided the party 's offices in Lahore yesterday , but made no arrests .
However , one official said three party workers had been arrested in Karachi .
The MQM has denied responsibility for the blast ."
1999-01-22,"When Pakistan 's cricketers assembled in Lahore yesterday morning for the 40-minute flight that would take their country 's first Test side to India in 12 years , there was one last formality to undergo .
The players were summoned to a meeting with the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , who said he had taken the final decision to let the tour go ahead .
He told them to go out and promote good neighbourliness between India and Pakistan .
That Sharif 's intervention was necessary illustrates the explosive nature of any cricketing encounter between India and Pakistan , and why contests between the two have generally been restricted to far away - and neutral - grounds like Sharjah and Toronto .
But no tour has been undertaken amid such tension as this one after the Hindu extremists Shiv Sena threatened violence to sabotage the series .
Then they demonstrated their muscle power , digging up the pitch at the stadium here which was to host the first Test - while police stood by - and on Monday ransacking the headquarters of the Board of Control for Cricket in Bombay .
The Shiv Sena also issued threats against any India player who did not recognise his patriotic duty and boycott the series .
In 1991 such tactics prompted the Pakistan government to call off a planned tour .
Yesterday the Shiv Sena yielded , hours before the Pakistan side landed at New Delhi airport and was bundled into a motorcade and taken to a heavily fortified hotel .
Bal Thackeray , the Shiv Sena leader whose word is law in Bombay , was prevailed upon to call a temporary truce in his crusade to sabotage all Pakistani sporting visits on the pretext that Islamabad supports separatist militants in Kashmir . ""
In response to a request made by the prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the Shiv Sena chief , Bal Thackeray , has decided to suspend the protest move against the series of matches against Pakistan - for this year only , "" said a statement issued after a meeting in Bombay between Thackeray and the Indian home minister LK Advani .
But the Indian government , which has had to reassure Pakistan on several occasions that it could protect the visitors , was taking no chances .
Hundreds of police manned barricades on roads leading to the New Delhi hotel and intelligence officers prowled the lobby muttering into radios as the Pakistan side , looking tired and slightly ill at ease in their green jackets , alighted from the bus .
Hotel guests were made to pass through metal detectors , and plain - clothed police sealed off the second floor to all but the Pakistani guests .
The players leave today for the central city of Gwalior for a match against India A , and six bulletproof cars will ferry them between hotel and stadium .
The first Test starts next Thursday in Madras , where 2,000 police have been deployed to protect the stadium and some 300 people were arrested on Wednesday for fear they will disrupt the match .
Amid much secrecy , the Indian side also arrived here yesterday from New Zealand , diverted from their original landing in Bombay because of the security threat .
"" This is in many ways a historic occasion , "" said Shahryar Khan , a former Pakistani diplomat who was made team manager for the tour .
""
Never before in the history of cricket has a team arrived in a country in such a daunting atmosphere .
"" Much of the tension was gone , Pakistan 's captain Wasim Akram conceded , and the fans can now concentrate on the series instead of the politics that have preceded it .
"" It 's been a completely different kind of pressure , "" Wasim said .
"" But after the assurances of the Indian government we are feeling much more relaxed . ""
However , it is not certain whether all of Thackeray 's followers , who have also dumped pigs ' heads outside the Chidambaram stadium in Madras and burnt effigies of Imran Khan in Bombay , will readily heed his truce after being worked into such a frenzy .
On several occasions before this tour , the Shiv Sena resorted to force to enforce its dictats .
Its thugs have smashed up galleries showing the paintings of India 's best - known artist , who is a Muslim , and cinemas showing the film Fire , which has lesbian love scenes .
Last year , they nearly sabotaged a visit by Pakistani squash players to Bombay .
But in taking on cricket they struck directly at India 's heart .
"" Cricket is above all religions , and the only thing that is binding this country together , "" says Bishan Bedi , who captained India to Pakistan in 1977 .
"" To fire communal guns on the shoulder of cricket is unpardonable .
Cricket has been my life ; it still is .
And anybody who hurts cricket is hurting me .
"" Not only Bedi , who was among the most outspoken critics of the Shiv Sena 's campaign to sabotage the tour .
The subcontinental passion for cricket is legendary , and on any Sunday in Bombay it is practically impossible to find a scrap of open ground without several groups of children playing games on it .
Commentators would be lost if they were forced to explain the machinations of Indian politics without cricketing metaphors .
And when all else goes wrong , there is always Sachin Tendulkar .
"" In a year of gloom one man brought us cheer - the last great hero , "" said the Indian weekly magazine , Outlook , devoting a double issue to the batsman .
Despite the terror tactics of the Shiv Sena , which included a particularly brazen order to Bombay cable television operators in its affiliated union to black out the series , some 74 per cent of Indians wanted the tour to go ahead , according to a poll published in Outlook .
Among them presumably were the 39 per cent who believed there could be riots . ""
There is something in the rhythm of cricket that moves in time with the subcontinental lifestyle , "" says Ashis Nandy , a sociologist and author of The Tao of Cricket :
On games of destiny and the destiny of games .
"" There is a bit of everything .
There is drama , there is a leisurely pace .
Even when you lose very badly cricket allows you to retrieve some amount of dignity and self - esteem , and that goes with the Indian sense of what is just and proper .
""
The contest is that much more exciting when it is India v Pakistan , ratcheted up because of the deadly , and now nuclear , sibling rivalry between the two countries that were born out of British India in 1947 , and which have gone to war three times since .
"" Defeating them is the greatest ambition we can ever have , "" says Nandy .
"" It 's like when a joint family splits .
Whatever you do for the rest of your life , somehow your point of reference is that other part of the family . ""
Despite the division of the sub - continent on religious lines , India is home to 120 million Muslims , and for the Hindu lunatic fringe , minority loyalties are always suspect when the neighbouring sides meet .
Most Indians , though , would find the idea of a cricketing loyalty test distasteful .
But in the disputed territory of Kashmir it is no longer required .
In the mid - Eighties a one - day international against West Indies in Srinagar , the summer capital , was disrupted by a pitch invasion and the raising of Pakistani flags , and for years Kashmiris made it a point of honour to support any side playing against India .
Yesterday 's climbdown by the Shiv Sena means that such political considerations will retreat into the background .
For the players , who share a language and often friendships made playing county cricket , hostilities eased years ago .
But for ordinary Indians it is too early to say if they will disappear entirely .
"" If we play each other at our own houses instead of far off Toronto , Bangladesh and Sharjah , things will gradually settle down , "" says Bedi .
"" But if this kind of vandalism is allowed to get away scot - free , then the subcontinent with all its prowess and cricket talent will make a laughing stock of itself . ""

1999-02-22,"Nine months after entering the nuclear age , India and Pakistan promised yesterday to share information that could prevent a holocaust .
The prime minister of India , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , and his Pakistani counterpart , Nawaz Sharif , declared : ' The two sides undertake to notify each other immediately in the event of any accidental , unauthorised , or unexplained incident that could create the risk of a fallout ... or an outbreak of nuclear war . '
The Lahore Declaration was made at the end of an epic journey to Pakistan by Mr Vajpayee .
Yesterday 's belated recognition of the dangers of the nuclear age - the first since India and Pakistan carried out rival nuclear tests last May - is a small and tentative step towards a peace that has eluded the neighbours for more than 50 years . '
There is no other way but peace .
We can no longer play with the embers because we can start a fire that will destroy everyone , ' Mr Vajpayee said .
His largely Pakistani audience on the lawn of the Punjab governor 's mansion was spellbound .
However , Mr Vajpayee and Mr Sharif skirted around the most contentious issue : their dispute over Kashmir .
But Mr Vajpayee 's trip to Lahore , where he inaugurated the first bus route between India and Pakistan , signalled that both countries are now committed to dialogue .
No other Indian prime minister has traversed the 40 miles from Amritsar , the closest Indian city to the border , to Lahore .
Mr Sharif made history too , venturing a few feet into Indian territory to shake hands with border guards .
The partition of India and Pakistan at independence was at its bloodiest in the two border cities and encounters between the two countries are traditionally tinged with suspicion . '
Whatever happens in India , they blame Pakistan .
Whatever happens in Pakistan , we blame India , ' Mr Sharif said .
' We have to live together .
History can change , but geography can not , ' Mr Vajpayee said .
For India , escaping the past means accepting that Pakistan exists .
But he admitted that the visit could antagonise the hardliners in his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party .
He will also be returning home to a clamour about Pakistan support for the separatist uprising in Kashmir , where more than 20 Hindu villagers were killed at the weekend .
For Mr Sharif , rapprochement with India must be tempered by assurances that Pakistan will not lower its defences against its giant neighbour .
Yesterday , police fired tear gas into the headquarters of the Jamiat Islami party in central Lahore as police flushed out , beat and arrested Islamic activists .
On Saturday night ambassadors travelling to the state banquet at Lahore 's Shahi fort were ambushed by truckloads of protesters armed with bamboo sticks who slashed tyres and tore up national flags .
At their joint press conference yesterday , the prime ministers were guarded on the question of Kashmir , refusing to rise to provocative questions from journalists .
In both countries , opposition is confined to small but powerful fringe groups with a capacity to unleash unrest .
But among ordinary Indians and Pakistanis the longing for peace is tremendous . '
They should stay in the same room together until they have made peace , ' said a man selling lottery tickets . '
In the last 24 hours , the distance between Delhi and Lahore has grown a little bit smaller .
We have become a little closer , ' Mr Vajpayee promised ."
1999-05-10,"A Pakistani newspaper editor was handcuffed and marched from his home by armed police at the weekend , the fourth journalist in a week targeted by a government unwilling to tolerate dissent , writes Suzanne Goldenberg .
Several journalists have complained of harassment from intelligence agents and from officials seeking to block a BBC programme on corruption allegations against the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , and his family 's financial empire .
Najam Sethi , editor of the Friday Times of Lahore , was arrested by uniformed Punjab police early on Sat urday .
He was filmed by the BBC earlier this month .
Last night his wife , Jugnu Mohsin , said he was believed to be held in Islamabad by the Inter - Services Intelligence , the military 's spy agency .
But the government has denied knowledge of his whereabouts , and Ms Mohsin fears for her husband 's safety .
The official news agency said Mr Sethi was being investigated for treason after a speech in New Delhi on April 30 about Pakistan 's decline .
But the arrest is seen as a warning to critics of Mr Sharif .
Mr Sethi delivered the same speech in Pakistan last November ."
1999-05-15,"Pakistani intelligence services distributed millions of pounds to ensure the electoral success of parties opposing the former Prime Minister , Benazir Bhutto , according to court documents obtained by The Observer .
The money - totalling 140 million rupees ( pounds 3 million ) - was allegedly distributed among Bhutto 's opponents in 1990 .
The election was won by a coalition of parties led by Nawaz Sharif , the current Prime Minister , which received the bulk of the funds .
Bhutto 's party was heavily defeated .
Statements by figures in the scandal have claimed Sharif personally received 3.5 m rupees ( £ 75,000 ) from the fund for his campaign .
He has denied receiving any money .
Hearings in the case will start this week in the Supreme Court in Islamabad .
Sharif could be disqualified from office if it is found that the receipt of money from Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) constituted corruption .
Last month a special bench of judges sentenced Bhutto to five years in prison and fined her £ 5 m for accepting huge bribes while Prime Minister .
She is now at her home in Dubai and does not appear to have decided whether to return to Pakistan and risk almost certain imprisonment .
Last Thursday the Supreme Court decided her appeal against conviction could not be heard while she was out of the country .
Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) - which had been elected in 1988 after the military dictator , General Zia ul - Haq , was killed in a plane crash - was dismissed by the President , Ghulam Ishaq Khan , after 22 months in power .
He then installed a caretaker government and called new elections .
The PPP claims its progressive agenda worried the conservative establishment , which sought to stop it returning to power .
Documents obtained by The Observer show that after Bhutto 's dismissal the ISI opened secret accounts into which about pounds 2 m in local currency was paid by a senior manager of the state - owned Habib Bank .
Highly placed sources say the money was from the public exchequer .
The operation appears to have been sanctioned by the President .
General Mirza Aslam Beg , then army chief of staff , has revealed in an affidavit that the ISI distributed just under half the money to ' various politicians and persons ' to pay for ' election purposes and the acquisition of election intelligence ' .
The rest was deposited in another secret account .
Aslam Beg describes how a ' cover account was opened by 202 Survey Section , [ which was ] a unit of the army for all political and technical purposes under the command of the ISI ' .
The head of the ISI at the time of the affair , Lt Gen Muhammad Asad Durrani , has said all the distributed funds went to the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad ( Islamic Democratic Alliance ) , the conservative coalition formed to contest the 1990 elections .
In an affidavit he alleges Sharif received 3.5 m rupees .
He says that ' in September 1990 I received instructions . . . to provide ' ' logistic support '' to the disbursement of donations to the election campaign of the IJI ' .
Professor Ghaffour Ahmed , Secretary - General of the IJI at the time of the alleged donations , said he knew nothing of any transactions . '
I would not have tolerated such a thing had I known , ' Ahmed said . '
The army chief of staff has said on the record that it happened , but I do not know anything about it . '
After winning the 1990 elections , Sharif remained in power until summer 1993 , when his government too was dismissed by the President .
However , allegations of corruption and mismanagement did not prevent him being re - elected two years ago with a huge parliamentary majority .
Sharif has now eradicated almost all serious threats to his power .
He is expected to win a majority in the upper house in the next round of Senate elections .
He has appointed a close aide as President , quelled dissent among the judiciary and manoeuvred a supporter into the post of army chief of staff .
Sharif has passed legislation to make the ISI more democratically accountable .
The service no longer answers to the President , but to the Prime Minister instead .
He has also removed the power of the President to dismiss elected governments .
Despite its strong position , the government has launched a crackdown on any dissent .
The editor of the respected Friday Times news magazine , Najam Sethi , was arrested in a midnight raid and badly beaten .
His only crime appears to have been to list in a recent speech the problems confronting Pakistan ."
1999-05-29,"Three days after Indian fighters jets first screamed over the mountains of Kashmir , driving tensions between the world 's newest nuclear powers to dangerous new levels , Pakistan 's prime minister last night said he had telephoned India 's leader to call for talks .
The telephone conversation between Nawaz Sharif , and his Indian counterpart , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , conducted over a hotline intended to avoid such high - stakes episodes , marks the first diplomatic attempt to cool temperatures along the disputed Himalayan border .
Earlier yesterday , officials in New Delhi were adamant there would be no let - up in the air raids , despite the loss of a third aircraft to a missile fired from within Indian - claimed territory .
They said diplomacy would have to wait until hundreds of Islamic militants , who had stolen across the frontier with Pakistani army support , were driven out of their high altitude dugouts near the Indian town of Kargil .
However , Mr Sharif told a public meeting in Karachi it was time for a pause .
He side both sides needed to review a confrontation which has prompted calls for restraint from the US , Russia , and China .
"" I talked to Vajpayee today and asked him where is this leading to , "" he said .
"" I told him and he agreed that there is no solution to Kashmir except to table talks .
"" There was no immediate reaction from the Indian prime minister .
Earlier yesterday , a foreign ministry official in New Delhi appeared to rule out the prospects of a speedy resumption of the peace mission Mr Vajpayee launched last February , by riding a golden love bus across the border to Pakistan .
"" The action taken to push out the armed intruders is the only action possible , "" the official said .
"" Our resolve is absolute and firm .
This armed intrusion will end .
We will not allow any armed intruders to remain in the Kashmir area .
This action will continue until it is completed and it will be completed successfully . ""
Meanwhile , defence officials claimed that 200 intruders had been killed since May 6 , and that they had driven the militants from several points , and cut off supply lines to other posts in the Drass area .
Last night , though , an adviser to Mr Vajpayee said privately that the prime minister would be more favourably inclined than his bureaucrats toward Mr Sharif 's gesture .
Throughout the rhetoric and blustering of Indian officials during the last three days , Mr Vajpayee has remained silent .
On Monday , he too resorted to the hotline , warning Mr Sharif that New Delhi was contemplating further action in the Kargil area to drive out the militants .
Such duality has been a feature of the last few days .
While officials in New Delhi have stepped up their accusations against Pakistan , accusing regular officers of guiding Islamic militants across mountain terrain , they have also claimed India has no intention of escalating the conflict .
The consequences of a further escalation in the most serious military confrontation in 28 years could not have been made more clear .
Mr Sharif announced his initiative at a rally to celebrate the first anniversary of its nuclear bomb explosion .
India tested its own nuclear device a few weeks earlier .
The Pakistani government has devoted 10 days to celebrating the bomb , which officials have described as the most important achievement in the country 's history after independence .
Mr Sharif 's government has sponsored song contests and science quizzes , and plastered city streets with images of the metallurgist credited with Pakistan 's entry to the nuclear age , set against a backdrop of a mushroom cloud .
Last night 's overture does not yet remove the prospects of worsening confrontation .
Mr Sharif also warned New Delhi that Pakistan would retaliate against any violations of its airspace .
The warning came hours after reporters were flown to view the wreckage of an Indian fighter strewn over several hundred yards , some 12 kms inside Pakistani territory .
The plane was shot down on Thursday .
Military analysts yesterday said they were not surprised by loss of a third aircraft , a helicopter gunship which was brought down by a Stinger missile some five miles south of the line of control at Tolcing .
A Pakistan - based militant group , the Mutahida Jihad Council , claimed credit for shooting down the helicopter , and claimed to have shot down another .
However , Indian defence officials said they had lost only one helicopter ."
1999-06-24,"Just a few months ago , the Wagah border crossing between Pakistan and India was the scene of jubilation as Pakistani officials and ceremonial bands welcomed the Indian prime minister , Atal Bahari Vajpayee , on a historic visit to Lahore .
Mr Vajpayee and the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , hugged each other as if to signal that decades of hostility between their neighbouring countries might be ending .
Yet today Pakistanis living near Wagah are frightened that fighting between India and Pakistan on the disputed Kashmir frontier could spread to the Punjab .
People here are afraid that Indian troops and tanks might once again pour over this border in a replay of the invasion of 1965 .
Their fears have been heightened by reports this week that India has put on alert its 30,000 troops in Punjab , a move described by Islamabad as "" threatening "" .
"" I have already seen two wars "" between India and Pakistan in 1965 and 1971 , said Abdul Lateef , a shopkeeper .
"" In both these wars I lost everything . ""
This time he 's taking no chances .
He has decided to send his wife and children along with all their valuable belongings to a safer location away from the border , and all the 150 families in his village are doing likewise .
"" People think that maybe India will attack Punjab and attack Lahore because it is very close to the border .
Maybe the next war between India and Pakistan will start here . ""
According to local Pakistani officials , people from more than 80 border villages have left their homes .
Only the men have stayed behind for what is an important planting season .
While India blames Pakistan for provoking the conflict by sending a force of Islamic militants and army regulars to seize strategic heights along a northern segment of the demarcation line in Kashmir , the border villagers in Pakistani Punjab accuse New Delhi of being responsible for the hostilities .
"" It is India that is to blame , "" said Mohammed Ishaq , "" because they have not given freedom to the people of Kashmir and it is because of this that there are wars .
""
Although life at the Wagah border crossing appears relatively normal , with long - distance buses and foreign tourists going through , western military sources confirm reports of military preparations on both sides of the Punjab border .
On the Indian side they say artillery batteries , tanks and infantry have been deployed , while in Pakistan some tank and first - aid units have been put in the field .
It has also been confirmed that Pakistan has positioned anti - aircraft guns at major airports and other sensitive locations .
But western military and diplomatic sources believe that these are precautionary measures by both sides and still fall a long way short of a general mobilisation .
Western military sources add , however , that they fear New Delhi may be tempted to give the go - ahead for Indian troops to cross the demarcation line in Kashmir to cut off supply routes of the occupying force and attack its positions from the back , which could spark a much wider conflict ."
1999-07-05,"President Bill Clinton and the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , have reached an agreement under which guerrillas who cross into the Indian - held sections of Kashmir will withdraw , US officials said yesterday .
It came as Indian soldiers captured the strategic Himalayan peak of Tiger Hill after a 10-hour battle against fighters loyal to Pakistan , according to Indian officials .
The agreement at the White House , if carried out , may defuse the worst conflict between India and Pakistan in almost 30 years .
"" It was agreed between the president and the prime minister that concrete steps will be taken for the restoration of the line of control [ between India and Pakistan ] , "" Mr Clinton and Mr Sharif said in a joint statement after three hours of talks in Washington . ""
The president urged an immediate cessation of the hostilities once these steps are taken , "" it added .
Although Pakistan has publicly maintained that it has no control over the guerrillas , US officials said the joint statement meant the insurgents would withdraw to the Pakistani side of the military line dividing the province .
No timetable has been set for this .
India launched an air and ground offensive on May 26 to dislodge what it says are Pakistan army regulars fighting alongside mercenaries who crossed the line of control .
Pakistan insists it has no control over what it says are Muslim militants fighting for freedom in the two - thirds of Kashmir ruled by India .
The Washington joint statement failed to specify who would take the "" concrete steps "" to restore the line of control or to make any explicit acknowledgment that Pakistan might hold some sway over the guerrillas .
The latest conflict between India and Pakistan raised special alarm in Washington because of their tit - for - tat nuclear tests in May 1998 .
In their statement , Mr Clinton and Mr Sharif said they shared the view that the recent conflict was "" dangerous and contains the seeds of a wider conflict "" .
The statement also finessed another issue - India 's long - standing rejection of any outside mediation over Kashmir and Washington 's resulting reluctance to play such a role .
The White House said Mr Clinton had spoken to the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for about 10 minutes yesterday to brief him on the talks .
It is understood that Mr Vajpayee declined to attend the talks ."

1999-07-06,"Withdrawing fighters from the Kashmir frontline with India is "" out of the question "" , several militant Pakistani groups said yesterday , despite the weekend agreement in Washington between the prime minister of Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif , and President Clinton aimed at defusing the Kashmir conflict .
There is concern in Pakistan about the impact on morale in the country 's regular armed forces if a withdrawal takes place , particularly as there has been heavy loss of life in the recent fighting with India in Kashmir .
But the army and the militant Islamic groups seem to be heading for a falling out .
A force apparently comprising elements of both occupied heights along a sector of Indian - administered Kashmir around the town of Kargil in May , sparking a crisis that has taken India and Pakistan - both of which have some nuclear weapons - to the verge of all - out war .
Now senior military sources say that , unlike the Islamists , the army and government are "" at one "" on the Washington agreement .
After the three - hour meeting between the two leaders on Sunday , US officials said they expected forces from Pakistan to leave their positions .
Western sources in Islamabad said they expected to see a change in the situation within the next few days , even though military sources said that details of how a Pakistani withdrawal would be organised had yet to be worked out .
So far no meeting between the Indian and Pakistani army chiefs has been organised , and it is unclear whether India will agree to a ceasefire to allow the Pakistanis to move out .
As news of the deal reached Pakistan yesterday opposition parties condemned it and several of the militant groups which claim to have fighters around Kargil rejected the notion of withdrawal .
Haifiz Mohammed Saeed , leader of the one of the largest militant groups , Lashkar - e - Taiba , said he was "" astonished "" at the deal made during Mr Sharif 's hastily arranged US visit . ""
The Pakistani people will not allow any bargaining on Kargil and the Kashmir issue , "" he said .
"" No government can maintain its rule over Pakistan if it bargains on Kashmir . ""
Other militant groups also warned Mr Sharif that he would not survive as prime minister if he tried to intervene in their affairs .
One of the main Islamic political parties , Jamaat - e - Islami , said it would hold demonstrations today , and accused the prime minister of making a total surrender .
"" This is treachery , "" said Munawwar Hassan , the acting leader of Jamaat - e - Islami .
"" He has betrayed the national interest ... just as the freedom fighters were winning the war and the Indian forces were demoralised . ""
Even the larger opposition parties , such as Benazir Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party , have called on the government to provide details immediately about the prime minister 's talks with Mr Clinton .
So far little has been revealed about the Washington meeting beyond the joint statement issued on Sunday , in which the two leaders announced that they had agreed that "" concrete steps would be taken for the restoration of the line of control "" - the divide between the Pakistani and Indian parts of the disputed region .
If , as is widely assumed , a withdrawal of Pakistani forces is intended , this could prove catastrophic for the government . ""
Without a quid pro quo with the Indians agreeing to look into the right of self - determination for the Kashmiri people within a specific time frame ... this [ agreement ] sounds like a recipe for suicide , "" said one observer .
It will also be particularly difficult to sell to the country , given that ever since the incursion took place in May , the Pakistani government has denied reports that its regular army is involved .
It also denied that it has any control over the militants , whom it described as "" indigenous Kashmiri freedom fighters "" .
But western diplomats and US state department officials have been increasingly blunt in their briefings in recent weeks , saying there was a well planned military operation involving hundreds of Pakistani troops who crossed the line of control into Indian administered territory along with a number of Islamic fighters .
Hundreds have died in the past two months of fighting , and the western powers have been threatening Pakistan with financial penalties , apparently leaving Mr Sharif feeling that he had no choice but to rush to Washington to do a deal , humiliating though this will be on Pakistan 's streets ."
1999-07-08,"An alliance of the main Muslim militant groups fighting Indian forces in Jammu and Kashmir yesterday rejected appeals by the United States to withdraw from positions inside Indian territory .
The appeals were made after an agreement in Washington last weekend between President Bill Clinton and the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif .
It was aimed at defusing the escalating crisis between Pakistan and India which erupted in May , when strategic positions in northern Kashmir were occupied by what India describes as "" Pakistani - backed infiltrators "" .
But in Islamabad yesterday the chairman of the Jihad Council , Sayed Salahuddin , described the Washington agreement as a "" betrayal "" of the Kashmiri people and an "" international conspiracy "" .
"" Our action against the Indian forces in Kargil will continue until the last drop of our blood , "" he said .
"" We will remain as long as the weather and our supplies allow us to . ""
He said nothing would deflect them from achieving "" freedom for the people of Kashmir "" from Indian rule .
Mr Salahuddin claimed there were more than 1,000 fighters - including many Pakistanis and some Afghans - holding strategic mountain positions around Kargil , Drass and Batalik in the north of Indian - administered Kashmir .
The militant groups deny they have been driven out of key positions overlooking the main road after the massive counter - offensive launched by Indian forces two months ago .
They also say their capture of high ground around Kargil represents a new military strategy .
Instead of their hit - and - run guerrilla tactics since the insurgency started 11 years ago , they plan to occupy Indian - administered territory .
The rejection of the Washington agreement leaves Mr Sharif in a difficult position .
Faced with heavy international pressure and the threat of all - out war , he needed a formula to defuse the tension .
Most of the occupying forces in northern Kashmir are widely believed to be regular Pakistani soldiers who could be given the order to pull back .
And the army chief has said there is no difference of opinion between the political and military leadership over Kargil -once
a withdrawal has been worked out .
But the division of Kashmir is an emotive issue for many Pakistanis , who believe none of the Muslim - majority territory should remain in Indian hands .
Any agreement to withdraw from areas seized militarily will not be easy to sell . ""
Nawaz Sharif ca n't win on this one , "" said one diplomat .
"" His days may be numbered . """
1999-07-12,"Faced with mounting international isolation and military reverses on the ground , Pakistan announced yesterday that forces which had captured ice - capped ridges in India 's portion of the disputed territory of Kashmir had begun to withdraw .
The announcement should bring to an end one of the most dangerous confrontations between the two nuclear powers in nearly 30 years , and followed a crucial meeting of top military officials from both countries earlier in the day .
It comes a week after Pakistan 's prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , agreed with President Clinton in Washington to take "" concrete steps "" to defuse the tension , which had taken India and Pakistan to the brink of all - out war and which raised international concern about a nuclear confrontation .
In a statement issued in Islamabad , Pakistan 's foreign minister , Sartaj Aziz , said that the "" disengagement "" was already under way "" satisfactorily "" in one sector of Northern Kashmir , near Kargil , and that more fighters would be pulled out from a second area by the end of the day .
A spokesman for the Pakistan army said he expected that all forces would pull out of Kargil , Dras and Batalik within two weeks .
But the main Muslim organisations fighting in Kashmir pledged to "" fight to the last "" rather than withdraw from territory captured from Indian forces .
When questioned on exactly which mojahedin groups had agreed to disengage , Mr Aziz was unable to elaborate .
In New Delhi , officials confirmed that the fighting , which India says has claimed some 330 of its own soldiers and nearly 700 Pakistanis since mid - May , was nearing an end .
"" We have evidence a withdrawal is already taking place , "" said Brijesh Mishra , the national security adviser .
Meanwhile , the Indian army re - opened the sole road route through the region to civilian traffic .
Last night 's announcements followed a meeting between Pakistani and Indian generals at Attari , on the Indian side of the Punjab border .
Although the generals continued their regular weekly telephone calls during the fighting , this was the first face - to - face meeting since May 26 , when New Delhi unleashed its air force against some 800 intruders .
Officials in New Delhi gave no details of a ceasefire or a phased plan for withdrawal .
However , Mr Mishra said India would not attack the departing forces . ""
The Indian army has no tradition of shooting at the backs of people , "" he said .
With India 's recapture on Friday of the Batalik and Dras ranges , scene of the bloodiest encounters of the border war , the fighting is expected to wind down completely within a few days .
However , there was no move in either country towards talks that could prevent a future conflagration over Kashmir , which was divided between India and Pakistan 50 years ago , and is claimed in its entirety by both countries .
For the last decade , separatist militants have been fighting New Delhi 's rule over the Kashmir valley , and India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the fighters .
New Delhi 's foreign ministry yesterday reaffirmed there would be no talks until all the intruders were gone .
There is little sign in India of a willingness to abandon the high rhetoric of war for the slow , hard grind of making peace .
On Saturday , even as the withdrawal began from Dras and Batalik , the Indian prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , appeared keen to make capital from the costly military campaign . ""
Operation Vijay [ Victory ] has given great vijay to the country .
This is a historic moment for all of us .
"" Passions are unlikely to ease in the coming weeks .
Mr Vajpayee 's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party is widely expected to exploit those sentiments to turn a military embarrassment into a victory before the polls .
Yesterday , India 's election commission announced the dates for the country 's general elections , with voting to take place on September 4 , 11 , 17 and 24 and October 1 ."
1999-08-04,"Saudi Arabia appears to be seeking nuclear weapons in a devastating blow for non - proliferation efforts in one of the most heavily - armed regions in the world , it emerged last night .
Suspicions that the Saudis were planning to buy nuclear weapons technology were raised privately in diplomatic circles after the kingdom 's defence minister , Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz , toured Pakistan 's secret nuclear facilities in May.
The prince toured the Kahuta uranium enrichment plant and missile factory with Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif and was briefed by A.Q. Khan , the father of Pakistan 's atom bomb .
Concern was underlined yesterday when a senior British official spoke of of "" concern "" that Saudi Arabia , the most powerful state in the Gulf , may be seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
Peter Hain , the junior foreign officer minister , has been given an expanded brief including nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation .
Last year 's Indo - Pakistani tests and the recent tension over Kashmir have added to long - standing worries about North Korea and Iran . ""
Proliferation has got to be pushed up the agenda in the interests of everyone , "" the official said .
"" What is happening is very serious . ""
Israel , with a nuclear capacity of between 100 and 200 warheads , and the ballistic missiles to deliver them , has kept western governments informed about the nuclear potential of arab and Muslim states .
India is expressing concern about Pakistan developing an "" islamic bomb "" and North Korea is threatening to test - fire a new long - range missile and abandon its agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons programme .
The Kahuta site is so sensitive that the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto has said she was not able to visit the installation during her time in office .
President Clinton is reported to have raised the issue of the spread of nuclear weapons with Sharif when he visited Washington last month for talks on the India - Pakistan crisis over Kashmir .
Diplomatic sources said there was concern Saudi Arabia , the world 's biggest oil producer , might have agreed to finance the Pakistani effort and might try to buy missiles and nuclear know - how .
Pakistan is desperate for for financial aid to prop up its ailing economy ."
1999-08-13,"A funeral ceremony was held in Karachi yesterday for the 16 Pakistani servicemen killed when their navy patrol plane was shot down by Indian fighter aircraft close to the border between the two countries on Tuesday .
There were emotional scenes at the naval air base in the city as the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , who had flown in especially for the ceremony , embraced the bereaved families and later accused India of a "" barbaric and cowardly act "" .
After the coffins , draped in the Pakistani flag , had been loaded onto planes to be flown for burial in their home districts , Mr Sharif told reporters that the shooting down of the plane was "" a very serious violation of all principles , international laws and agreements "" . ""
They shot down a plane which had no capability of doing anything aggressive and it did n't violate Indian airspace .
It was very cowardly , "" he said .
Pakistan 's navy chief , who also attended the ceremony , along with other senior armed forces personnel , accused India of extending the recent conflict over the northern region of Kashmir to the southern border between the two countries .
"" They have succeeded in dragging the Pakistan navy into this conflict , "" he said .
A western diplomat taken to the crash site yesterday said afterwards that there was no doubt that the site was within Pakistan 's territory .
He added "" In my opinion the Indian action was provocative , aggressive and unwarranted "" Just a few weeks ago the two countries , which both have nuclear weapons , came close to their fourth war after heavy fighting erupted in the long - disputed territory of Kashmir .
Pressure from the international community eventually persuaded Pakistan to withdraw the forces which had occupied mountain ridges in Indian - administered Kashmir .
Pakistan was widely regarded as having provoked the fighting in Kashmir , and the shooting down of one of its planes may help Islamabad win back some support from the international community .
The Indian authorities have been forced to admit that most of the wreckage did land on Pakistani territory in Sind .
Earlier India claimed that the plane had intruded up to six miles inside its territory and that all the wreckage had come down in Gujarat state .
It retrieved some debris and paraded before the television cameras in New Delhi .
But Pakistan , which has all along denied that its plane strayed into Indian airspace , accused the Indian air force of using helicopters to "" sneak "" across the border and pick up the debris for the media 's benefit .
Pakistani troops opened fire on other Indian military aircraft which approached the area on Wednesday , including a helicopter carrying a group of journalists from Delhi .
Yesterday Pakistan flew more than 30 diplomats to the crash site to press home the message that the incident was "" unprovoked and unjustifiable aggression "" by India .
It has appealed to the United Nations , the European Union and other countries to act quickly to prevent any further escalation of an already extremely tense situation .
"" We hope the international community will take timely remedial measures to stop India in its tracks , "" its information minister , Mushahid Hussain , said .
"" Because of its belligerence , regional peace is certainly threatened , and with the upcoming elections and power vacuum in the country this threat may escalate if India is not pressured to stop . ""
So far western states have confined themselves to appeals for restraint and for both countries to respect the aviation agreements which require each side to notify the other if any military planes are expected to fly within six miles of the border .
"" We urgently call on both sides to reinstitute this agreement in order to avoid further loss of life and further heightening of tensions , "" the US state department spokesman , James Rubin , said .
But already one of the main Kashmiri militant groups fighting Indian forces in Kashmir , the Hizbul - Mojahedin , has vowed to avenge the shooting down of the plane ."
1999-10-12,"Pakistan 's government has been ousted in a coup , army - controlled television said today .
A message scrolled across the screen saying that prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his cabinet had been dismissed and that the chief of army staff , General Pervaiz Musharaf , would address the nation shortly .
Earlier , troops took control of airports and government buildings throughout the country and the state - run radio and television stations , hours after Mr Sharif had sacked Gen Musharraf .
Troops cordoned off the prime minister in his residence in Islamabad , took over the houses of several other top ministers and seized other government buildings .
The dismissal of Gen Musharraf , a surprise move while the military leader was on a visit to Sri Lanka , follows months of rumours about a possible coup and a number of opposition rallies calling for Mr Sharif 's removal .
Gen Musharraf then flew back to Pakistan and was met by a large contingent of soldiers at the airport in the southern city of Karachi .
Gen Musharraf was in Karachi 's seized television building preparing to deliver his speech , the army information office said .
His dismissal was followed by a rapid movement of army personnel throughout the federal capital and in the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore , Mr Sharif 's hometown .
State - run television abruptly went off the air amid reports from witnesses who had seen army soldiers leap over the fence and go inside the building .
There were reports that Mr Sharif was inside .
After the main television building in the capital Islamabad was seized , hundreds of Pakistanis gathered in the street outside , singing , "" Long live the army . ""
Witnesses said the Pakistani army had also surrounded Islamabad international airport .
Soldiers have taken over the houses of government officials , according to witnesses who saw soldiers lock the gate of the information minister Mushahid Hussein 's house .
In Lahore , soldiers in jeeps and trucks have taken up positions on the main mall road and at government buildings .
Described as an "" early retirement "" on state - run TV , Gen Musharraf 's dismissal took the military by surprise .
He was replaced by General Zia Uddin , head of the country 's secret service and considered a close ally of Mr Sharif .
Before it went off the air , Pakistan Television showed Mr Sharif and Gen Uddin clasping hands as his promotion to army chief was announced .
There was no immediate reason for the army chief 's dismissal , but in recent weeks there have been reports of a yawning rift between the army and the civilian government .
Gen Musharraf 's term as army chief was to end in April 2000 .
The rift between Mr Sharif and Gen Musharraf developed after Mr Sharif ordered militants to withdraw this summer from Indian territory in the Kargil region ending a bitter two - month border dispute with India .
Many feared the border dispute would escalate into an all - out war between the two nuclear enemies .
The withdrawal was negotiated between Mr Sharif and US President Bill Clinton , but it reportedly did not have the support of the army chief , who many western analysts say orchestrated the takeover of Indian territory in Kargil .
After today 's events India 's army went on a state of high alert along the border , a senior officer in India 's northern command in Kashmir said .
In New Delhi , Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee held a crisis meeting with his top security and foreign policy advisers .
The reports from Pakistan "" are causing grave concern , "" said Mr Vajpayee 's spokesman , Ashok Tandon ."
1999-10-13,"General Musharraf General Musharraf is a former commando and is regarded by his fellow officers as an independent - minded general , and a straight talker .
That was not how Nawaz Sharif saw it .
The Pakistani prime minister promoted Gen Musharraf over two more senior generals to the post of army chief last October , thinking he would prove more pliant than his predecessor .
Last month , he was so confident of his man that he extended Gen Musharraf 's term on the joint chiefs of staff committee until 2001 .
As last night 's events show , Mr Sharif miscalculated .
Gen Musharraf is a rarity among the senior ranks in the Pakistani army .
He is not from Punjab , Pakistan 's largest and most politically dominant province , but from the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh .
An Urdu - speaking Mohajir , he migrated to Pakistan after independence in 1947 , leaving several cousins and other relatives behind in India .
But while Gen Musharraf did not in the end prove to be easily tamed , the unorthodox nature of his promotion - which made other senior generals jealous - and his ethnic minority status within the forces probably made him more cautious .
When Gen Musharraf took over last year , the army was fuming over the manner of the departure of General Jehangir Karamat , who was forced to retire only months before his scheduled date after incuring Mr Sharif 's wrath for daring to criticise his government .
From the outset , Gen Musharraf is believed to have shared Gen Karamat 's concerns : that Pakistan must be saved from the misrule of civilian government by a power - sharing arrangement .
During his tenure , Gen Musharraf had the army take on the role of a collection agency , tracking down defaulters - including cabinet minis ters - in an effort to haul Pakistan 's electricity board out of an economic morass .
Gen Karamat , however , proved unwilling to intervene directly in government , choosing to stand down rather than mount a fully - fledged coup when his confrontation with Mr Sharif came to a head .
Gen Musharraf chose a path that is more familiar to Pakistan 's generals who have ruled directly for 25 years since independence .
Prime minister Nawaz Sharif
Even as Pakistan descended into economic chaos and sectarian violence , the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , held his nerve , repairing each Saturday to his home town of Lahore to play cricket .
The matches , inevitably rigged in favour of the portly prime minister , became a symbol of his concentration on securing his own power rather than addressing the economic and political crises in Pakistan .
Although Mr Sharif won a landslide victory in February 1997 elections , from the start he behaved like a man under siege .
His first term as prime minister ended in sacking , and he appeared determined to last the full five years this time .
He began by removing the powers of the president to dismiss elected government , and then forced out the ouster of the president - the chief justice of the supreme court - and the army chief .
Along the way , his cronies launched an anti - corruption investigation to secure convictions against his main opponent , Benazir Bhutto , who promptly decamped to London .
Earlier this year , Mr Sharif moved to silence the last sources of dissent , cracking down on the press and those who dared oppose him within his own party .
Mr Sharif is now surrounded by a tight inner circle dominated by his brother and father and centred around the vast family estate near Lahore .
The opulence of the estate - and the astronomical growth of the family firm , Ittefaq Industries , since Mr Sharif 's entry into politics - have fuelled allegations of corruption ."

1999-10-13,"The Pakistani army 's "" dismissal "" of Nawaz Sharif , the country 's prime minister who won office in a landslide election victory in February , 1997 , represents another dismaying milestone in the troubled history of Pakistan .
It is a blow to democracy , a blow to Pakistan 's image abroad , and a blow to those who hope for peace in the Subcontinent , most especially between Pakistan and India .
Most of all , it is a blow against the mass of the Pakistani people who do not deserve , and can not afford , the instability , isolation , and economic problems that may follow this retrograde and deplorable step .
The coup comes 22 years after General Zia ul - Haq employed similar means to overthrow the then prime minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , father of Benazir .
Gen Zia announced a programme of national Islamisation and subsequently placed Mr Bhutto on trial .
In the teeth of an international outcry , Mr Bhutto was hanged in 1979 .
As the armed forces tightened their control over Pakistan 's cities last night , Mr Sharif appeared to be under house arrest .
If this latest military takeover proves to have been bloodless , then for that small mercy , we suppose we should be thankful .
But the Pakistani plotters should make no mistake : what ever Mr Sharif 's failings , there must be no repeat of the Bhutto horror .
Mr Sharif 's downfall came quick on the heels of his decision to sack the current army chief , General Pervez Musharraf .
This move , which has now so spectacularly backfired , is almost certainly linked to last summer 's ill - advised incursions by Islamic militants , aided and abetted by the Pakistani army , into Indian - held areas of Kashmir around the town of Kargil .
As the confrontation seemed to be spiralling out of control , amid heated talk of an all - out war between these two nuclear - capable nations , Mr Sharif flew to Washington and sought US mediation .
This was rejected by India but Mr Sharif , now with strong support from President Bill Clinton , prevailed upon his army to pull back .
India unwisely proclaimed a great victory , the Pakistani army fumed , and Mr Sharif became the subject of fierce public criticism at home .
Rumours of coup plots have been circulating ever since .
None of which can excuse the military 's foolhardy action .
Even now , it is not too late .
Gen Musharraf should sit down with Mr Sharif , sort out their differences , and then lead his troops back to barracks ."
1999-10-13,"Pakistan , the world 's newest nuclear power , last night appeared to be in the hands of a hawkish army general , whom the prime minister had attempted to dismiss just hours before .
After a day of high drama , hundreds of soldiers surrounded the homes of the Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his cabinet last night , before a message on national television screens announced that the government had been dismissed in what appeared to have been a clinically executed military coup .
The announcement said the sacked army chief , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , would address the nation in a broadcast speech .
Yesterday 's developments sent shockwaves through the diplomatically unstable region .
India 's army went on a state of high alert along the border , and in New Delhi , Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee held a crisis meeting with his security and foreign policy advisers .
The reports from Pakistan were "" causing grave concern , "" said Mr Vajpayee 's spokesman .
Robin Cook , the foreign secretary , said Britain would "" strongly condemn any unconstitutional actions by the army "" .
The foreign office urged all Britons in Pakistan to adopt a low profile following unconfirmed reports of shooting and general unrest in Islamabad .
The United States described the situation as "" fluid "" and expressed concern at the growing crisis .
The crisis unfolded after the prime minister sacked Gen Musharraf , who was at a conference in Sri Lanka .
In his place he planned to appoint Lt - Gen Ziauddin - the director general of the Inter Services Intelligence agency , the Pakistani secret service .
However , minutes before the prime minister was due to make an address from the PTV state television station in Islamabad at around 7 pm , a squad of soldiers arrived at the gates .
The police on guard refused to let them enter but they returned with reinforcements and a section of around a dozen men , in full battledress , climbed over the locked gates of the PTV station .
The commanding officer could be heard ordering them to "" take it over "" .
The police , including members of the prime minister 's special protection team , put down their weapons .
Shortly afterwards , screens went blank as the TV station was taken off the air .
Simultaneously , troops moved to secure Islamabad airport 10 miles outside the city and key administrative sites .
Soldiers also arrived at the private homes of the prime minister and many of his political allies , including that of his brother , Shabhaz , the influential chief minister of Punjab province , and the presi dent , Rafiq Tarar , a Sharif loyalist .
The airport and TV station in the southern port city of Karachi were also seized .
The governor of Pakistan 's central bank announced a bank holiday today in an apparent attempt to prevent an outflow of foreign exchange .
The exiled Pakistani opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto , blamed Mr Sharif for provoking the coup .
"" Ever since Nawaz Sharif took over he has sought to dismantle democracy , "" Ms Bhutto , who is in London , told Sky News . ""
The people believe the man is violating every rule of law . ""
"" The armed forces had to protect themselves as an institution , "" said Ms Bhutto , who faces arrest on her return home after being convicted of corruption .
The rift between Mr Sharif and Gen Musharraf began when the prime minister ordered militants to withdraw this summer from Indian territory in the Kargil region of Kashmir , ending a two - month border dispute with India .
The withdrawal was negotiated between Mr Sharif and President Clinton , but it reportedly did not have the support of the army chief , who many western analysts say orchestrated the takeover of Indian territory in Kargil .
The mood in Islamabad last night was tense but crowds were still on the streets around the main government buildings .
The majority appeared relieved at the news of the coup .
Hundreds gathered in the streets shouting "" Long live the army "" .
The Pakistani army has a history of interventions and has ruled in the country for 25 years of its 52-year history . ""
For the poor people , this is very good , "" said Aktar Baksh , 24 , a student from Karachi .
"" For the high - ups and the bureaucrats it is very bad .
We are happy , happy , happy . ""
"" Nawaz is in deep trouble now , "" said Ghous Barqah , a farmer from the southern province of Sindh .
"" The army has principles .
The soldiers will sort everything out . """
1999-10-13,"A coup d'etat is by definition a sudden , startling event but this week 's military take - over in Pakistan was utterly and drearily unsurprising to anyone who has been watching that country closely .
The military in Pakistan is a bedrock state institution ; without at least its acquiescence little gets done or decided .
Prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's increasing reliance on the army to perform tasks from inspecting electric meters to administering justice in special courts has caused severe anxiety since at least the beginning of the year .
"" The writing is there on the wall , the way the army is being involved is a controlled form of martial law , "" warned Group Capt Cecil Chaudhry , a retired and much - respected air force officer , in February . ""
[ This ] is precisely how a tiger becomes a man - eater .
This is how all our martial laws have happened .
"" It 's not as though there 's Bonapartism in the army , "" he added .
"" It 's the failure of civilians . ""
Others might dispute the first part of this assertion by pointing out that General Pervez Musharraf , the army chief who responded to his sacking by executing a swift and bloodless coup , is a proud , ambitious man disinclined to shrink from confrontation .
But few dispute that Mr Sharif is the architect of his own demise .
Many soldiers felt betrayed and humiliated after Mr Sharif made a snap visit to Washington in July and agreed to withdraw forces from the Indian - held side of the Line of Control in disputed Kashmir . ""
The army will obey the government , "" said Khalid Masood , a columnist for the Urdu - language daily Khabrain , at the time .
"" But not with their hearts . ""
By sacking two army chiefs in a year , Mr Sharif knew that he was playing with fire .
During his two - and - a - half years in power , he systematically undermined every institution that might have served as an alternative power centre to his own small coterie .
He instigated a showdown with the judiciary that culminated in the storming of the supreme court building by a ruling - party mob ; stripped the president of his constitutional power to dismiss a government ; replaced the chief justice of the supreme court , the president , the army chief , and an acting chief election commissioner .
He forbade members of parliament to vote against their own parties ; and bullied the press .
He got away with every brazen move - except the last .
Mr Sharif 's initiatives now look more desperate than bold .
"" This prime minister has amassed more powers to himself , and is still weaker than any other in history , "" a Western diplomat said earlier this year .
The leaders of Pakistan 's liberal elite understand only too well the inevitable role their country 's military plays .
"" Thirteen years of direct military rule in this country did teach them an important lesson , "" said Maleeha Lodhi , editor of the News , a leading English - language daily .
""
But I think [ the military ] see a country that is like a ship full of holes .
They are on the same ship . ""
"" There is no easy solution , ' said Najam Sethi , editor of the Friday Times .
"" Pure , unadulterated , unrestrained civilian rule has been disastrous , just as pure , unadulterated , unrestrained military rule has not worked .
What we really need now is a combination of the two , led by people in both the military and the civilian hierarchy .
Both have to be accountable .
There 's been no accountability of either in the past . ""
But with both Mr Sharif and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto thoroughly discredited and disgraced , and no other credible civilian leader visible , the military this time will be on its own .
And Pakistan 's history shows that the only time the country has suffered more than under civilian governments has been under military rule .

1999-10-13,"There is a grisly inevitability about the latest military coup in Pakistan , and about the apathetic acceptance of it by the people .
After all , the Pakistan army has been pulling the strings of power for so long that it does n't really matter whether the top general sits in the presidential palace or stays in barracks .
The excuse this time is that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was egregiously corrupt and that he was driving the national economy to the brink of collapse .
True , on both counts .
But the real reason General Pervez Musharraf took over was that he was about to be replaced as army chief .
Sharif was due to make the announcement on national TV yesterday evening , which is why the army took over the television station and closed it down .
Crude certainly , but effective .
Armies are like that : when threatened , they protect themselves by brute force .
Not that force was needed in this latest arrogant power play .
When the troops turned up , the police evaporated .
The TV people did what they were told .
Sharif and his cronies submitted to house arrest .
Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan , who perfectly personify Pakistan 's shallow and cynical democracy , had nothing to offer save criticism of Sharif .
The sad , dangerous fact is that Pakistan is not a nation .
That it exists is incontestable , and the vast majority of those within its arbitrary borders want it to exist .
But that begs the question : why is it there ?
In the beginning , Pakistan was supposed to be a homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent .
It was manifestly nothing of the kind , even when the British , in their unseemly haste to be rid of responsibility , simply carved north - west India and East Bengal out of the imperial map , and condemned their subjects to the appalling slaughter which accompanied partititon .
East Bengal - Bangladesh - has gone .
India has an enormous Muslim minority .
Fewer than a third of subcontinental Muslims now live in Pakistan .
They live in a country born without identity or institutions - except for an army which was , and remains , only too willing to fill the vacuum of power .
The people are divided ethnically , linguistically and - this is not enough understood - religiously .
There are obvious fault lines between Baluchis , Pathans , Punjabis and Sindhis , and between all of them and the Mohajirs , the refugees from India .
But the most dangerous divide of all is between the majority Sunni Muslims and the 20 % or so Shi'ite minority .
The army , ominously , carries two deep infections .
One is corruption on a grand scale .
Over the years , the military establishment has built a business empire , trading in everything from cement to heroin .
God help any civilian with the temerity to interfere .
The second infection is Islamist fundamentalism , particularly virulent in the secretive intelligence branch , the ISI , which has sponsored every kind of crazed intervention in Kashmir and Afghanistan , and which has inflicted on the latter country its latest monstrous God - child , the Taliban .
These are the people now ruling Pakistan in the name of national unity and sacred duty , and who now have their finger on a nuclear trigger .

1999-10-13,"As the world waited anxiously for general Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's new military strongman , to reveal his intentions , the International Monetary Fund today threatened to cut off vital funding to Pakistan unless Islamabad restored democracy .
Asked if the IMF should give money to the military rulers who seized power from prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a coup yesterday , managing director Michel Camdessus said , "" I hope that developments in Pakistan will lead to a democratic normalisation of the situation . ""
If not , he added , credit should be withheld .
Pakistan can ill afford to lose billions of dollars in foreign loans .
This summer agreements were finalised with international banks to renew $ 877 m ( £ 554 m ) in commercial loans and with western governments to roll over $ 3.3bn ( £ 2bn ) in loans from country creditors .
But the deals have not been ratified and they could unravel in the absence of an elected government .
"" We were about to finish a negotiation with prime minister Sharif , "" Mr Camdessus said .
"" We made conditions that have not yet been met to unblock our money . ""
Payments from the latest IMF credit approved in 1997 were delayed before the coup because of doubts about economic conditions and a dispute over the role of independent energy companies .
The IMF loan stalled initially after the US led moves to impose sanctions after Pakistan tested nuclear bombs .
Mr Camdessus said he was concerned about the coup because Pakistan was "" in that hot belt of the world , it is a country that is nuclear , Islamic , very populated , a neighbour of another country [ India ] that is also very populated . ""
As if to underline his concerns , India 's army went on alert after the coup , although no unusual Pakistani troop movements were seen near the border .
India 's prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee , speaking moments after being sworn into office for another term , affirmed India 's desire for good relations with Pakistan "" based on mutual trust and confidence "" .
But he said it was up to Pakistan "" to create the right environment "" and that India was "" concerned about developments .
We wish the people of Pakistan well .
We remain committed to developing friendly and cooperative ties with Pakistan . ""
Indian analysts said the military takeover of Pakistan , headed by a general they consider to be a hardliner , would set back efforts to revive peace talks over the disputed territory of Kashmir .
Negotiations were frozen this summer by two months of armed conflict between the two new nuclear powers near the town of Kargil .
Mr Sharif 's decision to withdraw Pakistani troops which had seized disputed territory and the discontent it provoked among the military sowed the seeds for his downfall .
India believes the Pakistani incursion into Kashmir was masterminded by Gen Musharraf .
Mr Sharif was placed under house arrest hours after announcing the dismissal of General Musharraf as his army chief .
In a television address last night , Gen Musharraf said he had acted as a last resort after Mr Sharif had "" systematically destroyed "" the nation 's institutions .
The Pakistani public greeted news of the army take - over and Mr Sharif 's dismissal with either indifference or joy .
In Islamabad , hundreds of people gathered outside the television station , chanting slogans supporting the army .
Crowds in Mr Sharif 's home town of Lahore celebrated in the streets .
Zahid Chaudhry , a shopowner , denounced Mr Sharif 's rule , saying : "" We gave him votes hoping that because he was a businessman he would improve our economy , but the situation just went from bad to worse . ""
Imran Khan , the Pakistani star cricketer turned politician , said : "" The only thing that stood in the way of Sharif becoming a complete dictator , because already it was not a democratic government - it was really a fascist government - was the army and he was trying to manipulate the army to get his man on top .
I guess the army just struck back . ""
He added : "" The saddest thing is that everyone in this country has welcomed the army .
People are really happy , there is not one person protesting against the coup . ""
Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , who was twice thrown out of power with the connivance of the army , welcomed Mr Sharif 's dismissal , saying that yesterday "" will be remembered not as the day democracy died , but rather the day that it began to be reborn "" ."
1999-10-13,"For many Pakistanis , last night 's events were inescapable and preordained : the coup was the revenge of generals who had been forced to make a humiliating retreat from the border war with India last July .
But Pakistan 's generals have been nursing a grudge against their political masters for much longer - ever since the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , took on one of their own .
In October last year Mr Sharif forced the then army chief , General Jehangir Karamat , into early retirement .
But yesterday 's events make it clear that the military was not prepared to countenance the sacrifice of another of their generals so soon , nor was Gen Pervez Musharraf , the present army chief , the type to walk away from a showdown .
Within minutes of the announcement of the retirement - a euphemism for sacking - of Gen Musharraf , a coup was under way .
In Pakistan , where no civilian government has completed its term since martial law ended in 1985 , it was a moment many had been dreading .
For weeks , the atmosphere of extreme suspicion between Mr Sharif and Gen Musharraf has been an all - consuming topic of conversation .
In the capital , Islamabad , speculation about a coup was taken very seriously .
As Pakistan is now the world 's newest nuclear power , it has also worried Washington .
On September 20 , a US state department official said that America would "" strongly oppose any attempt to change the government through extra - constitutional means "" .
Amid the rumours , Mr Sharif began shoring up his defences .
The Pakistani prime minister , who has ruthlessly crushed all sources of dissent since coming to power in February 1997 , had long been intriguing to get rid of the quarrelsome general .
According to intelligence sources in Pakistan , Mr Sharif has requested Gen Musharraf 's resignation on at least four occasions since July , each time without success .
The immediate trigger for the showdown lies in the two month - long conflict with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir this summer .
Mr Sharif has attempted to disown the actions of Pakistani - based forces in intruding over the Line of Control marking the border with Indian - controlled Kashmir .
His efforts were bound to infuriate Gen Musharraf , who feared he would have to shoulder the blame for a military adventure that went horribly wrong .
Military misadventure
When the conflict erupted last May , it appeared that Pakistan had stolen a march on its rival , India , through an act of military brilliance .
In the dead of winter , when temperatures fall to 50 below zero , Pakistani - based forces - including Islamic militants as well as regular troops - sneaked across the mountains to the Indian side and took over bunkers abandoned to the elements by their enemy .
By the time the spring thaw arrived , and a slumbering Indian army slowly realised the extent of the infiltration , Pakistani gunners already had their artillery and rockets trained on the town of Kargil , and on India 's sole road route through the region .
For the military establishment , this plan had another distinct advantage , it stopped the peace process launched in February by Mr Sharif and the Indian prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
A weekend summit in Lahore suggested that both men genuinely seemed to desire peace .
This notion was deeply threatening to the Pakistani military .
But the generals ' tactics foundered .
Instead of their manoeuvres in Kashmir conflict focusing international attention on the 50-year dispute over the territory , which is claimed by both countries , it caused consternation about the prospects of a full - scale war between the world 's two newest nuclear powers .
Washington and much of the rest of the world supported India 's demand that the Pakistani forces retreat to their side of the Line of Control .
For Mr Sharif , faced with a $ 32bn ( £ 19.4bn ) foreign debt and a veiled threat from the International Monetary Fund to withhold the loans which were keeping the economy afloat , there was little alternative but to withdraw .
On July 12 , he appeared on national television to declare he was not willing to play "" this game of blood and fire "" that had consumed both India and Pakistan since independence in 1947 .
As the speech was broadcast in Lahore , Mr Sharif 's hometown , knots of men watched grim - faced . ""
No one will accept this decision , "" said one office worker .
"" This could affect his political career also .
People all over the country they are very crazy about Kashmir . ""
For much of the last decade , Pakistan 's intelligence agencies have helped to train and arm Kashmiri separatist militants .
Nightly newscasts on state television show wailing Kashmiri women being tortured by Indian troops .
But in the weeks since his speech , Mr Sharif has sought to distance himself from the war .
Mr Sharif 's allies began to put about the story that he had been duped by his generals , who had deliberately concealed the extent of their ambitions at Kargil .
The generals disputed this .
In July , Gen Musharraf took the extraordinary step of telling a BBC news crew : "" Everybody was on board . ""
During one of the pair 's stormy meetings last month , Gen Musharraf went even further , saying that if Mr Sharif was uninformed about Kargil he had only himself to blame .
The army chief claimed he had given detailed briefings of his war plans to the head of the Inter - Services Intelligence , Lieutenant - General Ziauddin .
Gen Ziauddin is one of Mr Sharif 's most trusted allies , and was announced as Gen Musharraf 's successor just hours before the coup began .
Even before last night 's events , Gen Ziauddin had been touted as Mr Sharif 's choice to head the armed forces- largely for his pliability - but it was also foreseen that any attempt to remove Gen Musharraf would rebound on the prime minister .
Coup rumours ""
The army will resent this like hell , "" a retired general said .
In Pakistan , rumours of a coup are always close to the surface .
In recent years , however , the all - powerful army has seldom deigned to intervene directly in politics , although they have been critical of the civilian government .
But Mr Sharif did much to test that resolve , presiding over an economy in a tailspin while retaining his penchant for grandiose public spending projects .
In July , he tried to deflect attention from his Kargil climbdown by announcing a billion dollar plan to build 500,000 homes for the poor .
Yet last month the electricity company cut off the power supply to the finance ministry for non - payment of bills .
That economic debacle is just part of the inheritance Mr Sharif has left for his country 's generals .
They may discover in the weeks ahead that it is his own way of exacting revenge ."
1999-10-14,"General Pervez Musharraf , the army commander in charge of Tuesday 's coup in Pakistan , was desperately searching yesterday for a way out of imposing martial law on the country .
As Washington , the UN and the International Monetary Fund condemned the army 's actions in ousting the prime minister Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan appeared to be in limbo .
General Musharraf spent yesterday closeted in a series of meetings with politicians and senior military officers in an increasingly frantic bid to find a constitutional solution to the current crisis .
Last night he held talks with the president , Rafiq Tarar , who is a Sharif loyalist , in their first meeting since the coup on Tuesday .
No details of the talks emerged .
The embattled general had to cancel a statement on his future plans for running the country yesterday , admitting he was not ready .
"" You can very well understand that this is not something that one expects to happen every day and whatever was done it was a spontaneous reaction , actually by the army , to what actions , and wrong action , Mr Nawaz Sharif had taken , "" a military spokesman , Brigadier Rashid Qureshi , said .
If no solution is found it is likely that martial law will have to be declared and the constitution suspended .
That would further damage Pakistan 's credibility overseas .
Yesterday , the US secretary of state Madeleine Albright condemned the actions of the Pakistani military .
"" We expect them to return to democratic rule and want to hear what their plans are , "" she said .
"" I want to make it absolutely clear that military takeovers of this kind make it difficult to carry on business as usual . ""
She added that it had created "" a new level of uncertainty "" on the subcontinent .
In separate statements by Finland , which currently holds the presidency of the European Union , and the executive body of the 15-member bloc , the EU deplored the army takeover and called for a rapid return to civilian rule .
As Pakistan 's most important trading partner , the EU said it was "" deeply concerned about the implications for regional stability in South Asia "" .
Last night , the IMF made it clear that the talks it had been holding with Mr Sharif on future loans to the heavily - indebted country were now in abeyance and that discussions were effectively suspended until democracy was restored .
Facing international economic isolation , Pakistan was calm yesterday as the country woke up to life under a military regime .
Members of Mr Sharif 's family claimed that the ousted prime minister is being held in a government guesthouse close to Islamabad airport , on the outskirts of the capital city .
There was no sign that he or the scores of other senior political figures being held are likely to be released soon .
The prime minister 's brother Shabhaz , the chief minister of Punjab province , and Lieutenant - General Khawaja Ziauddin , whose promotion to replace Gen Musharraf sparked the coup , are still in what the army described as "" protective custody "" .
The atmosphere in Islamabad yesterday was almost bizarrely calm with most people going about their business as usual .
Though the governor of the state bank of Pakistan , prompted by the army , had declared a bank holiday , most businesses were open .
Only civil servants were being prevented from entering their offices by the military .
The stock exchange in the southern city of Karachi remained shut , its gates guarded by troops .
Pakistan has been governed by soldiers for almost half of its 52-year history .
Its last period under military rule ended in August 1988 with the death of General Zia ul - Haq ."
1999-10-14,"Pakistan is , once again , in the throes of a serious crisis .
The country is under martial law .
The elected prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , his brother , Shahbaz and General Ziaudin , the head of Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) are under house arrest .
Ever since its foundation in 1947 , the Pakistani state has been plagued by a failure to establish strong democratic institutions .
The reason is simple .
From 1951 onwards , when the country had become a US pawn in the cold war , Washington felt that the army was the best guarantor of Washington 's interests in the region .
General Ayub Khan 's dictatorship ( 1958 - 68 ) was openly backed by the US state department , till it was swept aside by a popular uprising that lasted three months .
General Zia 's monstrous regime ( 1977 - 89 ) was spawned by the Pentagon and the Defense Intelligence Agency , eager for a proxy to take on the Russians in Afghanistan .
For the third time in its traumatic history , the army has seized power , this time , apparently , against the advice of the US .
The people - disillusioned , apathetic , weary - appear indifferent to the fate of their venal politicians .
There is widespread disgust at the inability of successive governments to control the scale of corruption .
For several years now , the decay at the heart of the administration had become a national scandal .
Politicians were so busy lining their own pockets that they had little time to ponder the welfare of the country and its people .
In 1997 a palace coup , orchestrated by her own hand - picked president , removed Benazir Bhutto .
It was alleged that she and her husband , Senator Asif Zardari , had used Prime Minister 's House to amass a large private fortune , estimated at somewhere close to $ 1bn .
In the subsequent general elections , her long - time opponent , Nawaz Sharif scored a triumph , winning 80 % of the seats in parliament , but on the basis of an exceptionally low turn - out .
Only 25 % of the electorate bothered to vote .
Benazir 's supporters punished her by staying at home .
The new government had promised a great deal , but nothing changed .
The country continued to rot .
Pakistan has never been able to provide the bulk of its population with either free education or health , but in the past it could offer food to the poor at subsidised prices and protect innocent lives from random killings .
No longer .
Everything is falling apart .
A country that spends billions to fund its arsenal of nuclear weapons , forces its poor to eat grass .
The suicide rate among the poor , driven insane by poverty , has risen sharply over the last decade .
Last January a transport worker in Hyderabad , who had not been paid for two years , soaked himself in petrol and set himself alight outside the Press Club .
He left behind a letter : "" I have lost patience .
Me and my fellow workers have been protesting the non - payment of our salaries for a long time .
But nobody takes any notice .
My wife and mother are seriously ill and I have no money for their treatment .
My family is starving and I am fed up with quarrels .
I do n't have the right to live .
I am sure the flames of my body will reach the houses of the rich one day . ""
The Sharif brothers and their father , strong believers in globalisation and neo - liberal economics , helped create an enterprise culture in which they genuinely believed that everything was for sale , including politicians , civil servants and , yes , generals .
There were widespread rumours that , in order to buy time and make yet more money , the Sharif family had provided sackfuls of general - friendly dollars to bolster their support in the army .
A section of the high command was enraged by this civilian interference .
The immediate cause of the latest coup was Sharif 's decision to sack the army chief , General Musharraf while he was on an official visit to Sri Lanka and appoint General Ziaudin in his place .
Just as Pakistan TV was showing Sharif appointing and congratulating the new army chief , the old army pulled the plug and the country 's TV screens went blank .
Ziaudin , as the ISI boss , is the main supplier of the Taliban army in Afghanistan .
He is sympathetic to the fundamentalist cause and loathed by officers , who value the secular side of the army and enjoy drinking whisky to the tune of bagpipes at regimental dinners .
Musharraf 's supporters inside the army moved swiftly .
Once Nawaz Sharif 's instruction that the plane returning the general to Pakistan be diverted to a foreign country was ignored and Musharraf landed at a Karachi Airport secured by the army it became obvious that the government would be toppled .
The bloated Pakistan army - one of the Pentagon 's spoilt brats in Asia - hated becoming a cold war orphan .
"" Pakistan was the condom the Americans needed to enter Afghanistan , "" a retired general told me last year .
"" We 've served our purpose and they think we can just be flushed down the toilet . ""
Last year the army , fearful that a forced rapprochement with India might lead to a relegation of its status and power and a reduction of its budget , played the nuclear card .
This was followed by an adventurous border clash with India in Kashmir during which Pakistan received a severe drubbing .
This increased tensions with the government which tried to pin the entire blame for the botched operation on the army .
Now General Musharraf has seized power in the country , but in changed conditions .
The army is no longer a unified institution .
Well organised groups of Islamic zealots have penetrated its core .
Unlike the older and more traditional religious parties , the Soldiers of the First Four Caliphs , the Soldiers of Muhammed , the Soldiers of Medina and the Volunteers are all hungry for power .
Their preferred model is that of the Taliban and earlier in the year one of their factions seized several villages in the North - West Frontier province and declared the area to be under "" Islamic law "" .
A public destruction of TV sets and dish antennae took place in the village of Zargari .
If such a faction were ever to take over the Pakistan army - and the possibility is not as remote as it seemed a few years ago - then the possession of nuclear weapons would acquire a frightening new significance .
If Washington refuses to tolerate a new dictator , the most likely scenario is a caretaker government staffed by IMF - approved technocrats .
That , too , will achieve little , for the only serious and rational alternative to domestic chaos is a long - term treaty of friendship and trade with India , a new permanent settlement which could form the basis of a larger EU - style confederation of south Asian republics .
For over 50 years , Pakistan has turned its back on India , imagining it could replace its giant neighbour by cultivating links with the gulf states and Saudi Arabia .
The strategy has been a political and economic failure , leaving the country denuded of a skilled labour force and incapable of meeting its own basic needs .
In recent years there have been a few signs in that politicians of the main secular parties were beginning to explore a new economic deal with India .
Pressure from the fundamentalists and the army sent their heads quickly back into the sand .
And yet this remains the only rational solution in the medium term .
All other options are bleak beyond belief .
The ISI - armed fundamentalists are waiting in the wings .
If they decided to split the army it would unleash a bloody civil war , with devastating consequences for the region .
If the politicians of the sub - continent fail to devise a way of living together , they might end up dying together ."
1999-10-14,"Pakistan was facing international economic isolation last night as global financial lenders cut off the new military regime off from financial assistance .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said it had suspended the loan discussions it had been holding before the coup with Pakistan 's prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , and said talks would not resume until democracy was restored .
Pakistan owes $ 32bn ( £ 19bn ) to its international creditors .
Although it recently persuaded international donors to roll over $ 3.3bn in soft loans , those agreements have yet to be ratified and could easily unravel .
"" We were negotiating with prime minister Sharif and had made certain conditions which had not been satisfied , "" the IMF 's managing director , Michel Camdessus , said .
"" The IMF is not going to provide aid on its own - so the IMF 's own aid is suspended .
"" Under the new rules of engagement of the World Bank and the IMF , much stricter controls over lending are being exercised with good governance being a key factor in loan packages .
The IMF has been holding talks with the Sharif administration aimed at shoring up Pakistan 's battered economy .
The country is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been struggling to avoid a default on its borrowings in the European bond markets .
Both the IMF and the World Bank have lent funds to Pakistan over a long period .
The World Bank is currently involved in a large - scale loan programme of which $ 2.28bn has been paid .
A further $ 1.3bn of loans was agreed in principle but is now likely to be held in Washington until democracy is restored .
Tuesday 's coup has forced the IMF 's biggest shareholder , the US , to rethink its relations with Pakistan .
The US has lost influence in Pakistan , which during the cold war was one of Washington 's most important military client states .
Joe Lockhart , the White House spokesman , said : "" We call very clearly for the earliest possible restoration of democracy and constitutional rule in Pakistan . ""
The US secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , said that the coup had created "" a new level of uncertainty "" in relations between Pakistan and India . ""
What we hope very much is there is a return to a constitutional system in Pakistan and that we are able to continue the work that we have been doing to deflect the conflict , to get India and Pakistan to talk again about solving the Kashmir problem peacefully .
"" There was widespread recognition in Washington that US attempts to defuse tensions over Kashmir three months ago had directly contributed to the military coup .
Mr Sharif gave in to pressure from President Clinton in July to withdraw Pakistani military forces from the Indian side of the ceasefire line in Kashmir .
The move was unpopular in Pakistan , especially with the military , and led Mr Sharif to crack down on the opposition , the press and the courts , destabilising his hold on power .
The warning signs of an imminent coup were so strong that on September 21 the Clinton administration warned the Pakistani military not to attempt a seizure of power ."
1999-10-15,"In Islamabad 's Melody Market bazaar , few people were sparing a thought yesterday for Pakistan 's deposed leader , Nawaz Sharif .
"" Look around the market - all the shops are open , and everybody is happy , "" said Mohammed Wasim Qureishi , sales clerk at Abdullah Cloth House , purveyors of permanent press and practical colours .
"" You can see what happened two nights ago .
The army took everything in their hands - the television station and the airport - and since then , have you seen any strikes , or any protest demonstrations ? ""
Apart from a few minutes in the afternoon when soldiers sealed off the national assembly , there was barely a military uniform in sight yesterday on the capital 's broad avenues , and round the country protesters were few and far between .
For Mr Qureishi , and others trying to scrape together a living in this precarious economy , poverty is what they fear , not military dictators .
An orphan aged 20 , who helps support two sisters and four brothers on a monthly salary of 2,800 rupees ( £ 28 ) , Mr Qureishi said he had no reason to stand up for a prime minister who never stood up for him .
Of the army chief now in charge after Tuesday 's anti - Sharif coup he added : "" General Musharraf will work for us . ""
More than half of Pakistan 's 130 m people are below the age of 25 and , like Mr Qureishi , have no memory of the last dictatorship .
That was under General Mohammed Zia ul - Haq from 1977 to 1988 .
"" Our elders told us it was a very painful time , but it never affected me , "" he said .
Zia 's son spoke yesterday of his own hopes to lead the country .
Talking to the Guardian from his home in Rawalpindi , the sprawling garrison city 10 miles from Islamabad , Ejaz ul - Haq said that he was ready to serve his fellow Pakistanis if they called on him . ""
When it is possible , the parliament should be reconvened and decide who should be prime minister , "" he said .
He is deputy chairman of Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League , which has a majority in the national assembly .
"" Dozens of the MPs in my party - around 25 % to 30 % - have already contacted me and said that they would support whatever I plan to do . ""
Mr ul - Haq , 47 , held no official position in the Sharif government .
His family name and his hawkish views have earned him wide backing among the military .
He blamed "" sycophants who surrounded Sharif and fed him bad advice "" for the downfall of the government and said he welcomed the army takeover . ""
It was falling apart here , "" Mr ul - Haq said .
"" If he [ Mr Sharif ] now resigns and allows someone to succeed to his position then we will keep the party , the parliament and democracy intact . ""
But it is unlikely that army leaders will allow the son of a reviled military dictator to take a senior position in any administration . ""
The fallout overseas would be appalling , "" one western diplomat said ."
1999-10-15,"The new military ruler of Pakistan appears , quite literally , to have lost the plot .
Having decided to overthrow the elected government of Nawaz Sharif in "" spontaneous reaction "" to the prime minister 's "" wrong actions "" , General Pervez Musharraf seems to have precious little idea what to do next .
The most egregious ( for the army ) of Mr Sharif 's "" wrong actions "" was his sacking of Gen Musharraf .
The fact that many influential Pakistanis were also fed up with their PM is now used to persuade us that this constitutional vandalism was inspired by a noble and selfless love of country .
Humbug !
Mr Sharif may be a rogue .
But he is an elected rogue .
Gen Musharraf has a lot of medals but no mandate .
He has done the people of Pakistan a great disservice .
To make matters worse , there was plainly no plan to his plot ; good tactics , but no strategy .
Gen Musharraf 's mess will take others a long time to clean up .
The damage , though severe , is not irreparable .
While the military yesterday again postponed a statement on its intentions and troops sealed off parliament , rumours persisted in Islamabad that secret talks would produce a caretaker administration or a government of civilian "" technocrats "" , pending new elections .
It is possible that a Sharif ally , President Rafiq Tarar , whose spokesman claimed the military 's objective was a swift "" rehabilitation of the democratic process "" , will be co - opted to strengthen the appearance of propriety .
Questions also surrounded the possible return of Benazir Bhutto , the London - based , former PM who has been lavish in saccharine praise for the coup .
But for now , deep uncertainty persists .
Little wonder that India is twitchy , Islamic militants are again eyeing the heights of Kashmir , Afghanistan 's Taliban are looking for advantage , the World Bank has suspended loans , and the EU and US are reviewing relations .
Why did Gen Musharraf not give more weight to these predictable consequences before he took his "" spontaneous "" action ?
Unless he sorts his ideas out fast , popular jubilation at Mr Sharif 's fall will disappear as quickly as an IMF loan in a Russian bank .
There is something more sinister , here , too .
The army now claims to have evidence that Mr Sharif was , in effect , a traitor .
Does Gen Musharraf plan to follow General Zia 's example and hang his deposed adversary - as with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979 ?
Foolishness can be forgiven , perhaps , in time ; but not murder ."
1999-10-16,"Pakistan 's coup leader , General Pervez Musharraf , yesterday tried to appease international condemnation by announcing that he was close to the installation of a transitional government .
In cities , people awoke to the army chief 's imposition of a state of emergency early yesterday with the same calm with which they greeted Tuesday night 's coup , and the sacking of the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif .
Most seemed satisfied that Gen Musharraf would soon begin to share power with civilians . ""
Nowadays , in the present day world , you do n't have coups like they used to in Latin America and other countries .
Everyone knows it is so bad for the image of the country , "" said Lieutenant - General Asad Durrani , a former director of Pakistan 's main spy agency , Inter - Services Intelligence .
"" This is something very different . ""
The edict , which makes Gen Musharraf the country 's chief executive officer , is seen as a softer version of martial law , suspending the constitution and national assembly and all political officials except the president , Rafiq Tarar .
However , it does not suspend human rights or replace civilian courts with military ones .
That sets it apart from Pakistan 's last experience of martial law , imposed by General Mohammed Zia ul - Haq in 1977 .
Unlike Gen Zia , who introduced sharia , or religious law , Gen Musharraf is seen as a man unwilling to pander to Pakistan 's Islamists .
"" I think he will take everyone on board , but he is not going to compromise on fundamentalism , "" said a family friend of the general . ""
He will put his foot down against the fundamentalists . ""
But the international community was unprepared yesterday to entertain the contention of most Pakistanis that Gen Musharraf 's intentions are honest , and that good governance is preferable to elected politicians who have repeatedly betrayed the people 's trust with corruption and misrule .
Britain announced that it was suspending economic aid , and a spokesman in Washington said that the White House was considering sanctions .
Gen Musharraf , well aware that a country labouring under a $ 32bn ( £ 20bn ) debt can not afford international isolation , has been careful to acknowledge such concerns .
Yesterday he invited the US ambassador to a 90-minute meeting at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi , which the envoy described as productive .
Gen Musharraf is moving to put together a new government for Pakistan which is expected to shun politicians in favour of technocrats who have career experience outside the country .
Yesterday , he summoned the army 's nine corps commanders to military headquarters in Rawalpindi for talks on a transitional regime . ""
Gen Musharraf said that top priority would be accorded to economic revival , ensuring national integration and good governance , "" said an army statement .
However no mention was made of elections or of the reconstitution of the national assembly and other institutions .
That suggests that Gen Musharraf wants to leave his administration in place for as long as three years , unhindered by politicians in its mission of cleansing public life .
A US diplomat in Islamabad said the general might name the members of the new administration today .
It is almost certain to make the prosecu tion of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats its first task - which would win great public support .
Although the first man on the list is undoubtedly Mr Sharif , Gen Musharraf is expected to embark on a wholesale clean - up campaign , with the eventual aim of banning for life the dozens of politicians and bureaucrats who have looted the country 's coffers .
After two days of uncertainty , in which Pakistan had no government , he is believed to have resorted to military rule with some reluctance , after failing to persuade Mr Sharif and the president to rubber - stamp his coup .
Minutes after Mr Sharif was placed under house arrest on Tuesday night , the prime minister was summoned to a meeting with the commander of Rawalpindi 's 10th corps , Mahmood Ahmed , who spent 12 hours pleading with him to resign .
On Thursday , with no sign of surrender from a prime minister with a penchant for confrontation , Mr Sharif was flown to his home town Lahore .
There he had to face up to his father , Mian Mohammed Sharif , who is seen as the real power behind the throne , but who also failed to persuade him to quit .
Gen Musharraf was similarly thwarted in his efforts to induce Mr Tarar to give a cloak of respectability to his transitional authority .
That left him with no choice but to put Pakistan under army control .
"" I have never known such reluctant coup makers , "" said Gen Durrani ."

Me and my fellow workers have been protesting the non - payment of our salaries for a long time .
But nobody takes any notice .
My wife and mother are seriously ill , and I have no money for their treatment .
My family is starving and I am fed up with quarrels .
I do n't have the right to live .
I am sure the flames of my body will reach the houses of the rich one day . ""
The Sharif brothers and their father , strong believers in neo - liberal economics , helped to create an enterprise culture in which they believed that everything was for sale , including politicians , civil servants and generals .
There were rumours that , in order to buy time and make yet more money , the Sharif family had provided sackfuls of general - friendly dollars to bolster their support in the army .
A section of the high command was enraged by this civilian interference .
The immediate cause of the coup was Sharif 's decision to sack the army chief , General Musharraf , while he was on a visit to Sri Lanka , and appoint General Ziaudin in his place .
Ziaudin , as the ISI boss , is the main supplier of the Taliban army in Afghanistan .
He is sympathetic to the fundamentalist cause and loathed by officers , who value the secular side of the army .
The bloated Pakistan army - one of the Pentagon 's spoilt brats in Asia - hated becoming a cold war orphan .
"" Pakistan was the condom the Americans needed to enter Afghanistan , "" a retired general told me last year .
"" We 've served our purpose , and they think we can just be flushed down the toilet . ""
Last year the army , fearful that a forced rapprochement with India might lead to a relegation of its status and power , and a reduction of its budget , played the nuclear card .
This was followed by an adventurous border clash with India in Kashmir during which Pakistan received a drubbing .
This increased tensions with the government , which tried to pin the blame for the botched operation on the army .
Now Musharraf has seized power , but in changed conditions .
The army is no longer a unified institution .
Well - organised groups of Islamic zealots have penetrated its core .
Unlike the older and more traditional religious parties , these are all hungry for power .
Their preferred model is that of the Taliban .
Earlier this year one faction seized several villages in the Northwest Frontier province and declared the area to be under "" Islamic law "" .
A public destruction of TV sets took place in the village of Zargari .
If such a faction were to take over the army , the possession of nuclear weapons would acquire a frightening new significance .
If Washington refuses to tolerate a new dictator , the most likely scenario is a caretaker government staffed by International Monetary Fund - approved technocrats .
That , too , will achieve little , for the only serious and rational alternative to domestic chaos is a long - term treaty of friendship and trade with India , a new permanent settlement that could form the basis of a larger European Union - style confederation of South Asian republics .
For more than 50 years Pakistan has turned its back on India , imagining it could replace its giant neighbour by cultivating links with the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia .
The strategy has been a political and economic failure , leaving the country denuded of a skilled labour force and incapable of meeting its own basic needs .
In recent years there have been signs that politicians of the main secular parties were beginning to explore a new economic deal with India .
Pressure from the fundamentalists and the army sent their heads back into the sand .
Yet this remains the only rational solution in the medium term .
All other options are bleak beyond belief .
The ISI - armed fundamentalists are waiting in the wings .
If they decided to split the army , it would unleash a bloody civil war , with devastating consequences for the region .
If the politicians of the subcontinent fail to devise a way of living together , they might end up dying together ."
1999-10-24,"They tortured Rehman Malik by placing his hands and feet on ice for up to an hour at a time at a ' safe house ' in Islamabad .
Three years on , he still has trouble feeling sensations in his palms and soles from the punishment , meted out in black masks , by Nawaz Sharif 's heavies .
His neck , too , bears the painful crick from a year spent in solitary confinement in a tiny cell at Rawalpindi 's Adila jail with a brick wrapped in newspapers for a pillow .
Malik , in mortal fear of convicted terrorists and official hatchet men , found his monthly half - hour visit from his seven - year - old son his single comfort .
Three times following his arrest in November 1996 the courts ordered Malik 's release .
Each time he was re - arrested on trumped up charges until , after 12 months of humiliation , the Pakistani Supreme Court itself ruled his detention illegal .
Malik 's crime ?
To have been the deputy head of the Federal Investigation Agency ( FIA ) , Pakistan 's equivalent of the FBI , investigating allegations of massive corruption by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , his family and cronies .
At 46 , he was the youngest officer to reach such a senior rank , the equivalent of an army major - general .
In a 20-year career , Malik had gained an impressive reputation in the West for anti - terrorist expertise , including investigation of the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing in New York and of Saudi fundamentalist Osama bin Laden .
And , after Malik 's inquiries were publicised by The Observer last year , he started a ball rolling which culminated in the coup against Sharif . '
I have suffered enormously from doing my duty as a civil servant .
My friends , family and colleagues have been harassed .
My life has been at risk , ' Malik told The Observer in his first UK interview since fleeing Pakistan for London after an attempt on his life 15 months ago . '
I am not a politician , but I welcome the army 's action .
They have saved Pakistan from someone who was ruining the country .
As a career officer , I would like to return to fulfil my official obligations as soon as possible . '
He is also promising further explosive revelations , which will implicate Sharif and senior Muslim League politicians in allegedly creaming off more of the country 's wealth overseas .
Malik 's report last year was painful enough for the deposed Prime Minister , as were the cat - and - mouse tactics by which Malik has been a thorn in his side since .
The 200-page report , smuggled into the country on Sharif 's official Jumbo jet , set out a secret web of fake bank accounts and firms in offshore tax havens through which Sharif 's family allegedly siphoned off more than $ 70 million ( £ 40 m ) into London property , Swiss investments and banks in New York .
The family , whose empire grew hugely while Sharif was in office , was also accused of defaulting on $ 120 m of state bank loans , a favourite way of milking the public purse .
According to further documents seen by The Observer , however , the revelations appear to be the tip of an iceberg .
Following inquiries over the past year , Malik says he has established further channels by which the Sharif family channelled money illegally offshore .
They include $ 2.74 m allegedly deposited in the account of an Essex - based Pakistani family at the Atlas BOT ( Bank of Tokyo ) Investment Bank in Lahore as security for loans to four Sharif family members .
They also include $ 4.6 m deposited at the Al Faysal Investment Bank in Islamabad as security for a loan to Hamza Board Mills , a paper and forestry firm in the Sharif family 's Ittefaq group .
Among all his amassed wealth , Sharif also appears to have concealed ownership of a Russian - made Ulan helicopter , which he used during election campaigns .
The aircraft , worth more than $ 1 m , was bought from an Arab prince , Sheikh Abdul Rehman Bin Nasir Al Thani of Qatar , in November 1996 and registered in Sharif 's name at the Pakistani Civil Aviation Authority , according to official documents obtained by Malik .
It was , however , not declared on Sharif 's statutory filing of assets and liabilities to the country 's Election Commission . '
This was a man who once told me he could not afford a second - hand Mercedes .
How then could he buy a helicopter ? '
Malik asks .
Most explosive of all , however , is likely to be Malik 's new investigation , which is almost concluded and alleges laundering of more than $ 100 m offshore via a network of UK trusts , Swiss accounts and offshore havens including Liechtenstein .
An Observer investigation has revealed other instances of alleged corruption during Sharif 's last administration :  In an emergency budget after Pakistan 's nuclear tests last year , import duties on luxury cars were cut from 325 per cent to 125 per cent .
A week later they were restored .
In between a friend of Sharif imported 80 cars .

In 1996 senior figures at Bankers Equity Limited , a finance house , granted a huge loan , believed to be more than £ 10 m , to close associates of Sharif .
Last summer the bank collapsed and several senior managers , including a friend of Sharif 's , were arrested .
The loan is outstanding .

After the 1997 elections the Sharif family , and their business concerns , were able to reschedule and renegotiate loans worth nearly £ 100 m from eight banks .
When ordered by courts to pay some back they surrendered 33 factories .
Only one factory was fully operational , the rest closed , out of order , or both .
Sharif , his family and former Ministers have consistently dismissed the allegations as politically inspired .
Sharif himself is still in ' preventative custody ' , as the army calls it , in a government guesthouse on the outskirts of Islamabad .
General Pervez Musharraf , the self - appointed Chief Executive of Pakistan , has not revealed his plans for the man ousted in a coup 10 days ago .
Military sources say evidence is being gathered to put Sharif on trial for corruption and possibly treason .
Sharif 's former residence , the 100-acre Raiwind estate , near the city of Lahore in eastern Pakistan , is widely seen as a symbol of the opulent lifestyle the Sharifs have led since their pursuit of power and wealth began to pay off 15 years ago .
Last week The Observer was the first Western newspaper to visit it since Sharif 's fall .
Brand new roads lead out of Lahore , where the Sharifs have two other houses , to the walled 100-acre estate .
A turning leads to a helicopter pad and a set of steel gates .
Beyond is an open , grassy compound where five houses , all in white - washed villa style , lie in a rough circle around a man - made pond .
Each has a huge colonnaded porch sheltering a £ 20,000 four - wheel drive Jeep .
Two of the buildings are partially constructed as is a pool , though a lake stocked with fish is completed .
There is a small zoo .
All the houses are similar , with deep red carpets and velvet curtains throughout .
Sharif 's own house is distinguished by the number of televisions - the Prime Minister was gadget crazy .
Now army machine gunners have replaced the bodyguards who previously watched the compound 's perimeter .
And the muzzles of their weapons point in as much as out .
Raiwind is , to the ousted Prime Minister 's critics at least , a symbol of how his administration manipulated government to benefit itself .
According to opposition spokesmen , Sharif has ' used public office for personal economic gain ' .
It is corruption , they say , even if it is within the letter of the law .
Soon after coming to power for a second time in February 1997 Sharif declared the Raiwind site to be the ' Prime Minister 's Camp Office ' - his home away from the capital .
The local municipal authority took on the estate 's maintenance at an estimated annual cost of 40 million Pakistani rupees ( £ 500,000 ) and built a new road for it , while the state has also supplied gas , electricity and a 200-line telephone exchange .
Near Raiwind last week feelings were mixed about Sharif 's fall .
Many remain loyal to a man they see as a local boy made good . '
He has done a lot round here , ' said Ahmadullah Ali , a farmer . '
He is a good man . '
In the rough and tumble world of Pakistani politics Sharif may be down , but he still is n't out ."
1999-10-29,"Twenty miles south of the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore lies the sprawling estate of Raiwind - the newly built home of Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister ousted in an army coup 17 days ago .
Yesterday Pakistan 's military government allowed reporters to tour the complex for the first time .
Around four palatial , marble - faced villas stretch vast lawns and hundreds of acres of golden wheatfields , where dozens of farmworkers were harvesting ripe corn .
In Mr Sharif 's private zoo several deer , a herd of antelopes and a large turkey grubbed in the dirt .
Stuffed leopards stood outside his front door .
The prime minister is still being held in "" protective custody "" , as the military calls it , in a government guest house on the outskirts of Islamabad , the capital 200 miles away .
This week the army let him call his family at the Raiwind estate to tell them he was unharmed .
Neither he nor the half dozen other politicians under house arrest have been allowed to make any public statement since the army seized power .
The wife of one key aide has been reduced to calling foreign journalists in her efforts to find her husband .
The tour of Raiwind was part of a military charm offensive mounted to convince the international community that General Pervez Musharraf , the self - appointed chief executive of Pakistan , was justified in using force to overthrow an elected government .
The army admits that its action was unconstitutional but argues that the takeover was necessary to save the country from collapse .
Investigations into Mr Sharif 's murky financial affairs have started and Gen Musharraf has hinted that the 46-year - old will eventually face trial on corruption and treason charges .
Yesterday a delegation of foreign ministers from the Commonwealth arrived in Pakistan for talks with leading public figures including the president , the chief justice , politicians and human rights activists .
The delegation , led by the Canadian foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy , is the first high - level visit to the country since the army took power .
Its aim , a spokesman said , was to assess the situation and find out when the army planned to restore democracy .
After the coup Pakistan was barred from Commonwealth meetings and Mr Axworthy has said he will recommend full suspension from the body unless he sees a firm timetable for a return to democracy .
A decision will be taken at a summit next month in Durban after ministers , including Robin Cook , the British foreign secretary , have considered the delegation 's report .
The visiting ministers have also asked to see Mr Sharif .
Tariq Altaf , a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign office , said no one knew how long it would take the army to achieve its aims .
"" It could be weeks , it could be months , it could be years , "" he said .
In Islamabad few Pakistanis appear alarmed at the prospect of suspension from the Commonwealth .
Even the delegates themselves privately admit such a step would be "" embarrassing "" for Pakistan but little else .
Gen Musharraf , who is to meet the foreign ministers today , has left little doubt that his focus is elsewhere . ""
He is clearly more concerned with America and the Gulf states than with an association of ex - colonies , "" said Riffat Hussein , professor of defence and strategic studies at Quaid - i - Azam university in Islamabad .
"" If the Commonwealth shows no understanding of the predicament Pakistan was in and the need for radical steps to be taken then I think the new government will just say so be it . ""
So far the general must be pleased with the results of his diplomatic efforts .
Washington has been relatively conciliatory and a tour of the Gulf this week earned him hearty statements of support from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
Most importantly the military still has enormous support at home .
Fears that an economic meltdown would follow the coup have proved unfounded , with the rupee staying steady and the stock exchange rising .
It now appears that the International Monetary Fund is prepared to discuss conditions for the release of a $ 280 m ( £ 170 m ) tranche of its $ 1.6bn loan package .
This will please Mohammed Yaqub , the governor of Pakistan 's state bank , and Shaukat Aziz , a New York - based banking expert Gen Musharraf has picked to be his finance minister .
The general 's choice of respected bureaucrats and established experts to take key posts in the new national security council and in the small cabinet that will help him govern has been widely welcomed , both domestically and abroad .
A veteran constitutional lawyer , a well - known educationalist and a vastly experienced foreign office mandarin - 68-year - old Abdus Sattar , a former foreign secretary - have also been given jobs .
More appointments are expected by next week ."

1999-11-11,"Treason proceedings were launched early today against Pakistan 's prime minister by the military - led regime of General Pervez Musharraf , whose forces deposed the unpopular elected leader almost exactly a month ago .
The accusations , which cover not only treason but kidnapping , were lodged in Karachi after midnight against Nawaz Sharif and seven others .
These offences can carry the death penalty .
The allegations - which are probably meant to justify the continuing detention of the prime minister until the regime 's investigations can come up with corruption charges against the Sharif family and its supporters - stem from an episode on October 12 .
Mr Sharif is accused of having trying to prevent the return to Pakistan of Gen Musharraf , whom he had just sacked as army chief of staff .
That sacking instantly set off what the army called a "" spontaneous "" coup .
Gen Musharraf was flying home from a visit to Sri Lanka .
He and aviation officials said that the time that his plane was refused landing rights in the southern port city of Karachi when it was low on fuel after its long flight .
Eventually the aircraft landed elsewhere but with barely 10 minutes of fuel remaining , according to the general , who publicly accused Mr Sharif of endangering the lives of 200 people on board .
The treason proceedings were lodged at Karachi airport police station .
Mr Sharif was also accused of assembling people with the purpose of killing , and of physical endangerment , both of which carry prison terms .
In keeping with Pakistan 's legal system a complaint , or what is called a "" first information report "" , was filed .
The charges in their final form will be lodged later in court of law , if normal procedure is followed by the military administration .
Mr Sharif has not been seen since he was taken into military custody a month ago .
His Pakistan Muslim League had said yesterday that it would go to the supreme court to challenge the coup which dismissed the government and the suspended the constitution , parliament and provincial assemblies .
It was also set to file petitions with superior courts to seek the release of Mr Sharif and several of his colleagues on the basis that they were being detained without charge .
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had said yes terday that the detention of members of the ousted government without due process of law was against the constitution 's fundamental rights , which the military government says are still in force . ""
If they [ fundamental rights ] are indeed in force , the detention of these people is not a proof of that , "" the commission 's chairman , Afrasiab Khattak , said .
"" These persons are also re portedly being denied access to and communication with their families , "" he said .
"" Equally indefensible are the restrictions placed on the movement of even their families - of women , children and aged people . ""
The proceedings lodged last night now make it harder for anybody successfully to challenge the detentions through the courts .
During the day , Gen Mu sharraf chaired the first meeting of what he called his "" civilian - military combine "" administration .
At the meeting were national security council - a handful of military and civilian figures - and the general 's civilian cabinet and senior army officers .
"" It is only the civil - military combine that can overcome the massive problems faced by the country , "" an official statement quoted Gen Musharraf as telling the meeting .
The statement said "" a host of problems confronting Pakistan "" were discussed in the five - hour meeting at the army general headquarters in Rawalpindi .
But it did not announce any decisions .
Gen Musharraf has refused to give a timetable for restoring democracy before he tries to tackle official corruption , misrule and economic mismanagement .

1999-11-12,"Britain warned Pakistan 's military rulers yesterday not to stage a show trial of the ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif and said it would oppose any use of the death penalty .
Robin Cook , the foreign secretary , said in a statement that Pakistan must respect the rights of Mr Sharif and other ministers arrested in last month 's military coup .
The ousted prime minister was yesterday accused - along with four other people - of hijacking and kidnapping , which carry the death penalty .
Mr Cook , who is in Durban , South Africa , was to take part in a meeting of the Commonwealth ministerial action group , which has suspended Pakistan from all meetings of the 54-country organisation . ""
If there is a genuine legal case , then it should be pursued through due process of law with a fair and open trial before a civilian court .
Britain opposes the use of the death penalty , whatever the offence , "" Mr Cook said .
"" A show trial will do nothing to encourage confidence that the military genuinely intend to restore democracy . ""
Police in Karachi said a formal complaint was filed by a senior military officer against Mr Sharif in connection with the attempted diversion on October 12 of a plane carrying General Pervez Musharraf , who hours later overthrew Mr Sharif in a bloodless coup .
The police said they would press formal charges against Mr Sharif in a few days .
He has been in detention since the coup .
The flight carrying Gen Musharraf and 200 civilians was denied landing rights at Karachi airport , shortly after Mr Sharif announced that Gen Musharraf had been fired .
In a speech last month the general said the passengers ' lives had been put at risk ."
1999-11-13,"Osama bin Laden , the Islamic leader wanted for the bombing of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , yesterday came under immediate suspicion after an audacious series of rocket attacks on American and United Nations targets in Islamabad .
The rockets slightly injured one man and did no structural damage , but they sent a fresh wave of political shocks through the region , just a month after the army ousted the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , in a coup .
There were no immediate claims of responsibility .
However , the timing , just 48 hours before the imposition of UN sanctions against Afghanistan over the presence there of Mr Bin Laden , prompted speculation that the assault was a high profile gesture of defiance by the wanted terrorist leader .
Police said six rockets , fired from twin - barrel launchers in cars in three separate areas of the city centre , were fired during the space of just a few minutes at mid - morning .
The targets appeared to include the US embassy , the American Centre - formerly the US Information Service - and an office building housing UN agencies .
All the rockets fell in open ground , but a Pakistani guard was injured by flying debris after a rocket struck a steel fence at the American Centre .
The White House spokesman , Joe Lockhart , denounced the attacks as "" barbaric "" , and the US embassy was closed until further notice .
There was panic in the heavily guarded diplomatic district as residents and office workers fled the smoke - filled area .
After the initial explosions , rockets could still be heard flying overhead .
The improvised launchers were found by Pakistani police in the burned - out wreckage of the cars used , but the attackers had fled .
Pakistan 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , described the attacks as "" quite serious "" but refused to point the finger of blame .
"" Officials are investigating .
They will report , and only then would I like to comment , "" he said .
However , senior interior ministry sources said commandos supporting Osama Bin Laden were suspected of carrying out the attacks , which came two days before a UN deadline , set under American pressure , for Afghan leaders to hand over Mr Bin Laden , who is wanted for questioning in the US in connection with the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year .
Yesterday 's attacks were condemned by the Afghan Taliban leader , Mohammed Omar , who said the "" act of terrorism "" was aimed at "" creating misundertanding between Afghanistan and the rest of the world , specially to hurt Afghanistan 's relations with Pakistan [ and to ] create more complications between Afghanistan and the United States .
"" Afghanistan faces a range of UN sanctions starting tomorrow if it does not hand over Mr Bin Laden .
The sanctions include the freezing of the Taliban government 's overseas bank accounts and a ban on international flights by the state airline Ariana ."
1999-11-18,"The new military regime detained up to 450 of Pakistan 's most powerful and wealthy people , it emerged last night , in what the martial rulers claimed was an attempt to rid political ranks of corruption .
As the ousted prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , was flown in secret yesterday to the port city of Karachi in preparation for a court appearance , landowners , industrialists , athletes and politicians from all parties were arrested in the raids .
The coordinated sweep was just hours after the expiry of a deadline for debtors to repay loans or face criminal charges .
According to Pakistan television , $ 138 m ( £ 85 m ) had been recovered when the deadline expired - just 3 % of the estimated $ 4bn outstanding .
State - owned banks had been coerced , officials said , into giving loans to powerful people regardless of whether these borrowers provided enough collateral .
A leading member of the party of the former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , said after being arrested in Islamabad : "" We hope we will get justice .
We are not going to run . ""
He was just one of hundreds taken in during the crackdown ordered by General Pervez Musharraf , who promised to root out corruption after after seizing power in a bloodless coup on October 12 .
Mr Sharif and his brother , Shahbaz Sharif , were among those said by officials of the new "" national accountability bureau "" to be wanted for unpaid loans . ""
He [ Sharif ] has been brought to Karachi in a military aircraft , "" a military source said .
It is thought he will be brought to court tomorrow .
A separate complaint filed last week accused Mr Sharif and four others of criminal conspiracy , hijacking - which carries a maximum punishment of death - kidnapping and attempted murder .
Mr Sharif has not been seen in public , although the other four have been formally charged and brought before a court so they could be handed over to police for interrogation .
He has not , therefore , been able to respond to the charges against him .
The charges were connected to an alleged attempt to divert a plane bringing Gen Musharraf to Karachi from Sri Lanka .
A matter of hours later , Gen Musharraf overthrew Mr Sharif .
The army interrupted television programming last night to name some of those arrested .
They included a former chief minister of Punjab ; a former captain of Pakistan 's national field hockey team ; a retired air marshal ; and a leading politician and industrialist .
"" They have committed crimes against this nation , "" the de facto interior minister , Moinuddin Haider , said .
"" We have to be tough . ""
Yesterday 's arrests followed the enactment by the martial - rule regime of a law barring politicians from holding office for 21 years if they were found guilty of corruption or of defaulting on loans .
Those found guilty of corruption face up to 14 years in prison .
The new law establishes special courts to conduct trials within 30 days and allows for just one appeal .
It also gives the accountability bureau sweeping powers of investigation and the authority to seek help from police and intelligence agencies ."
1999-11-20,"The deposed prime minister of Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif , appeared yesterday before a special anti - terrorist court in the southern city of Karachi .
It was the first time he has been seen in public since being ousted by the army in a bloodless coup nearly six weeks ago .
Mr Sharif , 51 , arrived at the court in a convoy of armoured personnel carriers and jeeps amid chaotic scenes .
In a massive operation , hundreds of security personnel flooded the area around the courthouse but were unable to maintain order among the hundreds of journalists , onlookers and political activists .
Armed police took up positions on rooftops and cordoned off roads , while officers , armed with bamboo staves , broke up a small demonstration by Sharif supporters .
Wearing a light blue traditional Pakistani shalwar kameez ( trouser suit ) and a black waistcoat , the former prime minister looked tired and depressed as , surrounded by policemen and security of ficials , he struggled through the crowd from his vehicle - an armoured personnel carrier - to the court .
During a half - hour hearing , Mr Sharif was remanded in custody pending further investigations by the police .
Formal charges against him have yet to be lodged , though a complaint has been made to the police alleging criminal conspiracy , hijacking and attempted murder - offences for which he could theoretically be sentenced to death or life imprisonment .
Mr Sharif is expected to make a further court appearance early next week , when he will learn the date of his formal trial .
The charges relate to events on the day of the coup last month , when a plane carrying 198 passengers and General Pervez Musharraf - at that time the chief of the army staff and now the head of Pakistan 's military government - was allegedly stopped from landing at Karachi airport , despite running low on fuel , in an attempt to prevent the army taking charge .
The plane finally landed with seven minutes of fuel left after troops secured control of the airport .
The last military ruler of Pakistan , General Mohammed Zia - ul - Haq , hanged Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , the prime minister he deposed , after he was controversially convicted of conspiring to commit a political murder .
Few , however , believe that Mr Sharif 's life is now in danger .
"" It would be political suicide for the army to hang him , "" said one Islamabad - based political analyst .
Mr Sharif has denied the charges against him .
As he left the court yesterday , he reportedly told one journalist that "" the only hijacking has been of the democratic process "" .
He said his detention by the military after the coup was "" illegal "" , and hinted that he had suffered mental torture .
"" They did not torture me physically , but they did everything else .
I do n't know where they were keeping me , but they kept shifting me from one place to another , "" he is reported to have said .
The military government has promised that his trial will be "" fair and transparent "" .
It is also drawing up corruption charges against Mr Sharif and a number of close aides .
It is under pressure to act swiftly against corruption , not least to demonstrate to a domestic and international audience that its toppling of an elected government , albeit one that was highly unpopular and undemocratic , was justified . ""
The man in the street in Pakistan has heard the rhetoric of reform many times before .
But the army 's firm actions this week are convincing people that this time it is different , "" said Rashita Dohad , a specialist in civil society at an Islamabad - based think - tank ."

1999-11-22,"Ignoring the advice of Robin Cook , among others , Pakistan 's military rulers appear determined to stage a show trial of the country 's deposed prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , on capital charges of treason and hijacking .
This is unwise .
It prospectively turns Mr Sharif into a martyr .
It will alienate international opinion , especially if the proceedings in a special anti - terrorism court are not credibly impartial .
It will further destabilise a country where political bombings are a commonplace .
Yesterday , militant supporters of the deposed prime minister claimed responsibility for an explosion that killed six people in a crowded market place in Lahore .
Such a trial will carry a chilling echo of the condemnation and hanging of another democratically elected leader , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto .
And it will be seen as the result of a personal vendetta by Gen Pervez Musharraf , the armed forces chief who launched the October 12 coup when Mr Sharif tied to sack him .
Since becoming Pakistan 's de facto dictator , Gen Musharraf has made some crowd - pleasing moves .
Rooting out corruption is a popular cause in a country where $ 10bn ( or more ) has disappeared into the pockets of the privileged .
The charges pending against up to 350 members of Pakistan 's elite will , in many cases , prove justified .
He has sensibly eschewed martial law and curbs on press freedom .
And he has shown considerable skill , for a military man , in handling the media , giving numerous interviews in avuncular style .
But if he is to succeed in reviving Pakistan 's economy and tackling poverty , he needs to be moving his country forward , collectively , rather than constantly to be looking back , divisively .
What can we look forward to under Gen Musharraf 's unsanctioned ascendancy , a month or so after the coup ?
No timetable for a return to democracy , as demanded by the Commonwealth , Britain , and the US , has been forthcoming .
His plan to decentralise power remains just a plan .
Despite a token army withdrawal from the Kashmir border , renewed dialogue with India has not been pursued .
Immediate , positive steps could include measures to end the exploitation Pakistani children in textile sweatshops and farms , the switching of funds from military to social spending , and ratification of the Test Ban Treaty .
But so far , Pakistan 's new strongman seems better able to prosecute past wrongdoing than to produce creative , future solutions .
He should get help and call an election ."
1999-11-25,"Pakistan 's deposed prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , yesterday suffered a setback to his defence against accusations of hijacking and treason when one of his co - accused agreed to testify against him .
Aminuddin Chaudhry , the former chairman of the civil aviation authority , is believed to have told police that Mr Sharif personally issued the orders to turn away the flight carrying Pakistan 's military chief , General Pervez Musharraf , and 200 civilians to Karachi airport on October 12 , the night of the bloodless coup .
He is believed to have asked for a full pardon in return for appearing as the star witness against Mr Sharif and the three remaining accused .
The mid - air drama ended when soldiers occupied the Karachi control tower , allowing the general 's plane to land with just seven minutes - worth of fuel to spare .
Hours later Gen Musharraf seized power , detaining Mr Sharif and several key allies .
Mr Chaudhry 's statement is expected to be made public tomorrow , when Mr Sharif is to be formally charged in a Karachi anti - terrorism court with hijacking , treason , kidnap and conspiracy to murder .
If convicted , he and the three remaining co - accused could face the death penalty .
Mr Sharif 's defence lawyers say they remain confident .
But Mr Chaudhry 's testimony could prove extremely damaging if it allows the prosecution to establish a direct link between Mr Sharif and air traffic control at Karachi .
Mr Sharif maintains he is innocent , telling reporters outside the court on Monday that the army had carried out the only hijacking - of Pakistan 's constitution , and of democracy .
"" This is a cooked - up story and the world will judge the hollowness of the accusations , "" he said .
He arrived at Malir court in Karachi yesterday in an armoured personnel carrier to hear civil aviation officials and policemen record statements before a magistrate .
Several Sharif loyalists from his Pakistan Muslim League stood vigil outside the court , which barred journalists from its proceedings .
"" We just wanted to send a message of our support , "" said the provincial leader , Mohammed Shah .
Other Sharif supporters said that Mr Chaudhry had been coerced into giving his testimony on Tuesday , and that the former civil aviation chief was in poor health after being held in a mosquito - infested cell .
Pakistan 's new military rulers also intend to prosecute Mr Sharif for corruption , and for wilful default on billions of rupees in loans from state banks .
Mr Sharif 's brothers - the former Punjab chief minister , Shahbaz , and Abbas - were detained without charge last month .
They were taken into protective custody for 90 days on Tuesday pending corruption investigations .
But prosecution for financial crimes is a lengthy and complicated process .
Mr Sharif 's trial by the anti - terrorism courts - which he set up as prime minister - will be far speedier .
The anti - terrorism courts were intended to produce a verdict within seven days of the start of a trial ."
1999-11-26," Re your leader ( Show trial in Pakistan , November 22 )
: the trial is taking place in a civil court constituted by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and not a military court .
As for the "" unsanctioned ascendancy "" of General Musharraf , let us not forget that 90 % of the people of Pakistan ( polled by the international media ) are in favour of Gen Musharraf .
Pakistan was at the brink ; democracy had failed and there was a crisis .
Had Gen Musharraf not acted , it would have been the end of democracy in Pakistan .
You seem to be imposing unnecessary pressure by demanding a timetable for return to democracy .
Gen Musharraf wants to give real and meaningful democracy to the nation .
The actions of the man should be the criterion to comment on his ideas .
His primary objective is to establish order and stability .
He is not a premeditated or a pre - planned coup - maker .
History has appointed him and it is a belief of all Pakistanis that history will not be disappointed .
What is most important is that the people of Pakistan are supporting him .
Samina Parvez High Commission for Pakistan"
1999-12-08,"Nawaz Sharif , the deposed prime minister of Pakistan , appeared before the country 's supreme court yesterday to answer accusations that he was responsible for an attack on the court two years ago .
In 1997 the supreme court was invaded by a mob during a constitutional showdown between Mr Sharif and the then chief justice .
Mr Sharif , who also faces separate charges of attempted murder and hijacking , was taken to the court in Islamabad in a convoy of armoured personnel carriers .
The security operation appeared to have stopped any demonstrations in his support ; there have been protests at many of his recent court appearances .
Looking defiant and confident , the deposed prime minister greeted several senior members of his Pakistan Muslim League in the court before sitting among relatives .
During the hour - long hearing Mr Sharif , who was ousted on October 12 , attacked the conditions in which he is being held , and claimed that he had been denied access to a TV . ""
The treatment meted out to me and to my colleagues is humiliating , "" he said .
"" I have been kept in a small cage - like cell , which is locked all the time except for a few brief intervals when I am allowed out to walk around . ""
The case has been resurrected by the supreme court which , having dismissed it for lack of evidence earlier this year , has agreed to hold what is effectively a retrial .
Mr Sharif was flown from Karachi to the Pakistani capital for the hearing .
The charges he faces in Karachi relate to the day the army took power .
Mr Sharif and his aides are alleged to have conspired to force a plane carrying General Pervez Musharraf and 198 passengers to crash , by refusing it permission to land - in the alleged hope it would run out of fuel .
Mr Sharif had that day dismissed Gen Musharraf as the chief of the army staff .
The general is now the head of Pakistan 's military government .
The politician was to be returned to Karachi last night .
Today he is to appear with his brother and five senior officials before a special anti - terrorist court to face the so - called plane case charges .
The full trial in that case - which could end in death sentences for all the defendants - is expected to start next week .
The Islamabad case has been adjourned until next month .
Observers believe military chiefs are coming perilously close to making a martyr of Mr Sharif in their haste to have him convicted and jailed .
"" They have to be very careful to handle the process correctly .
One false step could badly misfire , "" said Rashida Dohad , a specialist in civic society at an Islamabad thinktank .
There are signs that Gen Musharraf 's honeymoon period may be nearing an end .
Next week the government is to announce an economic package that is expected to significantly raise the prices of many necessities , particularly electricity and fuel .
Pakistanis are deeply cynical about all rulers and tend to judge their governments on economic performance alone .
Gen Musharraf has so far given no indication of when he intends to return Pakistan to democratic government .
Yesterday he hinted that he planned to remain in power for a considerable time .
He called on the Pakistani people to make sacrifices and on politicians to "" cooperate for bringing stability "" .
But he appears to have learned enough about politics to know what appeals to the masses .
He said : "" It is the poor who have been victimised at every level of Pakistan .
I would like to alleviate their problems . """
2000-01-12,"Today 's disclosure that the government is actively considering a resumption of arms sales to Pakistan is deeply disturbing .
When General Pervez Musharraf overthrew the country 's elected prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , in a military coup last October , Britain 's response was robust .
Robin Cook , the foreign secretary , roundly condemned the takeover and led a successful effort to suspend Pakistan from the Commonwealth .
With the US , Pakistan 's principal overseas patron , taking a similar line , Mr Cook insisted that business as usual would be impossible until , at the very minimum , Gen Musharraf set a realistic timetable for the restoration of democracy .
British bilateral aid was frozen , as was IMF and World Bank funding .
Regardless of the short - lived jubilation with which some Pakistanis greeted Mr Sharif 's downfall , Britain 's message to the general was crystal clear .
A new bout of authoritarianism was not the solution to Pakistan 's chronic problems of poverty , debt and corruption .
Nor was it likely to improve Pakistan 's dangerously volatile relationship with a wary India .
Gen Musharraf , who now styles himself Pakistan 's "" chief executive "" , has done little of a substantive nature since October fundamentally to alter this view .
Normal political activity remains in abeyance after the closure of the national assembly ; local polls may be permitted at the end of the year ; an independent election commissioner may be given additional powers .
But a fully - fledged democratic restoration is nowhere in sight .
An anti - corruption crackdown has been launched , although many who pillaged the country 's banks for soft loans are likely to escape retribution .
The regime has also imposed an income tax on wealthy landowners for the first time , and promised to cut defence spending , which averages a whopping £ 2.5bn annually , by £ 100 m .
But the country 's overall difficulties , including a £ 20bn foreign debt , remain largely undented .
In its relations with India , meanwhile , Pakistan under Gen Musharraf has gone from cold suspicion to heated insults following the recent Indian airliner hijacking .
Separatist violence in Kashmir , for which India blames Pakistan , is escalating .
Having missed a fleeting opportunity to resume Mr Sharif 's thwarted dialogue with India , Gen Musharraf has also refused to contemplate limits on Pakistan 's nuclear bomb development programme .
Is this a man to whom Britain should be selling military supplies ?
Mr Cook 's consistent answer , echoed by Clare Short , the international development secretary , is no .
They are both right , and Geoff Hoon , the defence secretary , and Stephen Byers , the trade secretary , are wrong .
This latter pair argue that British arms manufacturers are in danger of losing out to foreign competitors .
They want up to 80 new export licences to be granted .
Yet whatever assurances Gen Musharraf may offer visiting British and US delegations this week , Mr Cook , having set British policy last October , should stick to his guns .
And he has a right to expect the support of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown .
In this respect , the chancellor 's announcement yesterday that Britain would no longer underwrite arms sales to highly - indebted countries was ethical as well as economical .
In this case , it should apply to Pakistan , too .
It is right that Britain should offer resumed development and technical aid such as help with voter registration - but on our terms , not Gen Musharraf 's .
Whatever other countries see fit to do , the British interest - and that of the disenfranchised Pakistani people - lies in nation - building , not arms - racing ."
2000-01-20,"The former prime minister of Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif , was formally charged yesterday with a series of offences that carry the death sentence .
During a brief appearance in a special anti - terrorism court in the southern port city of Karachi , Mr Sharif , who was ousted by the military in a coup just over three months ago , was indicted for terrorism , hijacking and conspiracy to murder .
Mr Sharif pleaded not guilty to all charges .
The judge appeared to have rejected the prosecution 's request to charge the former prime minister with treason .
Mr Sharif 's co - defendants - his brother Shabhaz , a former senior minister and four senior officials - also pleaded not guilty to charges relating to events on October 12 , the day of the military coup .
Prosecution lawyers say that Mr Sharif and his aides attempted to force a plane carrying the leader of the armed forces , General Pervez Musharraf , and 198 passengers to crash by denying it permission to land in Pakistan even though they knew it was running low on fuel .
Mr Sharif told the court : "" Actually , Gen Musharraf hijacked the plane himself [ and ] he hijacked the democratically elected government of Pakistan . ""
Referring to the night of the coup he said : "" Two dozen gunmen came to arrest me then [ for five weeks ]
I was unaware of the charges against me . ""
Although Mr Sharif , 51 , has been incarcerated since October 12 , legal arguments have delayed the start of proceedings .
The most recent row was over the right of Mr Sharif 's lawyers to tapes of conversations between the Pakistan International Airlines plane and air traffic controllers .
The outcome of the trial is crucial to Gen Musharraf 's government .
Its claims of legitimacy have been based on the alleged criminal nature of the previous administration .
If Mr Sharif is acquitted , then Gen Musharraf has a serious problem in justifying the takeover .
He also faces a growing domestic disappointment in his government .
Although he has tried to maintain the momentum of a national anti - corruption campaign , less than a tenth of the 211bn rupees ( £ 2.5bn ) owed to banks by businessmen and cronies of the last government have been recouped .
The respected Friday Times newspaper last week wrote : "" We understand that radical reforms ca n't be wrought overnight , but evidence of political immaturity and lack of strategic thinking is beginning to litter the bleak landscape of our beloved country . ""
Mr Sharif 's full trial will start next Wednesday and few believe the death sentence will be passed if he is found guilty . ""
The political fallout internationally would be too damaging and Musharraf is not the kind of man to take things that far , "" said one political analyst .
Following a spate of bombings in Pakistan , police yesterday defused a bomb in the car park of a Karachi civil court building .
It was found stuffed in a bag beneath a vehicle , witnesses said .
On Monday , a bomb in Karachi killed eight and injured three .
Police blamed the explosion on India 's secret services ."
2000-01-23,"Nawaz Sharif , the ousted Prime Minister of Pakistan , has been linked to a £ 6.1 million trust fund in Britain .
Documents obtained by The Observer show that the fund , registered with a firm of lawyers in Rickmansworth , Hertfordshire , was run by an American agent hired to represent six companies owned by the Sharif family .
The former prime minister was a director and shareholder in at least one of the companies .
A report drawn up by investigators from Pakistan 's military and civilian intelligence agencies - with help from the Federal Investigations Agency , an élite police squad - says the trust is part of ' the simplest and easiest case of money laundering [ against the Sharifs ] ' .
The report alleges that , while his family 's firms owed millions of pounds to the Pakistani exchequer and commercial creditors , the former Prime Minister was involved in a scheme to gain further multi - million pound loans using the money in the British trust as collateral .
The new loans were then used to get further finance from Pakistani banks .
Several such operations were carried out , each involving instalments of more than £ 6 m , the report says .
The investigators have built up 16 separate cases of corruption to be registered against Sharif in the coming weeks .
The former Commerce Minister , Ishaq Dar , who was deeply implicated in another money - laundering operation involving bank accounts opened in London in the names of a British Pakistani family living in South - east England , has given the investigators extensive details of how the Sharifs ' money was transferred out of Pakistan .
Dar is also believed to have revealed the existence of properties in Vietnam , Kenya and a second investment trust in America .
It is thought that the US trust received money from the Rickmansworth trust .
None of the family 's over seas assets was declared on electoral or government returns .
Sources close to the investigation have disclosed that the Sharifs , who have extensive property in Britain including four Park Lane apartments , have hired top public relations firms in London and New York .
The family denies any wrongdoing .
Last week Sharif , his brother and five others were formally indicted on charges of hijacking and conspiracy to murder .
The charges , which carry death sentences , relate to events on the day of the army takeover last October when a plane carrying the army chief of staff , General Pervez Musharraf , and 198 other passengers was allegedly prevented from landing despite running low on fuel .
The jet eventually put down after the army stormed the airport in Karachi .
The prosecution say Sharif and his aides wanted it to crash .
Sharif 's trial is due to start a week on Wednesday .
Preliminary hearings have provided a spectacle of farce , histrionics and incompetence .
Though prosecution lawyers say proceedings will be over within four or five weeks , many believe the trial may last more than a year .
There have already been a series of delays .
It took the military authorities five weeks to frame the charges , and there have been dozens of hearings to establish the exact composition , procedure and jurisdiction of the court .
Ironically Sharif will be tried in one of the anti - terrorism courts he set up , in the face of opposition from the judiciary and human rights activists , to streamline the conviction of his own political opponents .
One of the most dramatic moments at the preliminary hearings was the attempted arrest of a number of intelligence agents from the courtroom on the orders of the judge .
There are several competing secret services in Pakistan and all had sent their men to report on the case - and on the judge , the lawyers and the press .
When they were spotted the judge ordered the courtroom to be sealed .
The doors were indeed closed , but only after a delay which allowed the spies time to escape .
The outcome of the trial is criticial to Musharraf , who appointed himself Chief Executive of Pakistan after ousting Sharif .
He has refused to bow to international pressure for an early return to democracy , so his regime 's legitimacy rests on the alleged criminal nature of the last government . '
If Sharif gets off then the whole justification for the army takeover is gone , ' said one Islamabad - based analyst ."
2000-01-27,"The trial of Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan 's former prime minister , opened yesterday amid growing fears that the military regime that overthrew him is trying to undermine the independence of the judiciary .
The trial started hours after the chief justice and five other senior judges left their posts rather than take an oath that would have banned them from challenging the decisions of General Pervez Musharraf , the self - appointed chief executive of Pakistan , or senior officers of his government .
Gen Musharraf ordered all 13 supreme court judges to swear allegiance to a "" provisional constitutional order "" which he had passed immediately after taking power last October .
Six , including the chief justice , Said - uz Zaman Siddiqi , refused .
Fifteen of the more than 100 judges throughout Pakistan who were asked to take the oath are believed to have refused , and have thus effectively resigned .
"" I have not resigned .
I have refused to take oath , "" Mr Siddiqi told reporters yesterday .
"" I will work under the constitution , [ but ] not under the provisional constitution . ""
The judges ' show of defiance is a serious embarrassment for the army which is sensitive to charges that its rule lacks legitimacy .
Gen Musharraf has consistently refused to indicate when he plans to return Pakistan to democracy , provoking widespread condemnation overseas .
Mr Siddiqi and several of the judges who refused to take the oath were due to hear a legal petition next week that challenged the constitutional basis of the current regime .
The petition , which has been made by Mr Sharif 's supporters , will still be heard , though the results of the case are a foregone conclusion , observers believe .
Mr Sharif 's lawyers had earlier asked for a postponement of his trial until the supreme court had heard the petition .
But after hearing legal arguments , judge Rehmat Hussein Jaffri ordered that the trial continue .
Ammanullah Choudry , the former director of the civil aviation authority , was the first witness for the prosecution .
The prosecution hopes that his evidence will be key in convicting Mr Sharif and six co - defendants on charges of hijacking , kidnapping , attempted murder and terrorism .
The charges , which carry the death penalty , relate to events on the day of the army takeover , when the prime minister and his aides are alleged to have tried to force a plane carrying Gen Musharraf and 200 other passengers to crash .
Mr Sharif has pleaded not guilty to all the charges .
Yesterday Mr Choudry told the court that he had been ordered to prevent the aircraft from landing anywhere in Pakistan .
The order is alleged to have been given by Mr Sharif in the knowledge that the plane was running out of fuel .
Though the law says the trial must finish within seven days , it is likely to drag on for weeks .
There has been growing friction between the courts and Pakistan 's military rulers .
Not only have a number of courts at provincial and national level agreed to hear petitions challenging the legitimacy of the military takeover , but the sharia court - which enforces Islamic law in Pakistan - recently ruled that the country 's banking system is "" un - Islamic "" , and ordered the military regime to impose a new system where interest is not charged on loans .
Earlier this month a judge refused to hear the case against Mr Sharif in protest at the presence of intelligence agents and paramilitary soldiers in the courtroom .
Another judge had to take over .
Many are worried that Gen Musharraf is following the example of General Zia - ul Haq , the dictator who ruled for most of the 1980s .
In 1981 Zia asked judges to take a similar oath .
"" It does not exactly fill you with confidence about the army 's belief in democratic institutions , "" said a senior analyst with an Islamabad think - tank .
"" They are still thinking like soldiers , not as governors of a civil state .
They are not used to disobedience and any dissent is seen as a threat .
"" The judiciary has an unhappy history of politicisation and corruption .
Government investigators have recently revealed how Mr Sharif bought off at least one judge with a diplomatic passport .
However there have been moments where judges have shown considerable independence .
A showdown with the chief justice in 1997 nearly resulted in an early end to Mr Sharif 's administration .
Asma Jehangir , a Pakistani lawyer and a United Nations rapporteur on human rights , praised the judges who yesterday showed defiance .
"" The military rulers are doing their best to erode the independence of the judiciary , "" she said .
"" I salute those judges who refused to take the oath . """
2000-01-28,"If anybody can force General Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's recalcitrant coup - leader , to change tack , it is the United States government .
But the crisis in relations between the US and its long - time regional client and aid recipient grows starker by the day .
Gen Musharraf 's stubborn refusal to heed US - led calls to schedule elections ,
nearly four months after he overthrew Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , is the most galling aspect of a broader failure .
Instead , Pakistan 's new , soft - focus Zia puts Mr Sharif on trial for his life and indulges in further constitutional vandalism , compromising the judiciary 's independence and forcing the resignation of the chief justice .
Gen Musharraf is also proving obstructive on terrorism , a top administration priority .
A senior US official visiting Islamabad last week failed to convince Pakistan to proscribe the Harkat ul - Mojahedin organisation , the men behind last Christmas 's hijacking of an Indian airliner .
To US dismay , Pakistan persists with its support for this and other violent Kashmiri separatist groups , and with its close links to Afghanistan 's Taliban , the pariah protectors of America 's arch - foe , Osama bin Laden .
The regime 's refusal to discuss nuclear weapons curbs , its current military and diplomatic stand - off with Delhi , and its failure to launch credible reforms all endanger US and western interests in South Asia .
The idea , under active discussion at the White House , that President Clinton should try to win over the general with a personal visit , tacked on to his expected March tour of India and Bangladesh , is a bad one .
If Pakistan 's leader agrees to give ground , especially on a return to democracy , before Mr Clinton travels to the region , then the legitimising reward of a face - to - face meeting might be justified .
But not otherwise .
Quiet persuasion has not worked .
Washington must be ready to take a tougher line .
For the general 's coup has brought only trouble for Pakistan .
He has rejected the advice of his friends , including Britain .
He seems incapable of giving a clear lead .
He is digging himself into an ever bigger hole .
And as time passes , his incompetence begs a more basic question : who is really calling the shots in Pakistan ?
Is it the intelligence services ?
Is it army hardliners ?
Is it the Islamic fundamentalist parties and their armed surrogates ?
Nobody , including Pakistan 's US patrons , knows for sure - which is what happens when a general trashes a democracy ."
2000-02-04,"The ousted prime minister of Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif , sat stoney faced in court yesterday as a pilot described how he had pleaded with air traffic controllers in Karachi to allow his plane carrying 200 passengers to land before it ran out of fuel .
Mr Sharif is alleged to have ordered the plane to be stopped from landing in a deliberate attempt to endanger the life of one of the passengers , General Pervez Musharraf , the most senior soldier in the country , whom he had sacked a few hours earlier and who later assumed control of the country .
The pilot , Captain Syed Sarwat Hussein , said he was alarmed after being told by Karachi air traffic control that he could not land at the airport in the southern port city .
"" I have 198 souls on board , a limited amount of fuel and if I 'm not allowed to land - that will be the end of the story , "" Mr Hussein said he told the control tower .
Unknown to Mr Hussein , the prime minister had sacked the army chief at about the time the plane was taking off from Colombo , Sri Lanka .
The pilot was forced into a desperate search for a safe place to touch down as his fuel supply rapidly dwindled .
"" I felt helpless , "" Mr Hussein told the court .
"" It was a very tense situation , to say the least . ""
The flight from Sri Lanka was proceeding without incident until Mr Hussein made his first radio contact with the air traffic control tower in Karachi , and was immediately asked about the plane 's remaining fuel supply .
"" It was quite an unusual question , "" Mr Hussein said .
Even more unsettling , he was asked if he could find another airport to land .
The plane had enough fuel to reach the airport in Nawabshah , also in southern Pakistan .
But as the aircraft descended to land there , the pilot was told that it , too , was off limits .
"" That created a very alarming situation because Nawabshah was available for other flights , but not to us , "" Mr Hussein said .
"" I reached the conclusion that it was because of the presence of the chief of army staff on board .
"" It was not until army generals loyal to Gen Musharraf made a last - ditch effort to secure Karachi airport that Mr Hussein was given permission to land , with about seven minutes of fuel remaining .
Lawyers appearing for Mr Sharif and his six co - defendants say the prime minister issued the order to divert the flight only after the coup was begun .
They say the army coup was illegal and unconstitutional and that Mr Sharif was trying to defend "" democracy "" in Pakistan .
The former prime minister is charged with attempted murder , kidnapping and terrorism .
He faces a possible death sentence .
The case is being tried in a special anti - terrorism court , set up by Mr Sharif himself to expedite trials that were being delayed in Pakistan 's absurdly inefficient judicial system .
The new courts were criticised at the time by senior judges and human rights activists , who said the facilities would be used to crack down on the government 's political opponents .
Now , however , it is the army that is being accused of manipulating the judiciary .
Last week the army forced judges to swear new oaths of allegiance by which they agreed not to take any action against the current executive .
Several senior judges resigned , claiming that the new oaths were a serious assault on the independence of the judiciary ."
2000-02-25,"A judge is to rule today on whether Pakistan 's deposed prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , should be allowed to testify in open court .
Mr Sharif , who was overthrown by a military coup on October 12 , is on trial along with his brother , Shahbaz , and five former senior government officials .
They have pleaded not guilty to charges of hijacking , kidnapping , attempted murder and terrorism which could carry the death penalty .
Mr Sharif 's lawyers were preparing to open their defence yesterday , but prosecutors intervened to argue that the former leader could undermine national security in Pakistan - currently ruled by a military - dominated administration - if his testimony was not kept private .
His evidence will focus on the hours before the army seized control .
"" I am not against the media .
I just want to ensure that the national interest , security and integrity are not harmed , "" said the attorney general , Raja Qureshi .
On the day of the coup , Mr Sharif sacked the army chief , General Pervez Musharraf , who was flying back to Pakistan after a trip abroad .
The prosecution claims that Mr Sharif ordered that the Pakistan International Airlines jet carrying the general should be refused landing permission anywhere inside the country , even though it was running low on fuel , and so endangered the lives of the 198 people on board .
The plane landed after troops seized Karachi airport .
Within hours Gen Musharraf had taken over , proclaimed himself "" chief executive "" and detained Mr Sharif .
Defence lawyers insist that Mr Sharif acted only after the army had launched its coup .
Since the trial began last month , prosecutors have called 27 witnesses to support their case , including the civil aviation authority chief , Aminullah Chaudhary , who was charged but pardoned after turning state 's evidence .
Mr Chaudhary , a former colleague of the prime minister , testified that Mr Sharif gave the order to prevent the plane landing .
Witnesses told how Karachi airport 's lights were turned off and its runway blocked by fire engines .
Earlier in the hearing , Mr Qureshi refused to play instrument tapes from Gen Musharraf 's plane , including the cockpit voice recorder which would have recorded conversations between the aircraft and Karachi air controllers .
He said they were blank .
Lawyers for Mr Sharif insist that he should be given the right to speak in an open court .
They also complained that notes taken by the defendants during the trial had been stolen from their cells and may have been passed to the prosecution ."
2000-02-28,"Two of the lawyers representing Pakistan 's deposed prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , at his trial stepped down from the case yesterday , complaining about decisions made by the judge .
Ijaz Batalvi and Khwaja Sultan , the two leading lawyers for the defence , criticised a decision by the judge presiding over the anti - terrorist court to consider imposing a reporting ban when Mr Sharif gives evidence .
"" The whole world for the last two months heard the prosecution malign and scandalise Mian Nawaz Sharif and now when it was his turn to tell the truth he has been asked to shut up , "" said Mr Batalvi .
"" To say the least , this is not justice .
We have decided to withdraw from the case . ""
Mr Sharif was overthrown in a military coup on October 12 and is now on trial at the court in Karachi together with his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials .
They have pleaded not guilty to charges of hijacking , kidnapping , attempted murder and terrorism and face the death penalty if convicted .
Mr Sharif was due to give evidence this week at the start of the defence case but prosecutors argued that the hearing should be held in private , saying the former prime minister 's evidence could breach national security .
Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri ruled on Friday that he would decide which parts of Mr Sharif 's testimony could be reported after the former prime minister had spoken in open court and handed in written statements .
Mr Batalvi , one of Pakistan 's most senior lawyers , said he believed the judge had stepped beyond the law in making his decision but said the defence was unable to appeal against the ruling under the terms of the anti - terrorism court .
"" The law has not given him any such authority nor has the law fixed any parameters by which the statement of the accused can be scissored by the judge , "" he said .
Mr Batalvi represented the prosecution in another trial of a former Pakistani prime minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who was sentenced to death and hanged in April 1979 under the dictatorship of General Zia ul - Haq .
Mr Sharif was detained immediately after the October coup but a series of setbacks for Pakistan 's new military regime has delayed his trial .
A high court judge refused to hear the case in January , complaining about the presence of intelligence agents in the court room , and later that month all the country 's senior judges were ordered to swear new oaths of loyalty to the military regime .
There are still seven lawyers working in the defence team ."
2000-03-05,"Nawaz Sharif , the deposed Prime Minister of Pakistan , will appear before a Karachi court tomorrow on hijacking and terrorism charges without his top defence lawyer and is facing new accusations by the military regime of corruption .
Sharif 's entire defence team quit in protest at the judge 's handling of the case last week amid allegations that Pakistan 's generals have been piling pressure on the judiciary for a favourable verdict .
On Friday , all Sharif 's lawyers agreed to return to the trial , except Ijaz Batalvi , his leading counsel and one of the country 's most senior lawyers . '
I will be present only on account of the insistence of my client , ' said Khwaja Sultan , one of the defence team . '
Nawaz Sharif felt it would not be possible for anyone else to represent him . '
Now Sharif , who was over thrown in a military coup in October , is also facing two separate accusations of corruption at different courts .
More investigations are expected to follow .
Sharif , 52 , is accused of not paying tax on his purchase in 1993 of a $ 2 million Russian helicopter , which he used for electioneering .
He has also been ordered to appear before a court in Lahore to answer charges that in 1994 a family business , the Ittefaq foundry , defaulted on a loan from the state - run National Bank of Pakistan worth 729 m rupees ( £ 8.5 m ) .
Two of his brothers , Shahbaz and Abbas , are also accused in the Ittefaq case .
Sharif has been held in detention for the past five months and was formally charged only in January , when his trial began at an anti - terrorism court in Karachi .
Sharif , Shahbaz and five former senior government officials have pleaded not guilty to charges of hijacking , kidnap ping , attempted murder and terrorism related to the night of the coup .
They face the death penalty if convicted .
Hours before he was overthrown , Sharif sacked his army chief , General Pervez Musharraf , who was flying back into Pakistan after a trip abroad .
Prosecutors claim Sharif ordered that the Pakistan International Airlines jet carrying the general should be refused permission to land , even though it was running low on fuel , thus endangering the lives of all 198 people on board .
Musharraf landed after troops seized Karachi airport and , within hours , he had taken over the country .
Defence lawyers insist Sharif acted only after the army launched a coup .
Just before the defence was due to open its case , Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri ruled that some of Sharif 's evidence may not be released to the public on national security grounds .
The defence team promptly quit , accusing the judge of censorship . '
The whole world for the last two months heard the prosecution malign and scandalise Sharif and now , when it was his turn to tell the truth , he has been asked to shut up , ' Batalvi said . '
To say the least , this is not justice . '
His complaints were echoed by the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists .
Lawyers on both sides expect the case to end this month .
Sultan , now the leading defence counsel , insisted he was under no pressure from the generals . '
Throughout the trial there has never been any pressure from the military regime and I do n't think the judge is under pressure , ' he said .
' There is every chance of my client being acquitted . '
Although Sharif faces the death penalty , few observers here believe the military regime would carry out the sentence ."
2000-03-09,"Pakistan 's deposed prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , told a court yesterday that the military had plotted to overthrow his government and then trumped up hijacking charges against him .
Mr Sharif , 52 , looked relaxed and confident as he gave evidence for the first time at his trial in an anti - terrorism court in the capital , Karachi .
He has been in detention since being overthrown by Pakistan 's army chief , General Pervez Musharraf , in a bloodless coup on October 12 . ""
This case has been framed against me at the behest of General Pervez Musharraf , "" Mr Sharif said .
"" He bore a grudge against me on a number of accounts and had already prepared a blueprint for the overthrow of my government .
He framed me in this case to divert attention from his own crimes . ""
Mr Sharif , his brother Shah baz and five former senior government officials have been charged with attempted murder , hijacking , kidnapping and terrorism .
All have pleaded not guilty .
They face the death penalty if convicted .
On the day of the coup Mr Sharif sacked Gen Musharraf and prosecutors claim he then tried to stop a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft carrying the general from landing in Pakistan , risking the lives of the 198 people on board .
The plane landed only after the army seized the airport and within hours Gen Musharraf had declared himself Pakistan 's chief executive .
Mr Sharif denied trying to stop the plane landing and said flight PK 805 was under the control of the general himself .
He said the coup was sparked by last year 's Kargil crisis , a military showdown between Pakistan and India in the disputed state of Kashmir , which almost started a war between the two nuclear powers .
Under pressure from Washington , Pakistan eventually ordered Muslim militants who had crossed the Line of Control into Indian Kashmir to pull back .
Pakistan 's army , led by Gen Musharraf at the time , was understood to be angry at the apparent climbdown .
"" Kargil was one of the most serious crises in Pakistan 's history , which posed a grave danger to the integrity of the country , "" Mr Sharif said .
"" I saved my country from major crises , but unfortunately could not save myself and the system . ""
He said Gen Musharraf turned against him because of the Kargil episode . ""
He was playing hide and seek on this issue not only with me but also with the armed forces .
My objection to this conduct became a source of resentment for him , "" said Mr Sharif , who claimed that prosecution witnesses had been tortured to give evidence against him ."
2000-03-11,"Three smartly dressed gunmen walked into an office in Karachi yesterday and shot dead one of the leading defence lawyers representing Pakistan 's deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif .
Iqbal Raad was hit several times in the chest and died in his chair at his second - floor office in the Paradise Chambers building in central Karachi .
Two other men in the room , an office worker and a judge 's son , were also killed in the attack .
The shooting comes two days after Mr Sharif gave evidence at his trial and accused Pakistan 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , of plotting to overthrow his government and inventing charges against him .
Witnesses said the gunmen , who were carrying a Kalashnikov rifle and pistols , ran from the building into a waiting car and disappeared in the crowded traffic .
Crowds gathered outside the lawyer 's offices together with Mr Raad 's wife and two sons as the bloodstained bodies were carried out .
"" This could be an act of sabotage to damage the smooth functioning of the trial .
It could be personal enmity .
We are not sure , "" said a senior police superintendent , Akhtar Hussain Gorchani .
Guns , including automatic weapons , are easily bought and sold across Pakistan although the government has tried to tackle the problem with a ban on the issuing of new arms licences .
Karachi , the capital of Sindh province in southern Pakistan , is one of the country 's most violent cities .
More than 4,000 people have died there in the past four years in a catalogue of political , ethnic and sectarian violence .
In September 1996 Mir Murtaza Bhutto , the brother of then prime minister Benazir Bhutto , was killed in a police shooting .
Other defence lawyers in the Sharif case criticised the country 's military rulers for not providing them with better protection .
"" We need proper security .
It will be very difficult for us to attend the proceedings unless we are given the right security , "" said Khwaja Sultan , the leading defence counsel in the trial .
He said he would discuss the shooting with the judge at the next hearing on Monday .
Mr Sharif , his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials are on trial before a Karachi anti - terrorism court charged with attempted murder , hijacking , kidnapping and terrorism in a case based on the night of the October military coup .
All deny the charges .
If convicted they face the death penalty .
Another of Mr Raad 's senior colleagues , Ijaz Batalvi , who withdrew from the defence team last month in protest at the judge , said the lawyers had been closely followed during the trial .
Two weeks ago Mr Raad had a fax machine and telephone stolen from his office .
"" We have been watched , our telephones were tapped but we were ready for that , "" Mr Batalvi said .
"" This is different .
This is real terror .
I was never expecting something like this .
I am shocked and I am sad . ""
Mr Raad was the former advocate general of Sindh province and also worked as a legal adviser to the former prime minister 's Pakistan Muslim League party .
"" It is extraordinary that this happened at a time when the case against Nawaz Sharif has entered a crucial stage , "" said Raja Zafar - ul Haq , one of the party 's senior leaders .
He said Mr Raad had received threats .
The trial is drawing to a close and the prosecution had been due to start summing up on Monday .

2000-03-12,"Lawyers for Pakistan 's deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif insisted yesterday his trial should be moved away from Karachi after one of his defence team was shot dead .
The demand is likely to further delay the drawn - out case , which was due to resume tomorrow .
Iqbal Raad was killed with two other men as he sat at his desk on Friday .
Three gunmen , one carrying a Kalashnikov rifle and the others pistols , ran from the building into a waiting car .
Police have made no arrests and no one has claimed responsibility for the murders .
Hundreds of lawyers gathered for Raad 's funeral .
Sharif himself asked to leave jail to attend the burial but permission was refused .
Sharif 's defence team said they would not attend tomorrow 's hearing . '
We want a change of venue to Islam abad or Lahore , ' said Khwaja Sultan , the leading defence counsel . '
We will not be going to Karachi .
It is not safe . '
He said Raad and other colleagues had received telephone threats before the shooting and complained they were given less security than prosecutors in the case . '
We have to queue up to go into court every day alongside the public .
Anyone could be amongst them , ' he said .
Sultan said he had received one threatening telephone call warning him about his involvement in the case . '
I simply ignored it , ' he said .
The murder of his colleague , he said , was probably an attempt to disrupt the trial of Sharif , who was overthrown in a military coup last October . '
There are so many powers interested in sabotaging the case , ' he said .
Sharif , his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials have been charged with attempted murder , hijacking , kidnapping and terrorism in a case based on the night of the coup .
All have pleaded not guilty .
They face the death penalty if convicted .
Raad was a close friend of Sharif , who promoted him to be advocate general of southern Sindh province two years ago , and ironically helped set up the anti - terrorism court now trying the former prime minister .
He also worked as an adviser for Sharif 's party , the Pakistan Muslim League ."
2000-03-17,"Built by Nawaz Sharif as his official office in Islamabad , the huge Mogul - style building with its empty red - brick towers and green lawns speaks volumes for the deposed Pakistani prime minister 's extravagant taste .
Which makes the chief executive 's secretariat , as it is known today , an odd place for the army to base its anti - corruption task force after seizing power in a coup last October .
Odder still is the army 's choice as lead investigator for the high - profile operation .
Farouk Adam Khan , the 54-year - old prosecutor general for accountability , sits under a portrait of Pakistan 's founder , Mohammed Ali Jinnah , in the rather plain , octagonal room 401-D. Trained at Sandhurst and decorated in Pakistan 's 1965 and 1971 wars against India , his military career was brought to an abrupt end when he was court - martialled in 1974 after a group of army officers made a failed attempt to overthrow the prime minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto .
Now , working under a four - star general at the national accountability bureau , Mr Khan is responsible for chasing Pakistan 's missing billions .
He has just returned from Europe where he asked Interpol to act on 40 arrest warrants .
Those on the list include high - profile figures like Rehman Malik , the former chief of Pakistan 's federal investigation agency , and Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao , the former chief minister of North - West Frontier province .
"" They are a gallery of rogues , "" said Mr Khan .
More names will be added soon , he promised .
General Pervez Musharraf , who led the October coup , used the corruption of Pakistan as a justification for seizing power and set up accountability courts and extended sentencing powers .
In November , 50 people were arrested , including many senior businessmen , and more arrests will come in the next few weeks , Mr Khan said .
Although many welcome an attack on corruption , businessmen fear the arrests may discourage investors , and political groups are complaining about the slow pace of the work and questioning why the army is not also being investigated .
Two cases have been registered against Mr Sharif , who is on trial for his life in Karachi , charged with attempted murder and hijacking .
He is accused of avoiding tax on his purchase of a £ 1.3 m Russian Mi-8 helicopter in 1993 , and one of his family businesses , the Ittefaq foundry , is accused of defaulting on a 729 m rupee ( £ 8.6 m ) loan .
At least 16 more cases are ready to be filed against the former prime minister , said Mr Khan .
"" This is one of the Sharif cases , "" he said , his hand resting on a two - inch thick green file . ""
There is so much work involved .
We are not taking any chances . ""
In the past there were a lot of allegations that prosecutions were politically motivated .
We have made it a basic policy that none of our prosecutions are going to be politically motivated , "" he said .
Benazir Bhutto , a former prime minister living in London , is a "" proclaimed offender "" .
She and her husband were convicted in April last year of taking kickbacks from a Swiss firm and were sentenced to five years in jail , fined $ 8.6 m and banned from politics for seven years .
Mr Khan is waiting for a Swiss court to unlock some of the money involved in the case .
"" We have got a lot of money expected from the proceedings in Switzerland , "" he said .
"" I do n't want the embarrassment of her back here and creating a martyr out of her .
But where her assets were acquired through illegal means they should be returned to Pakistan .
And I will get them . ""
Mr Khan is working in a country steeped in corruption .
A small group among the elite has combined outstanding loans of an estimated 211bn rupees , a third of the national budget .
Then there are the kickbacks , tax evasion , embezzlement and money laundering . ""
By the time we 're through
we are going to try our utmost to eradicate the culture of massive corruption , "" said Mr Khan .
His young team of investigators has risen from a paltry 15 to more than 100 , still barely enough to handle the workload .
"" I 'm not talking about a police inspector taking 100 rupees .
I 'm talking about massive corruption , the millions and the billions , "" he said .
Others have promised as much in the past and not delivered .
But this time the military has staked its legitimacy on the work being done by Mr Khan in his red - brick tower ."
2000-04-01,"The wife of the deposed Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , yesterday threatened to defy the military regime and bring protesters out on to the streets if her husband is convicted in his hijacking trial next week .
Kulsoom Sharif already faces a charge of treason after making an angry speech to hundreds of workers from her husband 's Pakistan Muslim League last month .
"" If the decision is not positive then we will go and demonstrate , "" Mrs Sharif , 45 , said from her family 's sprawling Raiwind estate , on the outskirts of Lahore .
Next Thursday an anti - terrorism court judge in Karachi will deliver his verdict on Mr Sharif and may sentence him to death .
The former prime minister , his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials are charged with hijacking , attempted murder , kidnapping and terrorism .
They have all pleaded not guilty .
Prosecutors say that on October 12 Mr Sharif sacked his army chief , General Pervez Musharraf , and then tried to stop a commercial aircraft carrying the general landing in Pakistan , risking the lives of the 198 people on board .
The general landed after the army took control of Karachi airport and within hours he staged a coup .
Last month Gen Musharraf announced a ban on political rallies . ""
Let them ban all these things , "" said Mrs Sharif , who sat dressed in a flowing pink shalwar kameez trouser suit and clutching a mobile telephone .
She has spent the past five months travelling from the green lawns and golden wheat fields of Raiwind , in her husband 's political heartland , across the country in a desperate attempt to raise support for his cause .
"" They have banned them but the rallies are still there in Faisalabad , in Multan , in Hyderabad .
We have demonstrated and they can not do anything , "" she said .
"" Every Pakistani is with me and everybody in the army is with me , except the generals . ""
But few Pakistanis took to the streets to resist army rule in the days immediately after the coup , nor have they marched in the five months since .
Their reluctance is a sign of the resentment that many felt towards Mr Sharif , one of the country 's wealthiest businessmen whose family stands accused of widespread corruption .
Senior leaders in Mr Sharif 's party have also been slow to lead protests , perhaps worried about their careers .
"" They are not complaining , "" Mrs Sharif said .
"" Sometimes it does disappoint me . ""
Already lawyers are preparing to appeal against a guilty verdict .
"" They have not found a single piece of evidence that he was guilty of hijacking .
It was all a pre - planned story , "" she said .
"" [ Musharraf ] is a vindictive general . ""
Diplomats say Mr Sharif can expect a guilty verdict , although even if the court sentences him to death , the military will probably commute the sentence on appeal ; Pakistan 's sickly economy still needs loans and the new regime is unlikely to risk scaring international lenders .
Yet in the background of Pakistan 's brief and troubled political history remains the disturbing precedent of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , the prime minister hanged on April 4 1979 , after he was overthrown by another general , Zia ul - Haq .
Reports have suggested that the Sharif family has reached an out - of - court agreement to pay the regime in order to avoid the death penalty or a lengthy jail sentence .
But Mrs Sharif denied these and ruled out the possibility of going into exile .
"" There is no agreement .
Nobody came to him , nobody came to me , "" she said .
"" This is our country .
Where can we go ? ""
With Mr Sharif in jail there are no heavyweight political figures left in Pakistan to challenge the military .
His arch - rival , Benazir Bhutto , a former prime minister , is in London and faces a five - year jail term and a heavy fine for corruption if she returns to Pakistan .
Even after the hijacking trial , the Sharif family will find itself under pressure from a string of corruption investigations into huge sugar , steel , textile and paper interests .
Two cases against the family have already been registered and another 16 will follow , in vestigators say .
Mrs Sharif insists that the Raiwind estate and four Park Lane apartments are the fruit of business profits , not political kickbacks . ""
Having property is not illegal , "" she said .
"" The Sharif family is not at all corrupt and , insh'allah [ God willing ] , we will prove it one day . """
2000-04-06,"Robin Cook , the foreign secretary , has expressed misgivings at the trial of former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who was found guilty of terrorism and hijacking and sentenced to life in prison .
Although Mr Sharif was spared death by hanging , Mr Cook said he was disturbed by a number of aspects of the trial . ""
These include changing the terms of the trial to include hijacking in the anti - terrorist laws after the alleged event , and the questionable judicial climate , given the forced oaths of allegiances for the senior judiciary , "" he said .
Mr Sharif was spared the death sentence which the prosecution had demanded for hijacking , a capital offence .
The court also cleared him of kidnapping and attempted murder and acquitted his brother Shabaz and five others of all charges against them .
Mr Sharif and his co - defendants had denied all charges .
Mr Sharif 's son Hasan said in London that his father would appeal against the verdict .
Mr Cook said the British government would watch the appeal process closely and would reserve its view until the full judicial process had been completed .
"" There is no longer any justice in Pakistan .
Now my case rests with God , "" Mr Sharif said after the verdict .
The charges arose after Mr Sharif refused to let a passenger plane carrying General Pervez Musharraf , the army chief , land in Pakistan on October 12 .
The army seized power that night and installed Gen Musharraf as the country 's military leader .
Kulsoom Nawaz , Mr Sharif 's wife , and dozens of Sharif supporters yelled angrily inside the court when the verdict was announced , but officials of Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League party have said they will not ask their supporters to take to the streets .
Mr Sharif has the right of appeal against the sentence , which means a jail term of 25 years . ""
Obviously we are going to file an appeal within seven days , "" Haleem Siddiqi , a leading member of Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League , told reporters .
President Bill Clinton appealed for clemency for Mr Sharif during a six - hour visit to Islamabad last month and Gen Musharraf , chief executive of the military - led government , has consistently said he is not a vindictive man .
But Gen Musharraf also said it was up to the court to decide , stressing that the court was independent .
Gen Musharraf claims he is a reluctant army leader and only seized power to prevent the country sliding further into chaos .
At pains to rescue Pakistan from further political isolation after the army coup , he says he has only suspended the constitution and not imposed full martial law ."
2000-04-06,"Nawaz Sharif has paid a heavy price for committing the cardinal sin of Pakistani politics : he tried to challenge the awesome power of the military .
Whether in power or lurking on the margins of it , successive army bosses have demanded the right to guide the nation 's destiny .
Some , like Ayub Khan in the 60s , have been outright dictators .
Others , like Zia ul - Haq in the 80s , cloaked their authoritarianism under a veneer of constitutional propriety .
In between , and since , there have been army chiefs who preferred to pull the strings of political puppets , without appearing on stage .
Nawaz Sharif was a Zia protege , who rose to provincial power in Punjab as a competent , albeit corrupt , administrator .
When the dictator was assassinated in 1988 - the plane crash in which he died has never been fully explained - Sharif was swept aside in the wave of popular support for Benazir Bhutto , daughter of the prime minister martyred by Zia in the late 70s .
Bhutto , a striking young woman saying all the correct democratic things , dazzled the world , but duped her own country .
After a couple of years of corruption , she was ditched by the shadowy coalition of interests represented by Sharif 's Muslim League and the military establishment .
In 1993 , it was Sharif 's turn to feel the hot breath of the army on his neck , as he was manoeuvred from the seat of power .
The Bhutto dynasty was back , and once again they blew it .
Asif Ali Zardari , Benazir 's husband , amassed a vast financial empire , but could not defend it against the rising wrath of jealous rivals .
In 1997 , Bhutto was again dismissed , to be paraded with her husband through the mockery of a deeply flawed judicial system .
Back in the prime minister 's chair , Sharif set about tinkering with the constitution and legal code .
He wanted to tighten the law on terrorism and subversion in his unruly land , setting up an system of arbitrary special courts - the very system which has now brought him low .
The rumbles of serious military discontent began last summer when the prime minister , alarmed by the escalating conflict with India in the high mountains of divided Kashmir , ordered his army chiefs to pull back .
To compound the insult , he tried to divide and rule the cantonments , by appointing his own placeman to head the immensely powerful and semi - autonomous ISI military intelligence organisation .
By last September , the chiefs of staff were visibly seething with discontent , holding highly publicised meetings to discuss "" national defence issues "" .
Washington took the rare step of publicly warning the generals against a coup .
Perhaps emboldened by US support , Sharif launched what he fondly hoped would be a pre - emptive strike
In October , when army chief Pervez Musharraf visited Sri Lanka , the prime minister dismissed his top soldier and forbade his return to Pakistan .
But the general was already in the air over Karachi , and his aircraft was running out of fuel .
Dismayed military chiefs overruled the prime minister , and ordered air traffic control to led Musharrif 's plane land .
From the moment his feet touched the ground , Sharif was doomed .
That night , he was under house arrest .
Now , he is facing an indeterminate jail sentence , which prosecutors suggest will be 25 years .
He was found guilty , absurdly , of hijacking and terrorism , but acquitted on the slightly more plausible charge of attempted murder .
There can be few Pakistanis today who believe that Sharif , who is 51 , will really stay in prison for the rest of his days .
He is not the most impressive of politicians , being furtive in demeanour and dull of speech .
But he is the most wily and astute of Pakistan 's occasional civilian rulers , and he still has a formidable power base in Punjab .
That the court acquitted all his six co - defendants , and declined to pass the death sentence demanded by the prosecution , is a signal that not even the judicial system is wholly in the pocket of the generals .
But for the moment it is they , and not the judges or the politicians or the voters , who rule supreme .

The News"
2000-04-07,"Pakistan 's deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif was last night beginning a life sentence after a court convicted him of plotting against the man who subsequently ousted him from power in last October 's military coup , General Pervez Musharraf .
The anti - terrorism court found Sharif guilty of hijacking and terrorism , but cleared him of attempted murder and kidnapping .
He was spared the death penalty .
His brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials were acquitted .
The defendants had denied all charges .
Sharif 's lawyers immediately announced that they would appeal against the verdict , which effectively ends the political career of a man twice elected prime minister , and ensures that the most troublesome opponent of Pakistan 's new military regime remains behind bars .
Last night his wife , Kulsoom Sharif , said he was the victim of a "" personal vendetta "" by Pakistan 's military leader and accused the judge of delivering a verdict written by someone else .
"" My husband is innocent .
He has done nothing wrong .
This is a politically motivated judgment under pressure .
Only my husband was targeted .
That is what they wanted .
Such a judgment will make the nation hang its head in shame , "" she said .
The foreign secretary , Robin Cook , yesterday expressed his concern .
"" From the outset we have called for a fair and transparent trial .
But we are disturbed about a number of aspects , "" he said .
"" These include changing the terms of the trial to include hijacking in the anti - terrorist laws after the alleged event , and the questionable judicial climate given the forced oaths of allegiances for the senior judiciary . ""
Under Pakistani law Sharif , who is 50 , will serve 25 years if his life term is not reduced by either the high court or the supreme court .
"" We feel we have a very good case to fight because the others accused were all acquitted on the same charges , "" defence lawyer Naveed Malik said .
Prosecutors during the two - month trial had claimed Sharif tried to stop a commercial aircraft with Gen Musharraf on board from landing in Pakistan , risking the lives of 198 passengers .
The general - whom Sharif had just sacked - only landed after the army took control of Karachi airport , staging a coup hours later on October 12 last year .
Before the hearings - during which a defence lawyer was shot dead - Pakistan 's judges were forced to swear an oath of allegiance to Gen Musharraf .
Those who refused , including the chief justice , lost their jobs .
Giving judgment in a packed courtroom in Karachi , Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri said Sharif had ordered three fire engines to block the runway and had the landing lights switched off .
"" If the plane had landed in the presence of these things it would have crashed , "" he said .
"" The effect of the hijack was to create terror and insecurity in people and the passengers on board . ""
Several of Sharif 's relatives wept when the verdict was read out .
Others began to chant "" Nawaz Sharif zindabad "" ( Long live Nawaz Sharif ) .
The former prime minister looked grim .
"" We are just devastated , "" Saadia Abbasi , the sister of one of the defendants , said .
"" This is a ridiculous judgment .
The evidence is biased . ""
The prosecution yesterday announced they would appeal against Sharif 's sentence and demand the death penalty - an option which Pakistan 's military rulers were well aware would have provoked international outrage .
Twenty - one years ago , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , Pakistan 's first elected prime minister , was executed by the military after a coup .
Speaking outside court , Javed Jabbar , Gen Musharraf 's national adviser , said : "" We want Nawaz Sharif to be subject to the same law he formulated and promulgated "" , a reference to the draconian anti - terrorism law the prime minister introduced after his election victory in 1997 .
The court also fined Sharif 3 m rupees ( £ 40,000 ) , including 10,000 rupees compensation to each of the passengers on board the Pakistan International Airlines flight from Colombo in Sri Lanka to Karachi - Gen Musharraf among them .
The judge also confiscated all Sharif 's property .
Technically he owns none - the Sharif family estate in Lahore is not registered in his name . ""
He does not even have a bank account in his name , "" a relative said .
Yesterday 's verdict consolidates Gen Musharraf 's position as chief executive of the world 's most precarious nuclear nation and leaves the country 's democratic parties headless and in disarray .
While loyalists from Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League insist he will continue to lead the party from prison , others will attempt to find a new leader .
The verdict provoked little reaction on the streets of Pakistan .
Public demonstrations were banned last month by Gen Musharraf in advance of a brief visit from President Clinton , who had urged the military regime to show clemency towards its deposed ruler .
Sharif 's daughter Mariam said her father would become an even greater leader from jail .
"" We were born in Pakistan and we will die in Pakistan , "" she declared .
Sharif still faces two outstanding corruption charges and investigators are preparing 16 other cases against him .

Investigators have discovered that the Mayfair properties are registered to two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands .
At the weekend officials accused Sharif of concealing ownership of the properties at the time of his 1997 election victory and formally registered a corruption case against him .
He faces four other corruption charges , with at least seven more cases pending .
In a sign that General Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's military leader , has not finished with the man he toppled , Sharif is expected to appear in court again this month and faces the prospect of several lengthy corruption trials stretching over several years .
"" Sharif was involved in evasion of taxes , money laundering , circumventing procedures and railroading legislation specifically to benefit family concerns , "" Farouk Adam Khan , the chief corruption prosecutor , said .
"" We would like to confront him with information we have collected . ""
Sharif 's six co - defendants , who were last week acquitted in the hijacking case , have been arrested again .
His brother Shahbaz , a former chief minister of Punjab , has been moved to the Attock Fort jail , pending a corruption trial .
Mr Sharif is expected to appeal against his terrorism conviction today .
Investigators have been attempting to trace his assets since he was detained following the military coup in October .
They claim that he siphoned off "" hundreds of millions of pounds "" from Pakistan throughout his politcal career , hiding the money in Jersey , Guernsey and Switzerland .
Sources at Pakistan 's national accountability bureau say that Mr Sharif concealed ownership of his Park Lane apartments by registering them in the name of two British Virgin Island offshore companies .
The flats are managed by a firm of British solicitors .
The companies have two Swiss bankers as nominees .
"" We believe the money used to buy these apartments was stolen from the people of Pakistan , "" Mr Khan added .
Sharif , who is 50 , allegedly bought the properties with money borrowed from state - run Pakistani banks , and failed to repay it .
Although technically bankrupt , he is one of Pakistan 's richest men .
He owns an estate , several townhouses and a lucrative steel , sugar , textile and paper empire .
All these are registered to his wife Kulsoom , daughter Mariam and other relatives .
They deny impropriety . ""
Having property is not illegal .
The Sharif family is not at all corrupt and insh'allah ( God willing ) we will prove it one day , "" Mrs Sharif said recently .
"" The Park Lane flats were bought because the children were studying in London . ""
For the past six months investigators have been piecing together how Sharif 's wealth increased by 800 % since his appointment as Punjab chief minister in 1985 , and between 1990 - 1993 , when he first became prime minister .
He is accused of failing to pay tax on a Russian Mi-8 helicopter , not declaring income tax and defaulting on two loans worth £ 24 m .
Under Pakistan 's military rulers , corruption charges have been filed against 85 people , including politicians , bureaucrats , businessmen and bankers , many associated with the Sharif regime .
Others were officials who served under Benazir Bhutto , prime minister 1988 - 1990 and 1993 - 1996 .
She is now in exile in London , after fleeing Pakistan last year shortly before a court sentenced her to five years for corruption .
Sharif 's younger brother Abbas and son Hussain have been in prison for several months .
So far they have not been charged .
Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League met last night in Islamabad to discuss the future .
Sharif 's family insist that he still runs the party from jail ."
2000-07-10,"The wife of Pakistan 's deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif was penned in her Lahore home last night , surrounded by armed police desperate to stop her leading an anti - government rally .
Police detained Kulsoom Sharif for 10 hours , at one point using a crane to tow away her Toyota car while she sat inside it with colleagues .
Officers arrested at least 200 members of her husband 's Pakistan Muslim League to stop the rally going ahead .
Riot police raided a Muslim League meeting in Rawalpindi and detained another 30 people .
Party workers say up to 1,000 people have been detained nationwide since Friday .
What would have been a small - scale protest quickly turned into an ugly demonstration of the tough arm of the military , which seized power in a coup in October .
The operation comes just days after the British government lifted the arms embargo on Pakistan and agreed to resume supplies of naval and other equipment .
Last night Mrs Sharif insisted she would try again to stage the rally , in which a motorcade would have driven 300 miles from Lahore to Peshawar , in north - west Pakistan .
"" I want to say to the military government that their days are numbered .
They have to go back to the barracks and allow the political process to continue , "" she said .
Pakistan 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , suspended parliament immediately after the coup and this year banned political rallies .
Nawaz Sharif has been jailed for life on charges of hijacking and terrorism , and now faces a string of corruption charges .
Party support for his wife has been limited and she has not appeared a serious threat to the regime .
But the police crackdown may have improved her credibility . ""
Kulsoom Nawaz , who only two days ago was flailing in a destructive intra - party storm , is wearing the badge of a lady - leader who can make iron men run for extra security measures , "" the newspaper the News said .
Police began their operation with dawn raids on Friday , arresting dozens of party workers across Lahore , the Sharif stronghold .
Armed officers surrounded one of the family 's houses , in the city 's smart Model Town suburb , and disconnected the telephone lines .
But on Saturday Mrs Sharif slipped through the cordon and led police on a 10-mile car chase across the city before the road was blocked .
She refused to leave her car and so police attached a crane to the front bumper and hauled it to a police compound .
After a 10-hour standoff she was allowed to drive home . ""
Hundreds of police are still surrounding our home .
We are under house arrest , "" Mrs Sharif 's 26-year - old daughter Mariam Safdar said last night .
"" But my mother has now become a greater leader .
She has more determination , more courage
and I think more popularity . """
2000-07-23,"Pakistan 's deposed Prime Minister , Nawaz Sharif , was sentenced to 14 years of ' rigorous imprisonment ' yesterday when he was convicted in the first of several corruption trials .
Sharif , who was overthrown in a coup in October , was also banned from holding public office for 21 years and fined 20 million rupees ( £ 250,000 ) .
He is already serving two life terms for hijacking and terrorism in connection with the military takeover , and he condemned the verdict as a personal vendetta led by the military .
Accountability Court judge Farrukh Latif acquitted Saifur Rehman , Sharif 's own former anti - corruption chief .
Rehman was also acquitted in the hijacking trial earlier this year , but faces other corruption charges . '
There is only one target in this country and that is Nawaz Sharif , ' the former Prime Minister said after the brief court hearing in Attock Fort , a military compound .
He was found guilty of failing to pay tax on a £ 600,000 Russian Mi-8 helicopter which he leased and then bought in October 1993 and used for electioneering .
Sharif already enjoys ' A ' class privileges in jail and the balding 50-year - old is likely to be able to avoid hard labour , despite the sentence .
Lawyers for the former Prime Minister boycotted the trial but , after the hearing , Sharif claimed the helicopter had crashed before his tax returns were due and so its cost was not included . '
There was no corruption , no kickbacks , no public funds misappropriated , no embezzlement , ' he said . '
But I was expecting this verdict .
It has been announced by the judge but of course on behalf of somebody else .
There is noth ing worth the name "" independent "" in this country . '
Sharif has claimed Pakistan 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , has singled him and his family out for punishment since the coup .
Musharraf seized power shortly after Sharif sacked him as army chief .
Farouk Adam Khan , the chief prosecutor , insisted the case had been fair . '
This was a free and fair trial , ' he said .
Sharif is already appealing against the two life terms imposed by an anti - terrorism court earlier this year , but the government is also appealing against the sentence , arguing Sharif should face the death penalty instead .
Pakistan 's new military regime has pledged to tackle the country 's pervasive corruption , with Sharif and his family the main target .
A team from the FBI will arrive in Islamabad next month to help to train the newly established National Accountability Bureau in investigating white - collar crime .
The National Accountability Bureau has broad powers of investigation and arrest and under law is allowed to hold a suspect for 90 days without charge .
The former Prime Minister faces several more corruption cases based on allegations that he stole hundreds of mil lions of pounds during his two terms in power .
Despite being one of Pakistan 's richest men , Sharif paid no income tax in the year 1994 - 9'5 , the accountability court heard , because he claimed all his income was from agriculture , which until now has never been taxed in Pakistan .
Last week prosecutors charged him with tax evasion for failing to declare income used to buy and develop his lavish £ 2.9 million , 100-acre family estate in Raiwind , near Lahore .
The estate was purchased under the name of his mother , Shamim Akther , who together with Sharif 's powerful father , Mian Mohammed Sharif , is also named in the charges .
Sharif has also been charged with defaulting on bank loans given to two of his companies .
He has been questioned over how he was able to buy four Park Lane apartments , which are registered to two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands .
Sharif has denied the allegations and insists he is being victimised by the military regime .
But he is losing friends fast .
Many in his Pakistan Muslim League party and now even his brother Shahbaz , who faces his own corruption cases , say they would rather accommodate with the army than risk confronting it .
The trial was the first civilian case to be heard in the 16th - century Attock Fort , which has been used for at least three military courts- martial for attempted coups .
Khan , the accountability prosecutor - general who led the case against Sharif , was jailed here for 13 months in 1973 for his part in a failed military takeover .
Now the fort , which stands between Islamabad and Peshawar , is the base of the army 's elite commando unit , the Special Services Group ."

A report in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted the head of archives at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation as saying that many of the files presumed missing were in the foundation 's possession and it would allow the government to see them sometime next month .

He is already serving two life sentences passed in April .
But it is unclear whether Saturday 's ban will be considered legal if and when constitutional democracy is restored .
Mr Sharif refuses to recognise the court .

2000-11-21,"Pakistan 's biggest political parties have finally agreed to end their bitter feuding and work together to bring down the military regime which seized power in a coup more than a year ago .
The agreement caused a serious row yesterday in the ranks of the Pakistan Muslim League , the party of Nawaz Sharif , the ousted prime minister who is serving a life sentence for hijacking .
Senior members opposed to an alliance with their erstwhile opponents stormed into the party headquarters in the capital , Islamabad , ripped portraits of Mr Sharif from the wall , and burned them , cheered on by hundreds of supporters outside .
But Kulsoom Sharif , Mr Sharif 's wife , is in favour of the alliance and has most of the Muslim League firmly on her side .
"" I will make it a national movement so that the entire political fraternity joins hands against the military rulers for the restoration of democracy , "" she said .
The agreement , which aligns the League with Benazir Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's Party and most of the smaller political groups , comes at a difficult time for the military government .
General Pervez Musharraf , the army chief who led the coup , has been struggling to revive the economy and is facing a growing chorus of criticism in the press .
Since the coup in October last year , 14 senior civilian appointees have resigned from his government The latest , last week , was his outspoken corruption prosecutor , Farouk Adam Khan .
He announced his departure after the general running the anti - corruption body , the National Accountability Bureau , was replaced .
"" This has been a task of gigantic proportions , "" he said .
"" I think we made our share of mistakes , and when I approached this job I think I was naive . ""
Mr Khan 's draconian laws , under which the bureau could hold suspects for 90 days without charge , brought a barrage of criticism .
He was under pressure from politicians and businessmen to ease up on his prosecutions and received death threats from corruption suspects in Peshawar , in northern Pakistan . ""
The situation in Pakistan is such that only a draconian law could even begin to set right what is there for everyone to see , "" he said .
"" We are talking about a culture of corruption that is widespread and pervasive . ""
The flood of resignations has raised questions about the freedom given to civilians to operate under military rule .
Others who have resigned include the information minister , Javed Jabbar , who was asked to quit by Gen Musharraf last month for failing to project a sufficiently positive image of the regime .
The general said at the time that nobody was indispensable and he would accept resignations from anyone . ""
Selection is on merit and continuation is on performance , "" he said .
Gen Musharraf has been hoping to improve his government 's image abroad by holding local elections , starting next month .
But a new computerised electoral rollcompiled at the cost of £ 7 m by an agency run by one of his generals was rejected last week after it was found to be riddled with errors ."
2000-11-28,"A year after the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) was pushed out of government in a military coup the party is in a shambles .
The party 's chief Nawaz Sharif is serving a life sentence for hijacking and 14 years for corruption .
In a country where personalities make political parties , the PML is left confused and riddled with infighting .
Mr Sharif 's wife , Kulsoom , has taken charge , though she has no position in the party and barely spoke out while her husband was in power .
She has led the PML into an alliance with its arch rival , the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) , led by Benazir Bhutto .
The two parties have dominated political life since the last military dictator , General Zia ul - Haq , died in a plane crash in 1988 .
Several of the PML 's senior leaders including Gen Zia 's son , Ijaz ul - Haq , are infuriated by Mrs Sharif 's sudden influence and the idea of an allegiance with Mrs Bhutto .
They prefer reconciliation with the military regime .
Both sides are taking a huge gamble .
Mrs Sharif 's alliance with the PPP against the military represents a staggering about - face for the party .
And their call for democracy is raising some eyebrows in Pakistan .
When he was elected prime minister for the second time in 1997 , Mr Sharif scrapped the president 's most important powers , particularly his right to sack the elected government .
Eventually the president resigned and was replaced by a friend of the Sharif family .
The prime minister also picked a fight with the chief justice , forcing him out after hundreds of PML workers stormed the supreme court .
He then appointed his brother Shahbaz to chief minister of Punjab , the second most powerful position in Pakistan .
The family grew incredibly wealthy , leading to Mr Sharif 's conviction on corruption charges .
For 12 years the PML was defined by its opposition to Mrs Bhutto 's PPP .
Nawaz Sharif was encouraged by General Zia , the man who hanged Benazir 's father .
The cross - party alliance is not new .
Its leader , the veteran kingmaker Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan , has led alliances against Mrs Bhutto with the support of Mr Sharif and alliances against Mr Sharif with the support of Mrs Bhutto .
But it may be that Nawaz Sharif has gone too far in approving this alliance .
"" It is an open question whether Nawaz voters and supporters will ditch him for this heretical conduct , but his political standing , and by that token the political rating of his faction , will suffer , "" said The News , a leading English language newspaper .
300 party dissidents , who opposed the alliance , stormed the party 's Islamabad headquarters last week , tearing down and burning pictures of Nawaz Sharif .
Mr Sharif 's supporters noted that the police stood by and allowed the riot to continue , perhaps in the hope of derailing the cross - party alliance against the military .
Last weekend another group of dissidents climbed on to the roof of the party office in Lahore and posed for cameras with their pistols , shotguns and Kalashnikov rifles , a blatant and unpunished defiance of the government 's new curb on weapons .
One of them , Mr ul - Haq , has been widely tipped to become the prime minister , with the military ruler General Pervez Musharraf installing himself as president .
This split in the PML may be Mr ul - Haq 's way of moving closer to the military in the hope of greater glory .
If so he may have already lost the support of a large and crucial slice of his party .

2000-12-11,"The deposed Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif began a new life in exile in Saudi Arabia last night after being released from prison by the military regime which toppled him from power .
He flew from Pakistan early yesterday after General Pervez Musharraf 's government unexpectedly announced that his life sentence had been commuted .
He had been in jail since the military coup 14 months ago , convicted of kidnapping , hijacking and corruption .
He landed in Jeddah yesterday afternoon in a private jet belonging to the Saudi royal family .
He was accompanied by 18 members of his family , including his wife Kulsoom , his three children and his elderly parents .
The party was immediately whisked off on a pilgrimage to Mecca .
Mr Sharif was due to return to the Saudi capital , Riyadh , for a medical check - up . ""
Nawaz Sharif and family have been exiled to Saudi Arabia .
The decision has been taken in the best interest of the country and the people of Pakistan , "" the Pakistan government said in a statement .
Earlier it had said that Mr Sharif had requested permission to travel abroad for medical treatment .
On Saturday he was granted a Saudi visa , causing rumours that his release was imminent .
As a condition of his exile , Mr Sharif has agreed not to take part in politics in Pakistan for 21 years .
He has also forfeited property worth $ 8.3 m ( £ 5.7 m ) and agreed to pay a fine of $ 500,000 .
His brothers Abbas and Shahbaz , who were serving jail sentences for corruption , were also freed and allowed to leave .
Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League revealed yesterday that an unnamed member of the Saudi royal family had negotiated his release .
"" This is purely a humanitarian gesture by the kingdom and has nothing to do with politics .
Mr Sharif has pledged not to undertake any political activity while in Saudi Arabia , "" a Saudi official said last night .
The deal is an ignominious end to Mr Sharif 's political career : he is the first former prime minister of Pakistan to be exiled .
His predecessor Benazir Bhutto is living in self - imposed exile in London .
As the family left Islamabad yesterday , his wife said : "" We are not running away in the darkness of night .
We are being expelled from this country . ""
She said her husband was suffering from a heart con dition and high blood pressure .
She added : "" Pakistan will never be far from our hearts .
We pray that our countrymen will be prosperous and whenever Nawaz Sharif 's health is better , we will come back . ""
Mr Sharif was taken to the airport from the fort near Islamabad where he was serving his sentence .
His deal with the government has dismayed many of his political allies , who only a week ago joined other parties in an alliance with the sole goal of ending military rule in Pakistan and restoring democracy . ""
Sharif will find it difficult to sell this to his supporters , "" a party source said .
But it also raises questions for the increasingly unpopular military rulers .
Gen Musharraf had launched a high - profile drive to punish those guilty of corruption .
"" What does this say about our judicial system , that Nawaz Sharif , who was sentenced and in judicial custody , can be allowed to leave ? ""
Farhatullah Babar , spokesman for Ms Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party , said .
Pakistani intelligence sources said Mr Sharif , whose two terms in office were marked by corruption , had handed over at least two factories to the government .
His family assets are estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars .
By the time of the coup Mr Sharif had become Pakistan 's most powerful prime minister since independence in 1947 , using his huge parliamentary majority to amend the constitution and increase his powers ."
2001-06-21,"Pakistan 's military ruler declared himself president yesterday after sacking the man who held the post , and formally dissolving a parliament his regime had already suspended .
By these actions General Pervez Musharraf completed the coup that began almost two years ago when he overthrew Nawaz Sharif 's elected , if unpopular , government .
He had let Mr Tarar stay in the presidency as a figurehead , while inventing for himself the title of "" chief executive "" .
Though Mr Tatar will not be missed by most politicians or the military , Gen Musharraf 's swearing - in as president has removed the last facade of a civilian administration .
In a statement after the oath - taking ceremony in the capital , Islamabad , the general struck a slightly embarrassed note .
This self promotion "" involved doing something for myself which I have never done in my whole life "" , said a statement put out in Gen Musharraf 's name .
But "" taking over as president was required to guarantee stability and continuity of all reforms "" - a reference to his goals of ending economic stagnation and corruption .
In Washington , the state department spokesman , Richard Boucher , said : "" We are very disappointed that Pakistan takes another turn away from democracy . ""
The general 's move is seen here as a way to prolong his involvement in running the country beyond October , the expiry of the three - year deadline set by the supreme court when it legitimised his takeover .
The court said that general elections must be held by that time .
Gen Musharraf insisted yesterday that "" there should be no doubt that we will abide by the judgment of the supreme court "" .
And indeed it was the chief justice , Irshad Hasan Khan , who anointed the general as president , conducting the swearing - in ritual at President House watched by prominent civilians and senior officers .
But the general has given no indication that he will allow political activity to be resumed any time soon .
Political meetings are banned because the regime says they create instability which reflects badly on the country 's image for investors , who remain wary of conditions in Pakistan .
When the presidency was held by Rafiq Tarar , it was largely a ceremonial post - the government that chose him had already amended the constitution to curtail the president 's powers to dismiss parliament .
Mr Tarar , having been chosen by the previous government , was never regarded by the military regime as its trusted man .
Very few in the civilian opposition valued him either .
Now many analysts expect Gen Musharraf to try to reinstate a powerful role for the president , or even to imbed in the constitution a power - sharing role for the military , which has run Pakistan for almost half of its 54 years as a state .
A more immediate reason for Gen Musharraf assuming the presidency is thought to be a wish to raise his status for his summit meeting with the Indian prime minister , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , scheduled for the middle of July in India ."
2001-09-21,"Pakistan 's military leader , General Pervez Musharraf , believes he is a much misunderstood man .
His 1999 coup was provoked by prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's attempt to sack him as army chief .
But once installed as "" chief executive "" , Gen Musharraf quickly convinced himself that he had acted in the nation 's best interest .
The hostile reaction of many in the west , Britain and the US included , seemed to him unfair .
He was motivated , he said , by a desire to build a new , corruption - free Pakistan , not by personal ambition .
Democratic institutions would be restored in time .
When , last June , Gen Musharraf abruptly declared himself president , without the inconvenience of an election , the national interest was again cited in justification .
A summit with India was in the offing .
It was important to bolster the status of Pakistan 's leader in these crucial talks .
Now , in trying to explain his sudden embrace of America and its "" war on terrorism "" , Gen Musharraf falls back on the same old explanation .
The nation was in grave peril , he said .
If it made the wrong choice , its very survival was at risk .
Gen Musharraf 's solution ?
"" My fellow countrymen , you should trust me . ""
The confusion of national and personal interest is not uncommon among dictators , however urbane .
But the numerous other conflicts and contradictions inherent to Gen Musharraf 's position run uniquely deep .
Since seizing power he has played a double game over Afghanistan , sustaining and assisting the Taliban , while claiming to have no influence with them .
He has talked peace over Kashmir , but continued to support anti - Indian insurgents .
He has sought renewed economic aid and investment from the west , while rejecting its concerns about his nuclear arsenal .
He has complained about Delhi 's machinations , including its burgeoning US alliance , while pursuing a proliferating missile and arms collaboration with China .
He promised to restore democracy - but has not yet delivered .
And he has repeatedly said he will curb fundamentalist extremists - but has not done so yet .
Addressing an Islamabad conference of the faithful last summer , Gen Musharraf passionately voiced his belief that Pakistan could become an economic giant .
But he also bemoaned its present poverty and divisions .
"" We are riven into sects , we are prey to regionalism and ethnicity ... and what about mutual tolerance ?
It exists nowhere .
Instead , we are killing each other wearing masks . ""
Islam was glorious and forward - looking , he said .
"" But how does the world judge our claim ?
It looks upon us as terrorists ... and [ suspects ] we want to spread that violence and terror abroad . ""
He went on : ""
Some say we are a failed state .
It hurts badly . ""
And yet Pakistan 's 140 m people , if united , could achieve true greatness .
The likelihood of that vision ever being realised now depends on how the biggest contradiction of all is , or is not , resolved in the coming months .
In one sense , Gen Musharraf had no choice but to throw in his lot with the US .
Its bribes were as irresistible as they were reckless - blind - eyed debt relief , abundant aid , even tea and sympathy over Kashmir .
Its wrath , had it been rebuffed , was potentially catastrophic .
But in another sense , by giving the importunate Americans a base from which to kill his "" brothers "" , he has overturned much that he seemed to stand for as chief guardian of a proud though impecunious , independent Islamic nation .
Most politicians could not long survive such confounding contrariness .
Can a soldier ?
Gen Musharraf may be among the first casualties when the empire strikes back ."
2001-10-03,"In 1999 , the CIA secretly trained and equipped approximately 60 commandos from the Pakistani intelligence agency to enter Afghanistan for the purpose of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden , according to people familiar with the operation .
It was arranged by the then - Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , and his chief of intelligence with the Clinton administration , which in turn promised to lift sanctions on Pakistan and provide an economic aid package .
The plan was aborted later that year when Mr Sharif was ousted in a military coup .
The plan was set in motion less than 12 months after US cruise missile strikes against Bin Laden 's training camps in Afghanistan that missed hitting the exiled Saudi militant .
The Pakistani commando team was up and running and ready to strike by October 1999 , a former official said .
"" It was an enterprise , it was proceeding . ""
Still stung by their failure to get Bin Laden the previous year , Clinton officials were delighted at the operation , which they believed provided a real opportunity to eliminate him .
"" It was like Christmas , "" a source said .
The plan was aborted on October 12 , 1999 , however , when Mr Sharif was overthrown in a military coup led by General Pervez Musharraf , who refused to continue the operation , despite substantial efforts by the Clinton administration to revive it .
Pakistan and its intelligence service have valuable information about what is occurring inside Afghanistan , a country that remains closed to most of the world .
But a former US official said joint operations are always dicey , because the Taliban has penetrated Pakistani intelligence .
"" You never know who you 're dealing with , "" the former senior official said .
"" You 're always dealing with shadows . ""
In addition to the Pakistan operation , President Bill Clinton the year before had approved additional covert action for the CIA to work with groups inside Afghanistan and with other foreign intelligence services to capture or kill Bin Laden .
The most dramatic attempt to kill him occurred in August 1998 , when Mr Clinton ordered a Tomahawk cruise missile attack on his suspected training camps in Afghanistan in response to the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
At the time , the Pentagon informed the president that far more ambitious and riskier military actions could be undertaken , according to officials involved in the decision .
The options included a clandestine helicopter - borne night assault with small US special operations units , a massive bombing raid on the southeastern Afghan city of Kandahar , the spiritual home of the Taliban , and a larger air- and sea - launched missile and bombing raid on Bin Laden 's camps in eastern Afghanistan .
Mr Clinton approved the cruise missile attack and on August 20 , 1998 , 66 cruise missiles rained down on the training camps .
In the aftermath of last month 's attacks on the US , Clinton officials said their decision not to take stronger and riskier action has taken on added relevance .
"" I wish we 'd recognised it then "" , that the US was at war with Bin Laden , said a senior defence official , "" and started the campaign then that we 've started now .
That 's my main regret .
In hindsight , we were at war . ""
Outside experts are even more pointed .
"" I think that raid really helped elevate Bin Laden 's reputation in a big way , building him up in the Muslim world , "" said Harlan Ullman , a defence analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington thinktank .
"" My sense is that because the attack was so limited and incompetent , we turned this guy into a folk hero . ""
Senior officials involved in the decision to limit the attack to unmanned cruise missiles cite were worried that the intelligence on Bin Laden 's whereabouts was sketchy , and fears about innocent people being killed , especially in Kandahar .
- Washington Post"
2002-05-23,"In July 1999 Pakistan 's then prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , flew to Washington for a tense meeting with President Bill Clinton .
Several weeks earlier Pakistani troops had seized a chunk of Himalayan territory inside India near the town of Kargil .
India had responded furiously and demanded that the Pakistanis withdraw .
As Mr Sharif pleaded for American help , an angry Mr Clinton informed him that Pakistan had already started deploying its nuclear weapons .
Mr Sharif appeared shocked and admitted he knew nothing about it .
The man who almost certainly ordered the secret deployment - General Pervez Musharraf - is now the man with his finger on Pakistan 's nuclear button .
Four months later , Gen Musharraf , then the head of the army , overthrew Mr Sharif in a coup .
He is now Pakistan 's president .
Three years on , the prospect of a nuclear conflict between the subcontinent 's most deadly enemies is , most analysts believe , even greater .
For many within India 's increasingly war - like Hindu nationalist BJP party , Kargil is still unfinished business .
Jane 's Information Group estimates that India has between 200 and 250 nuclear weapons , compared to 150 for Pakistan .
Others believe the figures are much lower and say Pakistan has 40 - 52 nuclear bombs compared with 60 - 80 Indian ones .
Reports this week suggest Pakistan has already deployed its Shaheen I missiles - mobile 500-mile range solid - fuel rockets - which can be readied for use within minutes .
Both sides have also "" soft - wired "" their bomber aircraft to allow them to drop nuclear weapons - Pakistan by F16 and India by MiGs and Mirages .
For years Pakistan has been developing a comprehensive missile delivery system .
According to a CIA report in January , China has been providing "" significant assistance "" to Pakistan 's ballistic missile programme .
Now Pakistan is moving towards serial production of the Shaheen I and the Haider I , another solid - fuel short - range ballistic missile , the report said .
Two years ago the Federation of American Scientists ( FAS ) released photographs of Pakistan 's nuclear reactors .
The satellite pictures showed a plutonium reactor at Khushab , near Lahore , which the FAS said could produce five bombs a year .
Another base at Sargodha showed a dozen garages for missile launchers .
The FAS said Pakistan may have up to 84 short - range Shaheen missiles at the site , with 20 launchers .
According to the official Pakistan Institute for Air Defence Studies , Pakistan has "" one of the world 's most sophisticated and formidable indigenous missile weapons systems programme "" .
The institute admitted Pakistan received "" specimen guidance and propulsion systems "" from Chinese and North Korean missiles , quickly advancing its own programme .
On the other side of the divide , India has been developing its own indigenous ballistic missiles over the past 18 years as part of what it calls an Integrated Missile Development Programme .
The Agni I missile - named after the Hindi word for fire - has a range of 435 miles , which covers most of Pakistan , and uses solid fuel for a quick launch .
It can also be transported by rail , making it less vulnerable to "" pre - emptive strikes "" .
In April 1999 , India test - fired its first strategic missile , Agni II , which has a range of 1,550 miles and is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to anywhere in Pakistan and much of China .
It has now gone into production .
India also has a short - range Prithvi missile , with a 93-mile range , still capable of striking Lahore or Islamabad .
So the technology is undoubtedly there .
What is causing intense worry in the region and around the world is that the political will to use it seems increasingly to be there too .
India has traditionally been reluctant to attack Pakistan .
This can be explained by its uncertainty about how Pakistan would respond .
But any doubt appears to have been swept aside , as senior Indian officials hint openly that it is time to "" call Pakistan 's nuclear bluff "" as troops mass on the border .
Under this scenario , India would "" teach Pakistan a lesson "" by attacking militant training camps in Pakistan - occupied Kashmir .
Pakistan would refrain from deploying its nuclear weapons because of the presence of US troops on its soil .
If it did , New Delhi could respond with massive force , wiping out all of Pakistan 's cities and major population centres .
"" Use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan would be a very short recipe for national suicide , "" Prof Brahma Chellaney of New Delhi 's Centre for Policy Research , said .
The problem is that Pakistan does not share this view .
Islamabad is acutely aware that India enjoys a vastly superior conventional army - with about 1.2 million troops compared to Pakistan 's 700,000 .
Pakistan has already made it clear that , in the face of a superior enemy , it would be prepared to initiate a nuclear confrontation - unlike India , which has a strict "" no first use "" policy ."
2002-08-05,"The former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif has finally given up hope of reviving his turbulent political career , opening the way for his younger brother Shahbaz to return from exile to contest the general election in October .
Mr Sharif , who served two terms before being overthrown by the military coup nearly three years ago , chose not to stand in the leadership ballot of his Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) party at the weekend .
Instead he nominated the hard - nosed Shahbaz , a former Punjab chief minister , who was elected unopposed .
Party sources say that Shahbaz Sharif may return within weeks from Saudi Arabia , where the family went into exile a year after the coup .
Although Nawaz Sharif was convicted of terrorism , hijacking and corruption , Shahbaz has not been convicted and therefore can stand as a candidate .
There is no disguising his considerable political ambitions , and he is thought to command support in the army .
"" I am desperate to come back .
The sooner it happens the better , "" he told a Pakistani newspaper last week .
In another interview he appeared to dismiss whispers of a secret deal with the military .
"" I really want to return but that does n't mean I wish to compromise the party 's and my family 's standpoint and interests , "" he said .
"" No matter if I am arrested a hundred times I just want to come back with grace if allowed . "" But if Shahbaz Sharif returns it will be to a badly divided party .
The PML was once the darling of the establishment , fostered by the last dictator , General Zia - ul Haq , as a pro - military party .
But in his two terms as prime minister Nawaz Sharif showed little political acumen and steered an autocratic course .
The PML has never recovered from the 1999 coup .
Many party faithful stuck with the Sharifs , while others tried to create new but unpopular faction in support of Pakistan 's current leader , General Pervez Musharraf .
The bitter division has allowed Benazir Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party to emerge as the strongest political force .
Ms Bhutto was elected head of her party last week and she , too , has promised to return from her self - imposed exile .
The military regime does not want her back .
Late last week Gen Musharraf ruled that anyone convicted of failing to appear in court on corruption charges , as Ms Bhutto has been , would be ineligible to stand in the election .
He has already ruled that anyone who has served twice as prime minister , as both Nawaz Sharif and Ms Bhutto have , can not hold the post for a third term .
Even Ms Bhutto 's election as party leader may be challenged when parties submit the results of their leadership elections for government approval today .
An analysis in the News , a leading Pakistani newspaper , suggested that Shahbaz Sharif still had influence with the army and was a brighter leader than his elder brother .
"" Shahbaz is an aggressive and no - nonsense person .
He had proved to be a hard - headed and tough administrator , but a deliverer , "" the piece said .
"" Shahbaz , unlike Nawaz , is flexible and shows an extraordinary knack when it comes to dealing with powerful circles , particularly the Pakistan army . ""
Many questions were raised in the late 1990s about Shahbaz 's Sharif 's rule in Punjab .
In 1999 there were protests against his provincial government for closing hundreds of organisations which it claimed were involved in "" anti - state "" and "" anti - Islamic "" activities .
While he was chief minister , hundreds of suspected criminals were killed by the police in fake gun battles .
At the time the US state department said extra - judicial killing by the police was "" common "" in Punjab , where 265 people were reported killed in "" encounters with police "" in the first half of 1999 alone .
The Punjab government rejected the claim ."
2003-07-31,"In 1996 , following the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto 's second Pakistan People 's Party administration , Malik Meraj Khalid , who has died aged 87 , became interim prime minister of Pakistan .
His work in aligning anti - PPP forces contributed to Nawaz Sharif 's landslide 1997 victory , but as prime minister Meraj continued to live his simple life and his Lahore home too remained as accessible as ever .
Meraj was born in a village near Lahore and entered legal practice after competing his education in 1948 .
In 1965 , following community work - including literacy and Punjabi language courses in his village - he was elected as an independent to the National Assembly before gravitating to the dictator General Ayub Khan 's Convention Muslim League .
He quit that party in 1968 and later , as a member of the left leaning PPP founded by Bezair Bhutto 's charismatic father , the late Zulifkar Ali Bhutto , he was elected to the National Assembly in Pakistan 's first - ever democratic elections in 1970 .
After a stint as Punjab 's chief minister , he became federal agricultural minister in ZA Bhutto 's government , and was fleetingly National Assembly speaker before General Zia - ul - Haq shut down the National Assembly in July 1977 .
In that martial law period he kept a low profile , but remained a member of the banned PPP 's central committee , and unlike some other party leaders stayed in Pakistan .
On the restoration of democracy in 1988 , he was re - elected as National Assembly speaker during Benazir Bhutto 's first administration , earning the respect of both the opposition and ruling party for his impartiality .
But , growing uneasy with Benazir Bhutto 's leadership style Meraj , became associated increasingly with old guard PPP dissidents .
Following the dismissal of Benazir 's first government in 1990 , he returned to to his welfare work , but then , in 1996 , came the interim premiership .
After his exit from politics in 1997 he was appointed rector of the Islamic University , in recognition of his interest in education and literacy .
Meraj was perhaps the one Pakistani politician intensely engaged with community work while in high office , and whenever out of office , or out of favour with his party , he returned to grassroots activism , gaining respect and affection across the spectrum .
Amid political extremists and Bonapartist generals he was a model of reason .
He is survived by his widow and adopted son .

2004-04-13,"A Pakistani opposition leader was sentenced to 23 years in prison yesterday for trying to incite an army rebellion against President Pervez Musharraf .
Javed Hashmi , one of President Musharraf 's fiercest critics , was convicted of forging a letter purporting to come from the army which criticised the president for supporting the US - led war on terror in neighbouring Afghanistan .
Mr Hashmi , de facto leader of the Pakistan Muslim League of the exiled former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , was tried in prison behind closed doors ostensibly for security reasons .
"" It is one of the darkest days in Pakistan 's history , "" said Senator Raza Rabbani of the Pakistan People 's Party , one of dozens of opposition members of the upper house who walked out in protest .
Mr Hashmi has demanded that the president face a treason trial for subverting the constitution when he staged a coup in 1999 in which Mr Sharif was deposed ."
2004-05-12,"Hundreds of pro - democracy protesters were under arrest in Lahore and security forces were on full alert around the country last night after one of President Pervez Musharraf 's main political opponents was deported to Saudi Arabia , just hours after touching down in Pakistan .
Shahbaz Sharif , the brother of the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , arrived in Pakistan yesterday afternoon on a flight from London , via Abu Dhabi .
He kissed the ground , declared love for his country and was then led away by the security forces .
An empty Pakistan International Airlines flight was waiting to take him to exile in Saudi Arabia .
Outside the airport , thousands of protesters battled with the police , and roads to the airport were blocked to stop thousands more from arriving .
Mobile telephone coverage was cut to areas around the airport .
Shahbaz Sharif , along with his brother Nawaz and their families , was exiled three years ago after General Musharraf 's military coup in 1999 .
The government said the brothers were pardoned for crimes - including a charge against Nawaz of allegedly trying to assassinate Gen Musharraf - after agreeing to stay out of the country for 10 years .
The agreement has never been made public .
The supreme court ruled recently that Shahbaz should be allowed to return to the country , but that he could be arrested on arrival for any outstanding crimes .
Since being in exile , Shahbaz has assumed leadership of the country 's third largest political party , the PML - N , and was emerging as Mr Musharraf 's main political rival .
Political analysts say he is an astute politician and a serious political threat to the president .
While he was out of the country , charges of murder were brought against him for the death of five men in Lahore in 1998 , when he was the chief minister of Punjab .
He told reporters earlier yesterday that he was coming home to defend himself against these charges . ""
This might be my last opportunity to address the people of Pakistan , "" he said defiantly before leaving London .
"" If they wish to incarcerate me , that is up to them .
If they wish to deport me , that is up to them . ""
Another former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , is also out of the country , dividing her time between London and Dubai .
Mr Musharraf has said she will be arrested on corruption charges if she returns to Pakistan .
While rioting was taking place in Lahore and police were rounding up supporters and protesters , Pakistanis across the country were glued to their television sets , watching the drama unfold .
In the past two years two independent Pakistani satellite channels have been broadcasting into the country from Dubai .
It is the first time in the country 's history that it has been able to witness a major political event in Pakistan on independent television .
While the two independent broadcasters were running back to back coverage , the state broadcaster , PTV , was running a soap opera .
Yesterday 's political drama was only a minor item in its news bulletin .
An Islamabad - based political analyst , Adnan Rehmat , said the events showed how frightened Mr Musharraf was of democracy , and how hard he would fight to hold on to power . ""
The thin facade of democracy in Pakistan has been blown away - the fig leaf is gone , "" Mr Rehmat said .
"" He [ Shahbaz ] was willing to come back and face the charges against him and the government chose not to put him on trial .
"" Washington is a strong supporter of Mr Musharraf and the US assistant secretary of state , Christina Rocca , is currently in the country .
Pakistanis are waiting to see what the US reaction will be to Mr Musharraf 's moves .
The Pakistani information minister , Sheikh Rashid Ahmed , said last night that the supreme court ruling that Shahbaz should be allowed to return was simply "" advice "" , implying that it was not binding on the government .
He added that he was sorry that Pakistani officials had been unable to show Shahbaz "" around town "" ."
2005-02-12,"Pakistan 's exiled opposition leaders , Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif , have met for the first time to call for the restoration of democracy and the end of military - dominated rule .
The former political rivals met in Saudi Arabia , where Mr Sharif fled after being ousted from power by General Pervez Musharraf in a bloodless military coup in 1999 .
Ms Bhutto , a former prime minister , fled Pakistan in 1998 to avoid corruption charges .
Newspapers carried front - page photographs of the meeting , which many Pakistani analysts hailed as a significant step .
Ms Bhutto 's husband , Asif Zardari , told Geo television that they had vowed to "" bury their bitter past "" .
They issued a statement calling for fresh elections , an independent electoral commission and "" an end to dictatorships for all time to come "" .
Their respective political parties have joined under the banner Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy .
President Musharraf is facing renewed calls to reintroduce civilian politics .
But there was little sign that yesterday 's meeting would increase the pressure on him in the short term , analysts said .
"" There is no solid , coherent opposition that gives the government a reason for alarm .
The military establishment is strongly entrenched , "" said Talat Masood , a retired army officer .
Under a deal to avoid prison , Mr Sharif is due to remain in exile until 2010 .
Ms Bhutto is threatened with corruption charges ."
2006-04-06,"While we were opening the World Social Forum ( Asia ) with virtuoso performances of sufi music , the country 's rulers were marking the centenary of the Muslim League - the party that created Pakistan and has ever since been passed on from one bunch of rogues to another - by gifting the organisation to General Pervez Musharraf , the country 's uniformed ruler .
The secular opposition leaders , Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto , are both in exile .
If they returned home they would face arrest for corruption .
Neither is in the mood for martyrdom or relinquishing control of their organisations .
Meanwhile , the religious parties are happily implementing neoliberal policies in the North - West Frontier Province , which is under their control .
Incapable of catering to the needs of the poor , they concentrate their fire on women and the godless liberals who defend them .
The military is so secure in its rule and the official politicians so useless that civil society is booming .
Private television channels , like non - governmental organisations , have mushroomed , and most views are permissible - with the exception of frontal assaults on religion or the military .
If civil society posed any real threat to the elite , the plaudits it receives would rapidly turn to menace .
It was thus no surprise that the WSF too had been permitted and facilitated by the local administration in Karachi .
The WSF is now part of the globalised landscape and helps retrograde rulers feel modern .
The event itself was no different from the others .
Present were several thousand delegates , mainly from Pakistan but with a sprinkling from India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , South Korea and a few other countries .
Absent was any representation from China 's burgeoning peasants ' and workers ' movements or its critical intelligentsia .
Iran too was unrepresented , as was Malaysia .
Israel 's Jordanian enforcers who run the Amman regime harassed a Palestinian delegation , so only a handful managed to get through the checkpoints and reach Karachi .
The huge earthquake in Pakistan last year disrupted plans .
Otherwise , insist the organisers , the voices of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo and Falluja would have been heard .
The fact that it happened at all in Pakistan was positive .
People here are not used to hearing different voices and views .
The forum enabled many from repressed social groups and minority religions to make themselves heard : persecuted Christians from the Punjab , Hindus from Sind and women from everywhere told heart - rending stories of discrimination and oppression .
Present too was a sizeable class - struggle element : peasants fighting privatisation of military farms in Okara ; fisherfolk whose livelihoods are under threat , who complained about the Indus being diverted ; workers from Baluchistan denouncing military brutality .
Teachers told how Pakistan 's education system had almost ceased to exist .
The common people who spoke were articulate , analytical and angry , in contrast to the stale rhetoric of Pakistan 's political class .
Much of what was said was broadcast on radio and television , with blanket coverage on the private networks .
What will the WSF leave behind ?
Very little , apart from goodwill .
For the elite still dominates politics in the country .
Small radical groups are doing their best , but there is no state - wide organisation or movement that speaks for the dispossessed .
The social situation is grim .
The education system has collapsed and even lower - middle - class families can barely afford the fees of privatised schools .
Small wonder that a poor family will send a male child to the madrasas , where he is fed , clothed and given a religious education .
Neoliberalism and religious fundamentalism are bedfellows .
The NGOs are no substitute for genuine social and political movements .
In Africa , Palestine and elsewhere , NGOs have swallowed the neoliberal status quo .
They operate like charities , trying to alleviate the worst excesses , but rarely question the systemic basis of the fact that 5 billion citizens of our globe live in poverty .
They may be NGOs in Pakistan , but on the global scale they are western governmental organisations ( WGOs ) , their cash flow conditioned by enforced agendas : Colin Powell once referred to them as "" our fifth column "" .
A few of them are doing good work , but the overall effect of NGO - isation has been to atomise the tiny layer of progressives and liberals in the country .
Most of these men and women struggle for their individual NGOs to keep the money coming .
Petty rivalries assume exaggerated proportions ; politics in the sense of grassroots organisation becomes virtually nonexistent .
The salaries , in most cases , elevate WGO executives to the status of the local elites , creating the material basis for accepting the boundaries of the existing system .
The Latin American model emerging in the victories of Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales has transcended the WGO world , but this is a far cry from Mumbai or Karachi , Jerusalem or Dar es Salaam . ·

2006-08-27,"The killing of a tribal chief by Pakistani troops sparked widespread violence and rioting yesterday and raised fears that a decades - old conflict in the country 's volatile south - west could widen .
Nawab Akbar Bugti , 79 , died when troops raided his mountain hideout on Saturday .
His killing was described as "" the darkest chapter in Pakistan 's history "" by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif yesterday .
Mobs set fire to shops , buses , banks and police vehicles in Quetta , the capital of Baluchistan province , to protest at Mr Bugti 's killing .
Police arrested 450 people for rioting .
Violence spread across Baluchistan and into neighbouring Sindh province , where ethnic Baluchis burned tyres in Pakistan 's largest city , Karachi .
Political leaders and analysts feared that the killing of Mr Bugti , a champion of greater rights for ethnic Baluch tribespeople , could influence more young Pakistanis to take up militancy .
Talaat Masood , a former army general , described the death as a "" great tragedy "" that would further divide ordinary Pakistanis from the military , led by the president , General Pervez Musharraf .
"" It is very dangerous when we 're already fighting [ al - Qaida ] terrorists to bring about another reason for radicalising the youth , "" said Mr Masood .
On Quetta 's streets , anti - government sentiment was at fever pitch .
"" The government has killed the Baluch leader .
We will take revenge , "" said Ghulam Mohiuddin , a student .
An alliance of four Baluch nationalist groups announced 15 days of mourning and vowed to continue protests .
"" The government has pushed Baluchistan into a never - ending war , "" said Hasil Bizinjo , an alliance leader .
A senior official of Gen Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League called for a "" political solution to [ the province 's ] long - standing problems of neglect and injustice "" .
Baluchistan , which borders Afghanistan and Iran , has suffered decades of low - level conflict that has often flared into large - scale clashes , as ethnic Baluch tribespeople led by Mr Bugti pressed the government for an increased share of wealth from natural resources extracted from the province , rich in gas , oil and coal .
Mr Bugti , who went into hiding last year accused of ordering attacks on government targets , was killed when troops attacked his cave hideout in the Kohlu area , about 140 miles east of Quetta .
Authorities say the cave 's roof collapsed , killing him and at least 24 of his fighters .
A former Pakistani senator , interior minister and provincial governor , Mr Bugti had described army forces as "" invaders and occupiers "" for expanding military garrisons into Baluchistan .
Hundreds , if not thousands , of tribesmen fought under his uncompromising leadership ."
2007-05-18,"Pakistan 's political crisis deepened yesterday when President Pervez Musharraf and his main rival , Benazir Bhutto , dismissed the possibility of a power - sharing deal .
General Musharraf said on television last night that he would not allow Ms Bhutto or his other rival , Nawaz Sharif , to return from exile before parliamentary polls later this year . ""
No , they will not be returning before elections , "" he said .
Speculation over a deal between Gen Musharraf and Ms Bhutto , who fled Pakistan in 1999 amid corruption allegations , has been rife .
In return for an amnesty , Ms Bhutto - who controls the country 's most powerful party , the Pakistan People 's party - had offered to share power with the general .
But she ruled out cohabitation after Musharraf supporters rampaged through Karachi last weekend shooting rivals . ""
With 42 people dead , I can not envisage such a thing at this moment , "" she told the Christian Science Monitor .
This appears to close off another exit for Gen Musharraf from the crisis triggered by his removal of the chief justice of the supreme court , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , in March .
The judge 's refusal to resign - the first senior civilian to defy Gen Musharraf since he seized power in 1999 - triggered a political earthquake .
Mr Chaudhry has led a spirited campaign for reinstatement and is an unlikely unifier of the notoriously fractious opposition .
Pro -
Chaudhry rallies have drawn huge crowds , most recently in Lahore , the heartland of military rule .
Opposition parties spanning secular liberals and Islamist clerics have rallied behind him with the exception of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) , a Karachi - based party with a history of thuggery .
Gen Musharraf appears increasingly authoritarian and the crisis has taken some sinister twists .
Last weekend in Karachi 15,000 police and soldiers failed to intervene as armed MQM gangs blocked roads and shot the chief justice 's supporters .
On Monday , Hamad Raza , a supreme court official close to Mr Chaudhry , was shot dead in his Islamabad home .
Yesterday Shakil Turabi , a news agency editor , said he was dragged from his car in Islamabad by suspected intelligence agents and beaten for "" writing against the government "" ."

On Monday , Hamad Raza , a senior supreme court official close to Mr Chaudhry , was shot dead in his Islamabad home by unknown assailants .
His widow said she suspected political motives .
Yesterday Shakil Turabi , the editor of a local news agency , said he was dragged from his car in Islamabad and beaten by men who accused him of "" writing against the government "" .

Asma Jahangir , a leading human rights activist , said : "" The real face of President Musharraf is beginning to show .
The so - called ' enlightened moderation ' is peeling off and the ugly face is coming through . ""
But General Musharraf can still count on some powerful allies , most notably the US government , which has given Pakistan $ 10bn ( £ 5bn ) since 2001 in exchange for help in hunting down al - Qaida militants .
On Wednesday a US state department spokesman reiterated the Bush administration 's support for General Musharraf .
"" I do n't think our assessment has fundamentally changed , "" he said ."
2007-08-09,"Is there any basis for the rumours of a state of emergency being imposed in Pakistan by President Musharraf ?
He failed to attend a meeting in Kabul yesterday designed to investigate peace moves on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border and faces a challenge in the courts today over the possible return from exile of the former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , whom he deposed in 1999 .
He faces two election battles early next year , one for the presidency -- and he is constitutionally ineligible for a further term of office -- and a parliamentary election .
Last month Pakistan 's supreme court reinstated the country 's chief justice , Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry , ruling that his suspension by the president was "" illegal "" .
The president of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League party dismissed the rumours as baseless and the view was advanced in editorial conference that the threat may be a signal from an embattled General Musharraf to Washington , telling the White House not to push too hard .
George Bush said this week that the US would kill Osama bin Laden and other al - Qaida leaders in Pakistan if it had the necessary intelligence
and he refused to say whether he would consult Gen Musharraf before an attack .
Just a week ago Barack Obama , one of the Democratic party hopefuls for the presidential nomination , said he would send US forces to Pakistan in to get Bin Laden if the government there failed to act .
The position of the UK government was reported to be hopeful for a deal with the other exiled former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , but the recent meeting between her and Musharraf in Abu Dhabi had failed to reach an agreement ."
2007-08-17,"The former Pakistani prime minister ousted by General Pervez Musharraf in a military coup has warned Benazir Bhutto not to do a deal with the embattled leader .
Nawaz Sharif likened Gen Musharraf - whose position is now believed to be at its weakest since he seized power in 1999 - to a "" sinking ship "" and told Ms Bhutto that any alliance would damage her credibility .
Gen Musharraf met Ms Bhutto , his chief rival , in Abu Dhabi last month .
The talks came amid claims the US was secretly pushing for a deal between the two to bolster the president , who is a key Washington ally in the "" war on terror "" .
"" Musharraf is a drowning man at this stage - he has no options left , "" Mr Sharif said .
"" I hate to say this , but I think he is like a sinking ship .
"" Anybody who cuts a deal with Musharraf at this stage would damage his own credibility and I do n't want to damage my credibility , "" he said in Dubai , where he is in exile .
Gen Musharraf , who remains chief of the army , has been badly damaged by his failed attempt to fire Pakistan 's chief justice .
Many Pakistanis see him as being too pro - US , and Islamist extremists have launched repeated attacks on the security forces .
An alliance with Ms Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party - generally regarded as the country 's leading party - would broaden his support and help him win subsequent presidential elections .
For her part , Ms Bhutto would probably need Gen Musharraf 's support to overturn a law prohibiting former prime ministers from returning to that office .
Since Gen Musharraf 's rise to power , Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto , who have both been living in exile , have formed an alliance of their own .
The former prime ministers , who both held power in the 80s and 90s , joined forces in the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy to press for the end of military rule .
However , the alliance has appeared to wither since Ms Bhutto established contacts with the government .
Mr Sharif called on her to stop talking to the government and return to opposition . ""
She must come back and join the struggle for restoration of democracy , join the struggle for pushing the army back into the barracks and join the struggle for banning the entry of generals into politics , because this has done great harm , "" he said .
Mr Sharif has vowed to return from exile for the forthcoming parliamentary elections , and has petitioned the supreme court to lift restrictions on his return .
Ms Bhutto went into self - imposed exile following allegations of corruption when she was prime minister in the mid-90s .
Gen Musharraf has repeatedly said she would not be allowed to return to Pakistan before the elections .
She has said she would demand Gen Musharraf relinquish the post of army chief of staff before agreeing to share power ."
2007-08-23,"Pakistan 's chief justice , who survived a botched attempt by President Pervez Musharraf to fire him , has ruled that one of the president 's key political rivals can return from a seven - year exile .
In an extraordinary twist that is likely to enrage the president , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry declared that the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had an "" inalienable "" right to enter his native country .
Mr Sharif , who was ousted from power in 1999 by Gen Musharraf in a bloodless coup , is now set to contest upcoming parliamentary elections .
The decision will place more pressure on the embattled president , who had vowed that Mr Sharif , and another exiled former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , would be barred from returning .
Speaking at a press conference in London , Mr Sharif hailed the ruling as "" a victory for democracy and a defeat for dictatorship "" , adding that he planned to return to Pakistan "" fairly soon "" .
He said : "" I do n't believe in any power - sharing with Musharraf .
He is a dictator .
We are democrats . ""
Mr Sharif also predicted the courts would now thwart Gen Musharraf 's hopes to continue as president .
Sheikh Rashid Ahmed , a close ally of the president , acknowledged he would be weakened by the ruling .
"" I was expecting it , and I think we have to accept the court verdict , "" he told the Associated Press .
Outside the court in the capital , Islamabad , supporters of Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N party welcomed the verdict .
One man celebrated by slaughtering six goats .
"" General Musharraf must realise he is on the losing end , "" a spokesman for Mr Sharif 's party said .
"" The sooner he realises and resigns , the better it is for him . ""
The supreme court ruled that Mr Sharif and his family , who were banished to Saudi Arabia in 2000 , had "" an inalienable right to enter and remain in the country as citizens of Pakistan "" , Mr Chaudhry said .
He added that their return should not be "" hampered or obstructed "" by the state .
However , Mr Sharif may still face unspecified legal action brought by the government if he returns , lawyers said .
Gen Musharraf had claimed he released Mr Sharif from jail in 2000 on condition he would not return to Pakistan for 10 years , but Mr Sharif 's lawyers argued that the agreement was not legitimate .
The rapid decline in Gen Musharraf 's authority this year can be traced back to his failed attempt to fire Mr Chaudhry in March .
Last month , the supreme court ruled against Gen Musharraf in his four - month vendetta against the chief justice .
The decision was a unique victory for Pakistan 's civilians and emboldened a pro - democracy movement that has swept the country .
He now faces the October presidential elections in a severely weakened position .
The US president , George Bush , is also piling on pressure for better results in the hunt for al - Qaida suspects - pressure that compounds perceptions in Pakistan that the general is little more than a US puppet .
October 's poll is due to be followed by parliamentary elections , where the main opposition parties of Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto hope to make gains .
Gen Musharraf has sought to bolster his position by holding talks with his chief rival , Ms Bhutto .
An alliance with Ms Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party - generally regarded as the country 's leading party - would broaden his support and help him win the presidential election .
However , she has demanded he relinquish his post as army chief of staff before agreeing to share power .
Before news of the talks leaked out , Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto had formed the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy to press for the end of military rule ."
2007-08-23,"President Pervez Musharraf 's political problems deepened yesterday when the Pakistan supreme court ruled that his arch - rival , the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , is free to return home after seven years in exile .
Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz , currently living in London , have an inalienable right of return , said the chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , whom Mr Musharraf tried to fire earlier this year .
The government should not try to impede Mr Sharif 's return , the judge warned .
The verdict comes at an awkward time for General Musharraf , who must confront deepening unpopularity and a growing number of political enemies as he seeks re - election in the coming months .
After the verdict , jubilant Sharif supporters spilled out of the court , hugging one another and chanting "" Go , Musharraf , go ! ""
One man slaughtered six goats in celebration outside the court gates , leaving blood smeared across the road .
The scenes highlighted how the supreme court has become a stage for Pakistan 's increasingly defiant civilians to vent their frustrations at military rule . ""
No police , no army , no state of emergency ! ""
yelled one man .
At a press conference in London , Mr Sharif hailed the verdict as a "" defeat for dictatorship "" and promised to return "" fairly soon "" .
The government will almost certainly try to stop him .
Long - standing corruption cases have been reactivated in recent weeks and officials have hinted that Mr Sharif , currently living in a Park Lane apartment , faces jail on his return .
"" If they want to come , let them .
The law will take its course , "" said the attorney general , Malik Qayyum , in court yesterday .
Gen Musharraf and Mr Sharif 's political future were yoked together before in one of the great national dramas .
In a crude attempt to depose Gen Musharraf as army chief in 1999 Mr Sharif , then prime minister , refused permission for the general 's plane to land as it returned from a conference abroad - even though it was perilously low on fuel .
But Gen Musharraf did land , and with the help of fellow generals seized power and hauled Mr Sharif before a court that found him guilty of treason , tax evasion and hijacking .
The prime minister was sentenced to life imprisonment but a year later Gen Musharraf allowed him and his family to go into exile in Saudi Arabia - provided they stayed outside Pakistan for 10 years .
Yesterday 's verdict further undermines Gen Musharraf 's plan to secure re - election before mid - October .
His popularity is plummeting , the courts are hostile , and a much - touted power - sharing deal with the other exiled opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto , is now in doubt .
"" If she 's seen shaking hands with Musharraf , who has become so devalued , she will be standing on the wrong side of history , "" said Talat Hussain , a television commentator .
The question is now whether Mr Sharif is willing to risk imprisonment .
Yesterday he was defiant .
"" I will face anything that he does against me .
I 'm not scared of that , "" he said in London .
His party spokesman , Ahsan Iqbal , said the political landscape had altered .
"" People 's aspirations have changed - they want rule of law , not dictatorship .
Gen Musharraf does not realise that he is swimming against the tide of history . ""
Gen Musharraf did not comment .
But a close ally , Sheikh Rashid Ahmed , the railways minister , conceded it was bad news .
"" We were expecting it , and we must respect the court 's decision , "" he said ."
2007-08-27,"Pakistan will not impose a state of emergency to end the ballooning political crisis and will instead hold free and fair elections , the prime minister , Shaukat Aziz , has pledged .
"" We have no intention of imposing an emergency because we do n't believe that will really solve anything , "" Mr Aziz told the Guardian at his hilltop mansion in Islamabad .
Speculation that the president , Pervez Musharraf , would resort to drastic measures resurfaced this weekend after a supreme court ruling allowing the former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , to return home after seven years in exile .
A spokesman said yesterday that Mr Sharif , who was ousted by Gen Musharraf in a bloodless coup in 1999 and currently lives in London , was "" expected to embark for Pakistan in a few days "" .
The development has plunged Pakistani politics into confusion .
Local media reported yesterday that General Musharraf had sent an envoy to London to negotiate a power - sharing agreement with the other exiled opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto .
He is also reportedly holding back - channel talks with other opposition leaders .
But Ms Bhutto may be reluctant to associate publicly with an increasingly unpopular leader , and may set a high political price for any deal .
The main stumbling block is his uniform - Gen Musharraf hopes to get re - elected by the current parliament before October 15 , but without resigning as army chief .
Gen Musharraf 's allies , led by Mr Aziz , are likely to be the first casualties of the approaching political storm .
But the prime minister said he was confident the government could ride the crisis out .
"" The president will be supported by our coalition , we have a comfortable majority in parliament , and we are very confident of his re - election , "" he said , adding that Gen Musharraf was "" a symbol of unity , a symbol of progress for Pakistan "" .
The uniform issue , which has transfixed the political establishment , held little interest for most people , said Mr Aziz .
"" For the average person in Pakistan this is not a big issue at all .
What they want is a better life , better future , better health and education , housing and justice , "" he said .
Mr Aziz said he will stand for re - election but his weak political base is a major problem .
A former Citibank executive , he returned from New York in 1999 after Gen Musharraf asked him to become finance minister .
Since becoming prime minister in 2004 he has claimed credit for Pakistan 's steady economic growth including record levels of inward investment .
"" You ask the average Pakistani , they will tell you that this is the prime minister that turned our economy around , "" he said .
Critics say the growth has been fuelled by large cash inflows and the cancellation of international debts after September 2001 - a charge that Mr Aziz contests . ""
To say it is all due to 9/11 is simplistic .
The truth is that 9/11 had nothing to do with improved infrastructure , job creation and poverty reduction , "" he said .
The return of Mr Sharif or Ms Bhutto in the coming weeks is likely to reignite the debate about corruption .
Gen Musharraf and Mr Aziz accuse the opposition leaders of gross incompetence and corruption during their tenures in the 1990s .
But the latest figures from Transparency International suggest that Pakistan has fared little better under the military - led government - corruption levels remain virtually unchanged since 2001 , according to the latest figures ."
2007-08-30,"The deposed former Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , today said he would return from exile next month , as he stepped up plans to launch a political comeback against the president who ousted him in a coup eight years ago .
Mr Sharif is planning to fight upcoming parliamentary elections against President General Pervez Musharraf , who is said to be on the brink of a deal with Benazir Bhutto .
Ms Bhutto , another exiled former prime minister , is an old ally of Mr Sharif .
But after a series of negotiations with Gen Musharraf , Ms Bhutto yesterday declared she had largely agreed a deal which would see him drop corruption charges against her , while in return he would relinquish his role as head of the army .
Under the agreement , Ms Bhutto would return from exile to become prime minister while Gen Musharraf would become "" Mr Musharraf "" - a civilian president with responsibility for counter - terrorism and security affairs .
However , Mr Sharif plans to fight any alliance and at a press conference in London today declared he would be returning to Pakistan on September 10 .
Yesterday he was scathing about any agreement between Ms Bhutto and Gen Musharraf . ""
This will be very wrong .
There should be no personal objectives .
If Benazir supports Musharraf now the system will remain intact .
It will be catastrophic if this goes ahead , "" he said .
A Pakistan supreme court judgment last week sanctioning Mr Sharif 's immediate return to Pakistan lent a new urgency to the London talks between Ms Bhutto and representatives of Gen Musharraf .
Having watched two former prime ministers languish in exile for almost a decade , Pakistanis now face the prospect of a race to Islamabad airport .
Mr Sharif was deposed from office in a bloodless coup in 1999 by Gen Musharraf and sentenced to life in prison on hijacking and terrorism charges .
He was released from jail a year later after signing a pledge not to return to Pakistan for at least 10 years .
Earlier today , a spokesman for Gen Musharraf said he had yet to decide whether to step down as head of the army before a presidential election .
His spokesman said : "" No decision has been made .
When he will decide , he will announce it . ""
Ms Bhutto said from London that she hoped for a breakthrough in the negotiations "" in the next few days "" and that Gen Musharraf 's silence on his military role "" could be a tactical rather that strategic retreat "" until all issues had been resolved .
The prospect of a deal between Gen Musharraf and Ms Bhutto is not to the liking of all Pakistan 's politicians .
The conservative religious affairs minister , Ijaz - ul Haq , who sparked uproar in June with his criticism of the author Salman Rushdie 's knighthood , accused Ms Bhutto of blackmailing Gen Musharraf and of working "" against Islam , against Pakistan "" .
Mr Haq , who is the son of the former military ruler Gen Zia - ul Haq , told Geo news television that any deal could collapse amid "" ideological differences "" and reservations about waiving corruption charges against her .
Gen Zia overthrew Ms Bhutto 's father as prime minister and had him executed on murder charges in 1979 during Pakistan 's previous spell of military rule .
Gen Musharraf has seen his popularity plummet since March , when he tried unsuccessfully to sack the supreme court 's top judge .
The move turned the judge , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , into an unlikely hero and sparked nationwide protests .
The court reinstated the judge in July , raising expectations that it would uphold legal challenges to Gen Musharraf standing again for president .
Gen Musharraf has insisted that the constitution allows him stay as head of the army until the end of 2007 , but he has never made clear when , or if , he will step down .
Opponents argue that the constitution obliges him to give up that post before he asks parliament for a fresh presidential mandate in September or October .
They have already lodged complaints with the court on the issue .
The US is monitoring Pakistan 's political manoeuvrings with interest and anxiety because of its pivotal position in the "" war on terror "" .
US officials have been putting the squeeze on Gen Musharraf to do more to halt insurgents crossing into Afghanistan , where Nato troops are fighting to prevent a comeback by the Taliban .
A national intelligence estimate last month concluded that al - Qaida had built a safe haven in the tribal areas of Pakistan and some US politicians have suggested that American forces carry out raids in Pakistan without its prior approval .
A US state department spokesman , Tom Casey , declined to comment on whether Washington wanted Gen Musharraf to give up his army post .
But he said the US wanted Pakistan 's intense political debate to result in free and fair elections and a government that continued to be "" a force to help work with us to fight against extremism "" ."
2007-08-30,"Your cautious leader on Pakistan ( August 30 ) misses a vital point : that were the status quo to prevail , the country would become even more instable , hence the need for a pact between Pervez Musharraf and the opposition .
If no deal were forthcoming , parliamentary elections would in any event have to be held .
In the absence of Benazir Bhutto , but with the return of Nawaz Sharif , who is associated with fundamentalist Islamist legislation , it is highly likely that the prevailing imbalance between the mainstream parties and the Islamists would skew in favour of the Islamists .
The latter made gains in the 2002 parliamentary elections because Ms Bhutto was in exile .
It is neither in Pakistan 's nor the west 's interest to see a rise in the influence of political Islam .
We need to temper our aims with pragmatism .
We should welcome even small steps towards secular civilian rule .

2007-08-31,"Exiled opposition leader Nawaz Sharif upped the stakes in Pakistan 's turbulent power struggle yesterday by vowing to return home in two weeks to challenge the president , Pervez Musharraf , despite threats of arrest . ""
This man Musharraf is on his way out ...
We will be launching a movement against Mr Musharraf and his government , "" Mr Sharif told reporters in London .
He said he would fly to Islamabad on September 10 .
The gambit by Mr Sharif , who has twice been prime minister , increases the urgency of power - sharing talks between Gen Musharraf and the other opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto , which remain on a knife edge .
Yesterday several government officials denied claims by Ms Bhutto that the general had agreed to resign from the army before elections . ""
No decision has been made , "" said the information minister , Muhammad Ali Durrani , at a press conference .
"" If anyone else says something about this , it is just their own opinion . ""
The jostling may determine the next government of Pakistan , a country of intense interest to western countries fearful of Islamist violence and al - Qaida militants sheltering inside its borders .
Further evidence of deep instability emerged again last night when more than 100 soldiers were apparently kidnapped by militants who ambushed a large convoy of military vehicles in the northwest .
British and US officials are playing a back - room role in the Musharraf - Bhutto talks .
But their plans are complicated by Mr Sharif 's sudden re - emergence .
He was thrust into the spotlight by last week 's supreme court ruling that he has an "" inalienable "" right of return , and his supporters are preparing a tumultuous welcome .
The government will try to dissuade him .
The attorney general , Malik Qayyum , said Mr Sharif could be arrested on charges stretching back to 1999 , when he was ousted in a military coup and charged with treason .
Ms Bhutto 's party leadership is due to meet this afternoon to decide whether to sign a deal with the military leader , or go it alone ."
2007-09-07,"Pakistan 's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has booked himself on five different flights to the country next week to counter government efforts to thwart his return .
The airliner intrigue is one of several ruses by Mr Sharif to keep Pakistan 's intelligence agencies guessing .
He has vowed to land in Islamabad on Monday , a move that will challenge the leadership of President Pervez Musharraf .
Government officials have threatened to arrest Mr Sharif on his return .
He could also be deported , as his brother Shahbaz was when he tried to fly to Lahore in 2004 .
This time Mr Sharif is unlikely to take the national airline , Pakistan International Airlines , or charter his own plane .
Instead , aides say , he will take a scheduled flight .
Mr Sharif 's aides say he will be accompanied by 100 people , including 60 journalists , who have been told little other than to be ready to leave Sunday night .
Islamabad has tried to block his return by exerting pressure through Saudi Arabia , which gave him exile in 2000 .
But a Sharif spokesman shrugged off the tactic . ""
He 'll definitely be there , "" he said yesterday .
Mr Sharif enjoys support from the supreme court , which recently ruled he has an "" inalienable "" right of return .
The drama is reminiscent of 1999 when Mr Sharif refused to allow a plane carrying General Musharraf to land in Karachi , triggering the military coup .
This time , Gen Musharraf fears Mr Sharif 's return could imperil power - sharing talks with former prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
Mr Sharif insisted nothing would stop his return .
"" The soil of my country is calling me "" , he told Geo News . ""
No dictator can now stop our way . ""
Yesterday lawyers ratcheted up the pressure on Gen Musharraf by hoisting black flags over courthouses across the country and calling for his resignation ."
2007-09-09,"Pakistan 's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif left London last night on course for a stormy showdown with President Pervez Musharraf in a defiant bid to end his seven - year exile .
Mr Sharif , who was ousted in a 1999 military coup , faces the prospect of arrest or deportation when he arrives at Islamabad airport on a scheduled flight from London at 11.45am ( 7.45am BST ) today .
The government has banned political rallies , arrested hundreds of opposition officials and declared an airport "" terror alert "" in an effort to scotch plans by Sharif supporters for a rousing welcome .
Local media reported that intelligence officials had taken up positions throughout the airport , where mobile phone jamming devices and additional surveillance cameras had been installed .
Mr Sharif said he was undeterred .
"" I 'm feeling great , "" he said as uniformed British police escorted him through a crowd of supporters at Heathrow airport on his way to the flight last night .
"" My ambition is very clear , I have to take Pakistan back to the rule of democracy , because unless we have this , we will continue to be in a state of mess , as we are today , "" he told reporters on the plane as he waited for takeoff .
Earlier , he acknowledged that it might be dangerous to return .
"" I know that this is a risky course and there are dangers in it for me , but I am doing this for Pakistan , "" he told Geo news from London .
"" I will be happy that for a small price - my going to jail - Pakistan will win freedom . ""
In Islamabad , Mr Sharif 's supporters planned giant rallies to converge on the airport as he arrives .
"" The government 's knees are shaking , "" said a spokesman , Ahsan Iqbal .
""
Gen Musharraf is already defeated . ""
The deputy information minister , Tariq Azim , said there were "" no special plans "" for Mr Sharif , but hinted that he faced arrest . ""
He will be allowed to land and treated like any other commercial passenger .
What happens after that is up to the legal experts , "" he said .
There was a whiff of panic about government efforts to thwart Mr Sharif , who has unexpectedly positioned himself on the frontline of efforts to oust Gen Musharraf .
At the weekend police rounded up hundreds of Sharif supporters across the Punjab - his party claimed 2,500 - while many others disappeared into hiding .
The drama took a surprise twist on Saturday when the head of Saudi Arabia 's intelligence services , Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz , appeared in Rawalpindi alongside the prominent Lebanese politician Saad Hariri , urging Mr Sharif to respect a 2000 agreement in which he promised to remain in exile for a decade .
"" It is here and signed , "" said Prince Muqrin , waving a copy of the agreement before reporters .
But in London Mr Sharif rejected that assertion and claimed that he understood the deal , under which he escaped a sentence of life imprisonment , would lapse in 2005 .
On arrival in Islamabad , Mr Sharif plans to go by road to his political heartland in Lahore in a giant motorcade intended to further undermine Gen Musharraf .
The general has several options , none of them palatable .
He could have Mr Sharif bundled on to a plane and flown to Saudi Arabia , as he did when his brother Shahbaz tried to return in 2004 .
But that would trigger a fresh confrontation with the supreme court , which ruled on August 23 that Mr Sharif has an "" inalienable "" right of return .
The most likely course may be arrest .
Last week the courts revived corruption charges against Mr Sharif and a murder accusation against his brother .
But arrest would almost certainly trigger protest and violent unrest .
Gen Musharraf 's greatest hope may lie with the other exiled former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , though power - sharing talks in Dubai have stalled and Ms Bhutto says she will announce her own return date to Pakistan on Thursday ."
2007-09-10,
2007-09-10,"If the former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif wanted to create a political sensation , he certainly succeeded with his theatrical flight back home and swift expulsion .
His return was brief but , in those four hours , he has burnished his democratic credentials while diminishing his rivals - the president , General Perverz Musharraf , and Benazir Bhutto , another former prime minister seeking to make her own a political comeback .
Ms Bhutto is seeking to cut a deal with Gen Musharraf under which she would be allowed back in time for the general elections , which are scheduled to take place later this year .
Under the arrangement , Gen Musharraf would stay on as president , but would step down as head of the army .
As a quid pro quo , all corruption charges against Ms Bhutto would be dropped .
However Mr Sharif threatens to upset the applecart thanks to his uncompromising stance on Gen Musharraf - the man who overthrew him in a bloodless coup in 1999 .
He wants the general to leave altogether , and has formed an alliance of opposition parties prior to the elections .
If his campaign picks up steam , he could be the next PM instead of Ms Bhutto .
Some analysts say Mr Sharif would be a better bet than Ms Bhutto to contain Pakistan 's Islamist threat .
MK Bhadrakumar , writing in India Abroad , published in the US , said : "" His political pedigree dates back to the Zia - ul Haq era , and he knows best how to squeeze the Jihadi culture out of Pakistan .
"" It was General Zia who pushed "" Islamisation "" as the military dictator of Pakistan from 1977 to 1988 , when he died in a mysterious plane crash .
Mr Sharif first achieved national recognition when he was brought into the Punjab government during the early days of General Zia 's martial law , serving as the finance minister and then the chief minister .
Punjab , Pakistan 's most populous province , is Mr Sharif 's power base , and he was planning a 180-mile motorcade to its provincial capital , Lahore , from Islamabad airport .
Mr Sharif first became prime minister in 1990 , but was dismissed in 1993 when Ms Bhutto - then the opposition leader - formed a government .
He returned to office in 1997 with a comfortable majority .
Although he is presenting himself as democrat standing up to a military rule , Mr Sharif is no political angel .
During his second term , he took measures that can only be seen as anti - democratic .
In particular , he reversed a constitutional amendment that took away the president 's powers to dismiss the prime minister , a move intended to ensure his longevity as PM .
Mr Sharif also had his own battles with Gen Musharraf , who tried unsuccessfully to get the head of the supreme court , Iftekhar Chaudhary , sacked earlier this year .
At one point , Mr Sharif faced possible disqualification from office after charges of contempt of court were brought against him .
The charges were eventually dismissed .
There is also the whiff of corruption .
Mr Sharif was dogged by accusations of corruption during his two terms , and an anti - corruption court last month reopened three cases against him "" at the request "" of the government .
Upon his return to Pakistan , Mr Sharif was served with an arrest warrant from Pakistan 's anti - corruption body .
The investigator , Azhar Mahmood Qazi , said he was being arrested on money - laundering and corruption charges stemming from a sugar mill business several years ago .
However , the authorities eventually decided to deport him to Saudi Arabia on the basis that they were better off with Mr Sharif outside Pakistan .
It is hard to say whether Mr Sharif is guilty of the charges but , as the EU said in a statement , he should have been given the chance to defend himself in a Pakistani court .
In any case , the supreme court last month ruled that Mr Sharif had the right to return to Pakistan and that authorities should not obstruct him .
By deporting him , Gen Musharaff looks as though he is flouting the law .
Mr Sharif was deposed by Gen Musharraf in 1999 because of the military 's unhappiness with his decision to withdraw Pakistani - backed forces from the Indian side of the line of control in Kashmir .
The army felt humiliated and got rid of Mr Sharif .
Eight years later , he has come back to make life difficult for Gen Musharraf ."
2007-09-10,"Pakistan 's political direction and the future of President Pervez Musharraf will be decided in the next four months .
Following are the key dates for the country 's presidential and parliamentary elections .
September 10 :
Nawaz Sharif , whose government was ousted in General Musharraf 's 1999 coup , returns to Pakistan from exile and is arrested at the airport on corruption charges and immediately deported to Saudi Arabia , according to reports .
He had intended to campaign against Gen Musharraf 's bid for a fresh presidential term .
September 14 :
Benazir Bhutto , another former prime minister who is in talks with Gen Musharraf over a potential power - sharing deal , plans to announce the date of her return from exile .
September 15 :
The earliest possible date for the presidential election .
The electoral college comprises all provincial as well as federal lawmakers .
October 7 : The deputy chief of the army is due to retire .
The general that President Musharraf promotes to this post will be in pole position to replace him if he steps down as army chief .
October 15 : The latest possible date for the presidential election , unless Gen Musharraf dissolves parliament and calls early parliamentary elections .
The presidential vote would take place from the new assemblies .
November 15 :
Gen Musharraf 's five - year presidential mandate and the term of the sitting parliament expire .
January 14 2008 :
The latest possible date for general elections ."
2007-09-10,"Nawaz Sharif rode the crest of his new popularity right out of the country today .
A journalist working in Lahore called to tell me how absurd it was that the very man who stormed Pakistan 's supreme court in 1997 and had been an accomplice in threatening to kill an active chief justice of Pakistan ( CJP ) became a folk hero merely by following the judiciary 's cues to return to the country that unlawfully exiled him .
Seven thousand indisputably innocent supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) were arrested by police for waiting outside Islamabad airport to witness his arrival .
Citizens in Pakistan have been calling General Musharraf "" Busharraf "" for years now , and now that Hariri and the Saudis have dabbled their hands in the mess , Sharif has become one of the country 's "" good ol' boys "" .
Given Nawaz 's own pedigree in corruption , he was probably aware that the plane he was being escorted to by hulking commandos and Busharraf goons was n't headed for Karachi .
From where I 'm sitting , it seems like one big fat publicity stunt .
Another Pakistani reporter echoed these sentiments more poetically .
He said that since Nawaz announced his return a week ago , Mush 's "" arrow was already out of the bow "" .
The PML - N admitted failing to mobilise in time , something I find hard to believe seeing that 7,000 of their own were arrested in the incident .
The real blame lies in the way party lines were drawn up during the protests to reinstate the suspended CJP last spring , which have prevented these rival parties from participating in reinstating democratic rule together .
These enmities were first apparent to me outside the Lahore high court last April when women 's rights activists and students with Jimaati Islami pins chanted "" Go Musharraf , go "" together with striking lawyers , and jeepfulls of Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) and PML - N supporters , dressed in uniform party colours , rolled in .
Instead of waving flags with the unlawfully suspended CJP , they hoisted up posters of the same tired Bhuttos and Sharifs .
When I was marching alongside other college - aged protesters shouting an anti - Musharraf chant led by a youth with a megaphone , who was still wearing her school uniform , the other party slogans seemed played out .
To the PPP and PML - N , the protests were only a recruiting ground .
As rallies were organised by lawyers outside Lahore , the only non - lawyers being quoted in press coverage were party workers .
Parties are much easier to co - opt into the existing cronyism than the public and , as a result , we have Musharraf meeting Benazir in Dubai and Nawaz sent packing back to Jeddah .
With no end to the current ban on student unions in Pakistani campuses , we are n't likely to see a fresh set of leaders emerging from our youth .
So we will continue to pay for free flights for the present generation of Bhuttos and Sharifs to vacation in the Middle East ."
2007-09-10,"The former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif was arrested and deported to Saudi Arabia within hours of arriving at Islamabad airport today .
The airport drama was a major blow to Mr Sharif 's campaign to oust the current president , General Pervez Musharraf , who deposed him in a 1999 coup and sent him into exile one year later .
But the deportation will stoke public anger at Gen Musharraf 's increasingly authoritarian rule , and could trigger a fresh confrontation with the judiciary .
Clashes have been reported between Sharif supporters and police in Islamabad , Rawalpindi and Attock .
Mr Sharif 's party vowed to launch an immediate appeal before the supreme court , which only two and a half weeks ago ruled that Mr Sharif had an "" inalienable "" right of return to Pakistan .
In the event , Mr Sharif spent less than four hours on Pakistani soil .
Dozens of police commandos surrounded his Pakistan International Airlines flight after it arrived from London at 8.45am ( 0445 BST ) .
Earlier the authorities thwarted efforts by his supporters to reach the airport by sealing off roads , jamming mobile phone signals and arresting hundreds of people .
A tense standoff started as Mr Sharif refused to hand his passport to an immigration official who boarded the plane .
A helicopter waited outside , its rotors turning .
Ninety minutes later he was moved to a VIP lounge , accompanied by about 30 mostly foreign reporters , where a government 's anti - corruption investigator showed him a charge sheet , fuelling speculation that he was about to be arrested .
The charges included an accusation that Mr Sharif pocketed $ 21.2 m ( £ 10.4 m ) from the sale of a sugar mill business during his last term in offiice .
But Mr Sharif refused to sign the papers .
Shortly afterwards he was hustled into a bus that took him to the helicopter , and then into a waiting plane .
Officials in Saudi Arabia told Reuters that Mr Sharif was expected to arrive in the Red Sea city of Jeddah later this afternoon .
The deportation solves one problem for Gen Musharraf , who is battling to retain power in the face of swelling civilian opposition , but it may create many more .
Legal experts said the deportation appeared to contravene the August 23 supreme court ruling allowing Mr Sharif to return home .
Gen Musharraf has been at loggerheads with the court since March when he unsuccessfully tried to sack the chief justice , Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry .
Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (
PML - N ) party vowed to launch an appeal to the court by tomorrow , said Muhammad Iqbal , son of spokesman Ahsan Iqbal , who was arrested on his way to the airport .
On Sunday Mr Iqbal told a press conference : "" The government 's knees are shaking ...
General Musharraf is already defeated . ""
But today defiance gave way to disarray as the military - led government clamped down hard on the party .
"" The situation is really messed up , "" said his son .
"" The majority of our leadership have been arrested .
Our central secretariat was raided , the staff are gone and our phone lines have been cut . ""
A former president of Pakistan , Rafiq Tarar , was among Sharif loyalists who said they had been roughed up before being taken into police custody .
Now the mantle of leadership falls to Mr Sharif 's younger brother , Shahbaz , who bade him a tearful farewell at Heathrow airport yesterday .
"" This will be counted as the blackest day in Pakistan 's history , "" Shahbaz told Geo television from London .
"" I do not have words to describe my grief . ""
Before his arrest Mr Sharif acknowledged that his return was a "" risky course "" .
But his aim was to "" take Pakistan back to the rule of democracy "" , he told reporters on the plane . ""
Because unless we have this , we will continue to be in a state of mess , as we are today .
"" As his plane touched down in Islamabad he moved from business to economy class , where he offered prayers amid a clutch of journalists and supporters .
The crisis has dragged the government of Saudi Arabia ever deeper into Pakistani politics .
On Saturday the head of the Saudi intelligence services , Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz , arrived in Pakistan , where he urged Mr Sharif to respect an earlier promise to stay away until 2010 .
"" It is here and signed , "" said Prince Muqrin , waving a copy of the agreement before reporters .
But the most immediate impact could be on negotiations between Gen Musharraf and Pakistan 's other exiled former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto .
Talks in Dubai have stalled as Gen Musharraf refuses to cede key powers of the presidency , including the right to sack the prime minister without cause .
Ms Bhutto has said she will announce her own return date to Pakistan on Friday ."
2007-09-11,"Lawyers for Nawaz Sharif , the former prime minister of Pakistan , have filed a petition in the country 's supreme court , challenging his deportation to Saudi Arabia .
President Pervez Musharraf expelled Mr Sharif , whom he ousted in a 1999 coup , hours after the opposition leader arrived on a flight from London yesterday , intending to lead a campaign against General Musharraf .
Mr Sharif was charged with corruption before he was forced to leave after spending just four hours in the country .
The petition asks the court to start proceedings against the government for contempt in relation to the deportation .
Last month , the court ruled that Mr Sharif had an inalienable right to return home .
Fakhruddin G Ibrahim , a lawyer for Mr Sharif , said the petition was filed this morning
but it was not clear when the court would begin hearing the case .
The petition will create another battle between the supreme court and Gen Musharraf .
The court has curbed the president 's dominance since his failed attempt to sack the country 's top judge earlier this year , a move that sparked a nationwide protest movement .
Ali Ahmed Kurd , a senior member of the Pakistan bar council , said lawyers across the country were boycotting court proceedings to protest against Mr Sharif 's deportation .
"" The government intentionally and willfully violated the August 23 ruling of the supreme court , "" he said .
"" The government wants to curb the independence of the court that it achieved through the lawyers ' movement .
We should back the independence of the judiciary . ""
Tariq Azim , the deputy information minister , told the BBC that the government obeyed the court 's ruling to allow Mr Sharif to enter the country , but that the former prime minister chose to go back into exile to avoid facing trial .
Mr Sharif was exiled in 2000 following the coup .
Accused of denying landing rights to a plane carrying Gen Musharraf that was running out of fuel , Mr Sharif was jailed but later released and sent to Saudi Arabia after allegedly pledging not to return for a decade .
"" It was a choice given to him that either he goes to a detention center and be detained and tried , or he goes and completes his 10-year agreement that he has signed with the Saudi government , "" Mr Azim said .
"" No hindrance or obstacle was placed upon his entry into Pakistan . """
2007-09-11,"The former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif was back in exile in Saudi Arabia last night after a dramatic airport showdown in Pakistan that bruised his hopes of ousting President Pervez Musharraf .
Mr Sharif was arrested , charged with corruption and put on a flight to Jeddah just four hours after landing in Islamabad on a scheduled flight from London .
The runway drama was a blow to Mr Sharif , who has been in exile since 2000 .
But it also damaged the credibility of his nemesis , Gen Musharraf , who is battling to stay in power beyond November 15 , the date when his term of office ends .
Mr Sharif 's supporters said they would immediately appeal against the deportation to Pakistan 's supreme court , which ruled on August 23 that the exiled politician had an "" inalienable "" right of return .
The case may be heard today .
"" This will be counted as the blackest day in Pakistan 's history , "" Mr Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , told Geo television from London .
"" I do not have words to describe my grief . ""
The interior minister , Aftab Khan Sherpao , said the deportation was "" in accordance with law and ethics "" , although Gen Musharraf 's spokesman , Rashid Qureshi , said the action had "" nothing to do with the presidency "" .
The European Union said Gen Musharraf should have respected the court ruling .
In Washington a state department spokesman was less critical , calling it a "" pending legal matter "" .
Gen Musharraf was never going to make it easy for Mr Sharif , who has regularly denounced him as a "" dictator "" .
From Sunday evening officials sealed the airport road , jammed mobile phone signals and arrested hundreds of supporters .
A former president of Pakistan , Rafiq Tarar , was among those roughed up .
As Mr Sharif 's flight pulled up outside the half - deserted terminal yesterday , commandos swarmed around the stairway .
A helicopter waited nearby , its rotors turning .
An immigration official boarded the plane but Mr Sharif refused to hand over his passport .
After a 90-minute standoff he moved to a VIP area , where he was presented with corruption charges , fuelling speculation he would be arrested and imprisoned .
They included an accusation that Mr Sharif pocketed $ 21.2 m ( £ 10.5 m ) from the sale of a sugar mill business during his time in power .
But shortly afterwards the commandos hustled Mr Sharif back onto the runway and into a waiting plane to be flown straight to Saudi Arabia .
Human rights groups protested against the role of Saudi Arabia , which on Saturday sent its intelligence chief , Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz , to admonish Mr Sharif . ""
Saudi Arabia has made itself party to the kidnapping of a Pakistani citizen in broad daylight and has flouted international law , "" said Ali Dayan Hasan , of Human Rights Watch .
On the flight to Islamabad Mr Sharif had moved from business to economy class , where he offered prayers among supporters .
"" It 's a great feeling to be home , "" he said , after stepping on Pakistani soil .
A few hours later he was deported ."
2007-09-11,"A fresh confrontation between President Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan 's supreme court loomed last night following a legal challenge to Nawaz Sharif 's deportation on Monday .
Mr Sharif 's lawyers lodged a court petition saying that government security agents acted illegally when they bundled the former prime minister on to a plane for Saudi Arabia just four hours after landing in Islamabad .
The former prime minister is relying on last month 's supreme court verdict that he had an "" inalienable "" right of return and should not be hindered by the government .
The supreme court , previously a rubber stamp for Pakistan 's military - led governments , has become a powerful check on the powers of General Musharraf .
It is headed by his arch - rival , chief justice Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry , whom he unsuccessfully tried to fire last March .
But the Sharif deportation suggests that Gen Musharraf 's mood is hardening , and the courts are under increasing pressure .
On Monday supporters of the MQM , a pro - Musharraf party whose leader lives in London , stormed a Karachi courthouse holding an inquiry into political violence last May.
The judges adjourned the hearing for a week .
Also in Karachi an outspoken anti - government lawyer was shot dead in a taxi on his way to work .
Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (
PML - N ) party was in disarray following an iron - fisted government clampdown .
The party said 4,000 activists had been arrested in recent days ; the interior ministry put the figure at 1,000 .
"" There 's a great sense of despondency in the party .
They had n't really thought this through , "" said Ayaz Amir , an analyst and former PML - N parliamentarian .
Among those in detention last night was spokesman Ahsan Iqbal , who spoke by phone to the Guardian .
He was being sent to a prison in Bahawalpur , near the Indian border , for 30 days .
"" This is a very serious crisis of governance , a blatant violation of the supreme court , "" he said .
"" It is no longer about Nawaz Sharif , it 's about the rule of law in this country . ""
He warned that Pakistan 's secular parties would give rise to greater religious fundamentalism .
"" When they crack down on us , they create a vacuum for the religious parties to gain ground , "" he said .
Mr Iqbal spoke during a six - hour parole break to attend a relative 's funeral .
He was due to return to jail last night .
The controversial deportation won Gen Musharraf valuable time to consider his next move in his campaign for re - election between September 15 and October 15 .
Power - sharing talks in Dubai with the other banished former premier , Benazir Bhutto , have stalled .
In the light of Monday 's deportation , the failure of talks could lead to harsher measures such as the imposition of a state of emergency or martial law .
Meanwhile , a suicide bombing in the North - West Frontier province highlighted the growing threat of Islamist violence .
Eighteen people died on a bus in Dera Ismail Khan as police tried to search a suspicious - looking passenger .
Witnesses claimed that the bomber appeared to be 14 or 15 years old ."
2007-09-12,"The sight of a former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , getting pinged out of his homeland to a place of exile in Saudi Arabia is bad news for Pakistan and the west .
And not because Sharif a good leader .
It demonstrated Musharraf 's unreconstructed authoritarianism in the face of a growing yearning in Pakistan for democracy .
It also evidenced his preparations for a political arranged marriage in which his chosen prime minister is elected solely to anchor him in power .
According to a senior aide to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , Musharraf even offered earlier this year to rig the elections in favour of her Pakistan People 's Party , if she guaranteed not to return to Pakistan to contest them .
The logic behind this kind of managed democracy is that only the military can hold together a fractious Pakistan that is strung out on incendiary religious fault - lines that threaten its stability and the west 's safety .
With nuclear weapons comes great responsibility , too , and the Pakistan military is the west 's best guarantee that it remains secure .
Then there are the powder kegs of Kashmir , al - Qaida and the Taliban , which the Pakistan military , too , are best - suited to tackle .
You would n't want the Islamists to take charge of Pakistan and these forces too , would you ?
However , backed by an estimated $ 10bn in US aid handed over since 9/11 , the military 's naked greed has been demonstrated by their sandbagging , according to the analyst Ayesha Siddiqa , of one third of the country 's economy - making them a political class rather then the constitutionally - appointed force to guard the country 's internal security and geographic integrity .
Under Musharraf , extremism has blossomed , as have the republic 's jihadi - infiltrated madrasas .
The Taliban , too , have regrouped and merged with a leaner al - Qaida that has taken succour from Pakistan 's Sunni extremists who although banned in 2002 re - emerged in 2005 with newly - minted global goals .
The Pakistan military even vacated the troubled province of Waziristan , having signed secret truces with the Talib - supporting militia there who continued to kill British and Afghan soldiers over the border in Helmand province .
Musharraf 's reluctance to tackle extremists suits him well .
While the west wants to drain the swamp in Afghanistan , the Pakistan military is eager to topple Hamid Karzai and raise there a conservative Pashtun government , akin to the Taliban , that will loath India and be thankful to Islamabad .
But the US sees none of this .
It is intent on Musharraf remaining in power , judging by Washington 's refusal to comment on Nawaz Sharif 's removal .
The White House is ploughing ahead with a deal to couple Musharraf with Benazir Bhutto , a feat that aims to legitimise Musharraf , buying him another five years , but at what cost to Pakistan and the west , which Musharraf has repeatedly betrayed ?
Rather than find out , many authoritative voices on Pakistan are arguing that it is time to step away from the generals , to stop prefiguring Pakistan 's democracy and let the people decide ."
2007-09-14,"Former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto can return to the country but will have to face any corruption cases against her , the government of Pervez Musharraf said today .
The deputy information minister , Tariq Azim , drew a distinction between Ms Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif , who was expelled four hours after his return on Monday . ""
Nawaz Sharif 's case was different .
He went back to Saudi Arabia because of an undertaking he had with the Saudi government , "" Mr Azim told the Associated Press . ""
She ( Bhutto ) was always allowed to come back . ""
Ms Bhutto , who lives between London and Dubai , has announced she will fly back to Pakistan on October 18 .
Asked about pending corruption cases against Mr Bhutto , Mr Azim said : "" It 's for the law to take its own course .
Everybody has to face cases against them and the same applies to her . ""
Ms Bhutto has been negotiating with the embattled president , Gen Musharraf , on a power - sharing deal to allow her to run for prime minister while he stays on as president .
Mr Azim said the talks with Ms Bhutto had become bogged down over her request for corruption cases to be dropped , for a constitutional amendment to let her seek a third term as prime minister , and over Gen Musharraf 's re - election .
Ms Bhutto has led her party from exile since leaving Pakistan in 1999 amid corruption claims .
Her party said it would announce her return date at simultaneous news conferences later today .
Her bargaining with Gen Musharraf has divided her own Pakistan People 's party , with opponents fearing it will be tarnished by associating with an unpopular leader .
Gen Musharraf has cut an increasingly forlorn figure since he tried to get the head of the supreme court sacked .
Now he faces an unfriendly court , which is due next week to begin hearing a petition against his bid to stand for a second term and his holding the offices of president and army chief simultaneously .
General elections are due by January .
A coalition of Musharraf and Bhutto is favoured by the US , which wants a dependable ally against al - Qaida 's influence on the Afghan - Pakistan border .
Mr Sharif 's party today again urged Ms Bhutto not to cut a deal with Gen Musharraf , who overthrew Mr Sharif in a coup in 1999 .
"" We welcome her coming back , but let me say that it will be an insult to democracy if she agrees to share power with a man who ousted the elected government of Nawaz Sharif and has caused irreparable damage to democratic institutions , "" said Sadiq ul - Farooq , a senior figure in the Pakistan Muslim League .
In a reminder of the militant threat confronting Pakistan , a suicide bomber detonated a car inside a high - security military base , killing 16 soldiers from an elite counter - terrorism force .
Twenty - nine soldiers were wounded in the attack on Thursday at Ghazi Tarbela base , about 60 miles south of the capital , Islamabad .
The base is the headquarters of Pakistan 's quick - reaction counterterrorism commandos ."
2007-09-26,"The party of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto today threatened to resign from parliament if President Pervez Musharraf was allowed to remain as head of the army and stand for another five - year term as head of state .
The supreme court is hearing petitions that General Musharraf should not be allowed to contest the presidential vote on October 6 by federal and provincial MPs unless he resigns as head of the armed forces .
Gen Musharraf , who seized power from the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a 1999 coup , has pledged to resign as military chief and restore civilian rule if MPs give him a fresh mandate .
A government lawyer said yesterday that the Pakistani leader would remain as army chief if he were not re - elected .
Ms Bhutto has held talks with Gen Musharraf about a potential power - sharing agreement that could see her return as prime minister for the third time .
But her Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) has said it would nominate its own candidate for president , the party vice - chairman , Makhdoom Amin Fahim , if Gen Musharraf were barred from standing .
PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar said : "" If the supreme court does not disqualify Gen Pervez Musharraf , the PPP would consider resigning from parliament unless moves are taken towards democracy . ""
An opposition coalition of Islamist parties and Mr Sharif 's party has said that they , too , plan to resign from parliament this week in an attempt to rob the presidential vote of any legitimacy .
There have been fears ahead of the supreme court judgment that Gen Musharraf would declare a state of emergency if the decision goes against him .
The government has denied the claims .
With the court ruling expected this week , authorities have already rounded up at least 100 leading opposition members to prevent street protests , drawing sharp criticism from Washington and the European Union .
Syed Munawar Hasan , a leader of the Islamist Muttahida Majlis - e - Amal ( MMA ) , or United Action Forum , said its lawmakers would resign from the national assembly , parliament 's lower house , but were waiting until after the supreme court verdict before deciding whether to resign from the four provincial assemblies .
He said MMA members of the senate , the upper house , would not resign and would support Wajihuddin Ahmed , a former supreme court judge who was nominated by lawyers to run against Gen Musharraf .
Siddique ul - Farooq , a spokesman for Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N party , said its senators would also support Mr Ahmed 's candidacy , while its other lawmakers would resign from the other assemblies "" as a strategy to block the way of Pervez Musharraf "" .
Gen Musharraf has seen his popularity and power erode since his failed attempt to fire the supreme court 's chief justice earlier this year .
His administration is also struggling to contain Islamist militants .
Arguments continued today in the supreme court over whether Gen Musharraf 's role as both president and head of the military affected his eligibility to stand in the presidential election .
SM Zafar , a lawyer appointed by the supreme court to advise on the case , said that if the military leader had previously separated the offices of president and army chief , "" the country 's democratic credentials would certainly have been raised "" ."
2007-09-28,"Pakistan 's chief justice ordered the release of hundreds of opposition activists yesterday as President Pervez Musharraf pushed ahead with controversial plans for re - election in eight days ' time .
Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry ordered government officials to free the activists , mostly from Nawaz Sharif 's PML - N party , whom the police had been rounding up since the weekend .
The interior minister said 200 people were in custody ; the opposition put the figure in the thousands .
The judge , who scored a historic court victory over General Musharraf in July , also demanded an explanation for a security crackdown across the capital , Islamabad .
Hundreds of riot police flooded on to the streets at dawn and main roads were blocked to prevent expected protests .
The deputy information minister , Tariq Azim , said the government would comply with the judge 's orders .
But the crackdown had already served its purpose - hours earlier Musharraf supporters had lodged his nomination papers for re - election on October 6 at the national election commission .
The detentions had embarrassed the US , one of Gen Musharraf 's key allies .
In a statement on Monday , the American embassy termed the arrests "" extremely disturbing and confusing "" and called for the immediate release of the detainees .
But the president may have to cross his greatest hurdle today , when the supreme court is expected to rule on a major challenge by opposition parties , who claim that Gen Musharraf 's re - election bid is illegal and unconstitutional .
Analysts say that if Gen Musharraf loses the court battle he may resort to emergency rule or impose martial law .
He has tried to assuage concerns by promising to resign from the army - but only if he is re - elected . ""
This is part of the transition towards democracy .
Soon Gen Musharraf will become Mr Musharraf , "" said Mushahid Hussain , a key civilian aide of the president .
Critics say Gen Musharraf is using his military uniform to force his way back into power through a vote of dubious validity .
Pakistan 's presidents are chosen by an electoral college composed of the national and provincial assemblies .
But the current parliament was elected in a rigged poll in 2002 , and its term of office expires in six weeks ' time .
"" Why can he not simply contest the election on the basis of his popularity ?
Is it an admission that nobody would elect him unless he carries a gun in his hand ? ""
a lawyer , Aitzaz Ahsan , asked the supreme court .
An opposition alliance comprising the Islamist Muttahida Majlis - e - Amal and Mr Sharif 's party said yesterday that their legislators would quit the national and four provincial assemblies on October 2 - three days later than initially planned - to deny the election legitimacy .
Wajihuddin Ahmed , a retired supreme court judge who refused to swear allegiance to Gen Musharraf after his 1999 coup , was among 42 other protest candidates who put themselves forward for next week 's vote . ""
He has been in power for the past eight years .
The people of Pakistan are groaning , "" he said .
The stock exchange reacted positively to news of Gen Musharraf 's nomination , ending 0.43 % higher , reflecting his popularity with business people .
But many poor Pakistanis are less enthusiastic , weary of soaring food prices and angry at his strategic alliance with Washington .
The legal drama places immense pressure on the nine supreme court judges .
The chief justice , Mr Chaudhry , recused himself , citing a conflict of interest .
Yesterday there was much speculation that the court would come up with a compromise ruling - allowing Gen Musharraf to compete in the election , but only after giving up his army uniform .
"" Much depends on tomorrow 's judgment , "" said an analyst , Hasan Askari Rizvi .
"" But even if Musharraf gets away with the election , the crisis will continue . """

2007-11-16,"Even as the US tries to salvage something from a tattered anti - terrorist strategy , it is aware that there is more to Pakistan than General Pervez Musharraf , Benazir Bhutto , Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif .
In a fluid political situation , one thing is certain .
No ruler of Pakistan , whether an unelected or sort - of - elected military man , or an elected politician , governs in a vacuum .
Pakistan 's army and its citizens - the potential voters - will play a crucial role in shaping their country 's future .
The military will remain visible in politics , regardless of who is in power .
No one can govern without its consent .
Yesterday , Musharraf announced his intention to take his uniform off by December 1 and appoint a caretaker government , led by Mohammad Soomro of the ruling pro - army Pakistan Muslim League ( Qaid - e - Azam ) , only after consulting the military and intelligence .
Since the first of four military coups in 1958 , the military 's ascendancy has been evident in the politics , society and economy of Pakistan - in everything from the nuclear establishment to golf courses and the arms and tourist trades .
Reports that some officers were unhappy with Musharraf 's declaration of emergency on November 3 do not necessarily imply that the army is thinking of retiring from politics .
The generals think they know the people .
So the idea that any politician could challenge the military 's dominance is unlikely to be entertained by them .
Even the blundering Bush administration would not advise the politicians to do that , if only because Washington needs the help of Pakistan 's armed and intelligence services in the fight against global terrorism .
All that it is telling Pakistani leaders is that the electoral trappings of democracy could look nice , thank you .
That in turn raises the question of what Pakistan 's citizens think .
In the 2002 elections to the National Assembly , Bhutto 's People 's party won 25.8 % of the vote , and 86 seats .
The government was formed by the Pakistan Muslim League ( Qaid - e - Azam ) , which got 25.7 % of the vote and 126 seats , and an alliance of radical Islamic parties , including the Jamaat - e - Islami , which obtained 11.3 % of the vote and 63 seats .
The Islamic alliance won a majority in the North - West Frontier province ( NWFP ) , where they have introduced Sharia law , and presided over a steep rise in extremist activity over the last five years .
The arrest of the former cricketer , Imran Khan , on November 14 , heightens suspense about the inclinations of young Pakistani voters .
Emerging out of hiding to address students at Lahore 's Punjab University , he was held up by student supporters of the hawkish Jamaat - e - Islami , who objected to his presence on the campus .
That hold - up made possible Imran 's capture by the police .
The hard question is about the extent of radical Islam in Pakistan .
According to an opinion poll conducted earlier this year , 46 % of Pakistanis approve of Bin Laden , 38 % of Musharraf .
Bin Laden was endorsed by 70 % of Pakistanis polled in the NWFP , which is probably his safe haven .
More than 57 % favoured Bhutto and Sharif .
Only 24 % disapprove of local Pakistani jihadi groups associated with al - Qaida and 72 % take an unfavourable view of the US , making it the most unpopular foreign country among Pakistanis .
Moreover , human rights activists do not know whether the low public response to calls for protests reflects apathy , fear of prison or fear of suicide bombers if people defy the emergency .
At present public opinion appears divided , giving generals yet another pretext to retain their grip on Pakistan 's polity .
The preferences of Pakistani voters will only be known when they go to the polls in January 2008 .
Meanwhile , has the ongoing crisis in Pakistan sounded the last call of America 's anti - terrorist strategy , or will the Bush government be able to devise a viable one ?"
2007-11-24,"Pakistan 's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf will allow his bitter rival Nawaz Sharif to return home tomorrow , ending seven years of exile in Saudi Arabia , Musharraf 's spokesman said .
"" Yes he will be allowed to land , "" retired General Rashid Qureshi told the Observer , referring to Sharif 's planned arrival at Lahore airport tomorrow afternoon aboard a chartered Saudi jet .
Musharraf ejected Sharif , whom he deposed as prime minister in a 1999 coup , from Pakistan when he tried to return last September .
Four hours after landing in Islamabad the burly politician was bundled onto a Saudi - bound airliner .
But the military ruler changed his mind earlier this week following a meeting with the Saudi monarch King Abdullah in Riyadh .
Qureshi said : "" Discussions were carried out on Nawaz Sharif 's return .
The president said there is no issue , he can return if he wants to . ""
Sharif 's return is a potent addition to Pakistan 's political cauldron , with Musharraf struggling to maintain power against a backdrop of great instability and rising Islamist violence .
Today two suicide bombers struck outside army headquarters in Rawalpindi , killing at least 35 people .
One bomb hit an army checkpoint ; the other a bus laden with employees from the powerful Inter Services Intelligence agency .
They were the first major attacks since Musharraf imposed emergency rule three weeks ago .
Musharraf , who insists he wants to become a civilian ruler , is under intense international pressure to lift the emergency and make good on promises to resign as head of the army .
Today the national election commission cleared Musharraf to take oath as a civilian president following the defeat of all legal challenges to his re - election .
His spokesman , Qureshi , said that once the federal government is officially notified on Monday , Musharraf may take off his uniform as early as Tuesday .
"" I do n't think it 's going to take long .
I would estimate a day or two [ after Monday ] before change of baton of the army , then oath taking , "" he said .
The return of Sharif will complicate Musharraf 's plans to remain in power .
The two have been nursing a nasty feud since 1999 , when Musharraf ousted Sharif as prime minister as part of the bloodless coup that brought him to power .
Musharraf said the move had been triggered by Sharif 's clumsy attempt to remove him as head of the army .
A year later Sharif was released from prison on condition of agreeing to a 10-year exile in Saudi Arabia .
Local media reported that Musharraf tried to persuade Saudi authorities to keep him there during his flying visit earlier this week .
But the Saudis insisted he had to go home .
Sharif is due to fly from Medina to Lahore aboard a plane chartered by the Saudi royal family and arriving at 3 pm ( 10 pm GMT ) .
That gives him enough time to file his nomination papers for planned January 8 elections by Monday .
Musharraf aides put a brave face on his return , framing it in terms of national reconciliation . ""
The president 's a very magnanimous man .
Nawaz Sharif is the head of one political party .
If the rest of the political leaders can come to Pakistan , then he can too , "" said Qureshi .
Sharif aides denied his return had been greased by a political agreement .
"" Nawaz will die but he will not make a deal with Musharraf , "" said Javed Hashmi , the acting president of his Pakistan Muslim League - N party , on Friday .
The drama underscores the weight of Saudi influence in Pakistan .
Local media reported that Riyadh wanted Sharif , a conservative who as prime minister once tried to have himself titled "" commander of the faithful "" , to return as a counterweight to Benazir Bhutto , a relatively secular and liberal woman .
The return also spells trouble for Musharraf 's political associates .
His Pakistan Muslim League - Q party draws on the same vote bank as Sharif in Punjab , the country 's most populous and powerful province .
A strong showing by Sharif in the January poll could scupper Musharraf 's chances of a stranglehold on parliament .
Yesterday his former prime minister , Shaukat Aziz , said he would not be contesting the January vote ."
2007-11-24,"Nawaz Sharif , a former prime minister of Pakistan , will return home tomorrow , ending seven years in exile in Saudi Arabia , his brother said last night .

The announcement came hours after a meeting between Sharif and Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah , who is said to have approved his return .
A Pakistani government spokesman could not be reached for comment late last night .
Sharif 's planned return is the latest twist in Pakistan 's fast - moving political drama and spells a further headache for Pervez Musharraf , the president , who is already battling international criticism of his three - week - old emergency rule .
Yesterday the foreign ministry in Islamabad condemned as "" unreasonable and unjustified "" the Commonwealth 's suspension of Pakistan at a meeting in Uganda on Thursday .
Sharif 's returns could delay Musharraf 's plans to resign as army chief this weekend .
Already the attorney general , Malik Qayyum , who earlier said the general might remove his uniform today , pushed the deadline back to December 1 .
Sharif and Musharraf have been bitter enemies since 1999 when the general overthrew Sharif in a bloodless coup .
He was banished to Saudi Arabia a year later .
An attempt by Sharif to return in September was bluntly rebuffed when officials bundled him on to a Saudi - bound plane hours after he landed at Islamabad airport .
Saudi authorities were complicit in his expulsion but over the past week have made it clear they now want him to go home for good .
Ahsan Iqbal , a spokesman for Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N party , said the Saudis had been stung by criticism in Pakistan since September , and were mindful of general elections due on January 8 .
"" They do n't want Saudi Arabia to become an election issue in Pakistan .
They conveyed to Nawaz Sharif that there 's no reason why we should keep him , "" he said .
Sharif served as prime minister twice in the 90s and has his powerbase in Punjab province , Pakistan 's most populous .
Musharraf flew to Saudi Arabia this week to meet King Abdullah , apparently to try to stave off Sharif 's return ."
2007-11-25,"Pakistan 's ruler General Pervez Musharraf will allow his bitter rival , Nawaz Sharif , to return home today , ending seven years of exile in Saudi Arabia , Musharraf 's spokesman said .
' Yes , he will be allowed to land , ' retired General Rashid Qureshi said , referring to Sharif 's planned arrival at Lahore airport this afternoon on a chartered jet .
Musharraf ejected Sharif , whom he deposed as Prime Minister in a 1999 coup , from Pakistan when he tried to return last September .
Four hours after landing in Islamabad , the politician was bundled onto a Saudi - bound airliner .
But the military ruler changed his mind last week after a meeting in Riyadh with King Abdullah .
Qureshi said : ' Discussions were carried out on Sharif 's return .
The President said there is no issue ; he can return if he wants to . '
His re - emergence is a potent addition to Pakistan 's political cauldron , with Musharraf struggling to maintain power against a backdrop of instability and Islamist violence .
Yesterday two suicide bombers struck outside army headquarters in Rawalpindi , killing at least 35 people .
One bomb hit an army checkpoint ; the other a bus laden with employees from the Inter Services Intelligence agency .
They were the first major attacks since Musharraf imposed emergency rule three weeks ago .
Musharraf , who insists he wants to become a civilian ruler , is under international pressure to lift the emergency and make good on promises to resign as head of the army .
Yesterday the national election commission cleared him to take the oath as a civilian President after the defeat of all legal challenges to his re - election .
Qureshi said that Musharraf may take off his uniform as early as Tuesday .
Sharif is due to fly from Medina to Lahore in a plane chartered by the Saudi royal family , arriving at 5 pm local time .
That gives him long enough to file his nomination papers for the planned 8 January elections .
The drama underscores the weight of Saudi influence in Pakistan .
Local media reported that Riyadh wanted Sharif , a conservative who , as Prime Minister , once tried to have himself titled ' Commander of the Faithful ' , to return as a counterweight to Benazir Bhutto , a relatively secular and liberal woman ."
2007-11-26,"The former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif today ruled out a power - sharing deal with General Pervez Musharraf , as it was confirmed that the president would resign from the army on Wednesday .
After his return from exile in Saudi Arabia yesterday , Sharif said his PML - N party was not interested in governing with Musharraf , who ousted Sharif from power in a 1999 coup . ""
My party will not become part of any coalition government under President Musharraf in future , "" he said .
"" We believe that any government serving under Musharraf will be illegal and undemocratic . ""
Last week , Musharraf flew to Saudi Arabia in a failed attempt to persuade King Abdullah to keep Sharif in the country until after the Pakistani elections on January 8 .
There were rumours at the time that he could even be planning a power - sharing deal with Sharif .
The former prime minister said he had refused to meet Musharraf , and yesterday he insisted his return was not the result of any deal with the president .
"" I have n't met any Pakistani government functionary over the last eight years , although there were a lot of overtures from the Pakistani side to meet me and to talk to me , "" he said .
Benazir Bhutto has also ruled out serving under Musharraf , despite a western - backed power - sharing deal that was brokered before the imposition of emergency rule .
Sharif and Bhutto have both threatened to boycott the elections , although both are keeping their options open .
Bhutto filed nomination papers yesterday and Sharif registered today .
Speaking from his country estate outside Lahore , Sharif said of his party : "" We do n't want to boycott elections , but if you push someone to the wall ... what options are left ?
We demand restoration of all judges , lifting of curbs on media , lifting of emergency before elections .
"" The army today confirmed for the first time that Musharraf would finally step down as the head of the military this week . ""
He is going to take oath as has been announced by government on November 29 , most probably , so he is going to take off his uniform a day before that , "" said a spokesman , Major General Waheed Arshad .
Yesterday , Pakistan 's attorney general , Malik Qayyum , said Musharraf was likely to lift emergency rule before the elections .
Both concessions have been repeatedly demanded by the United States .
Bhutto welcomed Sharif 's return and did not rule out an election alliance with her former political rival .
"" We are ready to talk to any moderate party to find common ground and to continue our struggle for democracy , "" she said .
On Musharraf 's plan to step down from the army , a spokesman for Bhutto said it would be a "" major "" step forward .
If Musharraf made more concessions , "" then the window for negotiations can be reopened "" , said the spokesman , Farhatullah Babar .
Sharif confirmed that he had held discussions with Bhutto in an attempt to find common ground against Musharraf .
"" We have both been interacting over the past few days , so let 's see what comes out of it , "" he told the Karachi news agency News Network International .
The former cricketer turned opposition politician Imran Khan is expected to boycott the elections .
He was arrested at a student protest in Karachi earlier this month and then released last week after briefly going on hunger strike ."
2007-11-26,"It was second time lucky for Nawaz Sharif , the former Pakistani prime minister who returned home last night after seven years in exile to scenes of chaotic jubilation .
Frenzied supporters thronged Lahore airport after Sharif landed in a plane organised by the royal family of Saudi Arabia , where Sharif has spent most of his time since fleeing Pakistan in 2000 .
Struggling to stay on his feet , the portly opposition leader mounted a hotel reservations desk on the concourse , waving to the jostling crowd and smiling .
"" This is the proudest day of my life , "" he said , vowing to take on President Pervez Musharraf .
"" We ca n't afford to have dictatorship in Pakistan today ; there are too many problems , "" he said .
The return of another political heavyweight on the heels of Benazir Bhutto last month spells fresh trouble for Musharraf , who appears increasingly unpopular and isolated since declaring emergency rule three weeks ago .
The two men have been bitter rivals since 1999 , when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a bloodless coup , and the general apparently allowed him home yesterday with great reluctance .
The dramatic scenes also underscored the strong influence that the House of Saud has quietly wielded over Pakistani affairs for the past 30 years .
Two months ago Sharif attempted to return home by flying to Islamabad .
He was greeted by officials bearing a deportation order who bundled him on a Saudi - bound plane .
But this time the Saudis wanted Sharif home in time to contest the January 8 elections .
Analysts said that conservative - minded Saudi rulers wanted to insert Sharif as a foil to the relatively liberal Bhutto .
Musharraf travelled to Riyadh last week to persuade King Abdullah to change his mind and keep Sharif away until after the poll .
But the Saudis insisted that their guest should return home and Musharraf appeared to have little choice but to accept .
"" I have kissed the hands of Mian Nawaz Sharif ! "" said Rehan Butt , an employee of Pakistan 's national airline at Lahore airport last night .
Sharif led a slow - moving procession towards the city , travelling in a bulletproof Mercedes provided by the Saudi authorities .
It was a reminder of the dangerous times Pakistan is going through .
A suicide bomber struck a much larger welcome home procession for Bhutto last month , killing at least 140 people .
Two more blasts at the gates of the army headquarters in Rawalpindi on Saturday left another 35 people dead .
Several were employees of the powerful Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency .
Sharif and his officials denied reports of a secret pact with Musharraf .
"" There is no deal .
I know my leader , and no way will he make a deal , "" said Nazhat Aamir Sadiq , a leader of the women 's wing of his party .
The return is a bitter blow for Musharraf and spells trouble for his political party , which draws its support from the same Punjabi constituencies as the former prime minister . ""
The Q - league will come under pressure , "" said Ayaz Amir , a commentator and former Sharif parliamentarian , referring to Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League - Q party .
It also marks a remarkable comeback by Sharif .
Two spells as prime minister in the 1990s were marked by misrule , corruption and controversy .
Famously he tried to have himself declared as the "" commander of the faithful "" , and in 1998 plunged Pakistan into international isolation by ordering the first nuclear tests .
A leaked intelligence report in 2000 exposed how he had pressured a high court judge to jail his rival , Bhutto , and her husband , Asif Zardari , for at least seven years on corruption charges .
When a supreme court decision was going against Sharif in 1997 thuggish supporters stormed the supreme court .
But as Musharraf 's political fortunes have dramatically dipped this year , Sharif has successfully repackaged his image .
Tough statements condemning the general as a dictator chimed with growing condemnation from lawyers and civil society groups at home .
Returning home , he positioned himself as a champion of the judiciary and the rule of law .
"" I have no lust for any post or power , "" he said as supporters carried him off .
"" We want democracy and nothing else . ""
Welcoming him back , Bhutto kept open the possibility of a future election alliance .
Sharif is expected to file his election nomination papers today .
Saudi Arabia acquired a prominent role in Pakistani politics in the late 1970s during the rule of Islamist dictator Zia ul - Haq .
The relationship strengthened in the 1980s when Saudi intelligence matched secret American funding of the Afghan jihad to the tune of several billion dollars .
Musharraf relied on Saudi oil subventions worth $ 1bn a year to keep the Pakistani economy afloat in the late 1990s .
The ISI has maintained a close relationship with Saudi intelligence .
Sharif must now decide whether to boycott the January poll , which few believe will be free or fair under emergency rule .
Bhutto filed her nomination papers in Sindh yesterday .
The opposition has until December 16 to make a decision .
Under intense international pressure , Musharraf has promised to quit as army chief in the coming days and take the oath as a civilian president shortly afterwards .
He secured a second term through a controversial October 6 election .
The newly appointed supreme court , packed with Musharraf loyalists , cleared him of all legal challenges last week .
But Musharraf refuses to say when he will lift the emergency - a position that led the Commonwealth to suspend Pakistan last week , for the second time since 1999 ."
2007-11-26,"General Pervez Musharraf 's plan to retain power as Pakistan 's civilian president is still intact , despite weeks of jaw - dropping blunders .
But insiders say he will not last long , once a new government is elected and his army ties fade .
They predict the general 's final posting , following a trail into exile blazed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif , will be duke of Knightsbridge or king of Dubai .
Musharraf 's decision to call an election on January 8 , his imminent resignation as army chief , his acquiescence in Sharif 's weekend return , and gradual release of political prisoners have all helped put his pre - crisis plan back on track .
Officials say he is now under intense American pressure to take the last , crucial step and lift the state of emergency , as demanded by US special envoy John Negroponte last week .
Only an end to the emergency can give the coming elections necessary credibility ( although few expect them to be entirely free from manipulation ) , they say .
And only this will quell mounting alarm in Washington about the lack of political alternatives to Musharraf and semi - hysterical questions about who "" lost "" nuclear - armed Muslim Pakistan .
Pakistani officials suggest a private understanding that the emergency will end soon explains why President George Bush spoke out so strongly in Musharraf 's support after Negroponte departed .
To derisive guffaws from Democrats , Bush said the general "" truly is somebody who believes in democracy "" and who "" has n't crossed the line "" .
But so far Bush is sticking to his hired gun .
Despite personal hostility to Musharraf and long lists of preconditions , both Bhutto and Sharif are preparing to participate in the polls .
Bhutto said on Sunday her Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) would take part "" under protest "" because "" we do n't want to leave the field open for our rivals "" .
But other calculations are also in play .
The Bhutto - Musharraf relationship has deteriorated sharply since her return to Karachi last month .
Yet despite everything , the pre - crisis mutual understanding brokered by the US is still salvageable . ""
Musharraf and Bhutto detest each other .
They both think of themselves as saviours .
Neither is good at sharing power , "" a senior official said .
"" But this marriage was not made in heaven .
It was made in Washington .
Benazir does whatever the Americans tell her . ""
Both leaders were pro - American and relatively secular and liberal in outlook , unlike the conservative Sharif with his strong ties to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan 's religious parties .
And again unlike Bhutto , Sharif is adamant he will not work with Musharraf , who he has never forgiven for deposing him in the 1999 coup .
The most likely , immediate outcome was a coalition government led by Bhutto as prime minister , the official said , even though the chances of her working successfully with him as civilian president were poor in the longer term . ""
Benazir will make a bid for greater power as PM .
The dynamic will be with her .
So there 's going to be a big struggle . ""
In prospect now is a return to Pakistan 's so - called "" troika politics "" of the 1990s , when president , prime minister and military fought for the political upper hand , usually in alliances of two - against - one .
This ongoing institutionalised power struggle , guaranteeing instability and strife , was also cast as a battle between the "" three A 's "" - "" America , the army , and Allah , "" not necessarily in that order .
Musharraf 's aim had been to lead Pakistan out of this self - destructive cycle , the senior official said : "" In the first phase , from the coup until 2002 , he accumulated power .
That was when he called himself ' chief executive ' .
In the second phase , from 2002 until this year , he held managed elections and had a hand - picked PM .
The third phase is to hand over and move to a civilian presidency .
This is the most troublesome phase .
The problem is , he 's paranoid now .
He thinks everybody is out to get him - and he 's right . ""
Musharraf 's legacy in foreign affairs , notably in improved relations with India , and in growing the economy was not inconsiderable , a former supporter said .
The main opposition leaders were deeply flawed while it was true to say that a highly politicised judiciary had sparked the current crisis .
But in his recent actions , in the opinion of Pakistan 's "" civil society "" , Musharraf had simply gone too far , the source said .
However hard he now fought to hang on to the presidency , the probability was that , sooner rather than later , it would be prised from his grasp . ""
His preference will be to hold on to power , to run things himself , as long as he can .
That 's partly because he fears the consequences of letting go .
But he will never be forgiven for the last few weeks . """
2007-11-27,"This will be a decisive week in Pakistani politics .
Pervez Musharraf has been diminished by Nawaz Sharif 's return .
The ranks of the president 's opponents have been strengthened , while his projection of himself as a strong man in full command of the situation has been undermined by the very public way in which Saudi Arabia , in insisting that Sharif be allowed home , has demonstrated its power and influence .
When Musharraf ceases to be a general and is sworn in as a civilian president , which is expected to happen later this week , an important link between him and the Pakistani military will be broken .
What was originally simply a necessary move to continue in office will now reinforce the perception that a certain distance has opened up between him and the armed forces .
Their loyalty has always been conditional on his political effectiveness , but senior officers may now be considering more urgently the question of at what point his usefulness might come to an end .
Musharraf has also weakened his position by a series of interviews which suggest he has an unbalanced and almost messianic view of his role in Pakistani history .
While Musharraf weighs his shrinking options , Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have some critical decisions to make .
Events have given them a second chance in the Pakistani political arena , but one or both of them could easily mismanage it , particularly since they are attempting not only to outmanoeuvre Musharraf but to outmanoeuvre each other .
The most important issue before them and other opposition leaders is whether to boycott the general elections in January .
Some say that a boycott , leaving only Musharraf 's party and smaller allies in the fray , would strip Musharraf of his remaining legitimacy .
In the aftermath of such a pointless exercise , he might be pressured into resigning by the army and by the United States and Saudi Arabia , the two outside powers who matter most in Pakistan .
Others argue that the best approach would be to agree to take part in elections , but only on the condition that a genuinely national interim government take over from the present , openly pro - Musharraf caretaker administration .
A relatively fair vote would then throw up a government , perhaps one of national unity , which would decide Musharraf 's fate .
What would be the worst of all worlds would be for one major party , Benazir 's People 's Party being the one that might clearly be tempted , to boycott while the other participated , or for the parties to split into boycott and anti - boycott wings .
Opposition leaders are due to meet in Lahore to decide on a common strategy .
Much will depend on their conclusions ."

2007-11-30,"Pakistan 's president , Pervez Musharraf , promised to lift emergency rule by December 16 last night , hours after he was sworn in for a second five - year term .
A swift end to the state of emergency has been a major demand of Musharraf 's western allies , including Gordon Brown and George Bush .
But the concession was immediately rebuffed by an opposition alliance headed by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , which threatened to boycott elections scheduled for January 8 .
Sharif said he had decided "" in principle "" to boycott the election but would take a final decision after meeting with the other opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto .
Any boycott would badly damage the "" democratic transition "" envisaged by Musharraf at an oath - taking ceremony at Islamabad 's presidential palace . ""
This is a milestone in the transition of Pakistan to the complete essence of democracy , "" he told assembled army generals , political allies and western diplomats .
Musharraf vowed to "" preserve , protect and defend "" the constitution - which he usurped on November 3 to impose emergency rule .
The constitution remained suspended yesterday .
The newly retired military strongman defended his decision to impose emergency rule , blaming rising Islamist violence and an obstructive judiciary for forcing him to act . ""
This was an extraordinary situation , ladies and gentlemen , that required extraordinary measures , "" he said .
"" No half - hearted measures could have delivered . ""
But critics said the move had been principally aimed at silencing opposition and paving the way for his second term of office .
Since November 3 the government has arrested more than 5,000 opponents , sacked independent - minded judges and muzzled critical journalists .
About 55 of Pakistan 's 93 superior court judges have refused to renew their oath while the deposed chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry remains under house arrest .
Yesterday Sharif , who returned from exile on Sunday , said his party would boycott the election unless the sacked judges were restored .
"" It 's immaterial whether the emergency is lifted now or in 15 days .
The real issue is the reinstatement of the judiciary , "" said his spokesman Nadir Chaudhri .
Bhutto 's spokesman could not be reached for comment .
Sharif 's opposition alliance includes the country 's largest religious party , Jamaat - e - Islami , and several smaller parties , including that of Pakistan 's former cricket captain Imran Khan .
Together they are estimated to account for at least 25 % of the vote .
Since March the lawyers have proven to be Musharraf 's most consistent and vociferous opponents .
As the former general was sworn in yesterday hundreds of lawyers in black suits and white shirts clashed with police outside Lahore 's city courts .
Both sides threw bottles and bricks and several people were reported wounded .
Musharraf blamed recent turbulence on Chaudhry , whom he accused of orchestrating a "" conspiracy "" to derail his planned "" transition to democracy "" .
And he put a brave face on the return of Bhutto and Sharif , opposition rivals he used to denounce as corrupt and incompetent . ""
This is good for the political reconciliation I have spoken of , "" he said after being sworn in .
But he said that the election would take place regardless of any boycott . ""
Come hell or high water , elections will be held on January 8 .
Nobody derails it . ""
Addressing the ambassadors present , he lashed out at western criticism of his authoritarian tactics .
"" I feel there is an unrealistic and maybe impracticable obsession with your form of democracy , with your form of human rights , civil liberties , "" he said .
"" One certainly can not sacrifice the stability and development of the nation for the sake of your views . ""
Rioting lawyers in Lahore felt otherwise .
"" We are not scared .
We do n't accept Musharraf even without his uniform .
He has to go , "" Malik Mohammad Arshad , his eye swollen and head bleeding after being hit by a brick , told Reuters ."
2007-12-03,"The Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has been banned from taking part in January 's elections .
The country 's electoral commission today announced it had rejected his application on account of his criminal record .
The former prime minister was found guilty of treason in 1999 , when he was ousted from power by the then General Musharraf .
Sharif , who returned from seven years of exile on November 25 , had been threatening to boycott the election but had lodged nomination papers .
His exclusion from the vote will be seen by the opposition as the result of pressure on election officials by President Musharraf to block the old rival he ousted .
Critics say Musharraf has sway over voting officials .
"" I 'm very clear that there is somebody else who is manoeuvring things , "" said one of Sharif 's lawyers , Imtiaz Kaifi .
Kaifi said Sharif 's party would decide whether to appeal . ""
This shows the election is based on rigging .
General Musharraf ca n't face Mr Sharif in the polling
- that 's why he has been denied [ the chance ] to contest the election , "" said a party spokesman , Ahsan Iqbal .
Sharif arrived in Islamabad earlier today for talks with another opposition leader and former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , on his plan to boycott the vote .
Bhutto , who returned from eight years of self - exile in October , says her party will take part in the election although she has left open the option of joining Sharif in a boycott .
Critics of the move to ban Sharif from January 's elections on account of his criminal record will point to Bhutto 's similar criminal convictions .
Sharif was convicted of hijacking and terrorism and sentenced to life in prison in 2000 for trying to turn away an aircraft carrying Musharraf , the then military chief whom Sharif had just dismissed , back from an overseas visit in October 1999 .
The incident precipitated Musharraf 's coup against Sharif .
In July 2000 , he was convicted on a corruption charge .
He was sent into exile in Saudi Arabia later that year on condition , the government says , that he stay out of politics for 10 years .
Election officials citing financial irregularities last week barred Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , from running ."
2007-12-04,"The Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif was barred yesterday from contesting the forthcoming election , sparking fresh allegations that President Pervez Musharraf intends to rig the poll .
Barely a week after Sharif 's dramatic return from exile , officials in Lahore declared the former prime minister ineligible to stand for election , due to criminal charges going back to the 1999 coup which brought Musharraf to power .
Sharif dismissed the charges as politically motivated and vowed to battle on . ""
By God , Nawaz Sharif is fighting for his people and his Pakistan , "" he told cheering supporters in Islamabad .
"" I do not need any office .
I need only happiness on these faces that are standing here today .
"" The disqualification was a new twist in Pakistan 's political standoff as the country hurtles towards turbulent polls on January 8 stewarded by Sharif 's arch - rival , Musharraf .
Last night Sharif met the other opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto , to try to convince her to join a proposed poll boycott .
Afterwards the two leaders said elections under present conditions would not be free and fair .
But they stopped short of calling a boycott , announcing instead they would draw up a list of demands for the government - a clear softening of Sharif 's previously tough stance .
"" We intend to set benchmarks and throw the ball into the government 's court , "" said Bhutto .
Yesterday 's ban was not unexpected .
Although Musharraf allowed Bhutto to return in October by passing a controversial "" reconciliation "" law , he only reluctantly permitted Sharif back last week .
The rancour between the two men is so great that few believe they could ever sit in parliament together .
Sharif 's younger brother , Shahbaz , has also been disqualified from the vote .
The Sharif brothers can appeal to a panel of high court judges , but their chances of success are considered slim .
The boycott debate exposes rifts within the political opposition and wider Pakistani society about how best to resist the draconian emergency laws that Musharraf imposed on November 3 .
"" There are two views in Pakistan now .
One is that you can change the system by being part of it .
The other is boycott , "" said one analyst , Rasul Bakhsh Rais .
Although Sharif favours a boycott "" in principle "" , Bhutto and others say it would be a mistake to leave the political space open to Musharraf 's supporters .
They are joined by the US , which has a powerful sway over events in Pakistan .
Sharif 's party is also divided . ""
A boycott only makes sense if the opposition is united , and if it is part of a wider street agitation .
Without that it means nothing , "" said Ayaz Amir , a press columnist who hopes to campaign under Sharif 's banner in Chakwal , 60 miles south of Islamabad .
Critics say a free and fair poll in January is virtually impossible .
Although 5,000 political prisoners have been freed , senior judges and lawyers remain in detention .
Yesterday police prevented the US ambassador , Anne Patterson , from visiting a lawyers ' leader , Aitzaz Ahsan , who is under house arrest in Lahore .
Sharif has called for the reinstatement of senior judges , especially the deposed chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
But Musharraf has vowed he will never reinstate Chaudhry , and warned that the January poll will take place "" come hell or high water "" .
Bhutto , meanwhile , had some good news from Spain yesterday , where prosecutors said they were shelving a two - year investigation into money - laundering allegations against the opposition leader .
Bhutto , her husband Asif Zardari , and party officials were accused of transferring funds from a company that profited from the controversial Iraqi "" oil for food "" scheme into a bank in the eastern Spanish town of Onteniente .
But prosecutors said they hit a dead end when the Pakistani government withdrew its cooperation after Musharraf 's "" reconciliation "" with Bhutto earlier this year ."
2007-12-04,"Pakistan 's two main opposition parties today began to draw up a list of demands that President Pervez Musharraf must meet to ensure free and fair elections .
The former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif , who met yesterday in Islamabad , have threatened to boycott the January 8 vote unless their demands are met .
A full opposition boycott would rob the vote of credibility and deepen the isolation of Musharraf as he struggles with popular discontent and the rising threat from militants on the border with Afghanistan .
Bhutto has said her party would reluctantly take part in the vote , while reserving the right to withdraw or to protest against an unfair result .
Sharif , who is barred from standing because of past convictions for corruption , has called for a boycott unless Musharraf reinstates the supreme court and other judges dismissed when he declared emergency rule last month .
Sharif and some smaller parties want the judges reinstated , while Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party says the matter should be left to a new parliament .
Musharraf has ruled out the return of the judges , some of whom remain under house arrest .
"" We are already running short of time .
We will try our best to finalise the demands , at the latest by tomorrow , "" said Ahsan Iqbal , a spokesman for Sharif 's party .
Sharif and Bhutto , who are old rivals , have both recently been allowed back into the country after years in exile .
Musharraf , bowing to international and domestic pressure , stepped down as head of the army last week and was sworn in as a civilian president .
He has promised that emergency rule will be lifted on December 16 , fulfilling two main demands of his rivals and of his western backers , including the US .
But the opposition says Musharraf must do more and has yet to announce their demands or the government 's deadline for meeting them .
One opposition worry is the neutrality of a caretaker government installed last month by Musharraf to oversee the election .
The caretaker prime minister , Mohammadmian Soomro , and many members of his cabinet belong to the Pakistan Muslim League ( Quaid - e - Azam ) , a grouping that was cobbled together from the remnants of Sharif 's party as a political powerbase for Musharraf after his 1999 coup .
Bhutto said one of her main demands was an independent election commission to prevent vote rigging .
However , the main sticking point between Bhutto and Sharif is the judges dismissed by Musharraf .
Analysts expect the two main opposition parties to take part in the poll after extracting maximum concessions ."
2007-12-06,"Pakistan 's opposition parties today were close to agreement on a set of conditions for their participation in elections scheduled for January .
Benazir Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party and Nawaz Sharif 's Muslim League - N have both threatened to boycott the parliamentary vote set for January 8 unless the president , Pervez Musharraf , meets their demands .
They are expected to demand restoration of an independent judiciary and the constitution , and the creation of a neutral caretaker government and independent election commission .
The opposition is also expected to set a deadline for the government to meet its demands .
"" We 're optimistic that we 'll reach agreement because everyone wants to pull the country out of this crisis and prevent Musharraf from rigging the elections , "" said Ahsan Iqbal , spokesman for Sharif .
"" Despite our differences in the past , we are legitimate democratic parties while Musharraf is an illegitimate military dictator . ""
A boycott would be a severe blow to Musharraf who claims that he imposed emergency rule on November 3 to ensure a smooth transition to democracy .
As the opposition prepared to issue its set of demands on the January election , police blocked Sharif from leading a march to the home of Pakistan 's sacked chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
Officers also stepped up security around Chaudhry 's official residence .
The judge has been under house arrest ever since Musharraf declared a state of emergency and sacked most of the supreme court .
Musharraf declared the emergency just before the supreme court was about to rule on the validity of the president 's re - election in October .
Since then , Musharraf has stacked the court with loyalists , who have promptly dismissed all complaints against the former general 's election .
Dozens of Sharif supporters chanted anti - Musharraf slogans and tore down and stamped on a poster of the president .
Scores of lawyers opposed to the government had earlier tried to approach Chaudhry 's home .
But they were outnumbered by a massive police presence , and their path was blocked by a barricade of concrete blocks , heavy sheets of steel and barbed wire .
Hundreds of lawyers clashed with police in the south - eastern city of Multan .
"" The act of dismissing 50 judges in one go was the biggest blow the judiciary has ever known in Pakistan , "" the former chief justice Sajjad Ali Shah wrote in yesterday 's Dawn newspaper . ""
Now the president has nothing to fear from the judiciary . ""
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have demanded the immediate release of the detained judges in Islamabad and Lahore .
They say Chaudhry is held incommunicado with his teenage daughter and seven - year - old son .
Human Rights Watch says Chaudhry has managed to communicate with the outside world intermittently by mobile telephones smuggled into his home , but the government has repeatedly used signal jamming equipment and other means to disable them .
The group also says Chaudhry has not had access to television or newspapers since November 3 ."
2007-12-10,"The former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif today began campaigning for his Muslim League - N party before the expected January general election , despite being barred from standing .
Election authorities rejected Sharif 's candidacy because of criminal convictions , although Sharif claims the decision was politically motivated .
His party was part of a coalition threatening to boycott the election in protest at President Pervez Musharraf 's authoritarian rule .
Musharraf was criticised at home and internationally after he imposed emergency rule last month and dismissed judges unsupportive of his regime .
Musharraf said yesterday that he would lift the state of emergency on Saturday , a day earlier than expected .
Sharif announced yesterday that his party would contest the election after failing to secure unanimous support for a boycott .
Another former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , said on Thursday that her Pakistan People 's party would participate because she did not want to leave the field open to Musharraf 's allies .
A senior official within the All Parties Democratic Movement said Sharif 's party no longer belonged to the coalition because of its decision .
Other members would continue to refuse to participate .
"" Our struggle will continue until the government reverses all the decisions taken by it after declaring the state of emergency , "" said Qazi Hussain Ahmad .
"" We will not contest the elections until the acceptance of our demands . ""
Opposition parties have had to balance concerns about giving legitimacy to President Musharraf against the risk of being politically isolated if they do not stand .
Bhutto and Sharif have strong support within Pakistan and their parties would be expected to present a stiff challenge to the ruling Muslim League - Q party .
Bhutto has said the opposition has the option to pull out of the election race later , or launch protests if they are unhappy with the results .
The military said a suicide car bomber had attacked a bus on an army base in the town of Kamra , 30 miles north - west of Islamabad , injuring at least five children on their way to school ."
2007-12-23,"Pakistan 's escalating political crisis was one that oscillated between tragedy and farce .
It was a year of negotiations , deals and double crosses that centred on three figures : President Musharraf , and his two exiled foes , Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto .
In their midst , Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry 's court would form the nexus for a series of confrontations that would lead to the emergency over the legitimacy of Musharraf 's rule : the encroaching powers of the army and ' agencies ' under Musharraf , the confrontation with a growing Islamic militant threat , and old political rivalries .
Those tensions would come to a head over Musharraf 's promise to take off his uniform before being re - elected president , in the aftermath of the siege of the Red Mosque in Islamabad between militant students and the security forces .
So the court handed back the mosque to its students in July and cleared the way for the return of Sharif from Saudi Arabia .
On his arrival in September , Sharif was arrested and deported .
Next in town was Benazir Bhutto , greeted by suicide bombers who attacked her vehicle , killing 136 .
But the most serious crisis would be brought about by Musharraf 's decision to press ahead with being re - elected .
Fearing the Supreme Court would block his eligibility , he declared a state of emergency .
Bhutto was put under house arrest , while hundreds of lawyers were rounded up , casting a shadow over the prospect of free and fair elections for January .
And by the year 's end it was all change in Musharraf 's wheeling and dealing , with Sharif - now allowed to return - his preferred partner , not Bhutto ."
2007-12-28,"The Bush administration was today hurriedly trying to find a Plan B for Pakistan after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
US officials based in Pakistan were sounding out senior members of her opposition Pakistan People 's party about a possible successor .
They were also in contact with members of the other main opposition party , the Pakistan Muslim League , led by Nawaz Sharif , even though the US had previously opposed his return to Pakistan because of links between his party and Islamist extremists .
President George Bush called for the election to go ahead , though he avoided mention of whether Pakistan should stick to the January 8 timetable .
An announcement on whether to delay the election has been left until the end of the three days of mourning .
Asked whether the US was confident that Pakistan could stage an election in January , state department spokesman Tom Casey said : "" Well , we 're going to see what happens . ""
The assassination of Bhutto has thrown into disarray Bush administration hopes for establishing a degree of security in Pakistan .
Since 9/11 , Bush has relied on the military - run government of Pervez Musharraf as an ally in the fight against the Taliban and al - Qaida .
With Musharraf 's loss of popularity , the White House placed its hopes on a return to democracy and the emergence of a Musharraf - Bhutto coalition .
US intelligence analysts today warned that al - Qaida , which has a hold in Pakistan 's tribal areas - where the US believe Osama bin Laden is hiding - and in cities such as Karachi would be strengthened by the chaos in the aftermath of the assassination .
John McLaughlin , former acting director of the CIA , predicted today that the chaos would last for weeks at least and that the capacity of Pakistan 's authorities to deal with al - Qaida during that time would be diminished .
The Bush administration is worried that Pakistan could fall into the hands of radicals , undermining its battle against the Taliban and al - Qaida in Afghanistan and raising the spectre of nuclear weapons in the hands of Islamists hostile to the west .
The present head of the CIA , Robert Gates , warned last week that al - Qaida was focusing its efforts on Pakistan .
The US helped engineer the return of Bhutto to the US in October after eight years of self - imposed exile .
It will be harder for US officials to persuade Musharraf , who has stood down as commander of the army to contest the election as a civilian , to enter into a coalition with Sharif , given the degree of enmity between them .
Bush yesterday called on Pakistan "" to honour Benazir Bhutto 's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life . ""
But he made no mention of January 8 .
Gordon Brown , who also spoke to Musharraf , echoed Bush 's comments , calling on him to "" stick to the course he has outlined to build democracy and stability in Pakistan "" .
He did not specifically say elections should be held on January 8 . ""
This was a cowardly terrorist act designed to destabilise democratic elections .
The international community is united in its outrage and determination that those who stoop to such tactics shall not prevail , "" he said .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , made a similar call for the election to go ahead .
Stephen Cohen , a specialist on India and Pakistan at the Brookings Institution , a non - profit policy studies thinktank , described Bhutto 's death as a "" blow to the idea of a liberal , moderate Pakistan "" that made him fear for that country . ""
Its further decay will affect all of its neighbours , Europe and the United States in unpredictable and unpleasant ways , "" he said .
"" It is probably too late for the United States to do much either : we placed all of our bets on Musharraf , ignoring Benazir 's pleas for some contact or recognition until a few months ago . """
2007-12-31,"Nawaz Sharif today reacted angrily to news that the country 's elections , scheduled to take place next week , would almost certainly be delayed following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto .
Sharif , a former prime minister , told a news conference he believed the election should go ahead on January 8 despite Bhutto 's death on Thursday .
Earlier , the country 's election committee said it had advised the government to delay the elections for an unspecified length of time .
The government is expected to agree to the committee 's suggestion when it makes a formal announcement tomorrow .
A government source said it expected the delay to be around six weeks .
In the four days since Bhutto 's death , the commission has taken soundings from Pakistan 's regional governments on their readiness for polling .
The survey found that 11 election offices had been burnt down in rioting , ballot boxes destroyed and the printing and distribution of ballot papers disrupted .
Sharif said the Pakistani president , Pervez Musharraf , should resign and be replaced by a national unity government . ""
He is a one man calamity .
He is responsible for all the trouble in Pakistan , "" he said .
"" The country is burning . ""
The United States should see that Musharraf has not limited or curbed terrorism .
In fact , terrorism is now stronger than ever before with more sinister aspects . ""
No one among us wants elections to go beyond January 8 . ""
Sharif said in Lahore .
Although supporters of Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's party regard elements of Musharraf 's government as being implicated in the plot to kill their leader , they have left open the possibility of working with the former general if he triumphs in the election .
Both the PPP and Sharif 's party , a faction of the Pakistan Muslim League , had only recently decided to take part in the elections .
Yesterday , the Bhutto camp rushed to enact her political will that a combined team of her husband and son replace her in order to contest January 's poll .
Sharif , urged by the PPP , backtracked from his original decision to boycott the poll , yesterday declared he was ready to take part .
In a telephone call to Musharraf last night , Gordon Brown is understood to have told the president that he has the UK 's support to delay the elections for a short period .
Foreign election monitors warned that a full observation mission would be impossible if the polls went ahead next week because the unrest had caused them to delay preparations .
"" We can not follow our standard methods if the date stays [ as ] January 8 , "" Mathias Eick , a spokesman for the EU - led mission , said .
He added that the best it could manage was a limited assessment .
Controversy continues to surround the cause of Bhutto 's death .
Footage of the last moments before her assassination , which appears to discredit the Pakistani government 's account of her death , has emerged .
The footage , obtained by Channel 4 , shows a man firing a handgun at the politician from close range as she stood up in her open - topped vehicle .
Her hair and shawl moved upwards , suggesting she may have been shot , and she fell into the vehicle just before an explosion took place .
The government insisted Bhutto was not hit by any of the bullets and died after the force of the blast slammed her head against the sunroof .
Her family and supporters say she was killed by gunshot wounds to her head and neck .
After days of rioting in which at least 44 people died , life in many Pakistani cities began returning to normal , although soldiers and police patrolled several areas .
The streets in the southern city of Karachi , the scene of some of the worst violence , were quiet , witnesses said .
The political uncertainty caused the stock markets to tumble on the first day of trading since the killing , with the benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share index falling by 4.7 % ."
2007-12-31,"Benazir Bhutto 's assassination simultaneously shows up the strength of Pakistan 's anti - democratic forces , including the military , extremists , and clergy , and also their determination to ensure that democracy does not take off in their country .
That determination is somewhat mystifying .
For the disunity among Pakistan 's political parties , and the mutual dislike between Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif , her main political rival , made it unlikely that either would have won a majority in any election or been able to summon up the goodwill and good sense to unite against Pakistan 's military governors , who would have remained its real rulers , no matter what political constellation might have emerged after the polls .
Any post - electoral democracy would have been fragile and brittle .
The generals would have gloated and told the world - especially the US - to stop badgering them about democratisation .
They would have reminded everyone about the incompetence of Pakistan 's politicians and reassured the Americans and their countrymen that only the military could save and defend Pakistan from Islamic militants .
President Bush would happily have affirmed that the US could n't force democracy on Pakistan and thanked Pakistan 's generals for their help against evil terrorists .
But the deed was done .
Which anti - democratic forces were behind Bhutto 's assassination ?
Contributors to Cif , including Jason Burke , Simon Tisdall and MAU , have wrestled with this question .
Only those who instigated or committed the crime - and God - know the answer .
One thing is certain : the two main anti - democratic forces in Pakistan are its ruling military - intelligence combine ( MIC ) and terrorists .
The government has blamed al - Qaida for Bhutto 's death .
But al - Qaida and its associates enjoy the hospitality of Islamabad .
More generally , the MIC had reared and sustained extremists against Pakistan 's archenemy , India , long before 9/11 placed terrorism on the global agenda .
Since 2001 the MIC has trained the extremists who threaten to derail Nato 's anti - terrorist campaign in Afghanistan .
Even the ignorant Bush government , which thought that Pakistan could become democratic by the mere act of Musharraf replacing his uniform with civvies , has been told of the links between the MIC and extremism .
Pakistan 's history reveals that these links can be explained by the fact that its religious definition has induced all its rulers , since its birth in August 1947 , to turn to the clergy for legitimacy .
Inept politicians , unable to cement a fragmented popular base , and illegitimate military rulers , have all sought , and obtained , "" divine "" approval through extremist mullahs .
The embrace between state and Islamic clerics has been strong and constant .
Bhutto herself succumbed to that embrace as prime minister in the 1990s , if only to steal the thunder of her political and military rivals and to establish her credentials as the "" best "" Muslim .
Indeed the Taliban , created by General Muhammad Zia - ul - Haq , was sustained by her government .
And military rulers have always found alliances with religious extremists indispensable to shoring up their political standing and power .
Attempts on Musharraf 's life in 2003 and 2007 raised the question of whether the military had lost control over extremists .
Those attempts reinforced Washington 's belief that Musharraf was a reliable anti - terrorist warrior .
But there was never any evidence that he and his colleagues in the MIC had given up extremist training as a method of political and strategic choice .
So if lax security enabled the suicide bomber to kill Bhutto , was this laxness unintentional or deliberate ?
Again , no one knows .
This is because the secret play between the MIC , clerics and terrorists has been performed under an impenetrable purdah of guns .
Perhaps a momentary digression to Afghanistan could throw some light on the question , as Taliban thuggery has increased over the last two years .
Would the Taliban have been able to carry out their cruel acts without training and sustenance from the Pakistani side ?
No .
Never .
In fact , UN , Nato and even American officials see Pakistan 's hand behind the rising Taliban violence in Afghanistan .
Bhutto 's grieving party men have pointed a finger at Musharraf .
But one incontrovertible fact remains .
Whether as a military supremo or a leader apparently steering his country towards democracy at America 's behest , Musharraf can only act in concert with his associates in the intelligence and military .
Dictatorship in Pakistan has never been , and can never be , a one - man show .
So blame the military and intelligence , if you like , for Bhutto 's assassination .
Blame the suicide bomber , who may have spun out of the MIC 's control - or acted under their instructions and with their connivance .
Whatever - or whoever - inspired Bhutto 's suicide killer , the chances are that his disgusting mission was facilitated by the culture of violence created by Pakistan 's military and intelligence services , governing with the benefit of clergy ."
2008-01-01,"Prospects of democracy in Pakistan were rising when Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif returned to the country and decided to contest elections .
Movement for the rule of law spearheaded by lawyers and civil society actors in response to the unlawful deposition of the chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , since March 2007 was also a healthy development for the country .
However , Musharraf started backtracking on the understanding he had developed with Benazir as his political allies were getting uncomfortable with the reception she was getting across the country .
And then came the assassin 's bullet - in a professionally executed , targeted killing - raising important questions about the role of elements from within the establishment .
In an email to me last October , Benazir , while analysing threats to her life , maintained that the real "" threat [ is ] not from US perceived angle but estab[lishment ] elements "" .
The resultant chaos has shaken the state 's foundations and federation .
The PPP has a huge task ahead under the new leadership of Benazir 's 19-year - old son Bilawal and his father Asif Zardari - a combination of youth and experience guided by the Bhutto legacy .
It is quite likely the PPP will sweep the coming elections , benefiting from an additional sympathy vote across the country .
Such an eventuality would give Pakistan another chance to be rescued .
Musharraf , on the other hand , is becoming irrelevant , and there is a growing possibility the military leadership will distance itself from him to return to its professional job and regain people 's confidence .
Such a scenario requires sagacity on the part of the political and military leadership .
The past provides little comfort in this regard , but one hopes that Benazir 's sacrifice will pay off , ushering Pakistan towards a progressive democratic order ."
2008-02-15,"The main contest in the Pakistani general election on February 18 is seemingly between the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) , led by late Benazir Bhutto 's husband , Asif Zardari ; the pro - Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League - Q ( "" Q "" for "" Qaid - e Azam "" , the honorific for the state 's founder , Muhammad Ali Jinnah ) ; and the opposition Pakistan Muslim League - N ( "" N "" for Nawaz Sharif , former prime minister ) .
But no matter which party wins most seats and governs alone or in coalition , and which becomes the opposition , the privileges of feudal lords dominating the overwhelmingly rural society will remain intact .
The roots of feudal dominance lie in history .
The Pakistan Muslim League , the parent of its present two versions , is the descendant of the All India Muslim League ( AIML ) .
Formed in 1906 to promote loyalty to the British Crown while advancing Muslim interests , the AIML was led by Muslim grandees and feudal lords .
It was not until 1940 that it demanded partition of the Indian sub - continent , with Muslim majority areas constituting independent states .
Unlike the anti - imperialist Indian National Congress , it lacked an economic programme favouring small and landless peasants , and trade unions for industrial workers .
Given the traditional peasants ' servitude to landowners , and almost universal illiteracy in rural Pakistan , where most people lived , electoral politics became the privilege of large landlords , who controlled vote banks .
During elections their choice of a party depended on self - interest : which one will supply or raise government - subsidised irrigation water and/or fertiliser ; or build roads to the villages they owned .
This continues .
A recent report in the Observer from Old Jatoi ( population , 3,000 ) in Sindh is illustrative .
While the peasants working for the local grandee , Mustafa Jatoi , live in shacks , his spacious house is surrounded by green lawns and high white walls , with its driveway chocked with Toyota SUVs and Suzuki Mehrans , now deployed to transport him to drummed - up rallies .
His electoral rival , Arif Jatoi , too has similar assets .
But he takes time off to fly to Islamabad to seek extra development funds for his area from the prime minister , allied with the pro - Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League - Q.
In the more populous Punjab province , the Lahore - based Chaudhry Pervez Elahi , a PML - Q candidate , charters a helicopter to campaign in his rural constituency , promising to bring a gas pipeline to the villages .
The family 's fortunes have come from textile factories .
Likewise , Nawaz Sharif and his brother , the leaders of the opposition PML - N , have amassed millions from their industrial assets .
It would be naïve to expect such super - affluent Pakistanis to advance the interests of landless peasants or poorly paid factory workers .
The near - monopoly of power by the Pakistan Muslim League was broken in 1967 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , father of Benazir , established the Pakistan People 's Party .
He coined a catchy , all - embracing slogan : "" Islam is our faith , democracy our polity , socialism our economy ; and all power to the people . ""
It won him the sobriquet of "" a socialist demagogue "" .
While advocating socialist economy , he never uttered the term "" land reform "" .
He could not .
He possessed 12,000 acres of rice - growing land .
He behaved as haughtily as any other feudal lord .
So too did his daughter , Benazir .
The corruption and the affluence of her and her polo - playing husband , Asif Zardari , are widely known .
Just as with the Jatois elsewhere in Sindh , any electoral rivalry is between competing estate owners .
In the Bhutto - Zardari case , it is Benazir 's cousin , Mumtaz .
Owner of 15,000 acres of arable land worth £ 12 million , he earns an annual tax - free income of £ 345,000 in a country with per capita income of £ 350 a year .
In a recent interview , Mr. Bhutto waxed eloquent about his last summer holiday at Hotel Splendido in Portofino on Italy 's Amalfi coast while his peasants suffered the humid heat needed for rice to grow .
It was a break from his normal summer forays to apartments in London 's posh Mayfair or Knightsbridge .
The glaring scandal of the present election campaign is the total absence of the long - overdue debate about land reform , where the state takes over the land above the legal ceiling and distributes it among landless peasants ."
2008-02-16,"Who is taking part ?
Pervez Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League Quaid - e - Azam ( PML - Q ) can count on the support of the Karachi - based Mutahidda Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) .
He will need it in the face of opposition from Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister he ousted from power in 1999 .
Sharif 's PML - N has allied itself to the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) –
the party of the late Benazir Bhutto - but the two do not form a homogenous block .
While the PPP believes Musharraf has lost control of the country 's Islamist extremists , it differs from Sharif in saying it would consider cooperation with Musharraf if the elections were fair .
The Awami National Party , a Pashtun nationalist organisation from the North - West Frontier province , is also standing , as is the JUI - F party of the Islamist cleric Maulana Fazlur Rahman .
Other parties have decided to boycott the elections .
How does it work ?
On Monday morning , 64,000 polling stations will open in the country 's 272 constituencies .
Polling stations are thought likely to shut at 5 pm local time , and counts will be completed some two or three hours later .
However , at the moment it appears that these early and unofficial results wo n't be published as they have in previous years .
Instead , Musharraf has alarmed many by making the announcement of unofficial local results illegal .
Only an aggregated result will be announced by the central electoral commission .
Critics say this creates a "" black hole "" in which rigging can occur .
Although the US administration has called on Musharraf to reconsider , it appears likely that he will stick with his new system .
Expect opposition parties to try to flout the rules .
Is there any cause for optimism ?
This year , Musharraf purged the supreme court , imposed a state of emergency and arrested thousands of his opponents .
Many are expecting him to rig the elections .
However , after Bhutto 's assassination international scrutiny of events in Pakistan has increased , and some think that Musharraf 's PML - Q will have no choice but to play fair .
There are reasons to be optimistic about the delayed elections .
Firstly , the army 's grip on Pakistani politics has been weakened somewhat by the army chief general , Kayani , who has ordered his soldiers to keep well away from politics .
For a country run by direct military rule for 33 of its 61-year history and whose president came to power in a military coup nine years ago , this is significant .
Secondly , Bhutto 's assassination could increase voter turnout .
Normally only 30 to 40 % of Pakistanis actually exercise their right to vote , but the murder of the opposition leader looks as though it may bring more people to the polls .
Apart from making any resulting Pakistani government more representative of its people , it may also help a single party get a clear majority .
So will the elections be fair ?
"" On a scale from terrible to great , it 'll be somewhere in the middle "" is what Richard Boucher , the US assistant secretary of state for South Asia , said when asked about the possibility of fraud .
Conditions for campaigning have been dire .
Security fears have seen many politicians shy away from public appearances –
Bhutto 's husband addresses rallies from behind a bulletproof guard .
On the day Bhutto was assassinated at an election rally in Rawalpindi , she was due to announce new evidence of alleged election rigging .
The allegation came on top of reports that intelligence officials had pressurised PML - Q opponents in Punjab and Sindh to drop out of contention or change their political colours .
Evidence of intimidation has not abated since the assassination .
Election gatherings have been fired on in recent weeks , and the death of two Pashtuns was thought to be an attempt to stoke up tension between Pashtun speakers and Urdu speakers for political gain .
Opposition parties also say the apparatus of the state is against them .
The interim government that has run Pakistan for the last few months was full of Musharraf 's PML - Q allies .
With the electoral commission similarly aligned to the PML - Q , opposition parties say prospects for a proper regulation of the poll are small .
The PPP says it has filed 1,200 complaints to the election commission , but has received no response .
Election billboards , much larger than regulations stipulate , have been allowed to remain on display .
The party also alleges that membership of the electoral commission and Musharraf 's party is something of a revolving door .
The PPP senator Enver Beg has said he thinks more than 100 parliamentary candidates campaigning in the PML - Q are close relatives of the people who are running the elections .
Finally , some international observers have decided that security concerns are too great to risk monitoring the polls .
The Commonwealth has simply been refused entry by Pakistan .
What is expected ?
The assassination of Bhutto – a twice - elected former prime minister - will see her party garner sympathy votes .
Similarly , Sharif 's PML - Q party – a one - time rival but latterly ally of Bhutto 's - is expected to do well .
Foreign polls have also revealed a sharp fall in support for Musharraf , who used to be able to count of a core of backing from people who thought he was the only man who could keep a fissiparous country together .
If the results are radically , different there will be uproar .
The story of the last election was that of a coalition of Islamist parties sweeping to power , riding the wave of anti - US sentiment after the bombing of Afghanistan .
In these elections , the Islamist coalition is not in the picture , except for the party of Maulana Fazlur Rahman ( the JUI - F ) .
The west will breathe a sigh of relief that whatever the pitfalls of this election are , it is unlikely to result in a ballot box victory for political Islam .
The likelihood of any kind of government being formed in the next week is unlikely .
After the last elections in 2002 , it was months before a government was formed ."

Bhutto 's husband addresses rallies from behind a bulletproof guard .
On the day Bhutto was assassinated at an election rally in Rawalpindi , she was due to announce new evidence of alleged election rigging .
The allegation came on top of reports that intelligence officials had pressurised PML - Q opponents in Punjab and Sindh to drop out of contention or change their political colours .
Evidence of intimidation has not abated since the assassination .
Election gatherings have been fired on in recent weeks , and the death of two Pashtuns was thought to be an attempt to stoke up tension between Pashtun speakers and Urdu speakers for political gain .
Opposition parties also say the apparatus of the state is against them .
The interim government that has run Pakistan for the last few months was full of Musharraf 's PML - Q allies .
With the electoral commission similarly aligned to the PML - Q , opposition parties say prospects for a proper regulation of the poll are small .
The PPP says it has filed 1,200 complaints to the election commission , but has received no response .
Election billboards , much larger than regulations stipulate , have been allowed to remain on display .
The party also alleges that membership of the electoral commission and Musharraf 's party is something of a revolving door .
The PPP senator Enver Beg has said he thinks more than 100 parliamentary candidates campaigning in the PML - Q are close relatives of the people who are running the elections .
Finally , some international observers have decided that security concerns are too great to risk monitoring the polls .
The Commonwealth has simply been refused entry by Pakistan .
What is expected ?
The assassination of Bhutto – a twice - elected former prime minister - will see her party garner sympathy votes .
Similarly , Sharif 's PML - N party – a one - time rival but latterly ally of Bhutto 's - is expected to do well .
Foreign polls have also revealed a sharp fall in support for Musharraf , who used to be able to count of a core of backing from people who thought he was the only man who could keep a fissiparous country together .
If the results are radically , different there will be uproar .
The story of the last election was that of a coalition of Islamist parties sweeping to power , riding the wave of anti - US sentiment after the bombing of Afghanistan .
In these elections , the Islamist coalition is not in the picture , except for the party of Maulana Fazlur Rahman ( the JUI - F ) .
The west will breathe a sigh of relief that whatever the pitfalls of this election are , it is unlikely to result in a ballot box victory for political Islam .
The likelihood of any kind of government being formed in the next week is unlikely .
After the last elections in 2002 , it was months before a government was formed ."
2008-02-19,"The Pakistan People 's party will seek a national government that includes supporters of Nawaz Sharif , the husband of assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said today .
But Asif Zardari said the PPP was not interested in entering a coalition with President Pervez Musharraf 's allies , who lost heavily in yesterday 's parliamentary elections .
As Zardari held out the prospect of an alliance between the PPP and Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N party – the two big winners from the election - Sharif stuck to his uncompromising line on Musharraf .
Sharif , who was overthrown by Musharraf in 1999 , said it was time for the president to quit after his ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in Pakistan 's parliamentary elections .
The former prime minister told reporters that Musharraf had said he would quit when people told him to . ""
And now the people have given their verdict , "" Sharif told reporters .
Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League - Q party ( PML - Q ) conceded defeat after a paltry showing and said it was prepared to work in opposition .
Party chairman , Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain , told AP television news that "" we accept the results with an open heart "" and "" will sit on opposition benches "" in the new parliament .
The big winners were the Pakistan People 's party of the assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , and Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N.
But neither party won an outright majority and are expected to enter power - sharing talks .
Sharif 's party performed better than most polls had predicted , sweeping the board in the populous Punjab province , which elects about half of the parliament .
Nearly every major Musharraf lieutenant lost his seat and there were setbacks for the religious parties that have ruled the troubled North West Frontier province since 2002 .
"" All the kings men , gone ! "" read a headline in the Daily Times .
The losers included Chaudhry Shujat Hussain , the president of Musharraf 's party , the former foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri , and Sheikh Rashid , a close Musharraf confidante .
Pervez Elahi , a Musharraf stalwart with ambitions to become prime minister , won one of the three seats he was contesting under Pakistan 's unusual electoral system .
The result was a stinging rebuke for Musharraf , whose popularity has plunged since he initiated a confrontation with the country 's judiciary and lawyers last March , followed by emergency rule late last year .
The spokesman for Sharif 's party , Saqiq ul - Farooq , told reporters that Musharraf "" should go "" .
But he said that if the restored justices validated the election of Musharraf to a new term last October , the opposition would accept the decision .
"" We want to put Pakistan back on the track of democracy , constitution and rule of law , and the restoration of sacked judges is a must to achieve this goal , "" he said .
The question is whether , faced with overwhelming opposition , Musharraf , a former army commando , can bend to the new political reality and retain his position at the head of state .
Until now he has fought doggedly to maintain power , imposing a six - week emergency rule last November , jailing critical lawyers and judges , and imposing strict media controls .
With about 30 of the 272 seats undeclared , Musharraf 's last hope is to prevent the opposition from gaining the two - thirds majority that would leave him vulnerable to impeachment in the new parliament .
"" It 's the moment of truth for the president , "" Abbas Nasir , the editor of the Dawn newspaper told Reuters .
"" There will be thoughts swirling in his mind , whether he can forge a working relationship with two parties whose leadership he kept out of the country . ""
Support from the US , Musharraf 's most steadfast international ally , appears to be .
Senior American military and intelligence officials have travelled to Islamabad in the past few months for talks with General Ashfaq Kayani , Musharraf 's successor as head of the army .
A team of US senators that observed the vote described it as credible and legitimate , with the moderate majority expressing a desire for change . ""
The will of the moderate majority , and the vast majority of the Pakistani people , who are moderate and democratic , is becoming a reality , "" said Joseph Biden , the head of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee .
On the eve of the polls , senator Joseph Biden , the head of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee who was observing voting in Lahore , warned that any evidence of large - scale rigging could trigger a cut in US assistance to Pakistan , which has amounted to over $ 10bn ( £ 5bn ) since 2001 .
Many predicted the PML - Q , a mish - mash of political opportunists that has given Musharraf valuable political cover over the past five years , would not survive the rout .
"" I do n't think it 's going to hold together .
Nobody will want to stay with a party that has received such a big blow , "" said Hina Rabbani Khar , a former PML - Q minister who defected to Bhutto 's party on the eve of the election .
Fears of widespread vote - rigging did not materialise although there were significant irregularities in many places across the country .
Any manipulation was not enough to halt the opposition landslide .
The PPP won at least 80 seats , more than any other party but less than polls predicted .
In contrast , Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N picked up at least 64 seats thanks to his bald threats to unseat Musharraf .
Sharif was not elected , however , having been barred from standing by criminal charges dating back to the coup that brought Musharraf to power in 1999 .
Asif Zardari , the husband of Bhutto , travelled to Islamabad today , where the two leaders are expected to hold power - sharing talks ."
2008-02-20,"The political endgame loomed for President Pervez Musharraf last night as his party was evicted from power and his arch rival , Nawaz Sharif , arrived in Islamabad to negotiate a place in the new government .
Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League ( Q ) , was swept aside in a tide of anti - Musharraf sentiment .
With 96 % of votes counted after Monday 's election , the party had won just 39 of 268 contested seats , down from 118 .
The rout claimed a number of powerful political scalps , including Musharraf confidante Sheikh Rashid Ahmed , rumoured to have left the country within hours of defeat , and the party 's backroom powerbroker Chaudhry Shujat Hussain .
Hussain said the party had resigned itself to opposition , leaving an isolated Musharraf exposed to a hostile parliament that may try to oust him from office . ""
All the King 's men , gone ! "" proclaimed the headline in the Daily Times as jubilant voters danced in the streets , sang and fired celebratory bursts of gunfire into the air . ""
It turned out to be a referendum on Musharraf , "" said analyst Irfan Husain .
"" I do n't give him more than a few months , unless there is pressure from the US . ""
The main winner was the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) of murdered opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , which polled the most seats .
But the surprise performance came from Sharif , a former prime minister , whose party finished a close second .
Neither party has an outright majority .
Bhutto 's husband , Asif Zardari , and Sharif arrived in Islamabad for power - sharing talks last night .
The horse - trading was widely welcomed as dire predictions of vote rigging and violence failed to materialise .
Although there were localised complaints of irregularities they were not enough to halt the opposition surge .
Sharif , ousted by Musharraf in a 1999 coup , ran a campaign dominated by one unflinching demand : the removal of "" dictator "" Musharraf .
Now he has his chance .
Ecstatic loyalists chanted "" The lion is coming again ! ""
outside Sharif 's Lahore home , where the bullish opposition leader recalled an old Musharraf promise .
"" He would say ' when people want , I will go ' .
Now the people have given their verdict , "" he said , vowing to work out a plan to "" say goodbye to dictatorship forever "" .
In a striking sign of the retired general 's faltering authority , lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan , who has been under house arrest for over three months , welcomed the media to his home .
Ahsan said his phone was re - connected as the results streamed in on Monday .
Yesterday , jail officials assigned to guard him failed to show up for work .
The return of Ahsan , Pakistan 's most prominent lawyer , heralds another headache for Musharraf .
Ahsan vowed to renew the campaign for the release of former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , who has been under house arrest with his wife and children since November 3 .
Musharraf called the judge "" the scum of the earth "" in an interview last week .
Ahsan attacked the US and Britain for supporting Musharraf . ""
He is the most despised person in the country .
Why should the Americans and Brits continue to put pennies in his cap ?
I do n't understand . ""
Musharraf 's foreign friends are also piling on the pressure .
Senator Joe Biden , a powerful Washington politician , travelled to Pakistan to monitor the vote .
Before the poll he warned that the US could slash aid - $ 10bn ( £ 5 m ) in mostly military aid since 2002 - if the elections were rigged .
Yesterday he said the election was "" an opportunity to move from a policy focused on a personality to one based on an entire people "" .
The US seems to be priming itself for a post - Musharraf scenario .
Over the past month his successor as army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , has been visited by top US military and intelligence officials .
Kayani was perceived as a close Musharraf ally when he was appointed last November but as Musharraf 's popularity fell , Kayani pulled the army back from public glare , ordering soldiers to steer clear of politicians and withdrawing senior officers from sinecures in civilian institutions .
The election 's other major upset was the ignominious defeat of the religious parties that have ruled North West Frontier and Baluchistan provinces since 2002 .
In their place came secular Pashtun nationalists and the PPP - a welcome development for western countries hunting Taliban and al- Qaida militants in the area .
Many Pakistanis rejected Musharraf 's party for practical reasons , particularly food prices and electricity shortages that have afflicted the poor .
Whatever the final outcome , Zardari and Sharif have not been elected due to outstanding criminal charges , so neither can be prime minister ."
2008-02-20,"For once , the voice of the people of Pakistan has been loud and clear .
Pakistan 's ruling party was routed in Monday 's election , and with it went the pretence that Pervez Musharraf has the support of his people .
All the rigging in the world could not have prevented the resurgence of the two main opposition parties , the Pakistan Peoples party ( PPP ) of the late Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N ) .
With about 20 of the 272 parliamentary seats undeclared , Mr Musharraf 's last hope was to prevent the two opposition parties from gaining a two - thirds majority , which would leave him vulnerable to impeachment .
But the writing was on the wall last night : parliamentary politics have returned with a vengeance , and for the first time in his career the president will have to deal with a parliament he can not easily buy off or control .
This alone is a significant step on the path to restoring democratic rule in Pakistan .
The choice for the PPP , which has won at least 80 seats , is stark .
There were signs last night that its caretaker leader - Bhutto 's widower , Asif Ali Zardari - appreciated the importance of the party 's next move .
It could listen to American entreaties and form a pact with Mr Musharraf 's discredited party , the PML - Q.
This would form a coalition government that would keep the president in power .
But such an arrangement would come at high political cost .
It could split the PPP - a party largely held together by the collective memory of its fallen leader - and its support would haemorrhage .
The alternative is to keep faith with the popular vote and form a government of national unity with Mr Sharif .
The once unpopular former prime minister has been boosted by this election .
He campaigned on the issue of restoring the justices removed from office when a state of emergency was declared on November 3 last year .
Mr Sharif wants the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry , currently under house arrest , to rule on the eligibility of Mr Musharraf 's re - election as president .
This would put the clock back to November 2 and undo not only the state of emergency but also Mr Musharraf 's later attempts to set some of its darker elements in stone .
Whatever the politicians do , lawyers will take to the streets in early March to make similar demands .
Last night Mr Zardari said he would try to form a coalition with Mr Sharif .
Mr Zardari said his party was not interested in any of those who were part of the last government .
A government of national unity would not last long , but it does not have to .
Its function would be limited to carrying out a number of specific tasks : to restore an independent supreme court and election commission , to remove restrictions on the media , to see off Mr Musharraf and to set a date for new elections .
There are doubts as to whether a coalition between two parties that detest each other would survive the ousting of their common foe .
Mr Sharif , who found shelter in Saudi Arabia in his period of exile , would soon turn to the Islamist parties to which the PPP are opposed .
Neither the PPP nor the PML - N would want to play second fiddle , and Mr Sharif is now a powerful man .
He controls not only the second - largest party in the national government but also the regional parliament of the Punjab .
Mr Sharif and Mr Musharraf have a long and bitter history of removing or attempting to remove each other from power .
If a government of national unity were formed it would only be a matter of time before Mr Musharraf would be ousted from office .
The US senators Joseph Biden and John Kerry declared the election credible , but even these foreign - policy liberals have difficulty accepting the loss of Mr Musharraf , such is the importance Washington ascribes to his cooperation in the war against al - Qaida .
Yet it is surely time for the US and Britain to plan for life after Pervez Musharraf , because that is the central message of this election ."
2008-02-20,"Election results are in from Pakistan .
The late Benazir Bhutto 's Pakistani People 's Party ( PPP ) and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz ( PML - N ) won roughly 40 % of the seats each .
President Musharraf 's Pakistan Muslim League Quaid ( PML - Q ) barely won 11 % .
US senators Joe Biden , Chuck Hagel and John Kerry all signed off on the authenticity of the elections , and a suddenly meek Musharraf conceded quickly .
A major story in the elections is the rise of the avowedly secular Awami National Party ( ANP ) in the heavily traditional and conservative North Western Frontier Province .
The NWFP , bordering Afghanistan , has long been a stronghold of the hard - line , pro - Taliban clerics , a sort of cudgel with which they beat the rest of the country .
In the 2002 elections , the Muttahida Majlis - e - Amal ( MMA ) - an umbrella of Islamist parties - essentially ran the table in NWFP .
The ANP did n't win even one seat .
The MMA then used that momentum to try and pass the Hisba Bill , a public morality law based on Saudi Arabia and Iran 's virtue police ( the supreme court struck it down on constitutional grounds ) .
This time , though , the MMA won only seven out of 96 seats .
The ANP won 31 , and the left - leaning PPP won 17 .
As a result of having the majority , the ANP is in a position to form the provincial government .
The story of the ANP 's resurgence , in the face of blatant intimidation by hard - line groups ( ANP leaders were bombed even on election day ) , is significant .
Tarek Fatah , formerly a left - activist in Pakistan , summarizes the ANP 's success succinctly : "" Leading up to the elections , the jihadi extremists targeted the ANP and assassinated a number of their candidates .
ANP activists - highly visible for wearing their red caps - became the Taliban 's primary targets .
There was a reason : The Islamists had managed to convince the Pashtun population that their historic national struggle was the same as the international jihad of Osama bin Laden .
The ANP , however , stood in opposition to this jihadi ideology .
Deeply religious and practising Muslims , ANP supporters have their roots in the kind of secularism where religion and state are kept apart and the use of Islam as a tool of politics is considered an insult to Islam itself .
"" A close look at the ANP 's platform confirms their political philosophy , which begins with a homage to the party 's founder , Bacha Khan , whom the British called Frontier Gandhi .
The manifesto highlights the ideas of separation of religion from state as well as the emancipation and empowerment of women .
The resurgence of the ANP is also a potent reminder to analysts who tend to characterise Pakistan as constantly on the brink of theocracy to not be so simple - minded .
In fact , to people ( including me ) who were paying attention , the ANP 's success is not altogether surprising .
The success of the ANP in the face of the Islamist programme is illustrative and instructive .
It shows that one way of defeating Islamism is to offer a potent and viable alternative narrative .
The ANP does that in the form of Pashtun nationalism .
The ANP represents the elevation of local ethnicity over pan - Islamic rhetoric .
Their local focus gives them a powerful appeal among people hankering for the essentials of life .
ANP 's electoral success also suggests an interesting trend within Pakistani politics .
It appears that regional parties based on ethnic or linguistic commonalities tend to adhere to secular principles .
For example , the MQM , which is essentially a party limited to the city of Karachi , has long been secular in its outlook .
( Last year the MQM held a rally of a few hundred thousand people opposing extremism - great pictures ) .
These regional secular parties - in alliance with the secular PPP , which has revealed itself to be Pakistan 's only truly national party ( it is the only party that won seats in all four provinces ) - seemingly creates a massive secular block in Pakistan .
These regional parties do have their downside .
Aside from the corruption that seems to be rampant no matter what party one belongs to , these parties can be seen as divisive .
The ANP , for example , has what is essentially a secessionist clause in its manifesto : "" Federating units which wish to reorganise on the basis of cultural , linguistic and geographic similarities shall be free to do so . ""
Many Pashtun people of Pakistan - who became geographically split between Pakistan and Afghanistan when the British left - not only consider the border to be artificial , but essentially meaningless .
The ANP has already said that one of the first things it will do upon coming to power is to change NWFP 's name to something like Afghania or Pakhtunkhwa .
Whether or not this gesture is a harbinger of explicit secession or is simply an exercise in pride remains to be seen .
This is why the discussion about Pakistan in western intelligentsia can not just limit itself to mosque and military .
Ethnic and linguistic groups are an immensely powerful force in the country .
If the ANP initiative to rebrand the NWFP is successful , it will mean that all four provinces will be named after the dominant ethnicity in the region .
The challenge for future Pakistani leaders is to find a way to negotiate these ethnic groups in a conciliatory and respectful way .
Historically , this has been nearly impossible for Pakistanis to pull off , and ultimately the problem is one of economic monopolisation by Punjabi interests in the military and industry ( as well as the feudal landlords in Sindh and Punjab ) .
Islamists tend to try to use the frustration these oligarchs cause as a way to provide their utopian solutions .
However , people are becoming wise to their tricks and trying out other , potentially more results - oriented alternatives .
In my opinion , the secular resurgence has far more to do with material concerns than ideological ones .
Ordinary Pakistanis did n't vote for the ANP because they suddenly became hip to Thomas Jefferson or because they became persuaded by some blogger in Birmingham .
They voted for the ANP because they want clean water .
If the ANP fails to deliver the essentials of life - and simply uses nationalism the way Islamists use Islam - then they will be replaced .
If western interests want to maintain the secular resurgence , they are going to have to make sure that these groups do not fail .
At the moment , though , I do n't see any discussion about this in our press ."
2008-02-21,"The battle for power in Pakistan took a fresh twist yesterday when the government reinvigorated a Swiss corruption case against the opposition leader Asif Zardari on the eve of post - election power sharing talks that threaten President Pervez Musharraf .
Government lawyers urged a court in Geneva to prosecute Zardari - whose Pakistan People 's party won the most seats in Monday 's election - on 10-year - old charges of stashing $ 55 m in kickbacks in a Swiss bank account .
The move was seen as a pressure tactic against Zardari , the husband of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto , as he prepared to start negotiations later today for a coalition government with the second - placed opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , who has campaigned to oust Musharraf .
Despite a massive anti - Musharraf factor in Pakistan 's general election , the retired army chief rejected calls for his resignation from the presidency , indicating that he would serve out his five - year term of office .
His staunch ally , the US , urged the opposition to work with him .
The Swiss case against Zardari stalled last year after Musharraf struck a "" reconciliation "" deal with Bhutto under which all corruption charges would be dropped .
But since her assassination on December 27 , and this week 's election victory , all bets appear to be off . ""
There has been no ruling in 10 years .
Why ?
The answer is simple - because this is all political , "" Zardari 's lawyer , Saverio Lembo , said .
Musharraf 's political survival could depend on preventing a united opposition front that , with enough votes in the new parliament , could impeach him .
To do so he may try to exploit differences between Sharif and Zardari .
Sharif wants Musharraf to go and for senior judges who were sacked by the military leader last November to be reinstated .
But Zardari 's PPP has taken a softer line , keeping open the possibility of working with Musharraf and remaining ambiguous about the position of the former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , who is currently under house arrest .
Addressing the media outside his Islamabad home last night , Zardari said both issues would be solved by the next parliament .
"" Parliament will decide which president it can work with and which president it can not , "" he said .
The negotiations starting today will be complex and possibly slow .
Under the constitution there is no time limit for forming a government .
Yesterday the American ambassador , Anne Patterson , held a long meeting with Zardari .
Afterwards he denied that she had tried to pressure him to work with Musharraf . ""
I do n't think the diplomatic corps works on political lines .
They do not give political positions , "" he said .
President George Bush , on a trip to Ghana , deemed the elections "" fair "" and said he hoped the new government would work with the US .
"" We need Pakistan as an important ally , "" he said .
"" We 've got interests in helping make sure there 's no safe haven from which people can plot and plan attacks against the United States of America and Pakistan . ""
But EU observers said they found evidence of significant manipulation in favour of Musharraf 's party , particularly in the run - up to polling . ""
A level playing field was not provided for the campaign , with authorities primarily favouring the former ruling parties , "" Michael Gahler , head of the observer mission , told reporters .
The irregularities persisted last night , with the election commission failing to declare the results in a handful of constituencies - seats that could be vital in any future vote against Musharraf .
Samina Ahmed , south Asia director of the International Crisis Group , said there was evidence that pro - government rigging had deprived both opposition parties of an outright majority , but they should stick together if Pakistan were to achieve a transition from military rule .
"" Both parties have been deprived of a majority .
That makes them vulnerable to manipulation .
They need to realise that if they do not join hands , they can not stabilise the transition .
They have got to work together . """
2008-02-22,"Pakistan 's two largest opposition parties pledged to form a coalition government last night , stepping up pressure on President Pervez Musharraf to resign .
After meeting in Islamabad for the first time since Monday 's general election , Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif said they would come together in the national and provincial assemblies .
They did not say when the government would be formed or who would be prime minister , indicating further talks .
"" We intend to stay together , to be together in parliament , "" said Zardari , whose Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) won most seats in Monday 's election .
Sharif , whose party came second , again urged Musharraf to step down . ""
The nation has given its verdict ...
the sooner he accepts it , the better , "" he said .
In an apparent compromise , Sharif softened his position on the issue of the reinstatement of judges sacked by Musharraf : "" In principle there is no disagreement on the restoration of the judiciary .
We will work out the modalities in parliament . ""
Sharif avoided mentioning the former chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , who remains under house arrest and whose fate has become a sensitive point in negotiations .
The show of unity is part of a complicated power game to determine the shape of the next government .
Their main obstacle is Musharraf .
The US is striving to keep Musharraf in power .
The State Department has publicly urged the opposition to work with the retired general ."
2008-03-10,"Pakistan 's two largest parties agreed to form a coalition government yesterday and promised to reinstate judges fired last year by Pervez Musharraf , raising the prospect of fierce antagonism between president and cabinet .
Nawaz Sharif , the former prime minister once exiled by Musharraf , and Asif Ali Zardari , widow of Benazir Bhutto , announced a power - sharing deal at a resort town in the foothills of the Himalayas .
The deal dashes Musharraf 's hope that the party which backs him - a poor third in last month 's election - might get a role in the government .
Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party won 120 seats in the 342-seat National Assembly , followed by Sharif 's party with 90 .
The former ruling party aligned with Musharraf won 51 .
Zardari and Sharif agreed that the reappointment of the dismissed judges would occur through a parliamentary resolution within 30 days of the formation of the government .
The judges were seen as hostile to Musharraf 's October re - election by legislators for a new five - year term as president while he was still army chief .
The judges are likely to take up legal challenges to Musharraf if they are restored .
Lawyers launched a week of protests yesterday to press for the restoration of the judges .
Police fired teargas at protesters near the home of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry where he has been detained since November .
It was a year ago yesterday that Musharraf first suspended Chaudhry , triggering protests by lawyers and the opposition .
Sharif , ousted by Musharraf in a 1999 coup , has been calling for the unpopular president to step down ; he said yesterday that Musharraf should accept the people 's verdict "" against dictatorship "" .
Zardari was more conciliatory , saying he did not believe in "" personal agendas "" ."
2008-03-10,"President Pervez Musharraf is facing a severe challenge to his fading authority with the formation of a hostile new government that has vowed to restore 60 sacked judges .
The announcement yesterday of a coalition government between Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif , whose parties swept last month 's general election , poses a potent threat to the retired general .
Zardari and Sharif control almost enough seats for the two - thirds parliamentary majority that would allow them to start impeachment proceedings against Musharraf , or at the very least strip him of his remaining powers .
But the alliance between the erstwhile political rivals is fraught with potential pitfalls , and for now at least , Musharraf shows few signs of resigning . ""
He 's a strong man , he 's a commando and he does n't give up easily , "" said Tariq Azim , a Musharraf loyalist and former information minister who recently met the president .
In reaching their agreement , Zardari and Sharif - whose parties were at daggers drawn during the last period of civilian rule in the 1990s - made crucial compromises , both with each other and Musharraf .
Sharif agreed to allow his party take oath under the president - his bitter enemy , who ousted him in a 1999 coup .
Sharif himself will not even be present because Musharraf officials prevented him from contesting a seat .
The most significant concession , however , was made by Zardari , the husband of the assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto , who agreed that about 60 judges fired by Musharraf will be restored through a parliamentary resolution within the first 30 days of government .
The fate of the judges has become a burning issue in Pakistan .
They were removed on November 3 when Musharraf suspended the constitution and imposed emergency rule , days before the supreme court was due to rule on his controversial re - election .
Their restoration would be a victory for Sharif , whose supporters polled well thanks to promises of ousting Musharraf and reinstating the judiciary .
But the issue is a constitutional and political minefield .
Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) has been more taciturn , advocating an "" independent "" judiciary but stopping short of calling for the reinstatement of the former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
Chaudhry and Musharraf are bitter enemies and few analysts believe they can co - exist for long if Chaudhry is reinstated .
Musharraf 's ill - fated attempt to remove him a year ago last Sunday triggered a formidable protest movement that led to his present predicament .
In recent interviews Musharraf has denounced Chaudhry as a corrupt charlatan and "" the scum of the earth "" .
The PPP and many western diplomats are wary of Chaudhry for his fiery judgment and mercurial temperament .
They claim he has become politicised through his rivalry with Musharraf .
But Chaudhry is a hero to Pakistan 's lawyers and many ordinary citizens , and his fate has become a key factor in the complex political calculus .
On Sunday riot police fired tear gas on protesters outside Chaudhry 's Islamabad home , where the judge has been imprisoned with his family for the past four months .
Zardari has another problem .
Despite weeks of horse - trading and internal debate , his party has failed to choose a candidate for prime minister , underlining the difficulty of ensuring party unity in the wake of the assassination of his wife on December 27 .
A showdown between Musharraf and the new government is possible but unlikely as early as this week , when the national assembly may meet .
Even if the Sharif - Zardari government can muster the numbers needed to impeach Musharraf , the question is how the retired general and his military colleagues would react .
The army has held the balance of power in Pakistan for the past 50 years , ruling directly through military dictators or indirectly through intelligence agencies and clandestine machinations .
Musharraf 's stark unpopularity has caused the new army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , to publicly distance the military from overt political interference .
Kayani recent withdrew serving officers from several public bodies .
But last week he sought to dispel speculation that the army was "" distancing "" itself from Musharraf .
In a statement viewed as a veiled threat , Kayani appealed to political parties to avoid "" any kind of schism which ... would not be in the larger interest of the nation "" .
Whether Kayani 's definition of a "" schism "" involves the political future of his former boss , Musharraf , will become clearer if the parliament moves against him ."
2008-03-17,"Political leaders in Pakistan who triumphed over Pervez Musharraf and his allies in last month 's elections today hailed the country 's transition to democracy today the new parliament was sworn in .
Former rivals Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari are now expected to form a coalition government after their parties ' victory , which observers believe will curtail Musharraf 's power .
Senator Tariq Azim , a Musharraf ally , hailed the inauguration of the lower house as a "" step toward political stability "" but Zardari - the widower of Benazir Bhutto , who was assassinated during election campaigning - said it marked the beginning of the end for "" dictatorship "" .
"" This is the first step for democracy , "" he said .
"" Democracy is the last step for dictatorship . ""
Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party won the most seats in the February elections .
It plans to form a coalition with Sharif and a smaller group from the unstable north - west area of Pakistan .
The party said its top priority will be to seek a UN investigation of the December 27 assassination of Bhutto and to amend the constitution to strip Musharraf of his power to dissolve the assemblies and dismiss the prime minister .
The new government is also expected to restore judges purged from the courts by Musharraf when he declared emergency rule last November .
Musharraf swept aside the supreme court as it prepared to rule on whether he was eligible for the five - year presidential term he won in an October vote in the outgoing parliament .
The ousted chief justice , Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry , has been under house arrest for more than four months .
Musharraf is likely to oppose his return , which could reopen the question of Musharraf 's eligibility to be president .
But Sharif said as he left parliament that the process of restoring the judges "" has started today and we will not let the nation down "" .
Pakistan is reeling from two deadly attacks in its tribal areas and the capital , Islamabad .
Pakistan 's western allies fear any confrontation between the president and a new government may encourage rebels to launch more bombing raids ."
2008-03-17,"A salvo of suspected American missiles killed at least 20 people , including several al - Qaida militants , in Pakistan 's tribal areas yesterday , a day after a restaurant bombing in the capital , Islamabad , that wounded US and British officials .
The bloody weekend underscored the extremist threat facing the new coalition government of erstwhile rivals Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari , which is due to be formed after parliament is sworn in today .
Tribesmen near Wana , the main town in South Waziristan , reported seeing up to seven missiles fired at two houses .
Earlier they heard a buzzing noise - the signature sound of US Predator drones , which have carried out at least two attacks on suspected al - Qaida hideouts in the tribal areas this year .
The Pakistan army confirmed five or six explosions , but could not identify the source .
The US and Pakistan have a policy of not officially recognising politically inflammatory Predator strikes .
Security officials said that al - Qaida fighters from Arab countries and Turkmenistan were hiding inside the house .
Angry tribesmen said the victims were innocent locals , said Sailab Masood , a veteran tribal journalist .
In an unusual admission of the presence of foreign militants , the Saudi interior ministry announced that three of its nationals had been extradited from Pakistan after being "" in troubled zones in an illegal capacity "" , an apparent reference to al - Qaida activity in the tribal areas .
Islamabad was tense yesterday after the bombing of Luna Caprese , an Italian restaurant popular with foreigners , the previous night .
A Turkish aid worker was killed and 13 others injured including five American diplomats , two Japanese journalists and a British police officer .
Local media showed photographs of Keith Pearce , a Scotland Yard counter - terrorism specialist who had contact with the Pakistani police , leaving the restaurant with eye injuries and a bloodied shirt .
He has returned to the UK for treatment .
Police yesterday stepped up security , mounting roadblocks and standing guard outside the restaurant , one of the few to serve alcohol in the capital .
The attack may mark a significant shift in militant tactics .
Until now most attacks have been suicide bombings targeting military and police installations .
Now foreigners have joined the target list .
The US embassy warned citizens to avoid congregating in public places and to "" act self defensively at all times "" .
The Foreign Office updated its travel advice for Pakistan , saying there was "" a heightened threat to westerners in major cities "" .
Today 's inaugural session of the new parliament is the latest challenge for the politically diminished President Pervez Musharraf .
It paves the way for a coalition government uniting Benazir Bhutto 's widower , Zardari , and Sharif , who has vowed to oust Musharraf at the earliest opportunity .
But the coalition 's unity is fragile and the president could still exploit differences over the status of the former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , who has been under house arrest since November .
Musharraf 's spokesman , Rashid Qureshi , said parliamentary procedures meant it could take up to a week for the new government to assume power ."
2008-03-21,"Benazir Bhutto 's teenage son and political heir , Bilawal , will announce the identity of Pakistan 's next prime minister by the end of this weekend , his party said yesterday , ending weeks of backroom wrangling and setting the stage for a confrontation between the new government and the embattled president , Pervez Musharraf .
The 19-year - old Oxford history student was brought home by his father and party co - chairman , Asif Ali Zardari , who has been at the heart of contentious negotiations over the prime minister 's job .
A party spokesman , Farhatullah Babar , said Bilawal would announce the winner on Sunday night or Monday morning , when Musharraf has promised to facilitate the formation of a new four - party coalition government dominated by the Pakistan People 's party and Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League .
Wrangling about who should become prime minister overshadowed an otherwise bright week in Pakistan 's normally crisis - stricken politics .
On Wednesday the new parliament elected Dr Fehmida Mirza as speaker - the first woman to hold that position in a Muslim country .
The initial sessions were eager , glamour - tinged affairs .
First - time parliamentarians arrived in designer sunglasses , gleaming cars and dapper new outfits .
Some 76 of the 342 seats are occupied by women , largely thanks to a quota system .
Senior Musharraf advisers who lost their seats in the February 18 poll watched sullenly from the visitors ' gallery .
"" The days of dictatorship are over , "" said Asif Zardari , who is thought to hold ambitions of being prime minister even though he does not have a seat .
There is speculation he could come to power through a byelection in the coming months .
A series of looming crises , however , mean that the new government 's honeymoon is likely to be shortlived .
Sharpshooters perched on the parliament roof and bulletproof 4x4s parked outside were reminders of the threat posed by resurgent Islamist militants .
A string of suicide bombings have killed more than 150 people this year .
In the latest attack yesterday a militant killed five Pakistani soldiers and wounded nine others near the Afghan border .
The violence has spread to the larger cities , where many residents live in fear .
"" It 's an unseen enemy .
It 's like a civil war situation , "" said Salman Batalvi , an advertising executive whose office was destroyed in a blast in Lahore last week .
Foreigners also feel they are targets .
A bomb at an Italian restaurant in Islamabad last weekend killed one person and wounded 13 others , including a Scotland Yard detective and four American FBI agents .
On top of this threat , a painful economic squeeze is expected .
Chronic electricity shortages could see 10-hour blackouts in some parts over the long and humid summer , according to some newspapers .
In industrial areas some factories have already been forced to scale down production .
Fuel prices have risen by 17 % this month , causing the cash - strapped national carrier Pakistan International Airlines to ground eight jets .
Meanwhile ordinary Pakistanis are struggling to cope with galloping food inflation .
Prices of wheat , oil and other staples have soared in recent months , triggering long lines outside government food stores .
The economic troubles are partly the fault of the previous government led by the Musharraf loyalist Shaukat Aziz , a technocratic banker with little political support .
Despite numerous claims of economic success while in office he now faces sharp criticism for big mistakes , most notably the failure to add capacity to the creaking national power grid .
But the new administration 's first challenge is simply to stay together .
Despite public smiles and extravagant displays of bonhomie , the alliance between Zardari and Sharif faces numerous strains .
They differ on how to handle the increasingly isolated Musharraf .
Sharif , who was ousted by the former general in a 1999 coup , has vowed to force out Musharraf at the earliest opportunity .
Zardari favours a more conciliatory approach , although they may soon wield the two - thirds majority needed to impeach the president .
The other contentious issue is the judges .
Both parties have vowed to restore the 60 judges fired by Musharraf last November , including the president 's arch - rival , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry .
But the return of Chaudhry , who has become a hero for many Pakistanis , would be a major provocation to Musharraf and could trigger an explosive confrontation .
In a rare telephone address from the Islamabad home where he is being detained yesterday , Chaudhry was unbowed . ""
God willing , this struggle will continue until we succeed , "" he said ."
2008-03-27,"The Bush administration is scrambling to engage with Pakistan 's new rulers as power flows from its strong ally , President Pervez Musharraf , to a powerful civilian government buoyed by anti - American sentiment .
Top diplomats John Negroponte and Richard Boucher travelled to a mountain fortress near the Afghan border yesterday as part of a hastily announced visit that has received a tepid reception .
On Tuesday , senior coalition partner Nawaz Sharif gave the visiting Americans a public scolding for using Pakistan as a "" killing field "" and relying too much on Musharraf .
Yesterday the new prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , said he warned President George Bush in a phone conversation that he would prioritise talking as well as shooting in the battle against Islamist extremism . ""
He said that a comprehensive approach is required in this regard , specially combining a political approach with development , "" a statement said .
But Gilani also reassured Bush that Pakistan would "" continue to fight against terrorism "" , it said .
Since 2001 American officials have treasured their close relationship with Musharraf because he offered a "" one - stop shop "" for cooperation in hunting al - Qaida fugitives hiding in Pakistan .
But since the crushing electoral defeat of Musharraf 's party last month , and talk that the new parliament may hobble the president 's powers , that equation has changed .
Now the US finds itself dealing with politicians it previously spurned .
The body language between Negroponte and Sharif during their meeting on Tuesday spoke volumes : the Pakistani greeted the American with a starched handshake , and sat at a distance .
In blunt remarks afterwards , Sharif said he told Negroponte that Pakistan was no longer a one - man show . ""
Since 9/11 , all decisions were taken by one man , "" he said .
"" Now we have a sovereign parliament and everything will be debated in the parliament .
"" It was "" unacceptable that while giving peace to the world we make our own country a killing field , "" Sharif said , echoing widespread public anger at US - funded military operations in the tribal belt . ""
If America wants to see itself clean of terrorism , we also want our villages and towns not to be bombed , "" he said .
US officials have long paid tribute to the virtues of democracy in Pakistan .
But , as happened in the Palestinian Authority after the 2006 Hamas victory , policymakers are racing to catch up with the consequences of a result that challenges American priorities .
The US has long been suspicious of Sharif , whom it views as sympathetic to religious parties .
Unlike Benazir Bhutto , whose return from exile was negotiated through the US , Sharif came under the protection of Saudi Arabia .
But now Sharif 's party , which performed well in the poll , is an integral part of the new government .
Yesterday Negroponte and Boucher travelled to the Khyber Pass in North - West Frontier Province , the centre of a growing insurgency .
They met with the commander of the Frontier Corps , a poorly equipped paramilitary force that the US has offered to upgrade .
The US has earmarked $ 750 m ( £ 324 m ) for a five - year development programme in tribal areas .
At least 22 military instructors are due to start training the corps this year .
The timing of the American visit - before the new cabinet is announced - has offended Pakistanis . ""
It flies in the face of normal protocol at a time when public opinion is rife that they are making a last ditch effort to save Musharraf , "" said Talat Hussain , a prominent journalist .
It is unclear how Pakistan 's foreign policy will be formulated in future .
Musharraf 's power may have been cut but the strong army is lurking in the shadows , and the coalition is wrangling over cabinet posts , including that of foreign minister .
Gilani must manage other tensions , particularly over whether to reinstate Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , the deposed chief justice who was freed from house arrest on Monday .
Chaudhry has become a folk hero but is viewed with suspicion by Gilani 's Pakistan People 's party ."
2008-04-16,"The road to Nawaz Sharif 's house performs some radical zigzags along the way .
This is presumably for security purposes - forcing would be suicide - bombers to slow down enough for the guards to take a shot .
But the winding drive must also serve as a daily reminder for Sharif of the precarious route to power in Pakistan .
He has twice been prime minister .
His last term was cut short in 1999 by a coup by his army chief , Pervez Musharraf .
Nine years on , Musharraf is still president but has been haemorrhaging authority for months in the face of public disdain .
Sharif is back from exile and back in power , this time as part of a new democratically elected coalition , and working hard to sideline the president with the aim of eventually forcing him out .
Meanwhile , as part of the compromise that has brought the coalition to power , Sharif is not in a government post but instead wields power as head of his party , the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) , from his home in Raiwind , outside Lahore .
Home , in Sharif 's case , is an imposing white mansion , topped by a glass dome , set deep in an extensive compound owned by the family , which made a fortune in business after Pakistan 's partition from India .
It was to protect the family 's business interests that Nawaz was initially sent into politics by his father more than 30 years ago .
The military ransacked the Sharif compound after Musharraf seized power in 1999 .
But in the five months Sharif has been back in the country , the big house has been restored to its original splendour .
There is a stuffed lion prowling just inside the door , and huge Persian silk carpets adorn the floors and walls of its vast rooms .
Stepping outside , the man of the house shows off a cricket pitch being laid in the grounds .
His mood can best be described as quietly triumphant . ""
A lot of people were saying very confidently , including President Musharraf , that I would n't be back in my country by 2011 , and look what God has done , "" he said .
"" We have had this huge victory . ""
There is still much to be done to make the new coalition fully functional .
There are still jobs to be divided up with the other senior partner , the Pakistan People 's Party , run by Asif Ali Zardari , who has emerged as the country 's other principal power broker since the assassination in December of his wife , Benazir Bhutto .
Sharif and Zardari have been arguing about the restoration of judges summarily fired by Musharraf .
Zardari wants legislation to be passed first to redefine the judiciary 's position .
His critics accuse him of stalling out of fear that the restored courts may reopen old corruption charges against him .
They also say Zardari is under pressure from the Americans to block the return to the supreme court of the ousted chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , who is likely to reopen legal proceedings against Musharraf , Washington 's closet ally in the region .
Sharif insists that the complete restoration of the judges is a "" matter of principle "" .
"" This is about the independence of the judiciary , "" he said .
The declarations would perhaps have more resonance if Sharif 's own supporters had not ransacked the supreme court building when it had the temerity to contemplate a legal case against him while he was in office .
Sharif is well aware that Chaudhry 's return to the court is the quickest and surest way of getting rid of Musharraf , who he refuses to recognise as president .
This is an awkward position to take under the constitution .
Ministers from the PML - N , after all , had to take the oath of office in front of the president .
But Sharif insists their hearts were not in it . ""
They took the oath under protest , wearing black bands , and just taking the oath and rushing out of the presidency , without even meeting him , "" he said .
This is not , of course , the first battle of nerves between Sharif and Musharraf .
In 1999 , aware that Musharraf was planning a coup , Sharif tried to replace him while the army chief was in the air , flying home from a foreign trip .
Sharif tried to block the plane , a commercial airliner full of civilian passengers , from landing until it only had a few minutes fuel left .
Little wonder the feud between the two men is so toxic .
This time , Sharif is hoping to bleed Musharraf 's power away drop by drop , and he believes he is close to succeeding .
"" Maybe a few people in the [ US ] administration still think he should be allowed to stay as president , whenever or not he can do anything for anybody , "" Sharif said "" But I think he has lost his writ to a great extent .
He has outlived his utility for anybody . ""

In the article above ministers from the PML - N took the oath of office wearing black bands , not pants .
This has been corrected ."
2008-04-22,"A struggle is under way in Pakistan over the fate of AQ Khan , the godfather of the country 's atom programme , who is under house arrest for selling nuclear secrets and hardware to North Korea , Libya and Iran .
The junior party in the new coalition government , led by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , is pushing for his release ; the senior partner , the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) , is vacillating , under intense pressure from its rank and file and the general public , which generally views Abdul Qadeer Khan as a national hero rather than a traitor .
Before she was assassinated in December , the late PPP leader Benazir Bhutto provoked outrage by saying she would make him available for questioning by foreigners , including the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Her successors have dropped that line , hinting instead that it could be time to relax the restrictions on the 72-year - old scientist .
The old man himself forced the issue by giving a flurry of telephone interviews from his home calling on the new government to put its concerns over his imprisonment into action . ""
So far , they have just talked of love and have not demonstrated it , "" he said .
He insisted that he had been made a scapegoat for the sales of uranium centrifuges and blueprints abroad , hinting there had been wider government involvement under President Pervez Musharraf .
He also claimed his televised confession in February 2004 was made under duress .
Khan was pardoned by Musharraf the day after the confession , but he has been kept under house arrest ever since , shielded from the curiosity of the IAEA , as well as American and European investigators .
In response to Khan 's cry for help , the government tightened his gag once more , agreeing on a common line across the coalition that it would review his status once it had seen the evidence against him .
Last Thursday , Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's behemoth spy agency , presented that evidence .
Intelligence sources claimed the ISI case had been "" convincing "" , and that "" nothing is going to change "" in Khan 's circumstances : that meant no relaxation of his "" protective custody "" , nor any access for the IAEA , a move that in Pakistan is regarded as a politically unpalatable surrender of sovereignty .
It will be interesting to see if this position will hold .
The new government was elected on a wave of populist sentiment and is eager to test its strength against Musharraf and the military establishment .
But the government now has a dilemma .
Khan 's release would infuriate Washington , which is offering a "" democracy dividend "" if Islamabad continues to cooperate on counter - proliferation and counter - terrorism .
On the latter , the government of the prime minister , Yusuf Raza Gillani , believes it has a deal with the US in which the American military will curb military action against jihadist militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas and support a dialogue with Pashtun chiefs in the region .
In return , Pakistan pledges to take immediate and determined action against "" irreconcilable "" militants when and if its security apparatus is presented with "" actionable intelligence "" .
The ISI has mounted a determined public relations drive to convince the world Pakistan is doing all it can to combat the militants in the rugged tribal areas along the Afghan border - home to 3.8 million people , almost all Pashtun , and 90 % living below the poverty line .
Pakistan points out that more than 100,000 troops have been deployed there since 2001 , in a radical break with the region 's tradition of fiercely guarded independence , and that more than 1,000 have died .
At a briefing in Islamabad , ISI officials said that in the past year Pakistan had killed 914 "" miscreants "" there , including 480 foreigners .
The officials claim no more than 60 "" diehard Arabs "" from the al - Qaida network remain on Pakistani soil , supported by between 1,500 and 1,500 "" Chechens "" , a term used by the ISI as a blanket category that also includes Uzbek militants and other central Asians who provide al - Qaida footsoldiers in the region .
Of the al - Qaida Arabs , the ISI insists none are "" first tier "" top commanders .
The apparent certainty on this point , however , is at odds with Pakistan 's other claims about the impenetrability of tribal agencies like North and South Waziristan .
But Pakistan intelligence officials say the certainty is built on a dearth of "" actionable intelligence "" in recent years indicating Osama Bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri or any of their top lieutenants are on Pakistani soil .
Such claims are largely designed for public consumption , but they nevertheless irritate US intelligence officials , who believe the ISI is still not pursuing Islamic militants wholeheartedly .
For the time being , however , the new government has won a breathing space from Washington , and the US military is being restrained from launching new cross - border offensives against extremist groups , such as the Pashtun militants loyal to Sirajuddin Haqqani suspected of masterminding a string of attacks on westerners and Nato forces in Afghanistan .
That breathing space is unlikely to last for long .
The Bush administration wants some successes against al - Qaida to prove that the "" war on terror "" is not entirely mired in Iraq , and it is running out of time ."
2008-04-30,"Leaders of Pakistan 's coalition government were holding crisis talks last night in Dubai , in an attempt to avoid a damaging split and deliver on their pledge to reinstate by the end of April the judges who were deposed by President Pervez Musharraf .
Coalition leaders Asif Ali Zardari , chairman of the Pakistan People 's Party , and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had met in two marathon sessions , but party members said the talks were yet to yield a breakthrough .
"" I am hopeful that there would be an agreement .
We are expecting [ Nawaz Sharif ] back for a party meeting tomorrow in Lahore .
[ Failure to agree ] would have very bad consequences for the democracy and the country , "" said Raja Zafar - ul - Haq , chairman of Sharif 's party .
The issue threatens Pakistan 's month - old coalition government and has eroded its public support in a country where the ousted chief justice , Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry , remains a popular figure .
In the fevered atmosphere of Pakistani politics there is even speculation that the two parties might pull apart , relieving the pressure on the embattled Musharraf .
Some officials of Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) have hinted that their ministers could quit the government over the issue , while others say they could consider an extension of the April 30 deadline if there was "" reasonable justification "" .
On the surface the differences appear small .
Zardari , the husband of the late Benazir Bhutto , wants the restoration of the judges to be linked to constitutional reforms .
Sharif , his rival - turned - partner , has said publicly his party will not accept anything less than an unconditional reinstatement .
But the matter could spell trouble for Musharraf , analysts say .
The military dictator removed chief justice Chaudhry when the country 's supreme court moved to rule on the legality of his election last October for a new five - year presidential term .
Musharraf accused the judge of corruption and attempting a judicial takeover of the country , which would derail plans for elections .
Little - known before ascending to the top job in Pakistan 's legal system , Chaudhry had displayed a remarkable degree of independence , questioning state sell - offs and taking on Pakistan 's feared spy agency , Inter - Services Intelligence , for allegedly imprisoning political activists under anti - terror legislation .
Musharraf might even have to quit if Chaudhry is restored and the court looks again at the president 's
disputed re - election . ""
The PPP have become aligned increasingly with the presidency .
That is what people are now saying .
People can not have confidence in the present judges and [ Chaudhry ] was a symbol of resistance .
I can not see how they can not restore him , "" said Asma Jehangir , a prominent human rights lawyer .
There are also rumours that Zardari 's fear is that , if restored , Chaudhry could undo an amnesty deal president Musharraf made that cleared him of graft charges .
The deal allowed Zardari and his late wife to return home from exile last year .
The PPP rebuts such claims and says the party is committed to working out a way of removing the president in a "" democratic "" coup .
Its chairman told reporters that he wanted to "" strengthen the parliament "" , and in a veiled warning to Musharraf he said he desired a civilian president ."

2008-05-12,"Pakistan 's fragile coalition government suffered a blow yesterday when Nawaz Sharif , leader of the second - largest party , pulled his ministers from the six - week - old cabinet .
The withdrawal of the Pakistan Muslim League followed the collapse of talks with Asif Ali Zardari , the leader of the largest party , over how to reinstate about 45 senior judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf last November .
After a final attempt at talks , which shifted from Dubai to London , Sharif returned to Islamabad to announce that his ministers would resign .
Nine of the 24 cabinet positions , including the finance minister , are held by Sharif loyalists .
The split destabilises Pakistani politics and raised fears for the transition to civilian rule after nine years under Pervez Musharraf .
But for now it is more of a political trial separation than a divorce .
Sharif said he was "" pained "" to withdraw his ministers and would not seek to collapse the fledgling government .
Instead of joining the opposition , his party would support Zardari 's on an "" issue - by - issue "" basis .
"" We will not become part of any conspiracy to destabilise the democratic process , "" he said .
Zardari 's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) continued the conciliatory tone , saying the issue was not whether the judges should be restored but "" exactly how best to do it "" .
The awkward manoeuvres between the political allies are the public face of a complex power negotiation involving Pakistani diplomats , military generals and influential American officials .
On the surface , Sharif and Zardari are arguing about a relatively technical issue .
Both agree that sacked judges , including the firebrand former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , should be reinstated .
But while Sharif advocates their immediate return , Zardari 's PPP wants a more cautious approach , including a judicial reform package to limit the chief justice 's powers .
The controversy overlays a more sensitive debate about the fate of Musharraf , who suffered a humiliating defeat in last February 's election .
Musharraf has made it clear that he is not prepared to accept the return of Chaudhry .
Despite his electoral collapse , he enjoys the support of two powerful backers : the Pakistani military and the US government .
President George Bush wants his old ally Musharraf to remain in power , and last weekend dispatched the assistant secretary of state , Richard Boucher , to meet with Zardari and Sharif in London - the latest of several meetings between US and Pakistani officials at critical junctures .
Although in public the US favours a transition to civilian - led democracy , its first objective is to ensure cooperation in the hunt for al - Qaida and Taliban militants hiding on Pakistani soil and plotting terrorist attacks on Afghanistan or the west .
That cooperation is underpinned by the Pakistani military , which also appears to want to retain Musharraf in power .
The importance of those military ties was underscored yesterday by a visit from the acting commander of US Central Command , Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey , to military headquarters in Rawalpindi .
Before leaving he said the meetings were "" vital and productive , and I look forward to more visits with all of them in future "" .
The US role has dismayed civil society activists inside Pakistan .
"" There 's a lot of pressure from abroad
but it 's all for Pervez Musharraf , "" said a senior lawyer , Athar Minallah . ""
But what do they gain out of him right now ?
It 's beyond my comprehension .
"" The resignation of Sharif 's ministers leaves the government exposed at a time of deepening economic difficulties and growing public impatience .
Zardari 's popularity is slipping and the media has become increasingly critical .
If his party is deserted by Sharif he will have to rely on support from Musharraf loyalists - a politically devastating blow .
Meanwhile , the country is burdened by electricity shortages and rising inflation , running at 17 % .
Business confidence is also sliding : last week the rupee slid to an all - time low against the US dollar ."

Musharraf has made it clear that he is not prepared to stomach the return of Chaudhry .
And despite his electoral collapse he still enjoys the support of two powerful backers : the Pakistani military and the US government .
President George Bush wants his old ally Musharraf to remain in power , and last weekend dispatched the assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher to meet with Zardari and Sharif in London — the latest of several meetings between US and Pakistani officials at critical junctures .
Although in public the US favours a transition to civilian - led democracy , its first objective is to ensure cooperation in the hunt for al - Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistan who may be plotting attacks on Afghanistan or the west .
That cooperation is underscored by the Pakistani military , which also appears to want to keep Musharraf in power .
The importance of those military ties was underscored today by a visit from the acting commander of US central command , Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey , to military headquarters in Rawalpindi .
Before leaving he said the meetings were "" vital and productive , and I look forward to more visits with all of them in future "" .
The US role has dismayed civil society activists inside Pakistan .
"" There 's a lot of pressure from abroad
but it 's all for Pervez Musharraf , "" said senior lawyer Athar Minallah .
"" But what do they gain out of him right now ?
It 's beyond my comprehension .
"" The resignation of Sharif 's ministers leaves the government precariously exposed at a time of deepening economic difficulties and growing public impatience .
Zardari 's popularity is slipping and the media has become increasingly critical .
If his party is entirely deserted by Sharif he will have to rely on support from Musharraf loyalists — a politically devastating blow .
Meanwhile the country is burdened by chronic electricity shortages and rising inflation , running at 17 % in April .
Business confidence is also sliding : last week the Karachi stock exchange dipped 5 % and the rupee slid to an all - time low against the US dollar ."
2008-05-16,"The refusal yesterday of the head of Pakistan 's ruling coalition to accept the resignations of nine ministers of Nawaz Sharif 's party is a sign of the gravity of the situation facing the winners of Pakistan 's recent elections .
The issue dividing Asif Ali Zardari , the widower of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto , and Mr Sharif is , at face value , a technical one .
Both men are committed to restoring the judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf in November .
Mr Sharif wants them restored by an executive order of the prime minster , while Mr Zardari prefers the parliamentary tools of a constitutional amendment .
The dispute , which threatens the coalition only months after it crushingly defeated the presidential party , is anything but technical .
At stake is the ousting of the president .
An executive order would have dramatic effects .
It would rightly declare the state of emergency the president imposed on November 3 illegal , setting the constitutional clock back to November 2 .
Mr Musharraf 's dodgy re - election as president would again be up for legal challenge , as would the amnesty on corruption charges that the president arranged for the Bhutto couple ( although this could be re - adopted by parliament ) .
Loyalist justices Mr Musharraf installed after November would be sacked and their decisions annulled .
Mr Zardari 's constitutional amendment , on the other hand , would implicitly recognise that some of the changes to the constitution after November 3 were legal .
The amendment would be passed by a two - thirds majority of both houses of parliament , a way of loudly proclaiming the restoration of the chief justice , while quietly abandoning Iftikhar Chaudhry 's claim for his old job back .
Mr Zardari says Mr Sharif risks triggering another crisis : the loyalist supreme court would issue a stay order against the prime ministerial decree ; the army would go to the supreme court 's aid , while police would go to the government 's , igniting an armed standoff .
But nor does Mr Zardari want Mr Sharif to walk away from the coalition .
Without Mr Sharif 's party , the Pakistan Peoples party ( PPP ) would have no alternative but to return to the president 's fold .
To encourage this , Mr Musharraf yesterday appointed a PPP governor for Punjab , a rival of Mr Sharif in his home province .
Both Washington and London are pushing the PPP to do a deal with the president .
If it did , the PPP knows that it would pay a high price for acting as the fig leaf for his continued misrule .
Washington knows this too , but for short - term gain it is prepared to sacrifice a party that is pro - western , liberal and national on the altar of its fight against al - Qaida ."
2008-08-06,"President Pervez Musharraf decided last night to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic games in Beijing , but not without some trepidation at leaving the country .
The newspaper Dawn reported that the leaders of the two biggest parties in Pakistan 's ruling coalition were coming close to an agreement on a course that would lead to his ousting or to his impeachment , and for a while it looked as if the trip was off .
Mr Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif , one of the two leaders involved in the impeachment move , have a history of toppling each other .
The president has only to think back to October 12 1999 , when Mr Sharif , then prime minister , dismissed General Musharraf as head of the army while he was out of the country .
What followed Mr Musharraf 's dramatic landing at Karachi airport , when he got the army to unblock the runway as his plane was running out of fuel , was a military coup .
What could happen now may not be that different , and both men may be motivated by revenge - Mr Musharraf for the drubbing he received in the elections in February , and Mr Sharif for 1999 .
This is a country where vendettas are played out against a wider security landscape .
For all the euphoria that followed the crushing defeat of parties loyal to the president in February , the coalition government of Yousuf Gilani , the prime minister , has run into the sands .
Food prices are soaring , a war with militants is raging , relations with India have plunged ( again ) and the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) spy agency , accused by Afghanistan and India of helping the Taliban bomb the Indian embassy in Kabul , appears a law unto itself .
After just six weeks in office , the coalition between the Pakistan Peoples party and Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) all but collapsed over the issue of how to reinstate the judges sacked by Mr Musharraf .
The fate of the sacked justices is linked inextricably to the president 's , because it was the supreme court 's determination to pursue the circumstances of the president 's re - election last year that led to the court 's dismissal .
If the PPP and PML - N heal their rift over the reinstatement of the judges , Mr Musharraf may yet face his nemesis .
But the country is weaker than it was to cope with the consequences of domestic crisis .
There are many unknowns .
Will the army take sides ?
Will the president 's supporters engage the services of the ISI , whose cause they have been championing in parliament ?
Mr Musharraf said he would not use presidential powers to dismiss parliament , but there is all manner of proxy force available to those intent on destabilising democracy .
Day by day , the self - serving argument that Pakistan can not function under civilian rule advances its cause ."
2008-08-07,"The news of the potential impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf means further political instability for Pakistan - at least in the short term .
Though a deal has finally been done between the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) , effectively led by the late Benazir Bhutto 's husband , Asif Zardari , and Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N ) , this indicates a very temporary coincidence of interest rather than a new solidarity .
The beleaguered president 's decision not to go to China for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games indicates he is taking the threat seriously .
No Pakistani president has ever been impeached and the procedure laid down in the 1973 constitution is likely to mean a classic drawn - out Pakistani politico - legal wrangle .
Impeachment is a political process relying on a two - thirds majority of both houses of parliament deciding to remove the president from office on grounds of gross misconduct , physical or mental impairment or violation of the constitution .
Musharraf 's declaration of a state of emergency last November , shortly after getting himself re - elected for a second five - year term , means the third option is the most likely to be invoked .
But the PPP and the PML - N will need help from smaller groupings - including hardline religious elements and a significant number of the 17 independent parliamentarians - to get the impeachment through the National Assembly .
Such support is uncertain at best and all assembly members - and particularly the independents - are likely to be the subject of frantic horse - trading .
"" They will be seen as up for sale , "" said Rasul Bakhsh Rais , Professor of Political Science at Lahore University of Management Sciences .
Equally Musharraf still has powerful and wealthy political allies such as the loyalists of the reduced but still effective Pakistan Muslim League - Q.
And , any impeachment could prove to be unpopular at home and overseas .
With Pakistan suffering an economic crisis and "" a grave threat from terrorism "" there is "" a feeling that this is not the moment to be divisive , "" Rais said .
The issues of the restoration of around 60 judges removed from their posts by Musharraf when he declared the emergency last year is directly linked to the impeachment .
"" They have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing , "" said Professor Osama Siddique , an expert in constitutional law in Pakistan .
A simpler way of ousting Musharraf may simply be to use the threat of the impeachment to force him to opt for a confidence vote .
However , given that he is unlikely to win , the president will resist such a move if he can .
The west will be watching the evolving relations between the military and Pakistan 's political leaders closely .
A recent attempt to subject the country 's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service ( ISI ) to civilian authority backfired badly .
Though Musharraf still has some friends within the sprawling military establishment , few analysts believe the army will intervene .
That February 's general election was largely free and fair was in part due to the new Chief of Army Staff , General Ashfaq Kiyani .
Many soldiers now consider the president as something of an embarrassment .
The real winner may eventually be Nawaz Sharif , a two - time former prime minister who returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabia last year .
Despite having little time to prepare a campaign , Sharif 's PML - N party did well in the spring elections , especially in the key province of the Punjab .
Sharif has the vote of much of the religiously conservative , patriotic commercial middle class in Pakistan 's rapidly growing cities and has his finger on the popular pulse more than any other politician .
And it is Sharif , who detests the president , who has pushed hard for impeachment .
Musharraf still has the theoretical constitutional right to dissolve parliament - subject to eventual supreme court approval .
This is the political smart bomb that the president could use to delay his impeachment - but only at the cost of provoking a new election and giving Sharif , who he ousted in 1999 , the chance to consolidate his power .
Whatever the result of this latest crisis , it is Sharif who is likely to come out on top ."

2008-08-16,"Tomorrow morning two convoys of luxury four - wheel - drive vehicles will speed from the leafy western suburbs of Islamabad on to the newly widened dual carriageway through the centre of the Pakistani capital .
Barely braking for the police checkpoints , they will converge on the National Assembly .
The two most powerful politicians in Pakistan - Nawaz Sharif , the head of the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) , and Asif Ali Zardari , the husband and successor of assassinated Benazir Bhutto as leader of her Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) - will either be burying President Pervez Musharraf or praising him .
If negotiations to secure an ' honourable exit from power ' for the military strongman have been successful , it will be the latter : speeches disingenuously praising his contribution over nine years of rule to the Pakistani people .
If not , it will be impeachment . '
Musharraf 's days in power are numbered , ' Ayaz Amir , a PML - N MP , said yesterday .
Makhtoum Shahabuddin , a former PPP minister and recently re - elected MP , agreed : ' He is batting on a very , very sticky wicket . '
What is certain is that the world will be watching the power struggle in Pakistan very closely indeed .
For the apparently imminent political demise of the President of Pakistan , the head of a nuclear - capable Islamic state of 170 million people , will have repercussions well beyond the humid corridors of Islamabad .
Last week violence flared up throughout Pakistan : suicide bombers struck in the east , hundreds died as the army launched new offensives against radical Muslim militants a hundred or so miles to the west , there were riots across the border in Indian Kashmir and bombs , and the customary rockets and battles in Afghanistan . '
It is clear that we are on the brink of a major change that goes well beyond the end of another cycle of civilian - military rule in Pakistan , ' said one Islamabad - based Western diplomat .
Each of the main players in the drama - Sharif , Zardari and Musharraf - represents a broader trend in society , and each viscerally detests the other two .
Whoever triumphs will set the nation 's course for the future .
The changes in Pakistan over the past decade are manifest .
This weekend tens of millions will be following events on the country 's scores of new local language television channels - predominantly Urdu , the national tongue , but in minority Sindhi , Punjabi and Pashto , too .
None existed a decade ago .
The vociferous and hugely popular talk shows have politicised swaths of the population . '
Once we could count on our name to get elected , ' said Masroor Ahmed Jatoi , a candidate in the February election , who hails from a major landowning family in the southern Sindh province . '
But not any longer .
People are demanding much more .
They are much less deferential . '
For those without televisions , the now ubiquitous ' one rupee a minute ' mobile phones will act as a secondary conduit of information .
In the growing cities - a recent study revealed that more than 50 per cent of Pakistanis now live in towns of more than 5,000 people - the effects of the long economic boom of the Musharraf years has broadened the middle classes . '
The guys who had a bicycle now have a motorbike , those who had a motorbike have a car , ' said one Karachi - based journalist . '
They worry about paying the rent , about losing their jobs , but they are better off none the less . '
The symbol of these new classes is the tiny hatchback , the 800cc £ 3,000 Suzuki Mehran , which pack the congested streets of the southern port city .
If Britain 's ' Mondeo Man ' determined political fortunes in the early 1990s , Pakistan 's ' Merhan Man ' - and , in this still deeply traditional society , the drivers are almost always male - will determine how Pakistan goes forward .
The irony is that Musharraf instigated the changes , such as the liberalisation of the media and the economy , that could lead to his downfall .
The 65-year - old general took power nine years ago in a bloodless coup , ousting Prime Minister Sharif , a wealthy industrialist from the relatively prosperous eastern province of Punjab , who came to power when Benazir Bhutto 's administration had been dismissed for incompetence and graft less than three years earlier .
The summer of 1999 had seen a series of corruption scandals breaking around Sharif and his family , a short , vicious and disastrous war with India in Kashmir , and an economy in freefall .
One by one Sharif and his cronies corrupted , co - opted , imprisoned , exiled or intimidated almost all who could act as constraints on their power : NGOs , the press , the judiciary , the religious establishment , the bureaucracy , Bhutto and her husband , Zardari .
But when Sharif attempted to replace Musharraf , the head of Pakistan 's immensely powerful military , he went too far .
As the general circled in a passenger jet above Karachi , forbidden to land and running out of fuel , loyal army commanders moved swiftly to secure the country . '
The Pakistani Army always has updated plans for a war in Kashmir , for an Indian invasion , and for taking control of government , ' one retired senior officer said recently . '
We just dusted off the right file and it was over in hours . '
Sharif was arrested , tried for treason and exiled to Saudi Arabia .
He made no secret of his desire for vengeance .
Eight years later it looks as if he will get it .
According to sources close to the negotiations , it is Sharif who is insisting on the harshest conditions for Musharraf 's potential exit this weekend .
But revenge had to wait .
The coup had broad domestic support and Musharraf found himself back in international favour after the 9/11 attacks when , after some deliberation , he pledged his support in the ' war on terror ' .
A flood of diplomatic , military and financial aid followed .
And until spring last year , Musharraf , not least thanks to a booming economy , seemed unassailable .
The threat to Musharraf came from two directions .
The first was from the Islamic militants .
Critics argue that the general is a ' closet Islamist ' , but this is unlikely : Musharraf is far from devout .
In his first interview as President , he proudly showed The Observer his pet spaniels - causing fury among religious hardliners , who see pet dogs as un - Islamic .
If he has manipulated militant groups , it is out of Realpolitik , not faith .
Indeed Musharraf is broadly representative of many old - school Pakistani army officers - and of an earlier generation of the Pakistani middle classes heavily influenced by the culture , language and ideas of their British former colonial masters .
The surge of militant violence during Musharraf 's rule was partly a result of the fall - out from the war on terror globally , with Pakistan caught in the surge of radicalism that has seized much of the Islamic world , although sheer incompetence also played a large part .
Demoralised soldiers or policemen were sent repeatedly against enemies they were ill - equipped to fight , in campaigns with little strategic direction or consistency .
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto , shortly after her return to Pakistan after an agreement with Musharraf , was merely the most spectacular of hundreds of bombings , shootings and clashes in a struggle that is now becoming a full - scale war .
In the past ten days nearly 500 people have died and 135,000 been displaced by fighting in the anarchic western borderlands .
For Musharraf , the rising tide of violence was a double blow .
Overseas , the President appeared incapable of fighting even Pakistani militants , let alone the Taliban or al - Qaeda , which had based itself in the country he supposedly governed .
American officials asked themselves if he really was the right man to be receiving billions of dollars of aid .
Domestically , the violence undermined the military 's claim that only they , not a civilian government , could ensure security .
Worse , it led to Musharraf being seen by everyone from peasants through to Mehran Man and Pakistan 's intellectual elite as an American stooge who , in the words of one angry army officer , sent ' good Pakistani Muslims to fight Washington 's wars against their own countrymen and co - religionists ' .
Here a second shift in Pakistan in recent years was important : the reassertion of a more confident and aggressive national and religious identity , which translates into a much less deferential attitude to the West .
From the clerks or the pharmacists or the small businessmen who are convinced that Israel , India and America are joining arms against the Muslim world to the wealthy elite who would rather holiday in Dubai , Malaysia or Saudi Arabia than in Europe or America , a new sense of Pakistan 's place in the world , and crucially among Islamic nations , has become clear .
Language as well as faith is important , even among the English - speaking educated class .
There is a new emphasis on local , not imported Anglophone , culture . '
For the first time , I am ashamed that my Urdu is not better , ' said top music producer and former pop star Rohil Hayatt .
The other threat to Musharraf came in the unlikely shape of Pakistan 's white - shirted , black - suited lawyers .
Their protest was sparked when the President moved to suspend the flamboyant Chief Justice last year - a big mistake .
Protests spread to the universities as , for the first time , Pakistan 's middle classes turned against the man they had once largely supported .
The ringtone ' Go Musharraf Go ' became one of the most popular in the country .
A manipulated election in October , a state of emergency in November and a continuing crackdown on the media brought reinforcements from journalists and intellectuals .
A new ' civil society ' movement appeared for the first time for decades . '
The lawyers set things going , but are not a political party , so could not reap the true rewards of their actions , ' said Professor Rasul Baksh Rais , constitutional expert at the Lahore University for Management Science .
For the moment , the two major Pakistani parties , the PPP and the PML - N , recognise the need for uniting against the common enemy .
But , given the changes in Pakistan , it seems likely that Sharif will be the long - term winner .
In the surprisingly free and fair general elections of February , his Muslim League , though split and unprepared , did well .
Particularly in the crucial Punjab province , it is the portly parvenu Sharif who best reflects the new and evolving values and aspirations of tens of millions of his compatriots . '
He has his finger on the popular pulse and the common man likes him , ' Khawaja Asif , a key aide , said .
On one side , there was the moderate , secular , charming , Westernised Bhutto and now her urbane , slick widower ; on the other , there is Sharif , whose English is hesitant , who likes folksy Punjabi cooking and ostentatious foreign watches , who is socially and religiously conservative without being extreme , who has more support in Riyadh than in Washington , who sees Dubai - not London - as a model of economic development , and whose identity fuses religion and a chauvinist nationalism .
There seems little doubt who reflects better the changing identity of Pakistan . '
The winner of this crisis will be the democratic process in this country , ' said Professor Rais . '
The culture , values and institutions have yet to be defined and refined , but the democratic process will win . '
And in a democracy the government reflects the culture , the attitude and the beliefs of the people .
They may not be those the West hoped to see .
The fate of past presidents Being the President of Pakistan has advantages - the sumptuous free lodgings , the helicopter , the power - and one major disadvantage : the slim chance of a gentle old age spent basking in the gratitude of those you have so selflessly served .
Iskander Mirza
A military coup ended the rule of Pakistan 's first President in 1958 , shortly after he himself had declared martial law .
He appointed Ayub Khan as the martial law administrator , in the process forfeiting his own political legitimacy .
Sent into exile to London , he died a decade later .
Yahya Khan
The Chief of the Army Staff was handed power by Ayub Khan in 1969 , but was forced out of office after the disastrous 1971 war that brought defeat by India and the independence of Bangladesh ( formerly East Pakistan ) .
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Benazir 's flamboyant father and leader of the Pakistan People 's Party was in turn handed the reins of power by Yahya Khan .
He ruled , latterly as Prime Minister after changing the constitution , for six years before being deposed by the army in 1977 .
He was hanged in Rawalpindi in April 1979 , having been found guilty of the murder of a political opponent .
General Zia ul - Haq
After 11 years in power , Zia , who led the coup against Bhutto , himself died in a mysterious air crash - along with several of his generals and the US ambassador , possibly caused by a grenade hidden in a crate of mangoes .
For the next decade , Presidents came and went , according to the twists and turns of democratic Pakistani politics , becoming the subject of derision and contempt when ousted .
General Pervez Musharraf
In 1999 the current President seized power .
He is hoping to spend a quiet retirement on his ranch in the hills behind Islamabad , saying he has no money to quit the country .
The fate of his various predecessors can not be encouraging ."
2008-08-18,"Two days after Pervez Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , a poll in Pakistan revealed 75 % of Pakistanis supported the military takeover .
The army chief had deposed the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , seen by many as running an inept and corrupt government .
Fast forward nine years
and the irony is inescapable .
Today it was the 65-year - old President Musharraf who resigned rather than face impeachment charges of incompetence and corruption .
Recent opinion polls put Nawaz Sharif as the country 's most popular politician .
In many ways it is an ignominious end for the military strongman .
Musharraf has never been burdened by immodesty , but he comes from humble roots .
His father was a lowly Indian bureaucrat in the British Raj .
Musharraf was born , the second of three sons , in Delhi in 1943 .
During the bloody partition of India , the family fled to Pakistan by train .
Musharraf 's father joined the country 's new foreign service and was posted to Turkey in 1949 , where his family spent seven years and his sons learned fluent Turkish .
Musharraf did not grow up in a particularly religious atmosphere .
Unlike many observant families he kept dogs , seen as un - Islamic on the subcontinent .
When the family returned to Pakistan he was sent to Christian schools , where he was clearly more interested in sports than studying .
In his 2006 autobiography Musharraf spoke of being a talented athlete : "" I was fourth in cross - country , was the top gymnast , and was third in the [ college ] bodybuilding competition "" .
His mother persuaded him to join the army – an institution that shaped his attitudes .
As a mohajir , an Urdu - speaking refugee from India , he was an outsider in a Punjabi - dominated army , but his talent did not go unnoticed and he rose steadily through the ranks .
This rapid ascent almost killed him : he was appointed as General Muhammad Zia - ul - Haq 's military secretary and on August 17 1988 would have been with Zia on his plane when it crashed .
However , his job had not been confirmed .
A decade later Musharraf seized power .
He presented a liberal image - that of a man who privately liked a tumbler of Scotch - and promised to end corruption , cleanse the country 's institutions and return Pakistan to democracy .
He refused Bill Clinton 's request for cooperation in US efforts to capture Osama Bin Laden .
But 9/11 changed all that .
Pakistan became a key ally in the war on terror .
Whether the Bush White House threatened to "" bomb Pakistan back to the Stone Age "" or not , Musharraf cracked down on terror groups , sending the army into lawless badlands on the Pakistan - Afghan border and halting jihadis from entering Indian Kashmir .
But the reluctant coup - maker always appeared unwilling to hand power back to the civilian politicians he loathed .
His unseating of the chief justice in 2007 was a typical piece of bravado .
His declaration of a state of emergency to confirm his own presidency was another sign of what a remarkably poor politician and domestic strategist he was .
There is no doubt that Musharraf remains fairly liberal - minded ; he acted bravely to combat Islamic extremists .
The 65-year - old has always gambled against the odds – and often won .
Repeated triumphs have fed the myth of his indispensability .
Today , all that came to an end ."
2008-08-18,"General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani Army chief Perceived as a close Musharraf ally when appointed last year , but pulled the army back from politics .
Expected to be courted by the US for its war on terror in the lawless border regions and by Pakistani politicians to ensure the army does not stage another coup .
Nawaz Sharif Leader , Pakistan Muslim League - N Leads Pakistan 's second - largest party , the Pakistan Muslim League - N , served as finance minister and chief minister under General Zia - ul - Haq during martial law .
Was deposed as prime minister by Musharraf in 1999 and has been tainted by charges of corruption .
Asif Zardari Husband of Benazir Bhutto , leader of Pakistan People 's Party Took over the leadership of the PPP after the assassination of his wife , Benazir Bhutto , last December .
He and Sharif plotted to impeach Musharraf .
Zardari was known as "" Mr 10 % "" in Bhutto 's first term as prime minister , because of bribery allegations , later as "" Mr 20 % "" .
Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry Chief justice Described by Musharraf as "" the scum of the Earth "" when the president tried to sack him in March last year .
Chaudhry repeatedly opposed Musharraf .
The supreme court rejected the deportation of Sharif .
The chief justice also took up cases of "" forced disappearances "" ."
2008-08-18,"Why did President Musharraf resign ?
Musharraf 's position has been in doubt since elections in February .
Asif Ali Zardari , husband of the late Benazir Bhutto who leads the Pakistan People 's party , and Nawaz Sharif , the head of the powerful Pakistan Muslim League - N who was ousted by Musharraf in 1999 , eventually agreed to impeach the president .
Already deeply unpopular , Musharraf faced a lengthy legal battle .
While disputing the charges , he resigned , saying he had put Pakistan first .
Did he have any allies ?
Too few to count .
The ruling coalition needed 295 votes out of 442 in a joint sitting of both houses of parliament to impeach the president .
A series of votes in provincial assemblies went against him and the army had long since washed its hands of him .
What are the roots of Musharraf 's troubles ?
The popular anger can be traced first back to December 2004 when Musharraf announced he was going back on his pledge to step down as army chief .
But it was his decision in March 2007 to suspend Pakistan 's supreme court chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , on allegations of misconduct that ignited a popular revolt .
What about the "" war on terror "" ?
The resignation means that the west has lost its most important ally ; Musharraf was widely seen as having attempted to rein in the terror groups in Pakistan - supporting the US in Afghanistan and pulling support from the Islamist jihad in Indian Kashmir .
Last July , after a week - long siege , Musharraf ordered troops to storm the Red Mosque in Islamabad to crush a Taliban - style movement .
At least 105 people were killed .
The United States says Pakistan 's leadership is a Pakistani matter but is worried about future cooperation .
Will the army stage another coup ?
Unlikely .
The army is hugely unpopular at home for fighting Washington 's "" war on terror "" and has also been accused of protecting the Taliban .
The army has lost an estimated 2,000 men fighting extremists in the tribal areas .
Where will Musharraf go ?
No one is sure .
Some suggest , not seriously , that he might return to Delhi , the place of his birth .
Others say he would prefer Turkey , a Muslim country with strong secular traditions where he spent much of his childhood .
Saudi Arabia , with a history of sheltering former dictators , would make him feel comfortable .
But Musharraf 's allies say he will stay put - perhaps in his luxurious bungalow being built in Islamabad .
Who will be the next president ?
The president is elected by the four provincial assemblies and the national parliament .
Many think the role might be reduced to a ceremonial one .
If it retained the substantial powers , Asif Ali Zardari might want it .
Zardari has hinted the next president might be a woman .
Analysts have speculated that an ethnic Pashtun leader , Asfandayr Wali Khan , is a frontrunner because he is liberal and a sign of national unity ."
2008-08-18,"Two days after Pervez Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , a poll in Pakistan revealed that 75 % of Pakistanis supported the military takeover .
The army chief had deposed the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , seen by many as running an inept and corrupt government .
Fast forward nine years
and the irony is inescapable .
Yesterday it was the 65-year - old President Musharraf who resigned rather than face impeachment charges of incompetence and corruption .
Recent opinion polls put Sharif as the country 's most popular politician .
In many ways it is an ignominious end for the military strongman .
Musharraf has never been burdened by immodesty , but he comes from humble roots .
His father was a lowly Indian bureaucrat in the British Raj .
Pervez was born , the second of three sons , in Delhi in 1943 .
During the bloody partition of India , the family fled to Pakistan .
Pervez 's father joined the country 's new foreign service - posted to Turkey in 1949 , where his family spent seven years , and where his sons learned fluent Turkish .
Musharraf did not grow up in a particularly religious atmosphere .
Unlike many observant families he kept dogs - which are seen as un - Islamic on the subcontinent .
Back in Pakistan his mother persuaded him to join the army - an institution that shaped his attitudes .
As a mohajir , an Urdu - speaking refugee from India , he was an outsider in a Punjabi - dominated army but his talent did not go unnoticed and he rose steadily through the ranks .
The rapid ascent almost killed him : he was supposed to be General Zia - ul - Haq 's military secretary in August 1988 and would have been blown up when Zia 's plane crashed .
However his job had not been confirmed .
Just a decade later Musharraf seized power .
He presented a liberal image , that of a man who privately liked a tumbler of scotch .
He promised to end corruption and clean out the country 's institutions .
General Musharraf said he wanted a return to democracy .
He also refused Bill Clinton 's request to cooperate in American attempts to capture Osama bin Laden .
However 9/11 changed all that .
Pakistan became a key ally in the war on terror .
Whether the Bush White House threatened to "" bomb Pakistan back to the Stone Age "" or not , Musharraf cracked down on terror groups , he sent the army into lawless badlands on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
He stopped sending jihadis into Indian Kashmir .
But the reluctant coup - maker always appeared unwilling to hand power back to the civilian politicians he loathed .
His unseating of the chief justice in 2007 was a typical piece of bravado .
His declaration of a state of emergency to confirm his own presidency was another sign of how a remarkably poor politician and domestic strategist he was .
There 's no doubt Musharraf remains fairly liberal - minded .
He has acted bravely to combat Islamic extremists .
Repeated triumphs have fed the myth of his indispensability .
Yesterday all that came to an end ."
2008-08-19,"Post - Musharraf Pakistan got off to an inauspicious start yesterday , after a meeting of the coalition government resulted in deadlock over the key issue of the judiciary , and Taliban militants demonstrated that their violent campaign would continue with a suicide bombing that killed at least 27 .
Pervez Musharraf resigned as Pakistan 's president on Monday in order to avoid impeachment following a series of crises , starting with the sacking in March 2007 of the country 's chief justice .
The two main parties in the coalition government , Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N and the Pakistan People 's Party , could not agree on reinstating judges fired by Musharraf in November .
Sharif has made the restoration of the judiciary a central pillar of his policy .
The People 's Party had previously said it was Musharraf who was preventing the judges ' reinstatement and Sharif 's party had pledged that it would happen "" immediately "" after the president was gone .
But it is understood the two sides are at odds over the deposed chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , an activist judge when in office who held the executive to account .
Many believe that Asif Zardari , the leader of the Pakistan People 's party , is wary of having Chaudhry standing in judgment over his administration . ""
The coalition has to address the issues and get on with it , "" said Talat Masood , a retired general who is now a political analyst .
"" With the disagreements , first on the president and then on the judges , they are making fools of themselves . ""
The judges ' controversy has poisoned relations between the two main parties for months , with at least two deadlines for their restoration missed .
Yesterday , the coalition said a further 72-hours was required , providing a new deadline of Friday .
"" We wanted to see it happen within 24 hours , "" said Ahsan Iqbal , a leader of Sharif 's party .
"" Some of our partners had reservations over timing .
I 'm very hopeful .
The country can not afford break - up of the coalition . ""
The popular lawyers ' movement , which has campaigned for the judges , said it "" would not be very patient "" .
A suicide bombing outside the emergency ward of a hospital in Dera Ismail Khan , a town in the troubled North West Frontier province , killed at least 27 people , including two police officers , and injured 35 .
Pakistan 's Taliban movement claimed responsibility , saying that military operations against them must stop .
"" What we are seeing is no change in the Pakistan government policies after Musharraf , "" said a Taliban spokesman , Maulvi Umar .
"" We want the government to change its policies . ""
Meanwhile , Pakistan 's army chief flew to Kabul to see Afghan and Nato commanders in a move that could improve strained military relations .
Gen Ashfaq Kayani attended a meeting of the Tripartite Commission , which is supposed to meet every six months but has not come together for over a year .
Afghan officials have openly accused sections of Pakistan 's military of backing the Taliban and being behind the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in July , allegations supported by the US .
A statement from the Pakistan army said the meeting "" showed satisfaction at the existing level of cooperation "" ."
2008-08-21,"Pakistan 's ruling coalition is in danger of unravelling over whether to reinstate judges who were dismissed by the former president , Pervez Musharraf .
The coalition 's second - biggest party , the Muslim League - N , led by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , has threatened to leave the alliance unless a decision is taken by tomorrow to reappoint the supreme court judges removed last year .
The Pakistani stock market has started to see share prices fall after making initial gains when Musharraf quit .
There is nervousness that divisions among Pakistani leaders will distract the government from tackling severe economic problems and rising Islamist extremism .
In the latest violence , police said two suicide bombers killed at least 15 people and wounded 50 at a government arms factory near the capital , Islamabad .
A local police chief , Nasir Durrani , said that the bombers blew themselves up outside different gates of the complex in the town of Wah , about 20 miles west of the capital .
Sharif told the Wall Street Journal that the sacking of the judges had shaken the foundations of the country and it was necessary to restore them to their jobs .
"" We will not try to bring the government down , "" Sharif said in remarks published today .
"" But , of course , we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition . ""
The reinstatement of the supreme court judges has been a contentious issue between the Muslim League - N and its coalition partner , the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) led by Asif Ali Zardari , the widow of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
The PPP is reluctant to restore the judges as it fears the deposed chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , might challenge an amnesty on corruption charges granted to Zardari and other PPP leaders last year .
The two parties are also at loggerheads over who should become president to replace Musharraf , who resigned last week when the coalition threatened to impeach him .
The PPP has put forward Zardari , but Sharif 's party says it wants the next president to come from one of Pakistan 's smaller provinces and for the nomination to be a "" consensus candidate "" .
With Musharraf 's resignation , it was always on the cards that the makeshift coalition would start bickering .
The PPP and Muslim League - N have a long history of rivalry – Bhutto and Sharif
both served two terms as prime minister in the 1990s .
The departure of Sharif 's party from the coalition would not necessarily force an election as the PPP , the biggest party in parliament , should be able to muster enough support to remain in government .
In any case , the PPP would be nervous of new elections because Sharif has won popular support for his stand on the judges .
Sharif told the newspaper that Zardari had assured him the judges would be reinstated within 24 hours of Musharraf 's impeachment . ""
We supported him on impeachment .
It 's now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges . """
2008-08-24,"Asif Zardari , the controversial widower of the slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , will this week file his nomination papers to become Pakistan 's next president , pushing the fragile coalition government further towards collapse .
He is almost certain to be the next incumbent of the presidential palace in Islamabad , as his Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) has the required votes in parliament to get him elected , replacing Pervez Musharraf , who was ousted last week and who had kept Zardari in prison for years .
Nawaz Sharif , leader of the other major party in the coalition , is furious that he was not consulted over Zardari 's bid for the presidency .
Sharif has also given the PPP until today to reinstate the judges sacked by Musharraf last November , the fourth such deadline set .
He has warned that he is ready to walk out of the coalition .
As president , Zardari , who became known as Mr Ten Percent for his alleged corruption when his wife was twice prime minister , would enjoy a strong measure of protection from prosecution on any of the dozens of criminal charges made against him over the years .
He is alleged to have bought a £ 4.4 m country estate in Surrey with ill - gotten gains , and of having siphoned off $ 1.5bn ( £ 750 m ) from Pakistan while Bhutto was in office .
He was also accused in two murder cases , including the killing of Bhutto 's brother Murtaza in 1996 .
Zardari has never been convicted on any of these charges and maintains that all the allegations were politically motivated . ""
Zardari is a controversial leader , "" said Hasan Askari Rizvi , a political analyst in Lahore .
"" A president in a parliamentary system should be someone above day - to - day politics .
With him , controversies will continue around the presidency . ""
Under Pakistan 's constitution , the president is supposed to be a figurehead , with the prime minister - Yousaf Raza
Gilani - in charge of running the government .
However , as party boss and president , Zardari will be all - powerful . ""
He will overshadow the prime minister , "" said Rizvi .
Zardari spent 11 years in jail in Pakistan , in two stints , then went into exile in New York in 2004 .
Before his wife 's assassination in December last year he held no party position and was deeply unpopular within the PPP and the country .
He flew back to bury her and immediately established an iron grip on the party , winning plaudits for keeping it united .
Since elections in February , he has manoeuvred the party into all the important positions of power , despite it not having a majority in parliament .
While political in - fighting rages in Islamabad , extremists continue to carry out suicide bomb attacks and occupy the tribal border area with Afghanistan .
An editorial yesterday in The News , a Pakistan daily , pleaded : "" Politicians need to realise that with each day that passes people who face bomb blasts , crippling inflation and a general sense of despair , grow more distant from their government . """
2008-08-25,"Pakistan 's coalition government collapsed yesterday when one of its leading members stormed out , dealing a heavy blow to hopes for political stability following Pervez Musharraf 's resignation as president .
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N said it was joining the opposition , blaming its coalition partner , the Pakistan People 's Party , for failing to reinstate judges fired by Musharraf last November , and for disagreements over who should succeed Musharraf as president .
"" We therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches , "" Sharif told a news conference .
Islamabad now appears poised for renewed political convulsions rather than the unity required to take on the violent challenge from Islamic extremists based in its North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) and the tribal territory that borders Afghanistan .
The ousting of Musharraf as president just a week ago , meant to end the intrigue , only succeeded in pushing the political crisis into a new phase .
That will dismay Pakistan 's western partners , who want the government to tackle the Taliban - inspired militancy in the tribal area , which is a base for the insurgency in Afghanistan . ""
While there is not a stable government in Islamabad , then the law and order situation in NWFP and [ the federally administered tribal areas ] FATA will not be solved , "" warned Asfandyar Wali Khan , leader of the party that runs the provincial government of NWFP .
"" Saving lives should be the first issue , then we can look at the judges . ""
Sharif 's defection means the PPP is now reliant on the support of new partners , including the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , MQM , a party that was close to Musharraf .
Sharif also announced he will put up his own candidate for president , to challenge the Pakistan People 's Party 's chairman Asif Zardari , Benazir Bhutto 's widower .
Saeed - uz - Zaman Siddiqui , a supreme court judge who retired in 2002 , will be Sharif 's candidate .
At the press conference in Islamabad , a bitter Sharif brandished an agreement forged with the PPP , promising the restoration of the judiciary within 24 hours of Musharraf 's departure .
Sharif made the cause the centre - point of his politics , but the coalition missed three deadlines .
The deal , said Sharif , also included having a non - partisan new president , until the powers of the presidency were reduced .
Sharif and the Pakistan People 's Party were vicious rivals in the 1990s , alternating in power until the military coup in 1999 - led by then army chief General Musharraf , who described the period as the "" dreadful decade of democracy "" .
The power struggle between the two parties , now revived , is likely to be first felt over the provincial government of the Punjab , currently held by Mr Sharif 's party .
"" Are we now a laughing stock for those who did n't want democracy in Pakistan ?
For them , it 's a victory , but we 're both losers , "" said a PPP member of parliament , Fauzia Wahab . ""
By fighting each other , you are actually defeating democracy . ""
Sharif 's non - party candidate for president could be a masterstroke .
While Siddiqui is highly unlikely to defeat Zardari , he could certainly embarrass him .
The terrorist challenge was underlined yesterday with a rocket - and - bomb attack on the home of a provincial member of parliament in Swat , part of NWFP .
The politician escaped , but his brother , two nephews and five guards were killed .
Pakistan also belatedly banned the main insurgent group , the Tehreek - e - Taliban , signalling that hopes of holding dialogue with the militants had evaporated ."
2008-09-02,"Pakistani prosecutors today said they would press ahead with corruption charges against Nawaz Sharif , the former prime minister , who recently broke with the ruling coalition .
Zulfiqar Ahmed Bhutta , a leading prosecutor with the national accountability bureau , confirmed it moved late last month to challenge a court decision to indefinitely adjourn charges against Sharif , the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - N.
The accusations against Sharif include money laundering , loan defaults and the accumulation of wealth beyond his known sources of income .
Sharif 's lawyer , Khwaja Haris , said the charges were politically motivated .
"" It appears to be aimed at using the accountability courts against Nawaz Sharif , "" Haris said .
"" It appears to be used for political ends . ""
The move against Sharif came a few days ahead of a parliamentary vote for a new president to succeed the disgraced Pervez Musharraf , a longtime US ally who resigned last month ahead of opposition moves to impeach him .
Asif Ali Zardari , the head of the main ruling party and widower of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto , is expected to easily win the vote on Saturday .
Sharif 's party is fielding a retired judge as its candidate .
It would mark a remarkable turn of events as Zardari has no elected position and was best known as Bhutto 's husband .
When Bhutto was prime minister , Zardari was known as Mr 10 % because of the corruption allegations that swirled around him .
Zardari took over the leadership of the Pakistan People 's party after his wife 's assassination in December .
The PPP and Sharif 's party formed a ruling coalition after winning February 's parliamentary elections .
The coalition fell apart after Musharraf 's resignation over the issue of whether to reinstate the supreme court judges that he had sacked .
Sharif wanted them reappointed , but Zardari did not amid , fearing they would reopen corruption investigations .
Sharif has predicted the PPP - led government will not last long , saying its leaders are fast losing the trust of the people .
In an interview with the Gulf News , Sharif said the government , formed in March , might not complete its five - year tenure if its leaders continued "" breaking promises and ignoring public issues "" .
Ruling out any possibility of rejoining the coalition despite requests from the PPP , Sharif said : "" We have crossed that point and we do n't want to enter the ruling coalition again . ""
As for Saturday 's vote , Sharif said he would not withdraw the PML - N 's candidate , the former supreme court chief justice Saeed - uz - Zaman Siddiqui , who is running against Zardari . ""
Let us wait for polling day on September 6 as it is premature to say who will win , "" he said when asked if he saw Zardari as the next president ."
2008-10-06,"At least 12 people died and an opposition MP was wounded along with more than 30 others when a suspected suicide bomber targeted the politician 's house in a prosperous province of Pakistan .
The explosion happened in the town of Bhakkar in Punjab province at the home of opposition MP Rasheed Akbar Niwani , who is a member of the minority Shia Muslim community .
He is also a member of the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif 's party . ""
The bomber blew himself up the courtyard when Mr Nawani was sitting with his supporters there , "" Khadim Hussain , a police officer , told Reuters .
Nawani has spoken out in parliament several times recently against growing sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia .
"" It could be a sectarian - related attack as he belongs to the Shia community , "" said Khan Baig , a senior police officer in the region .
Ehsanul Haq , a medical official at the district hospital in Bhakkar , told the Associated Press that so far , four bodies had been brought in , and that of 35 wounded people , a dozen were seriously hurt .
According to Reuters , at least 12 people died in the blast .
An eyewitness described a smoky , dusty and gory scene .
Punjab , in eastern Pakistan , has largely been spared the militant - led violence that has gripped the nation 's north - west .
However , Pakistan has experienced a wave of violence in recent weeks , just as the military has stepped up operations in the north - west and the US has stepped up cross - border strikes ."
2008-10-08,"Pakistan 's parliament was given a confidential briefing by the army yesterday in an attempt to forge a consensus on a "" homegrown "" anti - terror policy for the first time .
The unprecedented briefing , by the new military spy chief , was a response to the widespread view that Pakistan is fighting "" America 's war "" , and it provided an opportunity for MPs to take control of national security for the first time .
But analysts said there was little chance of agreement , with the Islamist groups and Nawaz Sharif 's party , the main opposition group , believing that Pakistani interests were not being pursued .
According to reports emerging last night about the briefing , the head of the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency , Lieutenant - General Ahmad Shujaa Pasha , admitted that past peace deals with militant groups had failed .
He also told MPs that internal military operations were necessary , and said the army 's current deployment in Bajaur , on the border with Afghanistan , had killed more than 1,000 militants . ""
The briefing was rather superficial , more symptoms than diagnosis of a disease , "" said Khurram Dastagir , a parliamentarian from Sharif 's party .
"" But the fact that the briefing took place sets an excellent precedent for civilian supremacy . ""
For years , Pakistan 's security policy and approach to Afghanistan was decided essentially by the military , with little or no debate in parliament .
Critics say that led to the ISI and other parts of the army backing the Taliban in Afghanistan and extremist groups based in Pakistan , to fight proxy wars in Afghanistan and India . ""
No matter what happens , Islamist groups will not be brought into a consensus , "" said Hasan Askari Rizvi , a political analyst in Lahore .
"" Sharif 's stand is ambiguous .
His problem is that his support overlaps with the religious parties . ""
This week , Qazi Hussain Ahmed , the leader of a major religious party , Jamaat - i - Islami , described the anti - terror fight as a "" capitalist US and Indian conspiracy "" .
Even Asfandyar Wali Khan , leader of the secular Awami National party , which heads the regional government in militancy - plagued North West Frontier Province , said that "" it is not our war . """
2009-02-26,"Opposition supporters in Pakistan torched cars and stoned buildings today as thousands joined in a growing protest over the barring of two of their leaders from elected office .
Yesterday 's supreme court ruling that Nawaz Sharif , a former prime minister , could not stand for parliament due to an old criminal conviction , and its disqualification of his brother , Shahbaz Sharif , who was head of the provincial government in Punjab , prompted hundreds of the prime minister 's supporters to gather in Rawalpindi chanting slogans against the government .
While most demonstrators were peaceful , witnesses said some set up barricades of burning tyres and used rocks to smash the windows of stores and banks on a main shopping street .
A mob also torched four vehicles on the highway linking Islamabad to the Punjab , police said .
The supreme court rulings prevent Nawaz Sharif from challenging the president of Pakistan , Asif Ali Zardari , in general elections in 2013 and have forced his brother to immediately leave his job as Punjab 's chief minister .
The decisions promise an all - out confrontation between Nawaz Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League and the government , and threaten to paralyse governance just as Islamabad is coming under pressure from the west to act against militants .
Sharif told a rally of several thousand supporters near Lahore , the capital of Punjab province , that the people rejected the "" bogus "" court ruling , for which he said Zardari was responsible , Reuters reported .
"" The decisions of the masses have always been trampled either by judges or dictators , "" Sharif said .
"" Today the decision of the people has to be accepted …
we 'll see who dares defy this decision of the people . ""
About 20 MPs from Sharif 's party had been herded into police trucks as they gathered at the Punjab assembly in the city .
Police let them clamber out as the crowd swelled with supporters , who swarmed past barriers , banged on the wooden doors of the assembly building and held a mock parliamentary session on the steps . ""
He has triggered a war which he ca n't control , "" Rana Ijaz Ahmed Khan , of Sharif 's party , told the crowd , in reference to Zardari .
"" We 've accepted it as a challenge and will teach power - hungry Zardari a lesson . ""
Police fired teargas to disperse a crowd that torched cars on the outskirts of the city , according to Reuters ."
2009-02-26,"Pakistan was plunged into fresh turmoil yesterday after the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif was disqualified from office , provoking a political crisis even as the country struggles to challenge Islamist extremism .
The supreme court ruling against Sharif promises an all - out confrontation between his party and the government in Islamabad , which he blamed for the verdict , and threatens to paralyse governance just as Islamabad is coming under pressure from the west to act against militants .
Angry demonstrations broke out across Punjab province , which had been ruled by Sharif 's party , with tyres set ablaze and posters of President Asif Zardari torn down and burned .
The stock market fell by 5 % as investors panicked at the political instability that will now follow .
Analysts said that conflict between Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League and Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party threatened the country 's fragile democracy by replaying the 1990s , when the two parties repeatedly toppled each other 's governments , culminating in a coup in 1999 .
"" The future of democracy will be in serious question , "" said Hasan Askari Rizvi , a political analyst in Lahore .
"" The [ Islamabad ] government will find it difficult to cope with governance because political survival will be the main consideration for them . ""
The supreme court ruled that Sharif , a former prime minister , could not stand for parliament as a result of an old criminal conviction .
It also disqualified his brother , Shahbaz , who was head of the provincial government in Punjab , Pakistan 's richest and most populous province , forcing him to immediately quit the job . ""
The nation should rise against this unconstitutional decision , "" Sharif told reporters in Lahore .
"" People can work out for themselves whether this was the judges ' decision or Zardari 's . ""
Zardari , who suffers from derisory personal popularity ratings in the polls , immediately imposed emergency rule in Punjab for two months .
Zardari 's party will now try to garner enough support in the Punjab provincial parliament to form its own government there ."
2009-03-06,"Recently , a top US diplomat warned that Pakistan poses a bigger security threat to the world than Afghanistan .
This ominous statement tracks a series of alarming developments : the surreal video of twelve gunmen brazenly attacking the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore 's broad daylight ; Pakistan 's capitulation to the Taliban on implementing sharia law in the Swat Valley ; several days of riots after the Supreme Court banned popular opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and his brother from holding office ; evidence directly linking Pakistani terrorist groups to November 's Mumbai tragedy ; a significant increase in suicide bombings within Pakistan ; and , of course , the rapid Talibanisation of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) – a Grand Central Station for multicultural extremists seeking training , support and safe haven .
Although Barack Obama 's initial language , tone and action towards Pakistan reflected a unilateral belligerence reminiscent of his predecessor ( he 'd launched two controversial predator drone attacks as of March ) , the new president recently conceded : "" We 've been thinking very militarily , but we have n't been as effective in thinking diplomatically –
we have n't been thinking effectively around the development side of the equation .
"" In fact , neither the leaders of the US nor Pakistan have ever sincerely committed their resources and money to empowering Pakistan 's electorate , building infrastructure or creating sustainable social , economic and political reform programmes .
California senator Dianne Feinstein 's recent disclosure regarding CIA predator drones does n't bolster Pakistanis ' confidence in their ineffectual leadership – despite the government 's assurance to citizens that it will never compromise its "" sovereignty "" .
Feinstein revealed the painfully obvious : the unmanned CIA predator aircraft responsible for successfully eliminating 11 to 20 high - profile threats – as well as killing hundreds of innocent Pakistani civilians – were flown from Pakistani air bases .
A prominent Pakistani attorney and activist told me last year that the prevailing attitude among Pakistanis is that their government is either a complete ghulam ( servant ) of the US or a toothless , complicit partner , since "" the road to Islamabad leads to the White House "" .
That "" road "" was paved by the CIA and Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence during the 1980s as the US funded and supported the dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq , whose "" Islamisation "" period nurtured the proliferation of radical Islamic madrassas and trained the mujahideen soldiers – future Taliban and al - Qaida members – to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
Insisting on supporting military dictators to the detriment of Pakistan 's democratically inclined electorate , the Bush administration championed General Pervez Musharraf , who spearheaded freedom and democracy by imposing martial law , sacking a critical and independent judiciary , arresting activists and lawyers and shutting down private television stations .
He was rewarded with nearly $ 12bn as an ally in the "" war on terror "" .
According to Ahmed Rashid in his book Descent into Chaos , the ISI played Jekyll and Hyde as it spent some of these resources providing valuable intelligence , while covertly supporting the Taliban as a buffer between Pakistan and India – which they believe uses Afghanistan to gain "" strategic depth "" and fund Balochi insurgents to undermine Pakistan .
Musharraf 's India obsession also gave deferential , protective treatment to terrorist organizations such as Lashkar - e - Taiba – which initially fought for the nationalist , political struggle in Kashmir , but then flourished into a full - fledged , ideological militant jihad responsible in part for the Mumbai tragedy .
The bargain myopically forged by the US and Pakistan in training radicalised militias to fight as their proxies spawned a terrible monster that has effectively escaped from the laboratory , set it on fire and then evolved into a multi - headed hydra chasing its own creators .
FATA now serves as a haven for international jihadists of all stripes .
The Taliban are no longer a homogenous group , as they have splintered operationally into the "" Afghan Taliban "" and "" Pakistan Taliban "" , which in turn have divergent movements .
For example , Jalaluddin Haqqani 's Taliban and Mullah Omar exhort limiting jihad against US and Nato forces in Afghanistan and criticize those who commit acts of terrorism on Pakistan , as they are "" bringing a bad name to mujahideen , "" according to Omar .
However , Baitullah Mehsud 's group , which is indigenous to Pakistan , openly perpetrates attacks on the Pakistani government and its security forces .
As Brookings scholar Stephen Cohen told me , "" the root problem is that Pakistan is unable to exercise sovereign control over its own territory in FATA . ""
If the Obama administration is sincere about changing America 's egregiously short - sighted Pakistan policy and truly embracing the tools of diplomacy , then it requires a dedicated partnership with Pakistan 's military and leadership .
Too bad that leadership has been equally self - serving , callous and foolish in its policy initiatives and cynical alliances .
Only by mutually endorsing a long - term vision that gradually invites those operating in FATA – including some of the radical elements – to join a committed programme of political reform , economic aid , social welfare and educational development can the US and Pakistan hope to satiate , tame and ultimately pacify the unleashed beast forged by their own hands ."
2009-03-11,"The crisis engulfing Pakistan deepened today after the government issued orders for opposition leaders , including Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif , to be placed under house arrest ahead of planned rallies against the ruling administration .
Hundreds of lawyers and opposition activists have been arrested today and , according to reports on Pakistani television , orders have been issued for the detention of Sharif , the head of the Pakistan Muslim League N party ( PML - N ) , his brother Shabhaz Sharif , Qazi Hussain Ahmed , the Jamat - e - Islami leader , and Imran Khan , the former Pakistan cricket captain who is the head of Tehreek - e - Insaf .
Many opposition leaders are said to have gone into hiding .
Pakistani lawyers , supported by opposition leaders , are due to begin a protest tomorrow dubbed the long march to demand the restoration of judges removed from office by the former president Pervez Musharraf .
President Asif Ali Zardari , husband of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , has failed to fulfil a pledge to restore the justices since being elected last year .
The clampdown will increase fears for the stability of the country as the government struggles to contain violent extremists .
Six Pakistani policemen and a bus driver were killed , and six Sri Lankan cricketers and two team officials wounded last week when heavily armed men attacked a bus carrying the visiting team to the venue for the second Test against Pakistan .
Rao Iftikhar , the home secretary in eastern Punjab province , said he issued orders for a ban on public gatherings there "" so that terrorists can not take any advantage by targeting political gatherings "" .
The ban , which gives authorities the right to arrest any protesters , will remain in force for three months , he said .
The Sindh province home secretary , Arif Ahmed Khan , announced a 15-day ban on public gatherings today to "" prevent a bad law - and - order situation "" .
Sindh is the main stronghold of the ruling PPP .
But opposition activists have vowed to press on with the planned long march , which will see protesters gather in cities around the country tomorrow before leaving for the capital , Islamabad .
They have vowed to stage a sit - in at the parliament building until the judiciary is restored .
Addressing thousands of supporters at a rally in the North West Frontier Province , Sharif said : "" I can not rest when Pakistan is being taken toward disastrous circumstances .
We can not compromise when all institutions are ruined and the system is on the verge of collapse . ""
Last week 's attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team came amid protests following a court ruling banning the former minister Sharif and his brother , who was the chief minister of Punjab , from political office .
In August last year Sharif pulled his party out of a coalition with Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) , because of the failure to restore the judiciary .
His supporters saw the latest court ruling as a political move engineered by Zardari .
A spokesman for Sharif 's party , Sadiqul Farooq , said he received reports from party offices across the country that members were being arrested , but he had no accurate numbers .
Munawar Hassan , a Jamaat - e - Islami leader , said : "" Nearly two dozen of our supporters have been detained . ""
Farhatullah Babar , a spokesman for Zardari , said 18 people had been arrested and would be released once the situation calmed down .
"" Some people have announced they are going to defy the ban on public meetings , "" he said .
"" It is sad , but this is what the law says . ""
In the Punjabi city of Multan the senior police officer , Fayyaz Ahmad , said 42 Sharif supporters were arrested and "" would be dealt with according to the law "" ."
2009-03-12,"Nawaz Sharif , the Pakistani opposition leader , has accused the government of running an "" elected dictatorship "" that is plotting to kill him .
As a countrywide crackdown was launched against political activists , Sharif , a former prime minister , told the Guardian in an interview that Asif Ali Zardari , the president , was ruling under a cloak of democracy but his policies would only benefit extremist elements .
Pakistan is struggling with an onslaught by homegrown Islamist militants that has left hundreds dead , and the government is fighting to shore up a collapsing economy .
But these battles appear to have been sidelined by a confrontation between the two big political parties , Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N and Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party .
Sharif was speaking as the government arrested hundreds of political activists , lawyers and human rights campaigners before a planned mass opposition rally this week .
Public gatherings of more than four people were banned in Punjab and Sindh , two of Pakistan 's four provinces .
Police raided the house of Imran Khan , the leader of the Tehreek - e - Insaaf party and former Pakistan cricket captain .
"" I have recently received certain information from own sources , credible sources , about certain forces who are active against me , "" Sharif said yesterday as he was being driven in an armour - plated Mercedes to a political rally .
"" Threats to my life come from high - ranking government officials , certain topmost people in the government , my sources say .
"" He declined to give further details .
It is understood his party has yet to decide how to respond . ""
The risks are there .
I ca n't abandon my mission because of the risks .
It 's a very noble cause .
A mission to put the country back on the road to democracy , "" he said .
Last month Zardari dismissed the ­government in Punjab province , which had been run by Sharif 's PML - N. Elections in February 2008 , after eight years of military rule under Pervez M­usharraf , brought to power an elected government .
But Zardari has failed to reinstate Iftikhar Chaudhry , the chief justice , who was removed in 2007 by Musharraf .
Zardari 's aides say Chaudhry is too politicised and Sharif is exploiting the issue .
"" Sometimes we [ Pakistanis ] are caught up in military dictatorships .
Now we are caught up in a democratic dictatorship , "" said Sharif .
"" In the garb of democracy we are , frankly , under dictatorial rule . ""
His party was briefly in coalition with Zardari last year before Sharif stormed out over the issue of the judiciary .
But it was Zardari 's move against the Punjab ­administration that pushed Sharif from critic to enemy .
The province is now run by Zardari under emergency rule .
"" Our mandate [ in Punjab ] has been trampled .
He [ Zardari ] does n't show respect to other parties ' mandate .
It is the worst form of dictatorship , "" said Sharif .
"" He does n't allow the judiciary to become independent because of his own vested interest .
This is what dictatorship is all about . ""
Western governments , led by the UK and US , have tried to broker a truce between Zardari and Sharif .
There are fears that if serious civil unrest follows , the army could step in .
There were further ­diplomatic moves yesterday with Robert Brinkley , the British high commissioner , meeting Yousaf Raza Gilani , the prime minister , while Anne Patterson , the US ambassador , met Rehman Malik , the interior ministry chief . ""
Only a democratic Pakistan can get rid of extremism .
Therefore we 've got to put more and more emphasis on ­strengthening democracy , because that 's the only answer , "" said Sharif .
"" Rather than fighting extremism , we [ political leaders ] are fighting each other . ""
Farhatullah Babar , Zardari 's spokesman , dismissed Sharif 's allegations of a plot to kill him as "" political mileage "" .
"" This is outlandish , "" said Babar .
"" The government is providing him [ Sharif ] protection so that the militants do n't take advantage of the situation . ""
A "" long march "" protest was planned by a coalition of parties , led by Sharif 's party , and pro - judiciary groups , starting today .
The campaign wants the government to restore Chaudhry and appoint other independent judges .
The issue of judicial independence has turned into the most incendiary political debate in Pakistan .
­Setting out from all corners of the country , the protesters aim to converge on Islamabad on 16 March .
But the government moved to cut it off yesterday .
Many activists have gone into hiding for now , promising , though , that the march will proceed , a situation that could lead in the next few days to clashes between demonstrators and the authorities .
Paramilitary troops were put on standby .
In Punjab , about 300 political activists were arrested under a colonial - era law that allows for six months ' imprisonment .
Sherry Rehman , the information minister , blamed Sharif for provoking the clampdown by calling for civil disobedience and refusing to negotiate with Islamabad . ""
Had the PML - N and the rightwing rump of the former lawyers ' movement decided to hold a peaceful rally , the government would have facilitated it , as it has done in the past , "" Rehman said .
"" But Pakistan 's constitutional and democratically elected government can not allow the rule of law to be replaced by the law of the jungle . ""
In a reminder of the extremist menace , Bashir Bilour , a minister in the North - West Frontier province government , escaped an assassination attempt yesterday when a gunman opened fire , wounding two passersby .
The attacker later blew himself up , killing at least three other people .
Image change The image of Nawaz Sharif as a politician has been transformed from conservative and pro - establishment to a self - styled champion of democracy and harsh critic of the army .
Detractors who remember his second stint as prime minister , from 1997 to 1999 , say he showed an authoritarian streak , and religious fundamentalist inclinations .
His supporters even attacked the supreme court , the very institution that he now campaigns for .
His supporters say eight years of exile , first in Saudi Arabia , then Britain , have produced a wiser , more mature politician .
The west now seems more comfortable with Sharif even though , unlike the ruling Pakistan People 's party , he has never gone as far as claiming the "" war on terror "" as "" Pakistan 's war "" ."
2009-03-12,"The Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has accused the country 's government of running an "" elected dictatorship "" that is plotting to kill him .
As a nationwide crackdown on political activists continued todaywith dozens more arrests , Sharif , a former prime minister , told the Guardian that the president , Asif Ali Zardari , was ruling under a cloak of democracy but his policies would only benefit extremist elements .
Pakistan is struggling with an onslaught by domestic Islamist militants that has left hundreds dead , and the government is fighting to shore up a collapsing economy .
But these battles appear to have been sidelined by a confrontation between the two big political parties , Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - N and Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party .
Sharif was speaking as the government arrested hundreds of political activists , lawyers and human rights campaigners before a planned mass opposition rally .
There were scuffles , baton charges and arrests outside the high court buildings in the southern city of Karachi today , with a draconian colonial - era law used to suppress dissent .
A "" long march "" , setting out from Karachi and other southern cities and making its way north to Multan , Lahore , was due to begin today , culminating in a sit - in in Islamabad on Monday .
There were also gatherings in Quetta , in the south - west , today , and lawyers were due to hold a demonstration in Lahore .
The protesters are demanding an independent judiciary .
Many activists have gone into hiding but pledged that the march would go ahead – a situation that could lead to clashes between demonstrators and the authorities in the next few days .
Paramilitary troops have been put on standby .
In Karachi , a leading dissident lawyer , Rashid A Rizvi , said protesters were on foot after being prevented from reaching the buses intended to take them to Islamabad .
The government has told transporters not to carry the demonstrators .
"" We will walk until we board our buses or we are arrested , "" Rizvi said .
Public gatherings of more than four people were banned in Punjab and Sindh , two of Pakistan 's four provinces .
Yesterday , police raided the house of Imran Khan , the leader of the Tehreek - e - Insaaf party and former Pakistan cricket captain .
Analysts said the government appeared to have panicked .
Reports said the US special envoy to Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , had telephoned the Pakistani prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , to discuss the gathering political storm buffeting the key US ally .
Yesterday , Sharif said he had "" recently received certain information from [ my ] own sources , credible sources , about certain forces who are active against me "" .
"" Threats to my life come from high - ranking government officials , certain top - most people in the government , my sources say , "" he added , declining to give further details .

2009-03-12,"What are the latest Pakistani protests about ?
The protest has been launched by anti - government lawyers campaigning for an independent judiciary - a bone of contention for a long time .
They have been joined by the opposition Pakistan Muslim League and its leader , Nawaz Sharif , who are furious at moves to bar them from office .
How will the protests unfold ?
Though dubbed a "" long march "" , the protests take the form of a motor convoy through the country .
It is due to start in the south and culminate in a sit - in outside parliament in Islamabad on Monday .
What do the lawyers want ?
Lawyers are still agitating for the reinstatement of a former chief justice of the supreme court , Iftikhar Chaudhry , sacked by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2007 .
But President Asif Zardari fears that if reinstated he could rescind Zardari 's immunity from prosecution for old corruption charges .
Why is the confrontation important ?
Pakistan matters .
It is a nuclear power with a burgeoning domestic Islamist insurgency that poses a security risk not just for neighbouring Afghanistan and India , but for countries with historic social and cultural links such as Britain .
The US and Britain would rather the country 's leadership concentrated on fighting terrorism than each other .
An alliance between the democrats following the 2007 assassination of Zardari 's wife , Benazir Bhutto , proved all too brief .
Analysts are concerned that if the democratic forces self - destruct , the military will step in once again ."
2009-03-12,"Pakistan 's latest crisis – the confrontation between former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari – is deeply worrying for the US and Britain as they prepare for a big spring push , military and economic , against the Taliban on both sides of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
It has again underlined the west 's limited power to control events in a region often portrayed as the front - line in the fight against terrorism and Islamist extremism .
Britain 's high commissioner , Robert Brinkley , is urging the two sides to step back from the brink as a nationwide opposition protest movement , known as the Long March , gathers pace , Pakistani newspapers reported today .
The US ambassador , Anne Patterson , is also said to be pressing for a compromise deal , fearful that the protests may degenerate into violence and bring down the weak civilian government in Islamabad .
Also looking for a way out , Pakistan 's prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani , has advised Zardari to end direct rule in Punjab and allow the provincial assembly in Lahore to elect a leader , the Dawn newspaper said .
Zardari 's dismissal last month of the Punjab government led by Sharif 's party triggered this latest conflagration .
There is also talk that Zardari may reverse his refusal to reinstate the former chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , as the price of his own political survival .
"" I am speaking at a time when the country is on the crossroads , "" Gilani said .
"" I will advise the president to lift governor 's rule [ as direct rule in Punjab is known ] ...
It is the right of whichever party has the majority to form its government ...
We want to [ maintain ] the vision of our slain leader , Benazir Bhutto . ""
Gilani was optimistic that Pakistan would overcome its egregious economic problems with help from the IMF , but said it could not afford the sort of vicious political infighting that has led senior officials to accuse Sharif of sedition and insurrection . ""
A condition for the world 's support is that we show to the world that we are a politically strong and stable country , "" he said .
Understanding the necessity for firm , steady governance did not mean Zardari and co could deliver it in practice , said Maleeha Lodhi , a former senior diplomat and political commentator .
"" Developments in the past week ... [ are ] raising afresh the question of whether such a floundering government can run the country at such a critical time . ""
Pakistan 's history showed governments could not rule effectively if they pursued iniquitous policies towards their political rivals , she wrote .
Lodhi also set the political stand - off against a bleak backdrop of growing social despondency , especially among the young .
According to a worldwide Gallup poll of young Muslims aged 15 to 29 , Pakistanis were by far the most pessimistic , she said .
"" When asked if they thought they were thriving , struggling or suffering , 51 % in Pakistan said they were struggling and 35 % said they were suffering . ""
This was a higher level of discontent than that registered in Indonesia or in poor African countries such as Niger and Mali – and higher even than in Palestine .
Pakistan 's political volatility , its economic impoverishment , and deepening social alienation are at the heart of the challenge that the Obama administration 's current review of regional policy is trying to address .
But while Washington tries to mediate a political truce , appropriates billions of dollars in additional economic and development aid , and wonders how hard to push Pakistan 's military in confronting the Taliban , anti - western hardliners and jihadis are not sitting on their hands .
One Islamist party , the Jamaat - e - Islami , has joined forces with Sharif 's marchers ; its supporters clashed with police in Karachi this week .
And according to the Daily Times , intelligence agencies have warned Sindh 's government that terrorists linked to al - Qaida are planning new attacks , including possible attacks on the marchers , following last week 's assault on Sri Lanka 's cricketers in Lahore . ""
Agencies have been specifically warned that terrorist organisations can strike during the Long March ... with March 14 and 15 being sensitive days , "" a Sindh home department official told the paper .
Security had been increased in Karachi and additional forces sent to Islamabad .
A local television station reported meanwhile that al - Qaida planned to use unrest on the streets as cover for attacks on US consulates and citizens .
With Afghanistan also facing political upheaval ahead of August elections and with President Hamid Karzai under a cloud of western disapproval , these are far from ideal conditions in which to launch Barack Obama 's new "" Af - Pak "" strategy .
Obama effectively admitted the west was losing the war in Afghanistan .
The growing worry now is that it may "" lose "" Pakistan , too ."
2009-03-13,"Britain and the US are trying to broker a compromise between Pakistan 's two major political parties as confrontation threatens to push the country towards collapse .
For the past two days British and American officials have been involved in intense mediation between President Asif Ali Zardari 's government and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif .
London and Washington are concerned that Pakistan , a key ally , is engulfed in political infighting rather than tackling extremists .
Political sources in Pakistan said Sharif looks unlikely to back down as a "" long march "" protest against Islamabad kicked off yesterday , drawing a heavy - handed response from the government .
On the first day of a planned five - day protest dozens of activists were arrested and roads blocked by the authorities to stop demonstrators heading out in a motor convoy from the southern city of Karachi towards a mass sit - in planned for Monday in Islamabad .
The movement , which planned to gather supporters on the way , is backed by Sharif and is calling for an independent judiciary .
The security forces beat and rounded up lawyers , opposition politicians and human rights campaigners outside Karachi 's high court yesterday .
Later , the authorities blockaded the main route out of the city - Pakistan 's biggest - and detained protesters before they could board buses to begin the march .
It now seems likely that Zardari 's government will try to stop any activists reaching the capital . ""
So far all [ domestic ] attempts at mediation have failed , so this [ international mediation ] is going to be the final attempt , "" said a senior official with one of the two warring parties .
"" They [ UK and US ] see that this confrontation is not good for Pakistan , not good for the region , not good for the world , not good for the ' war on terror ' .
"" British involvement is considered important given its historical relationship with ex - colony Pakistan and its intimate knowledge of the players involved .
Britain is also seen as more neutral than the US .
The deal being hammered out would see Sharif given the chance to reconstitute the provincial government for Punjab which was dismissed last week by the federal government .
The former chief justice , who has been championed by Sharif , would be reinstated but under terms that would either limit his powers or see him subsequently retired .
But many think that Sharif is betting that he can bring down the government and win the elections that would follow , making him reluctant to cut a deal .
He has joined other opposition parties and Pakistan 's lawyers ' movement to oppose the government .
Yesterday David Miliband , the foreign secretary , telephoned Zardari .
It is understood that Gordon Brown was briefed by Miliband on developments .
Separately , the US ambassador to Pakistan , Anne Patterson , went to see Sharif at his base in Lahore .
She later took part in a conference call with Zardari and the US special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan , Richard Holbrooke , who is based in Washington .
Lasting 30 minutes , the call is said to have pored over details of a compromise ."
2009-03-13,"Pakistan 's warring government and opposition are moving towards to a reconciliation deal partly brokered by the UK that could pull the country away from political collapse .
Sources in Asif Zardari 's presidential administration and the biggest opposition party , led by Nawaz Sharif , said detailed discussions were under way .
A deal would address the issue of the judges that Sharif and a movement of lawyers want restored to office , and a way of reinstating the provincial government in Punjab , which had been run by Sharif 's party until Islamabad dismissed it last month .
Lifting a legal bar to Sharif and his brother Shahbaz standing for parliament would be part of the package .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , called Sharif today to discuss the terms of an agreement , urging him to reach a compromise .
US diplomats are also deeply involved , and Pakistan 's powerful military looks to be pressing for a political settlement , with the army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , today meeting Zardari and the prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , in Islamabad .
"" Conversations are going on internally [ within the country ] and externally , "" said a close aide to Zardari .
"" Now it depends if PML - N [ Sharif 's party ] accepts "" .
Sharif has so far been determined to push forward with his showdown with the government .
But the last - ditch intervention of the UK and US appears to have persuaded him to consider cutting a deal .
"" Things are still a bit raw but there is definitely some activity , "" said an insider in Sharif 's party .
"" The army is also showing some concern .
They [ the government ] have to do something . ""
Zardari has finally outsmarted himself . ""
Sharif 's party has joined the lawyers to take part in a "" long march "" this week to the capital , where a mass protest is planned for 16 March , raising fears of serious civil unrest that could force the army to step in .
They are calling for an independent judiciary , especially the reinstatement of the chief justice removed by the former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2007 .
The government has cracked down hard on the demonstrators , arresting hundreds and blocking roads across the country .
Whether or not Sharif and Zardari reach a compromise , the march is likely to continue , although the potential for conflict could be lessened . ""
These people [ the government ] are opening the doors to dialogue again , "" said Zulfikhar Khosa , a senior member of Sharif 's party .
Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party accuses Sharif of using the issue of the judges to try and bring down the government , which was elected in February 2008 , after more than eight years of military rule .
Given the harsh clampdown , it is unclear how many protesters will be able to make it to Islamabad for Monday .
Pakistan is a key anti - terrorism ally of the west but is struggling against the twin challenges of extremist violence and an economy in tailspin .
London and Washington fear that a political clash could paralyse the government and push the nuclear - armed country towards implosion ."
2009-03-15,"The Pakistani government said it would seek a review of a Supreme Court ruling last month that barred opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and his brother from elected office and triggered a political crisis .
"" The federal government will file a review petition in the Supreme Court against the verdict of the Supreme Court , "" the president 's spokesman , Faratullah Barbar , said in a statement .
Meanwhile , Pakistan 's government put the army on stand - by ahead of planned opposition protests in the capital , the military said , raising the stakes in a crisis that endangers the country 's efforts against Islamist extremism .
Authorities have vowed to prevent lawyers and supporters of Nawaz Sharif from converging on Islamabad for a mass sit - in in front of Parliament tomorrow , arguing it would paralyse the government and present a target for terrorists ."
2009-03-15,"Pitched battles broke out between police and demonstrators in Lahore today as the Pakistani opposition 's "" long march "" calling for restoration of an independent judiciary degenerated into ugly clashes .
Police in riot gear confronted a previously peaceful protest near the high court buildings , launching baton charges and firing teargas rounds at thousands of demonstrators , who in turn pelted officers with stones .
Mobs accompanying the convoy of opposition leader Nawaz Sharif smashed the windows of buses parked along the route .
Others torched tyres , sending plumes of black smoke into the blue sky over a usually bustling boulevard littered with stones and empty teargas shells .
But by evening police withdrew , and thousands of flag - waving supporters turned out to cheer Sharif , who set off for Islamabad in a convoy of about 200 vehicles .
A spokesman for Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim N League party earlier claimed he had been placed under house arrest .
But the government denied it had taken such action and Sharif was later able to leave his Lahore home without resistance .
Before leaving , he told activists : "" The government has turned the country into a police state . ""
The protesters , a coalition of political parties and civil activists , were demanding the appointment of independent judges and the reinstatement of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry , who was dismissed in 2007 by the then president , Pervez Musharraf .
Last week , police detained hundreds of lawyers and opposition activists and forcibly stopped marchers from travelling out of town , but the clashes in Lahore today were the most violent since the "" long march "" ‑ which is travelling through Pakistan to Islamabad ‑ set off on Thursday .
Before police charged the crowd , many there had described the atmosphere as jubilant .
Lahore is the political base of Sharif and the centre of Pakistan 's lawyers movement .
On Monday , the demonstration is due to arrive in Islamabad , the climax of a protest that has shaken a government also struggling to contain Islamist militants and shore up a collapsing economy .
Lawyers and opposition leaders are threatening to maintain a sit - in at the country 's parliament until the current president , Asif Ali Zardari , widower of the assassinated ex - prime minister Benazir Bhutto , honours a pledge to restore the justices .
Following last year 's election , Sharif entered a coalition with Zardari 's Pakistan People 's party to force Musharraf from power , but he later withdrew from the deal over the issue of the judges .
The relationship between the two men deteriorated further last month after the supreme court banned Sharif and his brother Shabhaz , then chief minister of the Punjab , from political office .
Sharif 's supporters took to the streets , accusing Zardari of engineering the court 's decision in order to quell opposition .
With the Taliban growing in strength in tribal areas of Pakistan and using the country to launch attacks in Afghanistan , the political crisis has prompted deep concern in the US .
The problems on Pakistan 's lawless north - west frontier were graphically illustrated today when suspected militants launched a pre - dawn attack on a transport terminal used to supply Nato troops in Afghanistan and set fire to dozens of containers and military vehicles , according to police .
Yesterday , after the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , spoke to both Zardari and Sharif by telephone , the government announced it would file an appeal against a supreme court ruling barring the opposition leader and his brother from standing for parliament .
Sharif 's party welcomed the move but maintained its demand for a shake - up of the judiciary .
Many observers suspect Zardari fears the judges could challenge a pact signed by Musharraf that quashed long - standing corruption charges against him and Bhutto .
For his part , Sharif has been accused of exploiting the lawyers ' march for his own benefit in an attempt to force early elections and capitalise on Zardari 's low approval ratings ."
2009-03-17,"The latest nail - biting crisis in Pakistan ended yesterday with jubilant scenes on the streets of Islamabad and sighs of relief in Washington and London .
Just as protesters were about to descend on the capital in their thousands , President Asif Zardari backed down by agreeing to reinstate the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry .
And Nawaz Sharif , the leader of the opposition , called off a sit - in outside parliament which would have ended in the overthrow of the government .
It was a clear retreat by Mr Zardari , who had started to copy the very worst aspects of the military ruler he had deposed .
He had ejected opposition politicians from office , ordered mass arrests and a media clampdown .
In a way , he had no choice but to back down .
Policemen melted away in front of the swelling ranks of black - suited lawyers , a sign the government was losing executive control .
The victor of this conflict , Mr Sharif , also stepped back from the brink by agreeing to the way the chief justice will be reinstated .
Mr Chaudhry will only go back to work on 21 March , when the incumbent retires .
Mr Sharif thus abandoned his demand to restore the legal state of affairs in the supreme court to 2 November 2007 - the day before the state of emergency imposed by General Pervez Musharraf when Mr Chaudhry was sacked and put under house arrest .
If the legal and constitutional clock had been put back 16 months , everything that the supreme court had done would have been declared null and void .
Before he was removed , Mr Chaudry was about to examine an amnesty Gen Musharraf used to entice the late Benazir Bhutto and her husband Mr Zardari back from exile .
This was an amnesty against all outstanding charges against the couple .
It was the fear of losing this protection that prompted Ms Bhutto to resist the method of restoring the chief justice which Mr Sharif had proposed .
All this may seem arcane and bizarre , as the goths stand at the gates of the nuclear - armed state .
Mightier foes threaten Pakistan 's nascent democratic order .
But it is neither arcane nor bizarre in a culture where assassination , ambition and amnesty are part of the same political coinage .
Mr Zardari enjoys immunity from prosecution as president , so it is not known how vulnerable he would be if Mr Chaudhry restarted his vendetta against Mr Musharraf , who is now peacefully retired .
The move to reinstate the chief justice by appointing him as a successor to the incumbent whom he regards as illegal avoids ( at least initially ) the chaos that would ensue if Mr Sharif had stuck to his guns .
The agreement to restore the chief justice was the second conciliatory move Mr Zardari made in an action - packed weekend .
On Saturday Mr Zardari started to undo another rash move - the ejection of Mr Sharif 's party from power in the Punjab .
The government said it would seek a review of the supreme court ruling , barring Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz from holding elected office .
This is only a ceasefire .
The protagonists could easily return to war .
An optimist would say that Mr Zardari might learn from mistakes which nearly spelled the end of his short term of office .
And it could be that Mr Zardari will now cede day - to - day control to more capable political hands like those of his prime minister .
Mr Sharif remains the most popular politician in the country , but he too would also be unwise to push for early elections .
His party controls Punjab , the most populous and powerful state , but it still falls far short of being a national party .
If the stability of the country is more important than his political ambitions , Mr Sharif should content himself with trying to work with a chastened president .
Pakistan needs a political leader who can unite the country .
Benazir Bhutto was , in the eyes of many , the last national figure capable of doing this .
Perhaps that is why she was killed ."
2009-05-02,"President Barack Obama 's administration is reaching out to Pakistan 's opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , in the face of the country 's worsening security crisis as it battles the Taliban .
Reports in the US have described a push by American officials to develop closer ties with Sharif , who is believed to have influence with the country 's Islamists .
The diplomatic moves , reported by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , reflect a growing concern in Washington that Pakistan 's leader , Asif Ali Zardari , is not able to deal with the challenge of the Taliban by himself .
However , the push is believed to fall short of a full - scale attempt to broker a power - sharing deal between the two men .
General David Petraeus , the head of the US military 's Central Command , reportedly told officials in Washington last week that Zardari is vulnerable and his government is increasingly weak .
The past two weeks have seen Taliban militants infiltrate a region not far from the capital , Islamabad , and take on army troops .
Though Zardari and Sharif do not have a good history of being able to work together , it has been reported that Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , and Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy to the region , have both urged the two men to explore options of co - operating .
Sharif 's standing with Islamists could perhaps go some way towards halting what appears to be a gradual militant takeover of much of the country .
The deepening crisis in Pakistan has prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity in Washington .
Obama has put Pakistan at the centre of his foreign policy , in effect treating it and the Afghan war as one "" AfPak "" issue .
That focus is likely to continue in the days ahead .
Petraeus was in Washington yesterday for talks about the situation with top White House officials .
Those talks come ahead of a meeting this week between Zardari and the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , who will travel to Washington for talks with Obama .
The talks are certain to be dominated by the gains made by the Taliban and their emergence as a threat to the government of nuclear - armed Pakistan ."
2009-05-26,"Pakistan 's top court today lifted an election ban on the opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , in a move that distanced the country further from its past of military rule and opened the way for a future attempt to gain power .
Sharif was banned from standing for office nine years ago after the military leader , General Pervez Musharraf , sent him into exile in Saudi Arabia .
Sharif returned to Pakistan in 2007 but was barred from last year 's election .
Now the tables have turned : Musharraf is gone , Sharif is the country 's most popular politician , and today the supreme court removed the last hurdle preventing his returning to parliament . ""
The decision is evidence of a free judiciary , "" Sharif told reporters at his home outside Lahore after the judgment was handed down in Islamabad . ""
The state should function with the will of the people and according to their wishes .
"" Supporters danced outside the supreme court and fed each other sweets , a traditional mark of celebration .
But Sharif is unlikely to make a bid for power soon .
The next polls are not due until 2013 and the Pakistan Muslim League leader has rowed behind the government as it battles Taliban militants in Swat .
The army spokesman , Major General Athar Abbas , said today "" fierce fighting "" was under way on the outskirts of Mingora , the valley 's main town , and that 29 militants and six soldiers had been killed in the previous 24 hours .
The figures were unverifiable .
In Pakistan 's combative politics , anything is possible , and analysts said Sharif may be aiming towards midterm polls in the hope that he can capitalise on the immense unpopularity of the president , Asif Ali Zardari . ""
He 's now the king of Pakistan , politically , "" said Cyril Almeida , an analyst at Dawn newspaper .
"" All he has to do is sound like the viable option if the present government implodes – which makes sense , given its record so far , stumbling from crisis to crisis . ""
Sharif has kept a low profile since last March , when he spearheaded a successful street campaign for the restoration of the chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry , which badly wounded Zardari 's reputation and prestige .
Chaudhry did not sit on the bench that delivered today 's judgment .
Since then , Sharif has made a concerted effort to widen his support base beyond his traditional stronghold , in Punjab province .
He has advocated greater autonomy for Baluchistan , where decades of neglect have stoked a simmering insurgency , and spoken in favour of tilting the federal budget in favour of smaller provinces .
But Sharif has spurned numerous attempts by Zardari to join the cabinet , perhaps sensing little political advantage in ruling during a time of military crisis , economic downturn and intense scrutiny from the US .
According to US media reports , the Obama administration has started cosying up to the Lahore politician as insurance against a Zardari government collapse .
Today 's court decision "" confirms the Musharraf era is well and truly over "" , said Almeida , referring to the fact that a previous court , favourable to Musharraf , had ruled against Sharif and his brother Shahbaz , now chief minister of Punjab .
Both Sharif brothers can now hold public office .
But other hurdles lie between Sharif , who ordered Pakistan 's first nuclear test , in 1998 , and power .
A Musharraf - era provision preventing anyone from becoming prime minister for a third term effectively bans him from the country 's top job .
Sharif led the country twice in the 1990s .
Many believe a lifting of the ban is matter of time , however .
Meanwhile , speculation about a possible political comeback by Musharraf is rapidly dwindling .
This week the retired dictator moved out of military headquarters , 18 months after he resigned as army chief .
Like the former prime minister Shaukat Aziz , Musharraf is currently living in London , from where he has defended his record through phone interviews with private television channels ."
2009-07-28,"When a Siberian tiger landed in the Pakistani city of Lahore last week , at the height of a sweltering summer , some worried that the blistering temperatures might prove too much for the rare animal .
But in the end the heat proved too much for its owners , the politically dominant Sharif family , who , after a round of lacerating media criticism , have offered to give the hapless tiger up .
The animal was flown in from Canada by Suleiman Sharif , a nephew of the opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , who is known as the "" Lion of Punjab "" .
The Pakistani government banned the import of big cats last February .
However , Sharif junior has got powerful connections : his father , Shahbaz , is chief minister of Punjab .
So when the tiger landed at Lahore airport , it was welcomed by the chief minister 's private secretary , who whisked it through customs .
According to press reports , Suleiman planned to house the tiger in a chilled enclosure at the family 's private zoo on the Raiwind estate , on the outskirts of the city .
A second tiger had been ordered from Canada .
The matter , when it hit the newspapers , prompted outrage , not so much because it highlighted the powerful dodging the law , which is nothing unusual in Pakistan , but due to the insensitivity of building a refrigerated room at a time when most Pakistanis are labouring under extensive electricity outages in roasting weather .
"" It is hard to see the inhabitants of Siberia faring well in the heat and humidity of Lahore , "" noted an acerbic editorial in The News , which demanded an official investigation .
Its competitor , Dawn , queried : "" Would n't millions of Pakistanis … be outraged ? ""
And so the tiger had to go .
Today , the World Wildlife Fund office said the Sharif family had offered to donate the politically problematic animal to charity .
"" They contacted our office to say they are ready to hand over the animal .
It 's in their interest to give it up , "" said the charity 's director for Pakistan , Ali Hassan Habib . ""
And so it should be .
We want to use this opportunity to educate them . ""
Habib said he would try to place the tiger with a suitable zoo in Lahore , otherwise the animal would be sent abroad .
He said the affair raised questions about why the Canadian exporter agreed to deal with a private individual instead of a zoo .
Suleiman Sharif has not publicly commented .
His uncle Nawaz , the most popular politician in Pakistan , according to polls , is in London , where his wife is receiving medical treatment .
A Sharif spokesman in Lahore said it was "" entirely incorrect "" that a chilled cage had been built , and added : "" There is no tiger at the Raiwind farmhouse , I can guarantee you that . """
2009-10-21,"You would think that the citizens of a developing country promised $ 7.5bn over five years would be dancing in the streets .
Instead , last week 's approval of the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act , formerly the Kerry - Lugar bill , by Congress met with widespread howls of condemnation in Pakistan .
A coalition of opposition political parties was quick to term the act a "" death warrant "" for the country , with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif saying conditions in the bill are against Pakistan 's "" sovereignty , security and national honour "" .
It all started after the corps commanders of the Pakistani army , the most powerful generals in Pakistan 's most powerful institution , took the unprecedented step of issuing a press release expressing "" serious concerns "" about the act 's impact on national security .
Although the aid package was meant to improve America 's image in Pakistan , for the time being it has been a public relations disaster .
The irony – a common feature of Pakistani politics – is that if Sharif or other opposition politicians or even the army were in government , they too would heartily endorse the Kerry - Lugar aid package .
What frightens people in Pakistan is that the aid is conditional on American oversight of the most sensitive aspects of Pakistan 's security establishment .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , is to report annually to Congress on the Pakistani government 's "" effective civilian control "" of the armed forces , including its budget , chain of command and the process of promotion for senior military leaders .
She is also to report on civilian involvement in strategic guidance and planning and military involvement in civil administration .
Controversially , aid may be dependent on US access to Pakistani nationals associated with nuclear proliferation , such as Abdul Qadir Khan .
Pakistan must also demonstrate that it is assisting the US in dismantling illicit nuclear supply networks .
Pakistan must show a "" sustained commitment to ... combating terrorist groups "" too .
Specific reference is made to Pakistan ceasing to support militancy in Afghanistan and India .
There is even a reference to the Afghan Taliban shura in Quetta and the Lashkar - e - Taiba headquarters in Muridke .
Such was the uproar over these measures that Congress was forced to issue an explanatory statement essentially promising that the US will not micromanage the administration of the Pakistan state .
But the fact is that the US already micromanages much of Pakistan .
The major difference now is that the US executive will be more accountable to Congress when it does so .
Still , it is n't all doom and gloom .
The act acknowledges the role played by ordinary Pakistanis in resisting authoritarianism and confronting terrorism – namely , "" the bold political steps "" taken by the Pakistan electorate in 2007 and 2008 ( a clear nod to the popular movement to oust former president Pervez Musharraf following his dismissal of the chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry ) , and the thousands of security forces and many more civilians killed in the war with militancy .
It is an ambitious piece of legislation that mentions practically every aspect of Pakistan 's statecraft from education and environmental sustainability to matters of security .
Another aim is to improve capacity in Pakistan to ensure aid is delivered by the government of Pakistan .
The bulk of the aid is intended for schools , roads , medical clinics and infrastructure development .
The "" core intention "" of the legislation is to make "" a long - term commitment "" to the people of Pakistan .
Of course it is unclear how much of the aid will go directly to Pakistan and how much will be spent by the US and private consultants in administering the funds .
Pakistan 's finance minister has previously noted that administrative costs halve aid given to Pakistan .
The act does encourage President Obama to utilise Pakistani firms and local non - governmental organisations .
And only $ 40 m is meant to be spent on US government administrative costs .
The chances of this happening , however , are very slim .
The problem for Pakistan is that there is little confidence in the accountability of its institutions , and for the Obama administration it would be a political disaster if funds sent to Pakistan ended up being misappropriated , as they were during the eight years of lavish military funding under the Bush administration .
Significantly , the secretary of state has wide authority to waive the conditions attached to aid if it is in the traditionally nebulous "" national security interests "" of the US .
In short , US aid to Pakistan will continue to be politicised .
Other recipients of American largesse , such as Israel , Egypt and Turkey , do not face the same degree of scrutiny .
But that is no excuse for not having such oversight .
Whether or not the US has hidden agendas , Pakistan 's history of unaccountable wealth accumulation from American and other international donors necessitates transparency .
There is no doubt that conditions attached to the aid package will be used to cloak American arm twisting .
The state department , along with Congress and the Pentagon to a lesser extent , have been charged with ensuring the monies are not misappropriated .
However , these institutions are far from independent and impartial .
Sadly , the reality is that Pakistan remains dependent on the US for its survival .
Now the responsibility rests on the civilian government to ensure the country 's interests are not overruled by the opportunists in Washington and Rawalpindi .
It 's a giant task , but has n't it always been ?"
2010-07-02,"It is a bit late in the day to be talking about wake - up calls in Pakistan , because after 18 months of bomb outrages that have targeted the Sri Lankan cricket team , intelligence and police officers , busy market places , and now fellow Muslims , the same policies are still in place : the distinction between "" good "" and "" bad "" jihadi groups ; the official tolerance of hardline madrasas which give shelter to them ; and the ambivalence of local political leaders to those groups .
Take Shahbaz Sharif , Punjab 's chief minister and the brother of the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif .
Shahbaz assured Lahore yesterday that the people behind the latest attack on a Sufi shrine , which killed 42 and injured 175 , would never be allowed to escape .
Really ?
This is the same chief minister who in March called on the Taliban not to attack Punjab because his party shared some of their ideas ( he said later that his remarks were taken out of context ) .
This is the same provincial government whose law minister , Rana Sanaullah , campaigned at a byelection alongside a leader of a banned sectarian organisation that attacks minority Shias ; and it is the same administration which gave £ 650,000 to Jamaat - ud - Dawa , a charity the UN put on its terrorism watchlist after the Mumbai attacks .
The attack on the Data Ganj Baksh shrine in central Lahore was the second assault against a religious group in just over a month , after the Ahmadi sect was targeted in late May , when 94 people were killed .
Popular reaction yesterday blamed America for stirring up the jihadis with drone attacks in the tribal belt .
But suicide attacks against Sufis have more to do with the sheer intolerance which the Wahhabi and Deobandi sects have for expressions of Islam they consider heretical .
These puritans have found willing agents in the emergence of so - called "" Punjabi Taliban "" who co - ordinate their attacks with their counterparts in Waziristan and are formed from the same groups that Pakistan 's army cultivated in the 1990s to attack Indian troops in Kashmir .
Thursday night 's attack was the second on Sufis , and will enrage ordinary Pakistanis , the majority of whom identify with that tradition of Islam .
No one in Pakistan , let alone Nawaz Sharif , who hopes one day to return to national power , can tolerate a policy of accommodating jihadis , or keep them as backroom allies in the mistaken belief that this is the best way of containing them .
After the last two attacks , his brother Shahbaz can not claim to have the situation under control in the Punjab .
It is not and it needs a concerted police and intelligence operation ( the army , too , needs to get off the fence ) against all jihadis to settle the point of who runs the country 's most populous province ."
2010-11-30,"Pakistan 's army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , considered pushing President Asif Ali Zardari from office and forcing him into exile to resolve a political dispute , the US embassy cables reveal .
Kayani aired the idea during a frantic round of meetings with the US ambassador Anne Patterson in March 2009 as opposition leader Nawaz Sharif rallied thousands of supporters in a street movement that threatened to topple the government .
Kayani said that while he disliked Zardari , he distrusted Sharif even more , and appeared to be angling for a solution that would prevent the opposition leader from coming to power .
The cable illustrates the strong behind - the - scenes hand of Pakistan 's military in civilian politics only six months after the last military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf , resigned .
It also highlights the central role of western diplomats in Pakistani power games – as the Americans spoke with Kayani , British diplomats forged their own plan to broker a political deal between warring factions .
The crisis was sparked by Zardari 's attempt to bar Sharif from running for parliament and his refusal to reinstate the deposed chief justice , Iftikhar Chaudhry .
As a powerful protest movement of opposition supporters and lawyers grew in Sharif 's stronghold of Lahore , western diplomats scrambled to defuse the situation with Kayani 's help .
During his fourth meeting with Patterson in less than a week , the taciturn army chief "" hinted that he might , however reluctantly , have to persuade President Zardari to resign if the situation sharply deteriorates "" .
He said Zardari could be replaced by Asfandyar Wali Khan , leader of the Pashtun nationalist Awami National party , but the prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , would remain in place .
As such , this "" would not be a formal coup "" , Patterson noted , but would leave in place a government led by Zardari 's PPP party .
But Kayani made it clear he hoped the US could resolve the crisis through negotiation because he did not want Sharif in power . ""
Regardless of how much he disliked Zardari he distrusted Sharif even more , "" it said .
Kayani told Patterson that his top generals , known as the Corps Commanders , had expressed disquiet about Zardari because he was thought to be corrupt and had neglected Pakistan 's "" economic and security challenges "" , he said .
The military 's spymaster , ISI chief General Shuja Pasha , made similar complaints about Zardari during a flight to America for a review of the strategic relationship between the two allies , the ambassador reported .
"" We have multiple sources demonstrating army complaints about Zardari , "" she said .
The preference for Gilani fuels long - standing speculation that the army leadership views the prime minister as a more palatable , or pliable , figure .
Patterson speculated that the army chief did not air his grievances directly with Zardari because he wanted to avoid any confrontation that might prompt Zardari to try to oust him – a "" disastrous "" possibility .
The British ambassador , Robert Brinkley , was working his own lines .
He told the Americans he had received permission from London to "" approach the various sides [ and ] discern their bottom lines "" .
But the UK had not decided whether it would take on the role of mediator .
In the end Zardari was forced into a humiliating climbdown on 16 March when , under massive pressure , he dropped the ban on Sharif and reinstated Chaudhry .
Reports at the time speculated that Kayani had played a central role in forcing Zardari to change course .
The drama prompted an American re - evaluation of the critical relationship between the president and army chief .
Only a month earlier , the embassy reported that they had developed a "" respectful if not entirely trusting working relationship "" .
"" Kayani has gone out of his way to publicly defer to Zardari because he needs political support to wage successful military operations .
After eight years of military rule under Musharraf , Zardari is re - shaping civilian - military relations in the shadow of Pakistan 's history of repeated military coups.""Sharif has much in common with the army leadership – his Punjabi roots , conservative politics and a history of supporting military rule .
But he earned the army 's wrath in 1999 with his bungled attempt to fire the then army chief Pervez Musharraf – a mistake that ultimately forced Sharif into exile ."

Classified By : Anne W. Patterson , for reasons 1.4 ( b)(d ) 1 .
( C ) Summary .
In a last - ditch effort to reduce tensions with the Sharif brothers ahead of the start of the lawyers ' march on March 12 , President Zardari offered Pakistan Muslim League ( PML ) leader Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain the post of Senate leader if PML would form a government with the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) in Punjab but will do little to pacify Nawaz Sharif or the lawyers .
Shujaat is considering the deal , which will be sealed by the March 12 vote in the Senate ; it could end governor 's rule in Punjab -- if Shujaat can keep the PML forward block in line .
Other compromise efforts have failed , although the UK High Commission is probing for the various parties ' positions in advance of a possible HMG mediation effort .
After seeing Interior Minister Malik and Awami National Party leader Asfundyar Wali Khan , Ambassador will see Shujaat March 11 and the Sharifs on March 12 .
2 .
( C )
Amid reports of possible targeted killings and Mumbai style attacks during the march , the GOP began arresting Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N ) and Jamaat - e - Islami ( JI ) members and some civil activists .
Interior Minister Malik assured Ambassador he had no plans to arrest the Sharifs or key civil society leaders like Aitzaz Ahsan , but caveated this by saying he might have to arrest Imran Khan or others "" who did not obey the law . ""
Lawyers and JI activists already have begun infiltrating Islamabad ; if a significant number of demonstrators can not enter the capital , we expect protests in multiple areas , especially in Punjab , beginning March 12 .
Accordingly , we are issuing a Warden Notice March 11 .
3 .
( C )
During Ambassador 's fourth meeting in a week with Chief of Army Staff ( COAS )
General Kayani on March 10 , he again hinted that he might , however reluctantly , have to persuade President Zardari to resign if the situation sharply deteriorates .
He mentioned Asfundyar Wali Khan as a possible replacement .
This would not be a formal coup but would leave in place the PPP government led by PM Gilani , thus avoiding elections that likely would bring Nawaz Sharif to power .
We do not believe Army action is imminent .
We do believe Kayani was laying down a clear marker so that , if he has to act , he can say he warned the U.S. in advance and gave us ample opportunities to pressure both sides to back down .
Kayani is trying to leverage what he considers predominate U.S. influence over Zardari , instead of seeking a direct confrontation that could provoke an unhelpful civil - military clash .
4 .
( C )
Two weeks ago , Zardari was staring at victory on all fronts ; today , he recognizes he must compromise with the Sharifs and might well be looking over his shoulder at the Army .
Even if the lawyers ' march fizzles -- and it may --
Nawaz retains the high moral ground in public opinion and can continue attacking a now weakened Zardari .
We should encourage Zardari to continue efforts to ease tensions and ask the Saudis and the UAE to weigh in with their respective allies .
This could be a protracted process .
End Summary .
Mediation / Confrontation / Collapse
-------------------------------- 5 .
( C )
There are three political scenarios in play as tensions between President Zardari and the Sharif brothers rise ahead of the start of the lawyers ' march on March 12 : mediation / accommodation , which resolves the Sharifs ' disqualification from holding public office , ends governor 's rule in Punjab and addresses the judicial issue ; confrontation , which leads to violence and possible Army intervention ; and a fizzled march that sets the stage for continued conflict .
Mediation / Accommodation -----------------------
6 .
( C )
On March 11 , Awami National Party ( ANP ) leader Asfundyar Wali Khan described to Ambassador and Polcouns his ISLAMABAD 00000516 002 OF 004 mediation efforts with Jamiat Ulema - e - Islam leader Fazlur Rehman over the past week .
Zardari , he asserted , agreed to request a review of the Supreme Court decision disqualifying the Sharifs , said that after a positive outcome to that review Shahbaz Sharif would be reinstated as Chief Minister Punjab , and agreed to a conference to discuss restoring the judiciary .
In return , Nawaz should delay the lawyers ' march .
7 .
( C ) Nawaz reportedly agreed but then changed his mind and demanded reversal of the court decision , an end to governor 's rule in Punjab and reinstatement of the former Chief Justice .
Under pressure , Nawaz relented and agreed to the judicial conference idea but offered only to ask the lawyers to consider postponing the march , and said all this had to be accomplished in a day .
Asfundyar noted that it was impossible to demand a immediate review of a Court decision that had not been formally issued .
He told Nawaz that he would win the next election and should just be patient ; by pressing now , he threatened a political vacuum that would be filled by the Army .
This time , warned Asfundyar , Nawaz might not be sent into a comfortable exile .
Nawaz refused to budge .
8 .
( C )
Asfundyar said that Zardari was surrounded by advisors who were not politicians , so he was not being encouraged to compromise ; Nawaz 's chief advisor was Chaudhry Nisar who , with the Sharif brothers disqualified , stood the best chance of being the next PML - N Prime Minister .
Nawaz had provoked the Court by launching a campaign over the doctored exam scores of the Chief Justice 's daughter , and this had prompted the ruling against Shahbaz .
Asfundyar attributed the crisis 70 percent to Nawaz and 30 percent to Zardari .
In Asfundyar 's view , there was an absence of trust on both sides , and what was needed was a cease - fire in which to conduct reasonable negotiations .
If the march fizzled , there could be time to work out a compromise ; if the march sparked violence , there was "" nothing to do but pray . ""
9 .
( C )
Asfundyar welcomed the idea of UK mediation but said it was the U.S. view that counted most .
He also urged that we contact the UAE to pressure Zardari and the Saudis to pressure Nawaz to back off .
ANP had seen PML - N members distributing cash envelopes to a stream of supporters this week ; like Zardari , Asfundyar said he believed the money was coming from the Saudis .
Asfundyar was open to continue mediating if asked .
He reminded Ambassador that Zardari had offered him the job of Prime Minister immediately after the February 2008 elections .
10 .
( C )
In a separate meeting with Ambassador and Polcouns , UK High Commissioner Brinkley said he had received approval to approach the various sides , discern their bottom lines , and report back to London .
HMG had not yet decided whether to take on any role of mediator or guarantor .
The UK planned to make a public statement today urging the parties to resolve their differences democratically and eschew violence .
Brinkley was scheduled to see PM Gilani and possibly Zardari and Shahbaz Sharif on March 11 , and Chief of Army Staff General Kayani and Asfundyar Wali Khan on March 12 . 11 .
( C )
Late on March 11 , the PML confirmed press reports that the PPP had reversed course ( Ref B ) and now had offered Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain the post of leader of the Senate if PML agreed to join PPP in a coalition government in Punjab .
Shujaat will meet PM Gilani later March 11 ; on March 12 , the newly constituted Senate would vote on a party leader .
If the deal goes through , it would end governor 's rule in Punjab but it is unclear if a PPP - led government will reduce tensions .
It remains unclear , however , if Shujaat can hold on to his 28 - 35 member "" forward block "" of Nawaz supporters to seal this deal .
Without the PML forward block , the PPP can not form a government .
Confrontation
------------- 12 .
( C )
In a March 11 meeting with Ambassador and Polcouns , Interior Minister Malik described his efforts to mediate with the lawyers to convince them to hold a peaceful march outside of Islamabad , but he said the lawyers so far have spurned the GOP 's proposals .
Malik plans to block roads into Islamabad ISLAMABAD 00000516 003 OF 004 beginning March 13 .
Ambassador warned that efforts to arrest the Sharifs or high - profile activists like Aitzaz Ahsan would not be well received in Washington or elsewhere .
Malik denied he had any intention of arresting the Sharifs or Aitzaz but qualified this by saying "" unless they do not stop , but I will tell you first .
I have to maintain law and order . ""
He said he might have to arrest Imran Khan and some JI activists .
( Note : On March 10 , Punjab police began arresting 200 - 250 JI student activists and low - level PML - N workers .
Mission contacts report many activists already are going underground .
Neither the Sharifs nor Aitzaz Ahsan have been arrested .
Geo TV News , which the GOP has criticized for being anti - government , disappeared from cable TV .
See septel for updates . )
13 .
( C ) Malik said he had received serious threat information regarding a Mumbai style attack in Karachi on March 13 - 14 by the Jandallah group that previously had attacked the U.S. Consulate .
There were also reports of a proposed targeted killing , against whom was unclear .
JI leaders were giving their students "" black coats "" so they could look like lawyers and already were infiltrating Islamabad .
Malik expected crowds of at least 4,000 - 5,000 in the capital , even with road closures .
14 .
( S )
In four conversations with Ambassador this week , Chief of Army Staff ( COAS )
General Kayani hinted that , however reluctantly , he might have to urge Zardari to resign , if conditions deteriorate .
He did not offer any red lines .
Kayani indicated that Asfundyar Wali Khan or someone else broadly acceptable might be an appropriate replacement for Zardari .
We do not believe Army action is imminent , but we do believe Kayani was laying down a marker that , if he had to intervene , the U.S. had been forewarned and given many opportunities to avoid intervention by pressuring both Nawaz and Zardari .
Kayani made it clear that regardless of how much he disliked Zardari , he distrusted Nawaz even more .
The scenario Kayani hinted at was one in which he would pressure Zardari to resign ( and presumably leave the country ) .
This would not be an official Army "" coup ; "" it would leave the PPP government led by Prime Minister Gilani in place and preclude the need for elections that likely would bring Nawaz to power .
15 .
( S ) Kayani hinted at disquiet among his corps commanders who believe Zardari is corrupt and has not been paying enough attention to Pakistan 's economic and security challenges .
ISI DG Pasha highlighted to Ambassador his concerns about Zardari 's alleged corruption on the flight to the U.S. for the strategic review , and we have multiple sources demonstrating Army complaints about Zardari .
Kayani believes the U.S. has the most influence over Zardari , and he knows we are Pakistan 's most important ally , especially for increasing the capacity of the Pakistani Army .
Kayani told Ambassador he has talked directly to Zardari , but he does not appear to have conveyed the seriousness of Army concerns about Zardari or the security situation vis a vis the march .
( Note : Kayani may be seeking to avoid a confrontation that would prompt Zardari to make a disastrous decision to try and oust the COAS . )
A Fizzle -------- 16 .
( C )
At this point , everything appears to rest on the outcome of the lawyers ' march .
PML - N does not have a proven reputation for putting demonstrators on the streets , although JI does .
By applying the road closure / detention tactics that worked for Musharraf in 2007 to stop pro - Nawaz demonstrations , the government might be able to avoid a serious clash this time .
But if a policeman fires into the crowd or a terrorist attacks protesters , all bets are off .
17 .
( C )
There is also the likelihood that the march will not occur as scheduled .
Blocked from Islamabad , there could be multiple flash points in the Punjab , early demonstrations in Islamabad , and a series of confrontations with the police .
This could be a protracted clash of wills .
18 .
( C ) Comment :
Two weeks ago , Zardari was staring victory in the face after negotiating a PPP win in Senate elections , setting Nawaz up for an entirely legal ISLAMABAD 00000516 004 OF 004 disqualification , and looking toward successful Friends and Donors meetings that would provide the financial support needed to bolster his sagging popularity .
By over - reaching to make a grab for Punjab without doing his homework on vote counting in Punjab , Zardari now needs to compromise with the Sharifs and might well be looking over his shoulder at the Army .
Even if the march fizzles , Nawaz retains the high moral ground in the public 's eyes and will use it to continue attacking a weakened Zardari .
Zardari needs to win back the military 's confidence .

( C ) Summary .
During a meeting with Ambassador January 31 , Nawaz Sharif confirmed he was ready to work with the Pakistan People 's Party in a post - election coalition government and described this union as "" the best thing that could happen in Pakistan . ""
He dismissed reports of threats against his life as attempts by the government to dissuade him from campaigning .
Noting that emotions remain high in Sindh , he predicted violence if the election was seen as being rigged for Musharraf 's party .
As proof of his pro - Americanism , Nawaz reminded Ambassador that he had overruled his Chief of Staff to deploy Pakistani forces with the U.S. coalition in the first Gulf War .
Nawaz remained firm in his belief that all of the deposed judiciary must be reinstated .

( C ) Ambassador and Polcouns met former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League
- N PML - N )
leader Nawaz Sharif January 31 for an hour during Nawaz 's recent visit to Islamabad .
PML - N leader Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan also attended the meeting .
Nawaz met with EU ambassadors the same day and urged them to take preemptive action to prevent rigging in the upcoming election .
3 .
( C ) Ambassador noted the reports about threats to Nawaz 's security and said we were pleased to have briefed his staff on measures that could be taken to enhance his safety .
Nawaz responded that the GOP has said he is "" number one on the hit list "" of the militants , but he is not convinced .
Citing the belief that an IED planted on the road he was to travel to a rally in Peshawar lacked a detonator , Nawaz insisted he had received information from credible sources that the device was planted by security services to go off hours after the rally .
This was another attempt at government intimidation to convince him not to campaign .
Ambassador cautioned him to remain vigilant as it was clear that militant extremists wanted to disrupt the election .
PML - N / PPP : "" the best thing that could happen "" -------------------------------------------- 4 .
( C )
In response to Ambassador 's question about whether PML - N could work with the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) in a possible coalition government , Nawaz recounted how he had immediately gone to the hospital when he heard Benazir Bhutto had been shot , and he had made a special effort to pay a condolence call on Asif Zardari in Larcana .
Ambassador said that Zardari had noted his appreciation for this gesture of support .
A PML - N / PPP alliance would be "" the best thing that could happen to Pakistan , "" if it materialized , said Nawaz .
The PML - N had reached out to the PPP , and time would tell what alliances could be built .
They could also work together in the provincial government of Sindh or Punjab .
He predicted that the PPP could win enough seats to rule in Sindh with or without the Muttahida Quami Movement ( MQM ) .
5 .
( C )
Nawaz expected both PPP and PML - N would do well at the polls if the elections were free and fair ; he dismissed the Pakistan Muslim League party , saying that Pervaiz Elahi would get few , if any votes .
Claiming he had no vendetta against President Musharraf , Nawaz said the PML - N had also reached out to the Pakistan Muslim League and they in turn had contacted PML - N ( Ref A ) .
( Note : He then launched into a long description of his mistreatment after Musharraf overthrew Nawaz in 1999 ) .
The PML - N 's goal in government would be to reinstate the deposed judiciary and restore the law and order situation .
Without restoring the judiciary , Nawaz argued , you can not restore law and order and rule of law .
6 .
( C ) Ambassador said we continued to support an independent judiciary and wanted to work with the new government on this issue .
It was simply too difficult to tackle before elections .
We believed there should be a way to restore some of the deposed judges , but not the former Chief Justice .
Nawaz insisted that without restoring the Chief Justice , there was no point to filling other slots on the bench .
Ambassador disagreed , noting that many of the provincial judges could be restored for the benefit of Pakistan 's judiciary .

Emotions High
------------- 7 .
( C )
Despite the decreased level of campaigning due to security concerns , Nawaz and Khan both said that voter emotions were higher than they have ever seen .
Sindh , in particular , remains very tense , and could erupt if the election outcome is perceived as being rigged .
Nawaz noted that civil society and student groups were politicized in ways they have not been before .
The PML - N did not want violence , but it might be impossible to control the people if they felt they had been wronged .
Nawaz expressed concern that extremists could take advantage of and exacerbate tensions .
He warned that what he described as negatively - preceived U.S. support for Musharraf could create a backlash of anti - Americanism , if the public perceives that the government rigged the elections .
"" We could be sitting on a volcano , and the next four - five weeks will be critical for the region and for Pak - American relations .

The best thing America has done recently , said Nawaz , was arrange to have General Kayani named as Chief of Army Staff .
This appointment is helping Army morale and raising the level of public respect for the Army .
Noting that Musharraf met the UK equivalent to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Khan said the U.S. and the UK need to stop treating Musharraf as if he still ran the military .
CENTCOM Commander Admiral Fallon would have met with Musharaf if the President had not been travelling , asserted Khan .
Ambassador replied that we had excellent relations with the Pakistani military and meet them all the time at various levels .
We are Pro - American ------------------- 9 .
( C ) Nawaz and Khan both repeatedly said that the PML - N was pro - American .
Nawaz recounted his decision to override his Chief of Army Staff and deploy Pakistani troops to Saudi Arabia in support of the U.S. coalition in the first Gulf War .
Meanwhile , Khan noted , the PPP and its leaders were organizing street demonstrations against Pakistan joining with the U.S. coalition .
Now , Nawaz said , he was hurt that the U.S. did not remember .
Nawaz said he understood that 9/11 had changed things , but urged that the U.S. apply some balance to the relationship .
In the past , the U.S. was known as the power that rejected dictatorships , that fought for independence of the judiciary and the rule of law .
Why , he asked , did we continue to support a man who fired the Supreme Court , abrogated the constitution , and arrested civil society activists ?
10 .
( C ) Comment :
The fact that a former Prime Minister believes the U.S. could control the appointment of Pakistan 's Chief of Army Staff speaks volumes about the myth of American influence here .
Based on our understanding of the current situation , we believe Nawaz can and should take the threats to his life seriously .
It comes as no surprise that Nawaz exaggerated his party 's election prospects ; his willingness to deal with the PPP is , however , a good sign he is ready to cooperate on government formation .

END SUMMARY .
2 .
( S )
The Ambassador delivered the demarche contained in reftel regarding Benazir Bhutto 's assassination to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal on January 2 .
Responding to the demarche , Prince Saud characterized Pakistan 's current internal situation as "" serious and tense , "" and described the current political environment there as "" poisonous . ""
He emphasized the need to maintain stability , noting that the key challenge for President Musharraf is to maintain the unity of the Pakistani armed forces .
He voiced strong support for holding planned parliamentary elections , but also said that a limited postponement would be acceptable , given the current situation in the country .
Postponing the elections could be "" an opportunity for the Pakistanis to talk things out , "" he said .
Prince Saud cautioned that Pakistan must be allowed to resolve its current political crisis internally , without overt , external pressure .
3 .
( S )
Commenting on the Bhutto assasination , Prince Saud observed that he had been afraid of just such an outcome ever since the former Prime Minister had decided to return to Pakistan .
He then cautioned that the USG must not be seen publicly to be influencing Pakistan 's internal affairs , lest it inadvertently inflame matters by provoking Islamist extremists to further violence .
"" People talk about the extremists we have here , but I think they are much worse in Pakistan , "" he commented .
4 .
( S )
The Foreign Minister stated that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is a force for stability , in his opinion .
He called Sharif a leader who can speak across party lines , even to religious extremists who are not usually open to dialogue .
In Prince Saud 's view , Sharif can play an important role in stabiizing Pakistan .
5 .
( S )
These views stand in marked contrast to those of Saudi Ambassador to the US Adel al - Jubeir .
In a December 31 conversation with the DCM , al - Jubeir was highly critical of Sharif , stating in particular that Sharif had violated a promise made to King Abdullah by publicly calling for President Musharraf to step down .
Accrding to al - Jubeir , prior to his return to Pakistan , Sharif had promised the King to avoid questioning Musharraf 's recent political decisions in public .
Jubeir also compared Pakistan 's current situation to Saudi Arabia in 2003 , when the Kingdom witnessed a violent campaign by terrorists linked to a - Qaeda .
He explained that the SAG was able to push back and eventually quell this extremism , in large part by convincing the Kingdom 's religious scholars to condemn terrorism strongly .
Jubeir expresed the hope that a similar outcome is possible in Pakistan .
6 .
( S ) COMMENT .
The contrast between the views of the Foreign Minister and Ambassador al - Jubeir are worth noting , since they probably indicate that the senior levels of the Saudi government are still debating what the Kingdom 's Pakistan policy should be in the aftermath of the Bhutto asassination .
It is likely that al - Jubeir 's views more closely reflect those of King Abdullah , his patron .
END COMMENT .
FRAKER"
2010-12-01,"Pakistan 's president alleged that the brother of Pakistan 's opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , "" tipped off "" the militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) about impending UN sanctions following the 2008 Mumbai attacks , allowing the outfit to empty its bank accounts before they could be raided .
Six weeks after LeT gunmen killed more than 170 people in Mumbai , President Asif Ali Zardari told the US of his "" frustration "" that Sharif 's government in Punjab province helped the group evade new UN sanctions .
A month earlier , Shahbaz Sharif , who is chief minister of Punjab , "" tipped off "" the Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JuD ) , LeT 's charity wing , "" resulting in almost empty bank accounts "" , Zardari claimed in a conversation with the US ambassador to Islamabad , Anne Patterson .
US diplomats were unable to confirm the allegation and noted that they came at a time of rising political tension between Zardari and Sharif .
But they conceded that JuD did appear to have received a warning from somewhere . ""
Information from the ministry of the interior does indicate that bank accounts contained surprisingly small amounts , "" said the cable in January 2009 .
A Punjab government spokesman vigorously denied the charge .
"" There 's nothing true in it , "" said senator Pervaiz Rashid , an adviser to Sharif .
"" Zardari is our political opponent and he wants to topple our government . ""
Sharif could n't have known about the UN sanctions , he said , because the UN co - ordinated its action with the federal government and not the provincial one .
The accusation , which has never been publicly aired , is one of several dramas that unfolded behind the scenes after the November 2008 attacks , now revealed by the embassy cables .
US diplomats and CIA spies found themselves playing the role of harried intermediaries to prevent Pakistan and India from going to war .
One week after the bloodbath an Indian official said his government was distinguishing between Pakistan 's civilian government , "" which India believed was not involved in the attacks "" , and the Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) .
We are not yet ready to give ISI a clean chit , "" he said .
Four weeks later the US embassy grew alarmed by Indian plans to release a "" sanitised "" intelligence dossier that , they feared , could scupper intelligence sharing or thwart efforts to prevent a second attack .
"" There are still Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) sleeper and other cells in India , Nepal , Bangladesh and Pakistan , as well as many law enforcement leads which need to be pursued , "" the note said .
Pakistan 's generals , usually antagonistic towards India , appeared unusually conciliatory .
Six weeks after the attack Pakistan 's army chief , General Ashfaq Kayani , said he was "" determined to exercise restraint in his actions with India "" .
"" If there is any clue about another attack , "" he told General David Petraeus at his Rawalpindi headquarters , "" please share it with us . ""
His intelligence chief , General Shuja Pasha , went even further , acting as a regional fixer for some of his most bitter enemies .
In late 2009 Pasha travelled to Oman and Iran to "" follow up on reports he received in Washington about a terrorist attack on India "" .
He sent warnings to Israel – a country that Pakistan does not officially recognise – "" about information about attacks against Israeli targets in India "" .
Earlier in the year , he reminded Patterson , information about a second attack on India had "" come his way "" , which he conveyed to Delhi via the CIA .
The cables suggest Pakistan 's ardour for bringing the alleged Mumbai masterminds to justice appears to have wilted as time went on .
The secretive trial of Lashkar leader Zakhi ur Rehman Lakhvi and six other suspects "" is proceeding , though at a slow pace "" , US diplomats noted in February .
The secretive trial of Lashkar leader Zakhi ur Rehman Lakhvi , and six other suspects "" is proceeding , though at a slow pace "" last in February 2010 .
ThePakistan 's Inter - Service Intelligence agency ( ISI ) refused access to Abdur Rehman Syed , a retired army major and alleged LeT accomplice .
Instead the FBI was told it could "" submit questions for Syed through the ISI "" .
American officials say there is "" no smoking gun tying the Mumbai LeT operation to ISI "" but are less sure if the spy agency has , as promised , cut all its ties . ""
Despite arrests of key LeT / JuD leaders and closure of some of their camps , it is unclear if the ISI has finally abandoned its policy of using these proxy forces as a foreign policy tool , "" notes a briefing to the US special envoy Richard Holbrooke in February 2009 .
Dealing with LeT has long been a vexed issue for American diplomats in Pakistan .
In March 2006 the US ambassador Ryan Crocker requested the US government to delay by two weeks the designation of JuD. American helicopters were still delivering aid to earthquake victims in Kashmir , he explained , and they risked attack if still in the area when the designation was approved .
That same month , embassy officials met with Pakistan foreign office director Tasneem Aslam , who told her that Pakistan had "" no evidence "" linking JuD to terrorism – a conclusion US officials judged "" dubious "" .
Later , in November 2007 , the US ambassador presented the foreign secretary , Riaz Khan , with evidence that senior government ministers were publicly helping militant groups , including a declaration from the ministry of defence parliamentary secretary "" that he was proud to be a member of LeT and that he seeks to extend support to jihadi organisations when they seek his ' co - operation . '
"" "" Each of these reports is disturbing in itself , the ambassador said , as they seriously damage Pakistan 's image in the international community . ""
JuD denies that it is a front for LeT."
2013-03-19,"For some , the 17 miles of road and flyovers built for the exclusive use of a fleet of red buses that zoom above the gridlocked streets of Lahore is a shocking extravagance .
In a country where only 35 % of children are in secondary school and poverty is a reality for many , it is easy to think of other ways to spend
Â£220 m .
But for Nawaz Sharif , the frontrunner in the battle to become Pakistan 's next prime minister , the country 's first mass transit project is worth
every penny â€ “ if it staves off competition from the country 's wily president and a famous ex - cricket star .
Despite the chorus of doubters , the opening last month of the Metro Bus in the capital of Punjab , which is controlled by Sharif 's faction of the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) , was a massive hit .
Passengers damaged buses as they fought for the chance to fly across the congested city in air - conditioned comfort for a heavily subsidised 15p a ride .
"" People were just craving something like this , "" said Ahsan Iqbal , a senior PML - N leader working on a general election campaign that kicked off kick off with the dissolution of parliament on Saturday night .
"" It has become the symbol of a new Pakistan .
People are experiencing a new way of life that is much closer to developed countries , and that gives them a good feeling . ""
Enthusiasm for grand projects comes after a calamitous five years for the ruling Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) , led by Asif Ali Zardari â€ “ a surprise president who was swept to power on a tide of sympathy in 2008 after the assassination of his wife Benazir Bhutto .
Apart from being the first government in Pakistan 's history to fulfil a full term , the PPP has little to brag about .
Continuously buffeted by terrorist violence , corruption allegations and crippling energy shortages , the PPP has been unable to deliver real economic growth , let alone the motorways and infrastructure that Sharif touts .
But while the PPP 's vote is likely to be wiped out in much of urban Pakistan , Zardari still has some cards to play as his party 's prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf goes to the polls .
Zardari â€ “ whose term as president expires in September â€
“ is a ruthlessly pragmatic politician with a track record of doing whatever is necessary to keep his party in power .
The PPP is thought to have deep reserves of electoral strength in parts of rural Punjab and Sindh where its "" feudal "" landlord allies maintain a tight control on votes .
Through the president 's political heir apparent , Oxford graduate Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , 24 , the PPP maintains a connection to the Bhutto name , harking back both to Benazir and Bilawal 's grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto .
The party has also lavished more than $ 1bn in welfare handouts on 5.2 million people through its scheme branded the "" Benazir income support programme "" .
"" People at the grassroots know what we have done for them , they do n't believe what the media is saying , "" said Taj Haider , general secretary of the PPP in Sindh .
"" Living standards in the poorest areas have gone up and people are getting better prices for their crops . ""
Cynics say the Metro Bus is less about tackling urban congestion and more the dramatic political rise of Imran Khan , the country 's beloved former cricket captain , who emerged as a major threat to the PML - N in late 2011 by holding an enormous rally for his political party , the Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) , on Sharif 's home turf .
About 100,000 people took part in the Lahore "" jalsa "" , creating speculation that what Khan calls a political tsunami would sweep Pakistani politics and break the corrupt , dynastic rule of the two established parties .
Perversely , Khan could actually be the best chance the deeply unpopular PPP has for clinging on to power , if his appeal to urban young people simply succeeds in cutting into the PML - N vote bank in the towns and cities of Punjab .
After the Khan rally , PML - N panicked .
It feared its cruise to power on the back of the PPP 's many failures was in jeopardy and so went into overdrive .
The party used its control of the government of Punjab , home to 60 % of Pakistanis , to push through as many eye - catching schemes as it could â€ “ nearly all of which have been criticised for wasting money .
Free laptops were given to students , a "" youth festival "" was held where thousands of young people set world records for the formation of giant flags and , most significant of all , the Metro Bus was built in 11 months .
At the party 's manifesto launch in Lahore last Friday , Sharif promised to turn Pakistan into an "" Asian tiger "" , with new infrastructure and a government with "" zero tolerance for corruption "" .
"" Our political philosophy revolves around economic progress , "" the two - time former prime minister said .
"" If a country is economically strong , it is able to solve all the problems , whether law and order or political extremism . ""
The period of hyperactivity appears to have paid off , with the PML - N now the favourite to win the largest number of seats after Pakistanis go to the polls in the first half of May , even if an outright majority is probably beyond it .
The party enjoys a substantial lead in the latest opinion polls .
Most analysts believe Khan will be lucky to get 20 of the 342 seats in parliament . ""
He peaked too early and gave the PML - N time to rejuvenate its base , "" said Cyril Almeida , a newspaper columnist .
"" People go to his rallies because he is a rock star in Pakistan .
He does n't have the party machine to actually turn out the voters and bring them to the polling booth on election day . ""
Sharif 's desire for improved diplomatic and trade relations with India and a reduced role of the army in national life has won over some liberal - minded Pakistanis who were once suspicious of the religious leanings of a man who tried to introduce Sharia law in the late 90s before a military coup sent him into exile in Saudi Arabia .
The PML - N is smarting from accusations that it has struck cynical electoral deals with sectarian terrorists based in the Punjab .
The bombing of apartment blocks in Karachi on 3 March that killed 48 has been widely linked to the Lashkar - e - Jhangvi ( LeJ ) , a Punjab based Sunni extremist group .
The LeJ 's leaders in Punjab have been left largely untouched by Sharif 's provincial government .
Even if a reported "" seat adjustment "" deal has not been struck , Sharif is "" supremely aware that he is fishing for votes in the same waters "" as the LeJ , said one diplomat .
The key parties â€¢ Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) Traditionally leftwing party led by Asif Ali Zardari , the widow of Benazir Bhutto .
Despite five difficult years at the head of a governing coalition it is thought to have resilient support among the rural poor .
â€¢ Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz ( PML - N ) Centre right , pro - business party with stronghold in Punjab .
Leader Nawaz Sharif , who is committed to improve relations with India , was ousted as prime minister in a coup in 1999 .
â€¢ Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI )
Founded by former national cricket captain Imran Khan .
Campaigned based on promise to abolish corruption "" in 90 days "" and stopping US drone strikes .
Has no seats in parliament but could upset final result .
â€¢ Regional , ethnic and religious parties They could well end up in government in the likely event of a coalition , even if they have no chance of winning the most seats .
Foremost is Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) , a party with firm control over almost all seats in the mega - city of Karachi .
Secular , liberal and accused of controlling armed political gangs in Karachi , the party is run from London by its self - exiled leader Altaf Hussain ."
2013-04-07,"Take the long view , and there is progress to be found in the fact that elections are taking place in Pakistan on 11 May.
It will be the first transfer of power from one democratically elected civilian government to another in the 65-year history of the country .
Further , the frontrunner to become prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , is now committed to the idea of keeping the military out of politics .
In opposition , he allowed the deeply unpopular Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) government to live out its full mandate .
The likely loser , Asif Ali Zardari , who as serving president can not campaign as leader of his party , has proved to be an adept transitional leader .
Under him , there has been no political victimisation , and parliamentary political culture is the stronger for it .
Alas , the good news peters out there .
Strong winds of religious conservatism are blowing among political stakeholders .
Pakistan 's self - propelled judiciary has taken upon itself the task of weeding out political candidates by applying two controversial provisions of the constitution , whereby candidates have to be righteous , truthful and good Muslims .
As there is no agreed way of verifying this , some candidates have been given the Orwellian task of reciting prayers as proof of religious belief .
Arbitrary hurdles are also erected by applying a Pervez Musharraf - era clause whereby holders of office must hold a degree .
Punjab 's provincial government , controlled by Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) , has also had a less than glorious record with Islamist militant groups , on whom the PML - N depends for its seats .
A pogrom on a Christian neighbourhood in Lahore on 9 March was triggered by allegations of blasphemy against one man .
The PML - N has also been accused of making cynical electoral deals with a Sunni extremist group , Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , thought to be responsible for the bombing of apartment blocks in Karachi that killed 48 .
The PML - N 's counter argument is that only it can deal with the militants .
We will see .
Further still to the extremes , the Pakistani Taliban have overtly sought to influence the outcome of the election , by declaring that election rallies of the PPP , the Pashtun nationalist ANP , and the Karachi - based MQM are legitimate targets for attack .
The playing field is far from level .
Even so , the PPP deserves a period in opposition .
Despite his success at coalition building , Mr Zardari has lamentably failed to improve governance , with gas and electricity shortages , and inflation .
Paradoxically , his best hope lies in Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf , which is competing for votes on Sharif 's home turf .
But the fear is that an inconclusive result will leave a weak coalition – democratically elected but unable to take decisions needed to improve life for the majority of the people ."
2013-05-11,"Fourteen years after being overthrown by a military dictator and sent into exile , the former prime minister of Pakistan known to his supporters as the "" Lion "" has claimed victory in one of most dramatic general elections in the country 's history .
Nawaz Sharif was on course to become the next prime minister of the troubled country facing multiple crises after it became clear he had secured a commanding lead in votes despite the challenge from Imran Khan , the former cricketer who had waged a ground - breaking campaign credited with galvanising an army of young people .
Although the final result was still hours away , the country 's television networks projected Sharif heading for an ultimately tally of around 110 parliamentary seats , comfortably on course to secure the parliamentary majority he said he desperately needed to fix Pakistan 's ailing economy .
Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) appeared to be headed for a final tally of around 35 seats , in line with the expectations of many analysts , but far below the stratospheric expectations of his followers who had been repeatedly promised a "" tsunami "" that would sweep away the country 's established parties .
Meanwhile , the Pakistan Peoples party ( PPP ) , which is wildly unpopular after five years in government , was battered at the polls , and was set to secure around 35 seats , most of them in its traditional rural strongholds in Sindh province .
Sharif emerged on to the balcony of the Lahore headquarters of his Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz party ( PML - N ) well before midnight to talk to his delirious supporters , who cheered and waved the green flags of the party .
He said he was prepared to work with all other parties to try to fix the country 's many problems .
"" We want to change the destiny of the country and fulfil the promises we made to the nation during the election campaign , "" he said .
While PML - N supporters erupted in noisy celebration across Lahore many PTI supporters reacted angrily to their disappointing result , with some beating cricket bats
â€ “ the symbol of the party
â€ “ on one of the city 's main boulevards .
One gain for Khan was the leading position the party gained in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , the province close to the troubled frontier with Afghanistan , where the PTI could become a leading partner in a coalition government .
However , given the province 's acute problems and struggle with Taliban militancy , it might prove a mixed blessing for a party that has never come close to governing anything in its history .
Merely having an election is regarded as a major achievement for Pakistan and a huge milestone in its efforts to strengthen democracy .
It is the first time in its history that one elected government has handed power to another .
However , despite a strong turnout , which in the critical battleground of Punjab was described as "" huge "" by election officials , the day was also marred by violence that killed 22 people and vote - rigging in the country 's biggest city .
Politicians began crying foul even before counting began in the 70,000 polling stations throughout the huge country , particularly in the volatile port city of Karachi where a number of parties announced they would withdraw from the contest in protest .
The PTI in particular complained of blatant efforts to intimidate voters in Defence and Clifton , two affluent neighbourhoods where Khan has a devoted following .
There were reports of people being threatened as they attempted to go to vote and one case of gunmen opening fire at a polling station .
Sana Bilal , a 28-year - old PTI supporter , said her polling station located in a school in the Defence neighbourhood never even opened .
"" There were people who have been waiting outside since 8 am [ the official start of polling nationwide ] , "" she said .
"" It was a sea of PTI supporters .
Everyone is just really angry that we 've been deprived of our right to vote . ""
The Muttahida Quami Movement , the dominant political party in the city , was immediately blamed for attempting to suppress voting in an attempt to prevent the PTI eating into its territory .
Pakistan had been bracing for violence after the Taliban vowed to use suicide bombers to disrupt a democratic process the extremist movement regards as un - Islamic .
The government deployed 600,000 security personnel in an effort to protect the vote .
Many voters took the threat seriously , circulating election day tips on social media that included remaining watchful for any abandoned packages .
Some 22 people were killed nationwide in a series of attacks , some by bombs placed near polling stations in the restive north - west of the country ."

Compounding the PTI 's humiliation , Khan lost one of the seats he was personally contesting in Lahore .
Although Khan won other seats , victory in the capital of rich and populous Punjab province was seen as vital if the PTI was to sweep all before him .
It was clear throughout the day that Khan was struggling against his PML - N opponent , Sardar Ayaz Sadiq , an old friend from Khan 's schooldays at Lahore 's elite Aitchison College .
Sadiq enjoyed solid support from his personal biradari â€ “ the traditional clan networks that Khan has urged voters to ignore when they cast their votes .

"" This system is very strong in Pakistan and we must respect it . ""

2013-05-12,
2013-05-13,"Nawaz Sharif is back .
And this time , it could be the culmination of a political journey that has seen him established as perhaps the country 's only genuine statesman in a couple of generations .
To critics , he is an unreformed rightwinger , a conservative politician who allows his party to pander to the extremist Islamist fringe , an arrogant bully who recklessly threatens confrontation with other institutions , particularly the powerful army .
But Sharif is no longer the callow 30-year - old who got his start in politics as a protege of the dictator General Zia .
Nor is he the wild confrontationist whose first two terms as prime minister came to premature ends because of his inability to pick his battles or learn to co - exist with other power centres .
Instead , a stint in jail under Musharraf , then exile and five years as the leader of the opposition to the Asif Ali Zardari - led PPP government appear to have mellowed Sharif .
He is now a leader who understands that democratic continuity is indispensable .
And he has set himself to mending two of the original fault lines in Pakistan : the civil - military divide and relations with India .
Taken together , strengthening the democratic project , nudging the civil - military imbalance in the right direction and seeking to reset ties with India would amount to a fundamental reorientation of the Pakistani state â€ “ a reorientation last engineered by General Zia for very different purposes and with disastrous results .
Can Sharif do it ?
He has the necessary attributes : he is Punjabi , is genuinely popular and appears to have the courage of his convictions .
During the election campaign , Sharif demonstrated an equanimity that was beyond him in the 90s , the last time he ruled Pakistan .
Furiously attacked from all sides by well - funded adversaries â€ “ the PPP , Imran Khan and the PTI , and the dregs of Musharraf 's old party , the PML - Q â€ “ Sharif refused to descend into the mud pit , choosing instead to emphasise national economic challenges and the need for strong government .
When Khan 's tumble brought his campaign to a premature end in the crucial last hours of an intense campaign , Sharif suspended his own campaigning for 24 hours in a gesture of goodwill â€ “ a significant concession given that Sharif 's party feared that a late PTI surge threatened to eat into its share of the vote .
This gives hope that Sharif will be a good custodian of the democratic project for the next five years .
But can he tame the army , particularly when it comes to wresting away control of national security and foreign policy ?
In this , Sharif may get some unexpected help from the army itself , which is almost certainly still wary of him but appears to have accepted a new role as first among equals rather than the unquestioned and predominant power within Pakistan .
Sharif 's first test could be the selection of General Kayani 's successor .
Ostensibly appointed by the prime minister , in practice the army chief is usually selected from a shortlist that the outgoing chief provides .
In the past , maverick civilian prime ministers , including Sharif , have installed their own favourites as army chief in an attempt to neutralise the army 's political role â€ “ a move that has backfired , as Sharif himself learned when he was ousted by Musharraf in 1999 ; Musharraf having been handpicked by Sharif as an army chief unlikely to challenge him .
On India , Sharif has already shown his intentions , giving forthright interviews to Indian journalists in the last days of the campaign in which he talked of his desire to restart the peace process he initiated in the late 1990s .
Sharif has now invited the Indian prime minister , Manmohan Singh , to visit Pakistan , perhaps even as a guest at his swearing - in ceremony early next month .
But what forthrightness and boldness can help secure , old tricks can fatally sabotage .
Sharif dramatically hosted the first ever visit by an Indian prime minister , in 1999 â€ “ but the Pakistan army - initiated Kargil war a few months later scuppered that initiative .
And like Sharif now , Zardari tried to reach out to India soon after coming to power in 2008 â€ “
but then came the Mumbai attacks , blamed on the army - friendly Lashkar - e - Taiba .
And there is another fault line that since Sharif was last prime minister has been threatening to suck both the Pakistani state and society into oblivion : militancy and violent extremism .
On that present - day challenge , Sharif has said worryingly little ."
2013-05-13,"Nawaz Sharif , who is set to become Pakistan 's next prime minister , has a huge opportunity to reshape the face of Pakistani politics .
When the results of Saturday 's poll are confirmed , his party will have enough seats to govern without a major coalition deal .
Defying predictions that his party would bleed votes to Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf , the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) swept all aside in the Punjab , the most populous province .
The centre - right party pushed the centre - left Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) all the way back to its traditional base in Sindh .
Factor in the other changes of the guard that are due this year â€ “ the election of a president , the appointment of a new army chief of staff and a new chief justice â€ “ and Mr Sharif has the opportunity of establishing a firm basis for a full term , which the outgoing PPP president never had .
If power does not go to his head , Mr Sharif could use it wisely .
Governing Pakistan is never easy .
The majoritarian vote in Punjab was strong enough to deliver a central government , but that rule did not apply to Sindh , which the PPP kept , or in Khyber - Pakhtunkhwa province , where Mr Khan 's party got enough seats to contend for the control of the regional government .
Mr Khan 's anti - corruption drive may have electrified the media but it did not turn out to be a national phenomenon .
The provincial breakdown of the vote poses the same challenge to Mr Sharif .
Unless his government can deliver services to the nation that the PML - N showed it could deliver in Punjab , the new prime minister 's honeymoon will be a short one .
For Mr Sharif , it will be a case of third time lucky .
Much of that luck will depend on whether he has absorbed the political lessons of his first two stormy periods in office .
Unlike Asif Zardari , Mr Sharif does not have the political gifts needed to keep coalitions together .
And yet with Sindh , and the Senate ( until 2015 ) , in the hands of the opposition , he will need to govern with a measure of consultation ; he can not change the constitution .
In its fraught relationship with the US , Pakistan 's actions are often at variance with its rhetoric .
On Monday Mr Sharif said that the CIA drone programme was a challenge to Pakistan 's sovereignty .
Which it is , until you scrape away the surface , and see how the Inter - Services Intelligence is not beyond using the CIA as cover for its own dark deeds .
The PML - N 's resounding victory tapped anti - American populism .
Mr Sharif must now navigate a strategic relationship that makes different demands .
The Taliban , similarly , may give Mr Sharif a few months of peace but , because its agenda and that of Pakistan are mutually irreconcilable , they may well turn their guns on the Punjab .
Mr Sharif has to prove that a civilian - led government is up to these challenges ."
2013-05-13,"The full scale of Nawaz Sharif 's thumping victory in Pakistan 's general election became clear on Sunday , making it far more likely the country 's next prime minister will be able to govern without coalition deals and be free to push through what supporters see as a potentially revolutionary agenda .
Besides overhauling a moribund economy , Sharif , with his conservative Pakistan Muslim League , wants to end his country 's decades - old feud with India and put Pakistan 's meddlesome generals in their place .
It is a programme that has won him fans even among left - leaning critics who oppose his conservatism .
It has also raised hopes in India and Afghanistan .
Although the final results are still days away , projections by Pakistani television stations suggested that Sharif would only need to secure the support of a handful of independent candidates , rather than rival parties , to secure a working majority in parliament .
On Sunday , Sharif was holed up in his luxury estate in Lahore working to form a government .
Party sources said he hoped to be able to achieve this long before the two weeks allowed by the constitution .
"" We have a very ambitious agenda for the first 100 days and we want to hit the ground running , "" said Tariq Azeem , Sharif 's spokesman .
Barack Obama congratulated Pakistan on the completion of the election and said the US would work with the country 's new government as an equal partner . ""
The United States stands with all Pakistanis in welcoming this historic peaceful and transparent transfer of civilian power , which is a significant milestone in Pakistan 's democratic progress , "" President Obama said in a statement . ""
By conducting competitive campaigns , freely exercising your democratic rights , and persevering despite intimidation by violent extremists , you have affirmed a commitment to democratic rule that will be critical to achieving peace and prosperity for all Pakistanis for years to come . ""
Sharif , a billionaire steel magnate who came into politics under the wing of a military dictator in the 1980s , is an unlikely symbol of radical change in Pakistan .
During his previous period in government he ordered the abduction of a newspaper editor who had criticised him and pushed to introduce sharia law . ""
He has evolved ever since he was sent into exile , "" said Mehmal Sarfraz , from the South Asian Free Media Association , referring to the 1999 military coup , led by the former army chief Pervez Musharraf , which forced Sharif to quit Pakistan .
Sharif distrusts the country 's generals â€ “ who have toppled three governments since Pakistan was created in 1947 , control vast economic interests and call the shots on the country 's foreign policy .
But despite the military 's muscle , Sharif has made it clear â€ “ including in interviews with Indian journalists who have taken a close interest in his campaign â€ “ that the army is constitutionally subservient to civilian politicians .
Sharif 's ability to reach out across the political divide was reflected by the actions of Ayesha Siddiqa , a prominent academic and analyst , who said that when she went to the polling station on Saturday she had been intending to vote for the left - of - centre Pakistan Peoples party ( PPP ) .
"" I 've always been a PPP supporter and yet I ended up voting for Sharif because who else is there ?
He is the only leader that will try and take back some power from [ the military ] establishment . ""
The military may resent any assertion of civilian power , particularly in the run - up to the end of Nato 's combat mission next year in Afghanistan , a country where Pakistan 's military spies â€ “ for reasons of grand strategy designed to limit Indian influence in the region â€ “ formerly played a key role in bringing the Taliban to power in the 1990s .
Sharif has talked of leaving Afghans to make their own decisions .
Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's president , said on Sunday he had approved of Sharif 's campaign rhetoric that had "" urged friendship and co - operation with Afghanistan "" .
However , critics of Sharif say he is too soft on Pakistani extremists and even militant groups that are ideologically close to the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan , preferring to avoid confrontation with them .
Kickstarting Pakistan 's sluggish economy , which is particularly weighed down by crippling energy shortages , is central to Sharif 's entire programme .
He hopes to bolster growth partly by boosting the feeble levels of trade with India , which would also help improve relations between two countries that have fought three major wars against each other since 1947 .
"" All parties want peace with India , "" said Safraz .
"" But only Sharif can deliver because , as a rightwing Punjabi nationalist , his patriotism can not be questioned .
If he was in the PPP , he would have been called a traitor . ""
Sharif has said he wants to see a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir conflict and has promised to ensure attacks against India are not launched from Pakistan .
Staffers at the politician 's campaign headquarters told the Guardian in April that Sharif , seen as close to Pakistan 's conservative Islamists by many in Delhi , had always been pro - Indian . ""
He started as a businessman after all , "" one said .
As results came in on Saturday night , Sharif reminded reporters he had worked to lessen tensions with India before his ousting by Musharraf .
"" We 'll pick [ up ] the threads where we left , "" he said .
Manmohan Singh , India 's prime minister , spoke to Sharif on Sunday and invited him to visit India at "" a mutually convenient time "" .
Fixing Pakistan 's economic woes , however , will require policies â€ “ not least expansion of the tax net so more people pay â€ “ that could prove unpopular with Sharif 's own business - world supporters .
He will also have to cut unaffordable electricity subsidies , perhaps raising the price for already hard - pressed consumers , as well as undertake radical surgery on Pakistan 's bloated public companies , including the national airline ."
2013-05-13,"The winner of last week 's general election in Pakistan has told former national cricket captain Imran Khan to "" show the sportsman 's spirit "" and drop his complaints of vote - rigging .
Nawaz Sharif , the victorious head of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) which is set to secure a strong working majority in parliament , said the elections had been "" by and large free and fair "" and all sides should accept the results .
Khan 's supporters have complained about alleged efforts to prevent people likely to vote for his Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) party from getting to polling booths in last Saturday 's historic polls , with some activists holding demonstrations to demand re - polling in some constituencies .
Speaking to journalists in his luxurious estate in the outskirts of Lahore , Sharif said that his party had accepted the local election results , where the PML - N had failed to win a majority of seats in provincial assemblies , particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , where Khan 's party won the highest number of seats .
"" We respect their mandate and similarly we expect them to respect our mandate , "" he said .
He also argued the PML - N had accepted the result of the elections in 2008 even though "" our hands had been tied very badly by Mr Musharraf at that time "" .
Pervez Musharraf , the former military dictator who toppled Sharif in a coup in 1999 , was president at the time of the 2008 elections and had ensured there was no "" level playing field "" , Sharif said .
"" But now one party , one party and its leader is alleging that the elections had been rigged , "" he said .
"" I think we should all show the sportsman 's spirit and accept the results of the election . ""
Because we also accept their mandate [ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ] , we could very easily say that the elections there were also rigged , but we do n't say that because we do n't believe that . ""
In his only public statement since Saturday 's contest Khan welcomed the high voter turnout but said the PTI would submit a detailed report on alleged rigging .
Andleeb Abbas , the information secretary for the PTI in Punjab , said Sharif was wrong to call for the complaints to be dropped and said there needed to be fresh polls in affected areas .
"" Imran being a sportsman will stand for what is free and right , "" she said in response to Sharif 's comments .
"" If he is a sportsman and he feels that it is LBW [ leg before wicket ] and Imran does n't ask for a review by the umpire then he is a stupid sportsman . ""
Abbas has been leading a sit - in demonstration in a neighbourhood of Lahore where she says the party has evidence of massive rigging including video that she claimed showed polling station staff marking ballot papers .
"" Every single part of this constituency has unanimously said that the result that came out was a joke compared to what was actually voted , "" she said .
"" Everyone is very , very upset . ""
On Monday the election observation mission fielded by the European Union released preliminary findings that praised the commitment by parties and voters despite efforts by Taliban militants to violently disrupt the polls .
"" Violence by non - state actors unbalanced the playing field and distorted the election process considerably in the concerned locations , "" a statement said .
Michael Gahler , the chief observer , noted twice as many people stood for elections than in 2008 . ""
While various aspects of the election process have improved , there were still shortcomings , "" he said .
"" It is important that the framework for elections is further developed , so that democracy is strengthened . """
2013-05-13,"Imran Khan was uncharacteristically absent from on Sundayas it became clear that his Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf party ( PTI ) had failed to make the huge gains he had promised his followers .
Khan , who is still recovering in hospital after a serious fall at a campaign rally last week , broke his silence 17 hours after Nawaz Sharif had claimed victory .
"" I congratulate the entire nation for taking part in such a massive democratic process , "" he said in a video message .
"" We are moving forward on the path of democracy . ""
But he said his party would formally complain about vote rigging , which some of his followers have blamed for robbing them of the sweeping victory they thought was inevitable .
Nevertheless , the 30 seats the PTI is projected to get is a remarkable breakthrough for a party that has only ever won one seat in parliament before .
Khan has also been credited with politicising many of Pakistan 's vast number of young people and encouraging them to vote in an electrifying election with one of the highest turnouts in Pakistan 's history .
He also looked set to form a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , one of Pakistan 's four provinces , and become the leader of the opposition in parliament after beating the ousted Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) into third place .
However , expectations had been higher among his supporters , particularly after news channels hyped the chances of winning enough seats to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament .
Compounding the sense of disappointment at this failure was the news that he had not got elected in Lahore , capital of Punjab province and one of the handful of other seats he contested around the country .
The victorious PML - N candidate , a PML - N politician called Sardar Ayaz Sadiq , said his opponent had made the mistake of confusing his fame as a former sports star with electability .
"" The people might admire him and worship him as a cricket hero , but when they go into the polling booth they are thinking about practical issues like which party will deliver jobs , "" he said .
He also said Khan 's popularity had been exaggerated by the wild enthusiasm for PTI among the relatively small slither of Pakistan 's many young voters who are affluent and highly educated . ""
He may have got lots of votes among these people in the well - off areas where people are more educated , but he ignored the lower classes who are loyal to us because they have seen us deliver in the last five years , "" he said .
The PML - N has controlled the provincial government in Punjab since 2008 , during which they have pushed through some major development projects , including Pakistan 's first mass transit system and effective public health campaigns against dengue fever . ""
For manual labourers or people earning a salary of less than 20,000 rupees [ £ 130 ] , changing loyalties is a huge decision , "" he said .
Analysts conducting postmortems of the election have also argued that Khan 's popularity was exaggerated by support from elite classes who dominate the country 's media and are active on Twitter ."
2013-05-17,"Last Saturday a crowd of lawyers , journalists and academics gathered in the Lahore drawing room of one of Pakistan 's most famous human rights activists to pick at a buffet dinner and watch the results of the country 's historic elections unfurl on two large televisions .
The guest list was a who 's who of Pakistan 's left - leaning , liberal intelligentsia , the sort of people traditionally expected to vote for the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) .
But there was no hand - wringing when it became clear that Nawaz Sharif , the rightwing business tycoon who once tried to turn Pakistan into an Islamic caliphate , was set to win an unprecedented third term with a thumping majority .
If anything , there was quiet satisfaction . ""
Right now people think he is the best hope the country has , "" said a media doyenne .
""
A decade ago the liberals would have been very wary . ""
During two stints in power in the 1990s , Sharif locked up journalists , tried to enact sharia law and sacked the supreme court .
A billionaire steel magnate , he was dogged by allegations that some of his wealth had come through kickbacks on government contracts , illegal writeoffs of loans and blatant tax evasion .
He reportedly paid just $ 10 income tax in 1999 .
But old foes and longstanding friends say Sharif is a changed man .
They argue that the 63-year - old leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) is the best equipped to tackle a daunting in - tray , including a failing economy , chronic energy shortages and an ever - rising tide of extremism .
Sharif has scored full marks for refusing to conspire with the army to bring down the last government , something of a tradition in a country that has seen three bouts of military rule .
Instead he chose to allow the stumbling coalition led by the PPP to become the first elected government ever to finish a full five - year term .
He earned the mockery of critics who accused him of running a "" friendly opposition "" .
Such patience is quite a change for a man who went into politics in the late 1970s to defend family interests after his father 's metal factories were nationalised by the PPP .
Throwing in their lot with Zia - ul - Haq , the military dictator who ruled for 10 years after 1978 , the Sharifs regained their property .
In the 1980s , Nawaz served as finance minister and chief minister of Punjab , Pakistan 's richest and populous province .
He became prime minister first from 1990 - 1993 , when he specialised in getting into fights with anyone who stood in his way , including President Ghulam Ishaq Khan , who tried to fire Sharif before conspiring with the army to force fresh elections .
In his second government in 1997 he took care to dispense with opponents , including an army chief , General Jehangir Karamat , whom he replaced with a handpicked general called Pervez Musharraf .
That was a mistake
â€ “ Musharraf would later arrest Sharif after mounting a coup against him in October 1999 .
Sharif says his entire outlook was changed by the misery of arrest and exile in Saudi Arabia and the UK .
To his immense anguish he was banned from returning to Pakistan to bury his beloved father .
He finally returned in 2007 a transformed man and not only , as his enemies love to point out , because his bald scalp had gained hair transplants .
He was convinced that Pakistan could succeed only if the military stopped interrupting periods of democratic rule .
During 14 months in prison he caught a BBC programme in which senior Indian politicians were arguing over their country 's biggest achievement since independence . ""
After an hour and a half of debate , the consensus was that the big achievement of India is that India has upheld the sanctity of the ballot box , "" Sharif told Newsweek Pakistan recently .
"" Nobody said the nuclear bomb .
Nobody said roads , bridges and highways .
Nobody said anything else . ""
For all his efforts to protect Pakistan 's fragile democracy , Sharif remains obsessed with big infrastructure projects , some of which are of questionable value .
During his second term he built a motorway from Lahore to Islamabad , lavishing time on personally inspecting progress .
Today it is a gloriously smooth ride , but largely empty .
Critics say the motorway was built 60 miles longer than necessary to please political allies who wanted it to come through their constituencies .
He is promising more motorways and a bullet train from Karachi to Peshawar .
In the past five years , with the PML - N controlling the Punjab provincial government , he has been criticised for expensive schemes , including diverting much of the education budget towards a handful of showpiece "" Daanish "" schools for underprivileged children .
A fan of the free market , he hopes to overhaul Pakistan 's subsidy - devouring state industries , and favours the privatisation of the railways and national airline .
He is also determined to restart efforts made under his last government to improve relations with India .
The two countries have fought three major wars with each other since 1947 .
Today it is almost impossible for Indians and Pakistanis to travel through their once common home .
Trade is negligible and Pakistan is forced to spend huge chunks of its meagre public revenues on defence .
This year Sharif told Caravan magazine that India and Pakistan had become trapped in an arms race .
"" We waste all our money on F-16s .
They buy tanks , we also buy tanks .
We also waste our resources .
Both countries have wasted billions of dollars into building up defence , "" he said .
"" I think we should sit down with India .
Both countries â€ “ you have to do it together
â€ “ just as America and the Soviet Union figured it out
, India and Pakistan need to figure it out , too . ""
The implicit challenge to Pakistan 's vast defence budget is extremely bold .
Few politicians dare to take on the all - powerful military establishment and risk having their patriotism called into question .
Just days before last week 's election
Sharif told an Indian journalist he would order an inquiry into the 2008 attacks on Mumbai , which Pakistan 's military intelligence service has been accused of masterminding . ""
Sometimes conservatives are good at making peace with their enemies , "" said Mushahid Hussain , a member of Sharif 's cabinet in his second government , but now a senator for another party . ""
Mr Sharif is from heartland Punjab , from a right - of - centre party with Islamic colouring .
That puts him in a more credible position to take the peace process forward without being attacked for appeasement .
""
Some fear the euphoria of the general election is clouding people 's memories of Sharif , the weak administrator with a poor eye for detail .
He was accused of letting his generals run rings around him when they sent troops across the line of control dividing the region of Kashmir in the summer of 1999 to occupy strategically important outposts in Kargil district .
The disastrous move brought the two nuclear states to the brink of war .
Sharif said he was kept in ignorance . ""
He was briefed but he just could n't understand what they were telling him , "" said Ayaz Amir , an acerbic ex - MP who recently quit the PML - N.
"" Reportedly he just commented that the sandwiches were very good . ""
Although he is now promoted as an economic saviour , by 1999 he was presiding over a business climate weakened by the international sanctions imposed after Sharif 's fateful decision to test a nuclear weapon in May 1998 .
"" People forget that when Musharraf took over there was a national celebration , people handed out sweets to each other in the markets , "" said Shaukat Qadir , a retired brigadier .
"" There was this feeling that Sharif had not been taking the country in the right direction , he was n't governing well and he was n't delivering on the economy . ""
Some argue that Pakistan has changed at least as much as the portly prime minister since 1999 .
Autocratic rule is far trickier , given the emergence of a fiercely independent judiciary and a pugnacious , multichannel media .
Peace with India may be a little easier because Pakistan now has the bomb , said Hussain . ""
[ Nuclear weapons gave ] Pakistan an injection of national self - confidence , and it also took away the threat of invasion and the fear of being gobbled up by a larger , threatening neighbour .
After 9/11 the principal threat for Pakistan is not from India but from within , from terrorism and extremism inside Pakistan . ""
Sharif 's attitude towards extremists remains a concern for many .
The PML - N has been accused of turning a blind eye to sectarian terrorists in its heartland of Punjab in return for being left alone .
Defenders say the PML - N simply had no choice if it was going to win the seats it needed . ""
He has always had these rightwing leanings , "" said Raza Rabbani , a senior senator with the PPP .
"" The temptation was there in the past to appease his rightwing Islamist constituency by saying ' I have brought sharia law . ' ""
In 1999 Sharif tried to turn Pakistan into an Islamic caliphate ruled by sharia , the seventh - century Islamic legal system , with himself as the powerful ruler .
Rabbani said he was a "" little sceptical "" that Sharif had fundamentally changed his politics .
Others are prepared to give Sharif the benefit of the doubt .
One former enemy said the years living in exile in Saudi Arabia had partly cured Sharif of any enthusiasm he might have once had for giving religion an even bigger role in national affairs .
Sharif has said he regrets his strong support for the Taliban government in Afghanistan in the late 1990s , saying Pakistan should no longer aspire to meddle in the affairs of its smaller neighbour . ""
Like most Pakistanis he is quite a good Muslim in terms of belief and basic rituals like prayer and going to Mecca , "" said Hussain . ""
But in cultural terms he is quite relaxed .
He likes music and movies and has a good sense of humour .
He is not your average type of serious , sulking fundo . ""
But Sharif is going to have to work hard to maintain the goodwill that gave him a landslide victory on a historically high turnout . ""
He really won because the [ PPP government ] was so bumbling and inept that it made the PML - N look good , "" said Amir . ""
Very soon the sound of clapping will die down .
Election victory euphoria will subside and reality will take over . ""

2013-05-29,"Just days after Barack Obama announced new restrictions on the use of drones , one of the CIA 's unmanned aircraft is reported to have killed the deputy leader of the Pakistani Taliban – one of the most significant strikes for the controversial programme in months .
It was the first drone strike since Pakistanis voted overwhelmingly on 11 May for political parties strongly opposed to the US use of drones .
It could complicate the first days in office of Nawaz Sharif , the incoming prime minister who has vowed to open peace talks with insurgents and is due to assume office on 5 June .
Pakistani security officials claimed Wali ur - Rehman was among the four people killed when a missile launched in the early hours of Wednesday from a drone struck a house in Chamsa , a village a mile from Miranshah , the political capital of North Waziristan , a Taliban stronghold .
However , the Taliban refused to concede the death of Rehman , the most senior military commander of the Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) .
A man claiming to be Rehman 's driver also vociferously denied that the leader had been killed , but admitted other militants had died in the missile strike .
In recent years , militants , particularly senior leaders , have taken great pains to avoid congregating in houses , in efforts to protect themselves from strikes in North Waziristan .
However , in 2013 the number of strikes has steeply declined .
Information about drone strikes is notoriously hard to verify .
The Pakistani military and insurgent groups prevent journalists and investigators from visiting attack sites .
Claims by intelligence sources can be inaccurate or deliberately designed to deceive .
Despite media reports suggesting Obama intended to severely rein in the use of lethal drone strikes , the president made clear in an address at the National Defence University last week that they would have to continue in Pakistan in the runup to the end of the Nato combat mission in Afghanistan next year .
He said drones were needed to kill senior al - Qaida leaders who could not be captured , but also "" against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces "" in Afghanistan .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry released a statement repeating a familiar stance on drone attacks that the government has long publicly opposed , despite considerable evidence of past complicity in the programme .
It said : "" The government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counterproductive , entail loss of innocent civilian lives , have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty , territorial integrity and international law . ""
But there will be few among Pakistan 's security officials who will mourn the death of Rehman , who has been responsible for huge amounts of bloodshed in Pakistan , including many deadly attacks on soldiers battling insurgency in the country .
Although Hakimullah Mehsud is head of the TTP , analysts say Rehman has been in charge of much of its activities , particularly planning and ordering attacks .
He was the alleged mastermind of the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008 that killed more than 50 people .
In 2009 , Pakistan offered a bounty for anyone who captured him , dead or alive .
Although primarily focused on attacking the Pakistani state , Rehman has also been involved in assaults on US forces in Afghanistan , including an attack on a US base in Khost in 2009 that killed seven Americans .
That means he fulfils one of the conditions in an unclassified summary of the new guidelines drawn up by the White House : that a target "" poses a continuing , imminent threat to US persons "" .
The document also said drone strikes would only be used when capture "" is not feasible "" and "" no other reasonable alternative exists to address the threat effectively "" .
In 2010 , the US declared Rehman a "" specially designated global terrorist "" and offered a $ 5 m reward for information leading to his arrest .
On the campaign trail , Sharif complained about the lethal strikes , saying they breached the sovereignty of Pakistan , although he was not as outspoken as his opponent Imran Khan , who vowed to shoot down US drones if he were elected .
Sharif has also announced his intention to engage the TTP in peace talks , and has approached an extremist mullah with strong Taliban links to act as an envoy .
On Wednesday the country 's political TV talk shows gave little prominence to the first drone strike since the historic elections , focusing instead on national issues .
Some of the political heat had already been removed from the issue after the frequency of drone attacks fell dramatically this year .
There have also been far fewer credible reports of civilian casualties , with many analysts suggesting the programme has become more accurate .
Pakistan has been hit by 355 such attacks since 2004 , according to the New America Foundation , a US - based thinktank .
Last Thursday Obama promised strikes would fall further as Nato troops leave Afghanistan and because of the success of US policy in reducing the strength of al - Qaida ."
2013-06-24,"The former military dictator Pervez Musharraf should be tried for high treason , Pakistan 's prime minister said , raising the prospect of a serious clash between the country 's civilian and military masters .
A treason trial would mark the first time in Pakistan 's history that a military ruler has been held accountable , and the decision was cheered by many who believe the country 's overweening army needs to accept the primacy of elected politicians .
The announcement by Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan 's recently elected prime minister , ended months of speculation over whether the government would dare take on a former president and army chief who could face the death penalty if found guilty of overturning the country 's constitution .
Only the government is able to try someone for treason , for which a special court would have to be established .
Although Musharraf is currently under house arrest and has negligible support in the country , many observers have long claimed the still powerful military elite would never allow a civilian court to try one of its former chiefs .
"" Musharraf is still more popular in the army than [ his successor General Ashfaq Parvez ] Kayani , "" said a lawyer , Chaudry Faisal Fareed .
He said Sharif risked "" opening a Pandora 's Box "" if the trial expanded to drag in other high - ranking officers .
Musharraf 's actions amounted to high treason , Sharif told parliament on Monday , promising that the former dictator had to "" answer for all his deeds in court "" . ""
The prime minister is under oath to protect , preserve and defend the constitution and it is implicit in his oath that his government ensures that persons guilty of acts under Article 6 are brought to justice , "" he said .
Pakistan 's attorney general said the government would bring treason charges against Musharraf for imposing emergency rule in 2007 .
In a statement , Musharraf 's spokesman said the Sharif government was "" demonstrating recklessness in its intention to pursue unwarranted treason charges "" .
The statement said : "" The people of Pakistan will not tolerate this circus , which is primarily meant to create a diversion .
It is taking focus away from addressing serious challenges faced by the nation and can result in unnecessary tension amongst the various pillars of state and possibly destabilise the country .
"" The development adds to the legal troubles Musharraf has attracted since his ill - judged decision to return from self - imposed exile in March in the hope of running for election .
Apparently deluded about his popularity in Pakistan , which he said he judged from his number of Facebook friends , he did not receive the mass welcome he had hoped for .
Election officials snuffed out any hope that he might make a political comeback when he was banned from standing in last May 's election .
Private prosecutions were brought against him for his alleged role in the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 , the killing of a prominent tribal separatist leader in 2006 and the detention of senior judges in 2007 during the tail end of his presidency .
In the view of many lawyers , Musharraf is likely to be successful in defending himself against those charges , but treason charges are "" an open and shut case "" , according to Fareed .
Talat Masood , a retired army officer , said a trial was inevitable given that Musharraf had alienated two of the country 's most powerful men : Sharif , whom he toppled in a 1999 coup , and Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , the activist chief justice who was the object of the then president 's battle against senior judges in 2007 .
"" It 's a gamble , no doubt about it , "" said Masood .
"" Sharif is taking a certain element of risk because the fight against militancy is the greatest challenge Pakistan faces right now and he needs the military for that . ""
Some have already detected army meddling in the issue , including Musharraf supporters ' attack on lawyers outside a court hearing in April .
In May , a senior lawyer involved in the investigations into Bhutto 's murder was shot dead as he drove to work in Islamabad .
Many assume that even if the trial does go ahead , a political deal will be hatched to spare Musharraf 's life , or even allow him to leave the country to live out his days in exile .
One possible scenario might see the intervention of Saudi Arabia , one of Pakistan 's closest allies .
Such an outcome would be rich in irony given that Sharif was given exile in the kingdom after he Musharraf deposed him .
Akhtar Hussain , a former vice - president of Pakistan 's bar association , said it was likely Musharraf would ultimately receive a presidential pardon after a long legal process that is likely to stretch into 2014 and beyond .
Merely putting the former general on trial would mark an important milestone for Pakistan , he said .
"" The key thing is the initiation of the trial itself , which is very important for the standing of democratic institutions in this country .
The result , whether acquitted or ultimately pardoned is a different matter . """
2013-06-30,"David Cameron is advising the newly elected Pakistani prime minister to revive relations with Afghanistan amid fears in Downing Street that its so - called "" Af - Pak "" strategy is losing momentum .
On the second day of his overseas visit , Cameron became the first western leader to visit Nawaz Sharif since his election in the first peaceful and democratic transition of power in Pakistan since independence in 1947 .
The prime minister hailed Sharif 's election .
He said : "" He 's in a strong position because Pakistan is having and has had effectively this democratic transition which is a huge bonus for Pakistan and will raise its profile in a thoroughly good way in the eyes of the world .
He won a decisive election victory and I 'll congratulate him on that .
I think it puts him in a strong position .
"" There are concerns in Downing Street that Sharif may be in danger of neglecting relations with Afghanistan amid historic and continuing enmity between the two neighbours .
Relations hit a new low this month when an Afghan diplomat , Naqeebullah Ibrahimkhel , was shot in the leg in Islamabad .
Speaking at the Pakistani prime minister 's official residence , Cameron said both countries had a shared interest in the "" battle against terrorism "" .
He said : "" This is a battle that requires a tough and uncompromising security response .
But it is also a battle that has to go so much wider . ""
Countering extremism and radicalisation , investing in education , tackling poverty , dealing in all the issues that can fuel extremism and radicalisation . ""
He added : "" In this battle the friends of Pakistan are friends of Britain and the enemies of Pakistan are enemies of Britain .
We will stand together and conduct this fight against extremism and terrorism . ""
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , is suspicious of the role played by Pakistan in the opening of a Taliban office in Doha , Qatar .
Karzai was outraged when the Taliban described it as the mission of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan – the Taliban 's name for the country during its period of rule .
Sharif has named trade , relations with India and the battle against extremism as his three main priorities .
He wants to seek peace with the Pakistan Taliban , allies of the Afghan Taliban .
Cameron , who met President Asif Ali Zardari on his arrival in Pakistan on Saturday night , is making clear that two of Sharif 's priorities – battling extremism and stabilising relations with its nuclear rival India – would be helped if relations with Afghanistan were put on a more stable footing .
The British prime minister said : "" I think that increasingly Pakistan knows that it 's in its best interest to have a stable Afghanistan as its neighbour and it supports the peace process and that 's what the trilateral meetings I 've held have been all about .
From everything I 've heard , and I 've spoken to him [ Sharif ] on the telephone a couple of times , he fully supports that .
We 'll have a very constructive view . ""
Cameron hoped to achieve a breakthrough in relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan when he held a trilateral summit at Chequers in February involving Zardari and Karzai .
But officials believe the momentum has slipped and relations are deteriorating .
Britain believes Pakistan must play a pivotal role as Nato prepares to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .
Cameron said : "" Our approach is to have this very clear boost to Afghan security by funding their armed forces and police .
The peace process then is additional to that .
There are some difficulties but there are some good prospects and I think Pakistan will want to help with that .
"" The prime minister said Sharif 's election was a good chance for a new start and played down concerns that the leader of the Muslim League , criticised for a soft approach to the Taliban , could not be even handed .
Cameron said : "" I think he has the credibility of having just been elected with a full term ahead of him , with Pakistan 's long term interests in mind , and I think that gives him a certain power and influence . """
2013-08-13,"When Pakistan 's new government allowed a five - year moratorium on capital punishment to expire in June it had hoped the move would burnish its reputation for being tough on law and order .
But the decision has enraged the Taliban , which issued a statement on Tuesday promising to target the ruling Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) if executions of militants on death row are carried out .
The Punjab wing of the Pakistani Taliban said the PML - N , led by the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , would be pulled into a "" swamp of blood "" if any of their comrades were executed .
"" Implementation on executions will be a declaration of war from the PML - N and it will have to pay a price for it at all costs , "" said the statement , which was signed by Asmatullah Muavia , the Punjabi Taliban spokesman .
The statement said "" death warrants of our comrades have been issued in Punjab "" , the country 's most populous province where militant networks have largely avoided head - on confrontations with political leaders , focusing instead on sectarian killings .
It is not clear how many militants are on death row in the province , but two from the banned Sunni group Lashkar - e - Jhangvi are due to be executed in neighbouring Sindh next week .
In July the interior ministry said 450 convicts were awaiting execution .
At the time the moratorium lapsed the government ignored the objections of domestic and foreign human rights activists , but it may quietly think again given the Taliban 's proven track record of murdering politicians whom it dislikes .
The statement by the Punjabi Taliban urged the PML - N to "" remember the fate of the Awami National Party ( ANP ) "" , a secular and anti - Taliban Pashtun party from the restless western tribal areas which was targeted during the spring election campaign .
Suicide bombers succeeded in killing a number of senior politicians and party workers , forcing the ANP to conduct much of its campaigning behind closed doors .
By contrast , the PML - N and other conservative and religious leaning parties were free to campaign normally with mass public rallies .
The statement said the executions would shut down any possibility of peace talks with the Taliban , a stated aim of the PML - N government .
It also warned against another key government objective of improving relations with India .
It said the PML - N and the Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf , a rightwing party led by Imran Khan , risked being drawn into full - blown conflict with the Taliban by "" short - sighted people in the intelligence agencies "" ."
2013-08-20,"Compared with the announcement in June in which the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , declared his government 's intention to press charges against Pervez Musharraf for treason , Tuesday 's court indictment against the former military ruler for murder in connection with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a sideshow .
Few analysts believe there is hard evidence linking Mr Musharraf to Bhutto 's murder , although a UN report concluded that he failed to make serious efforts to ensure her safety .
The treason charges , if they materialise , are a different matter , as the legal case that he subverted the constitution when he imposed emergency rule in late 2007 is relatively easy to make .
Mr Musharraf already faces charges in four cases related to his period of rule .
One way or another , it amounts to the same thing : putting a once untouchable general on trial .
Pakistan 's powerful military did not support his return from exile in London but they would also not want to see one of their own dragged through the courts .
Much has changed in his absence .
The chief justice , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , with whom Mr Musharraf feuded for most of his time in office , is about to retire .
There has been an unprecedented outbreak of criticism against the chief justice , from within his own ranks , the Lahore High Bar Association , and from the politician Imran Khan .
Mr Chaudhry no longer walks on water as far as many of his activist lawyers are concerned .
It is likely that his replacement will not be as awkward a figure for Mr Sharif as Mr Chaudhry was to the former government .
More importantly , the army , too , is about to have a new leader .
In his forthcoming book , Getting Away With Murder , the man who led the UN investigation in Bhutto 's assassination , Heraldo Muñoz , describes the outgoing army chief , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , as a professional soldier of independent mind .
Mr Muñoz said that the general expressed doubts to him about the claim by his former boss Mr Musharraf that Bhutto had been assassinated by the Pakistani Taliban .
He also spoke fondly of Bhutto , saying she had grown as a politician .
All this further muddies the waters about who was really behind her assassination .
The author himself concludes that almost everyone played a part .
Mr Musharraf was ill advised to return to Pakistan , where his political support has evaporated and where he spends his time under house arrest .
Even with a new army chief and chief justice , Mr Sharif will have to balance the demand to seek justice for emergency rule , with the needs of a military that remains the most powerful institution in the land .
A presidential pardon for Mr Musharraf , if convicted , could be one way out .
Establishing the rule of law is going to take somewhat longer ."
2013-09-27,"Three months after he came to power , Nawaz Sharif 's counter - terrorism policy is in tatters .
He was elected on a promise to hold peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban .
An all - parties conference called on the prime minister to initiate a dialogue with all "" stakeholders "" .
The response of some of those with an interest and concern in the outcome ( the dictionary definition ) was to blow up 81 Christian worshippers outside a church in Peshawar on Sunday and follow that up yesterday by bombing a bus carrying government employees in the same province , killing at least 17 people .
Although Tehreek - e - Taliban ( TTP ) denied involvement in one of the worst attacks ever made on the Christian minority in the country , a previously unknown group , going under the Taliban umbrella , did claim responsibility .
Although Christians are frequently targeted – in March , a mob swarmed through Lahore 's Joseph Colony , setting 150 houses ablaze over alleged blasphemy charges against one resident –
they are by no means the only minority to reap the full force of fundamentalist fury .
Since last year , over 750 Shia Muslims have been killed in targeted attacks across Pakistan , many from the Hazaras in Balochistan .
Figures like these have by now lost all meaning .
Since 2001 , well over 40,000 Pakistanis have perished in this maelstrom .
It is the responsibility of any government , let alone a popularly elected civilian one , to attempt to halt this weekly carnage .
Mr Sharif 's decision to release Abdul Ghani Baradar , the Taliban 's former second - in - command , to initiate a peace process between Kabul and the Afghan Taliban , was rightly welcomed .
That war , as we have said many times , can only be solved at the negotiating table , and Pakistan 's involvement is essential .
The drone attacks , which account for up to 3,000 deaths ( although these figures are disputed , too ) , only prolong the agony .
But there is a big distance to be travelled from that position to pretending that the Pakistani state can accommodate the agenda of the TTP , al - Qaida and other militant groups .
It is also Mr Sharif 's responsibility to protect religious minorities and uphold basic rights , as Human Rights Watch said in its recent letter to him .
The assumption that buying space for the Afghan Taliban is going to help with the TTP is erroneous .
The public discourse in Pakistan suffers from a false binary that the TTP is a function of the drone strikes .
The challenge it poses the state is more fundamental than that .
Fundamentalism is a product of decades of official complicity , cowardice and appeasement .
Sooner or later , Mr Sharif will be forced to realise that .
Until then , he is merely kicking the can down the road ."
2013-10-23,"Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif added to growing international pressure over US drone killings on Wednesday by calling on Barack Obama to end all strikes in his country .
At the end of a long - awaited US trip designed to smooth growing tensions between the US and Pakistan , Sharif told reporters that he had "" emphasised the need to end such strikes "" , which are estimated to have killed between 2,525 and 3,613 people in Pakistan since 2004 .
But a 2,500-word joint statement issued by the White House after the one - on - one meeting in Washington and attributed to the two leaders did not mention drone attacks , referring only to a need to respect "" sovereignty and territorial integrity "" .
It said President Obama also "" conveyed appreciation for Pakistan 's internal and regional security challenges "" .
Both leaders refused to take questions at the end of their two - hour meeting in the Oval Office .
In prepared remarks , Obama acknowledged that there will "" inevitably be some tensions â€ ¦ and some misunderstandings between our two countries "" but insisted the US - Pakistan relationship will continue to be a "" source of strength "" .
"" It 's a challenge , "" Obama added .
"" It 's not easy . ""
Pakistani criticism of the US drone program is known to irritate some in Washington defence circles , who believe that many of the attacks are secretly sanctioned or even assisted by officials in Islamabad , and regard the public condemnation as hypocritical .
But the White House is also facing its own charges of double standards after detailed reports published this week by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch accused the US of violating international law by failing to prevent civilian casualties during the attacks .
Analysts close to the administration say the talks between Pakistan and the US may mark a key moment in the drones program , especially since Obama has already indicated â€ “ during a speech in May â€ “ that he has a preference in future for capturing terrorist suspects where possible .
"" There are always two discussions on drones ; one behind closed doors , "" said Karl Inderfurth , a former assistant US secretary of state for the region now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
"" The real question is whether there is some private understanding about the need to curb the attacks .
The numbers have come down since Obama 's speech to the National Defense University in May , but not to zero . ""
Inderfurth said the real significance of Sharif 's visit to Washington was to smooth tensions between the two governments before a bumpy withdrawal of US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan . ""
The most important part of the meeting is the fact that they are meeting . ""
he added .
"" It is important that Obama establishes some kind of rapport , so that when things go bad , as they are likely to , he has a personal relationship with his new interlocutor in Islamabad . ""
In particular , Washington is keen for Pakistan to do more to encourage Taliban participation in peace talks with the Afghan government .
Speaking after his meeting with Obama , Sharif said : "" Let there be no doubt about our commitment for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan .
This result remains unwavering .
"" The joint statement added : "" The leaders affirmed their commitment to the Afghan - led and Afghan - owned peace and reconciliation process as the surest way to end violence and bring lasting stability to Afghanistan and the region . ""
Acknowledging Pakistan 's efforts to support an inclusive reconciliation process in which Afghans determine the future of their country , both Leaders called on the Taliban to join the political process and enter into dialogue with the Afghan government . """
2013-10-23,"On Wednesday , Pakistan 's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif meets with US President Barack Obama to discuss what has been termed a "" very important "" and strategic bilateral relationship .
A "" reset "" certainly looks necessary .
The US - Pakistan relationship deteriorated sharply during 2011 - 2012 , thanks to a series of adverse events : the Raymond Davis episode , the violation of Pakistani sovereignty for the Bin Laden raid in Abbottabad , the killing of 24 soldiers at the Salala checkpost , the blockade of Nato supply lines , and then , of course , the delay of any US apology over the original incident .
With the US withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 2014 , a need to "" normalize "" relations and achieve some stability in the region is imperative for both allies â€ “ the stakes are too high for both parties .
So , this meeting may appear significant in many ways .
But in Pakistan , it has failed to garner much enthusiasm .
Prime Minister Sharif holds a heavy mandate in Pakistan 's National Assembly , and specifically in Punjab â€ “ Pakistan 's biggest province , both in terms of size and population .
( Punjan also matters because the province is the key recruiting ground for army personnel . )
Despite this , Sharif has faced a wave of domestic political criticism from the moment he embarked on his US trip .
Last month , Sharif convened an "" all parties conference "" , ostensibly to tackle the problems of militancy and terrorism in Pakistan .
The APC sees talks with the Pakistani Taliban as key to any settlement , but opponents have criticized Sharif for not being serious about implementing talks with Taliban leaders and for using the APC as just a photo opportunity .
True , if Sharif 's motive was to demonstrate to the international community that he is a strong leader who enjoys united political support and works through consensus , that image - building may not be completely accurate .
Then , the PM 's decision to visit the US State Department to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry , before his summit with President Obama , has left Pakistani diplomats and commentators in shock .
To outside observers , for the Pakistani prime minister to visit the US secretary of state may seem unexceptionable , but in a country where the status and distinctions between ministerial roles matters a great deal , such a breach of protocol has led to severe opprobrium back in Pakistan .
For a strategic relationship , it is essential that an implicit equality be understood from the outset ; even if it is not a partnership of true equality , it matters that it is at least perceived to be so .
Criticism has also mounted over Sharif 's hesitation to appoint the next army chief , leading many analysts to predict that Sharif will take orders from the US over the appointment .
As a consequence , the next head of Pakistan 's army may very well be perceived as America 's pawn â€ “ meaning that Sharif 's indecision has undermined the appointment and has paved the way for a new political disaster .
Adding fuel to the fire , the low - key restoration of $ 1.6bn in US military and economic aid to bolster relations and fight terrorism has raised a flurry of questions .
US military assistance was halted , the State Department told Congress , after the deterioration of relations in 2011 - 2012 .
The timing now of the aid being restored â€ “ on the very day
Sharif left Islamabad for Washington â€ “ has been viewed with skepticism in Pakistan .
It looked to many as though the US was straightforwardly "" buying off "" Sharif before the talks even commenced .
But Sharif has been lucky .
On the eve of his meeting with President Obama , Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued their damning report questioning the legality of US drones attacks in Pakistan 's tribal areas ( and Yemen ) .
Given how inflammatory the issue of civilian deaths as a result of the US targeted killing progam has been in Pakistan , the renewed international focus on US drone attacks has put Sharif in a stronger position than perhaps he was expecting .
Though he touched on other issues like the energy crisis , economic opportunities and regional stability , Sharif used an appearance this week at the US Institute of Peace to deliver a tough message on drone attacks and the violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty .
In fact , because of crippling economic conditions in Pakistan , improving bilateral relations is particularly important .
For domestic consumption , Sharif may assert a stance against aid and for trade , by demanding market access .
In reality , Pakistan is hardly in a position to refuse aid .
It is estimated that the "" war on terror "" has cost Pakistan approximately $ 100bn in losses and economic stagnation â€ “ losses that dwarf the $ 68bn in aid Pakistan has received over the past seven decades .
While Sharif may push on drones , energy and the economy , it is clear that the US focus is on security , terrorism and stability following withdrawal from Afghanistan .
Public outrage about the effects of the "" war on terror "" in Pakistan is understandable : expectations are running high that Sharif will get some tangible economic benefits from this week 's diplomacy .
Animosity has defined the relationship over the past few years .
With so much at stake over the 2014 US withdrawal from Afghanistan , the two countries are still at loggerheads .
The meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Sharif is seen by both as an important opportunity to renew a commitment to work together for peace and stability .
Yet , both parties are also preoccupied with pressing domestic issues â€ “ with Sharif , in particular , facing mounting criticism over the APC and US aid .
The issue of drones is the one trump card in his hand .
Given the domestic pressure Sharif is under , he will have to play it well ."
2013-11-27,"Pakistan 's prime minister has appointed a new army chief closely associated with the country 's recent struggles against domestic militancy , following weeks of delay and speculation over who would fill the powerful role .
Nawaz Sharif announced that Lieutenant General Raheel Sharif , the brother of one of Pakistan 's most decorated war heroes , would take command of the nation 's 600,000-strong army , after the retirement of Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , a former military spymaster who ran Pakistan 's army for an unprecedented double term .
The new chief will not only control the country 's nuclear arsenal , he will also have a deciding say on Pakistan 's policy towards Afghanistan during a critical period that will see the end of the Nato combat mission in the country .
A close ally of former military dictator Pervez Musharraf , Sharif in recent years has held senior roles running the army 's training and education programmes as well as being intimately involved in re - focusing Pakistan 's army on counterinsurgency warfare against militant groups in the tribal west of the country .
His brother Shabbir was killed in action during Pakistan 's 1971 war with India that led to East Pakistan breaking away to form Bangladesh .
Hamid Hussain , an expert on Pakistan 's army , said Raheel Sharif was "" a below - average officer "" not well suited to lead a country in the midst of a bloody war against militants . ""
He 's nice , a gentleman but not regarded very highly , "" he said .
"" Most people in the army think his professional ceiling is at the major general level . ""
New army chiefs are usually announced six to eight weeks before they take command , giving them time to prepare for the job .
But Nawaz Sharif , the country 's three - times prime minister , refused to make a quick decision , instead waiting until the very last minute and only calling his new chief into a meeting on Wednesday morning .
The decision is particularly fateful for Sharif , whose previous term as prime minister was ended by a military coup
d'Ã
© tat in November 1999 .
The general who seized power , Musharraf , had been handpicked as army chief by Sharif just a year previously .
The drawn - out decision - making process has prompted speculation that the prime minister was deliberately attempting to stand up to a military establishment that is over - mighty
and , he believes , a source of many of the country 's problems .
However , according to one senior former colleague of Kayani , the delay was caused because Sharif had seriously considered re - appointing Kayani for a third term .
In the months since Sharif came to power , the prime minister had become convinced Kayani was committed to stopping the army from interfering in civilian affairs : "" The overall policy of the army during this period under Kayani has been to allow the politicians to take the driving seat again , "" said the former colleague .
When the option of reappointing Kayani ran into staunch criticism and had to be dropped , Sharif and his advisers were at a loss for whom to pick , he added .
Keeping Kayani would have been immensely controversial given the widespread disgruntlement within the army over his second term .
Analysts do not expect a radical shift in direction under Lt Gen Sharif , who reflects the outlook of an army moulded by six years of Kayani .
Lt Gen Sharif was closely involved in developing new counterinsurgency tactics designed for combating militants .
He also worked on efforts to confront India 's "" Cold Start "" doctrine , which enables the Indian army to attack Pakistan at short notice .
The focus on domestic militancy is unlikely to change , even though Pakistan 's civilian rulers are resisting army calls for a military operation in North Waziristan , a pocket of territory controlled by the Taliban and al - Qaida affiliates .
All analysts agree that a military takeover is unimaginable as the army is still recovering from the reputational damage done by Musharraf 's period in power and other major embarrassments , particularly the deep penetration into Pakistani territory of US special forces in 2011 during the mission to kill Osama bin Laden .
It is not known whether Kayani , who was ranked as 28th most powerful man in the world by Forbes Magazine last year , will be given an official position after retiring on Thursday .
But it is likely that the outgoing army chief â€ “ an avid golfer and president of the Pakistan Golf Association â€
“ will spend plenty of time at a custom - built mansion overlooking the greens of one of the country 's finest courses ."
2014-02-02,"Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , the youthful heir apparent to one of south Asia 's most famous dynasties , has launched a scathing attack on his political opponents who he said must stop "" making excuses "" for Taliban violence .
The 25-year - old son of the assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto said Nawaz Sharif , the country 's current leader , and the opposition politician Imran Khan , were "" letting down the people "" by not backing firm military action against the Taliban . ""
Perhaps they are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome , "" Bhutto Zardari said , referring to cases of hostages who sympathise with or even assist their captors .
"" There is no reason why the national leaders , the so - called leaders , should not speak out against people who are murdering our citizens , murdering our armed forces and claiming responsibility . ""
The remarks are likely to further burnish his reputation as both a brash new arrival on Pakistan 's political scene but also the most outspoken politician in the country on the issue of militancy and extremism .
He does not sit in parliament , but wields significant influence over the Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) , of which he is "" patron in chief "" .
The party has been led in the past by his grandfather , his mother â€ “ who was killed while campaigning in 2007 â€ “ and his father , Asif Ali Zardari .
Khan and other right - wing politicians have been criticised for handling the Pakistani Taliban with kid gloves , in a so - far unsuccessful bid to lure them into peace talks .
On Saturday the Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , as the country 's deadly coalition of militants is known , signalled its appreciation of Khan 's approach by announcing the movement wanted him to sit on a committee with four extremist clerics known to sympathise with militant aims .
The TTP said Khan and the others could represent its interests in peace talks with the government .
Khan brushed off the embarrassing endorsement , saying "" the TTP should select their own Taliban representatives for the peace talks "" .
Even mass - casualty suicide attacks on civilians have at times elicited only meek condemnations .
Many politicians are reluctant even to identify the culprits as the TTP .
Bhutto Zardari said the tactic had been disastrous , emboldening extremists to target civilians , including Malala Yousafzai , the schoolgirl education activist who nearly died in 2012 after being shot in the head by a Taliban assassin .
"" This is why people like Malala become targets because the politicians , or the so - called leaders of this country , ca n't find the courage to speak out when a 16-year - old girl could .
If we all speak in one voice , they ca n't kill us all , "" he said .
The TTP has used a highly effective intimidation campaign against liberal and left - leaning political parties and journalists to silence many of its natural critics .
Bhutto Zardari said he could speak out only because of the vast security operation that surrounds him at all times and heavily restricts his travel in Pakistan , where he spends much of his time at his fortress - like family compound in Karachi .
"" I have a lot of security â€ “
I lost my mother to the Taliban because of a lack of security â€ “ and that explains partly why I can be so vocal , "" he said .
"" But so does Imran Khan .
Nawaz Sharif is the prime minister of Pakistan , Shahbaz Sharif is the chief minister of Punjab .
They all have more security than I do .
They have no excuse . ""
In the past Khan has said strident rhetoric might endanger the lives of his supporters and party activists .
Bhutto Zardari has shown no such caution , even though he hopes thousands of members of the public will be attracted to numerous cultural events he has organised across Sindh in the coming weeks .
They are part of a festival he has promoted as a deliberate challenge to extremists and militants he derisively calls "" cavemen "" .
Bhutto Zardari is firmly against negotiations with the Taliban , saying the time has come for far - reaching military operations against the TTP , particularly in the militant stronghold of North Waziristan , an area bordering Afghanistan that for years has been a sanctuary for al - Qaida allied groups .
But he warned an operation should be in co - operation with Afghanistan , an unlikely proposition given the distrust between Kabul and Islamabad . ""
With Afghanistan there is no point of us launching an operation over here if they are just going to hop across the border and find sanctuary over there , "" he said .
"" The ideal situation would be an operation from both sides at the same time . ""
In recent weeks it had appeared that Sharif would finally announce the abandonment of a talks policy his close aides said had failed to make any progress .
But instead on Wednesday Sharif announced he was giving them one last chance , announcing a hastily assembled commission of intermediaries to try to talk to the TTP .
Bhutto Zardari said he was exasperated by the decision : "" It is extremely frustrating , not just for me but for the people who risk their lives on a daily basis , for the people who die on a daily basis , "" he said ."
2014-02-04,"Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's president , and Nawaz Sharif , Pakistan 's prime minister , have a lot in common .
Both are doughty political survivors in a tougher - than - average neighbourhood .
Both are embroiled in a love - hate relationship with the US government , which they regularly denounce even as they cling to it for dear life .
And the two men distrust each other with a passion borne of a thousand betrayals .
Now it appears Karzai and Nawaz are pursuing another shared interest : talks with the Taliban â€ “ the elusive Rosetta Stone of the 13-year Af - Pak conflict .
According to reports published on Monday , and not denied in Kabul , the Afghan president has been secretly directing peace negotiations with Taliban representatives for months .
This , it is suggested , explains why he has refused to sign a post - withdrawal security pact with Washington .
Karzai 's recent behaviour has indeed been suspicious , even by his eccentric standards .
Even though the pact would ensure continuing billions in western aid and non - combat back - up for Afghan security forces , and although it was approved by an inclusive loya jirga , Karzai has refused to sign up .
This leaves Afghanistan in potentially dangerous limbo .
He has intensified his criticism of Nato over high levels of civilian casualties , despite the fact that the UN says the Taliban are mostly to blame .
He has darkly hinted that western agents ( and former US defence secretary Robert Gates ) were attempting to undermine his authority .
And he has insisted on releasing high - profile Taliban detainees against US advice .
All this seems easier to understand in the context of a successful peace deal , presented as the crowning glory of the Karzai presidency before he steps down in April .
Except Karzai , like the Americans and others before him , appears to have drawn a total blank .
There is no deal with the Taliban , nor even a hint of one in the making .
It is not even clear whether the Taliban - esque figures encountered in various Gulf region capitals speak for Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader .
What is clear , meanwhile , is that the Taliban , whether by crafty design or thanks to Karzai 's dysfunctional relationships , have succeeded in complicating , if not wrecking , President Barack Obama 's 2014 withdrawal scenario .
The Americans , the British and the rest are all still leaving .
But as matters stand , what they leave behind will be even more of a tottering edifice than previously feared .
Karzai 's machinations have , as always , a Pakistani dimension , given his firm conviction , often expressed and partially justified , that Islamabad has deliberately conspired with elements of the Afghan Taliban to destabilise the Kabul government .
Islamabad is said to want a weak , divided Afghanistan that poses no threat to Pakistan .
The other side of this battered coin , as viewed from a similarly paranoid Islamabad , is that India , in newly - forged , post - Bush collusion with the US , seeks to encircle Pakistan by bolstering a friendly , pro - western Afghanistan .
While mindful of all that , Nawaz Sharif is under pressure to end the chronic extremist and sectarian violence that plagues Pakistan .
In the latest outrage , nine people died on Monday in a bomb attack on a Shia mosque in Peshawar .
Desperate to revive the failing domestic economy and ( like Karzai ) keen to demonstrate his independence from Washington , Nawaz has now proposed his own "" last chance "" peace talks , with Pakistan 's Tehreek - e - Taliban ( TTP ) .
But like an inexperienced suitor reaching clumsily for an embrace , Nawaz 's propositioning went wrong from the start .
His so - called peace plan was plucked out of the blue last week .
It is unclear who is representing who .
And there are no terms of reference and no timeframe .
Little wonder that on Monday key political figures such as Imran Khan washed their hands of the whole implausible business .
Analysts suspect Nawaz dreamt up the scheme to demonstrate to the public , and to the unpopular , drone - wielding Americans , that he is not a puppet performing Washington 's bidding .
The US has been pushing for a renewed Pakistani army offensive in the tribal areas , to coincide with the Nato drawdown and presidential elections across the border .
A more vengeful motive might be Nawaz 's determination to punish the former president , General Pervez Musharraf , who deposed him in a coup in 1999 .
Musharraf remains a darling of the army and Nawaz may wish the general 's current treason trial completed before ordering the military into uncertain conflict .
Whichever way you cut it , in either case â€ “ in Afghanistan and Pakistan â€
“
the Taliban seem to be winning .
And in the final analysis , this is surely not simply the fault of Karzai or Nawaz .
When Obama pre - empted all future debate by fixing on December 2014 as the date for Nato 's exit he in effect invited the Taliban to sit out the clock .
This they are now doing with great aplomb , in grateful expectation that all they wish for will soon be theirs ."
2014-02-04,"Pakistan 's last - ditch effort to hold peace talks with the Taliban experienced a setback when the first meeting in an already bizarre process was cancelled over concerns that Imran Khan had turned down an invitation to represent the militant group .
A four - man committee appointed by the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , had been due to meet a group of three extremist clerics in Islamabad on Tuesday afternoon .
Although none of the three are members of the Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , a coalition of Islamists fighting against the government , they are among five people the militants originally proposed as their representatives .
Khan , the cricketer turned politician , and Mufti Kifayatullah , a member of a rightwing religious party , turned down the TTP 's offer .
The refusal by the two men to participate was cited as one of the reasons that the meeting was cancelled .
Irfan Siddiqui , one of the government - appointed negotiators , said the decisions of Khan and Kifayatullah had "" put a question mark on talks "" .
The cancellation underlined widespread scepticism about a push for peace announced as a "" last - chance "" option by Sharif last week .
His statement in parliament surprised many commentators as it had been widely anticipated that Islamabad was about to give its blessing for a military push against TTP sanctuaries .
Even a member of the government negotiating committee , the highly regarded journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai , had publicly expressed doubts about whether anything would come of the meeting , pointing out that previous peace deals had always come unstuck .
The talks effort has no agreed timeframe or pre - agreed terms for the discussion .
One person was apparently approached by both sides to represent their interests .
Ansar Abbasi , a journalist who said he had turned down an offer from Sharif , was being considered by the TTP , the movement 's spokesman said .
Other members of the government team include a former diplomat , Rustam Shah Mohmand , and a retired army spy , Mohammad Aamir .
Ayaz Amir , a newspaper columnist , said all of the men except Yusufzai were Taliban sympathisers .
Sharif asked Yusufzai to join the commission just hours before the announcement , adding to suspicions the panel was little more than a last - minute scheme to buy more time before authorising military operations .
Many politicians , particularly from Sharif 's faction of the Pakistan Muslim League , fear that an attack on militant sanctuaries will lead to retaliation .
Another problem is whether the individuals delegated by the TTP have any authority to speak for the movement .
They include Sami - ul Haq , a radical cleric popularly known as Mullah Sandwich .
Although he was once deeply involved with the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s , some analysts believe the Pakistani movement has evolved considerably since those days .
Cyril Almeida , a prominent journalist , said the ongoing treason trial of the former military dictator Pervez Musharraf may be playing a part in Sharif 's calculations .
The trial , which started last month , has dragged on for weeks with Musharraf failing to turn up because of legal challenges , security scares and health problems . ""
The trial of Musharraf while a military operation is under way would be virtually impossible to pull off , "" Almeida said .
Musharraf is due to appear in court on Friday .
If he does he will be indicted and proceedings could then move swiftly ."
2014-02-13,"The powerful brother of Pakistan 's prime minister has warned the military establishments of both India and Pakistan not to block efforts to sweep aside trade barriers between the two distrustful neighbours .
On Indian affairs Shahbaz Sharif , the chief minister of Punjab , is widely seen as the de facto Pakistani foreign minister , conducting diplomatic missions to Delhi on behalf of his brother Nawaz Sharif , the prime minister .
But speaking to the Guardian he warned that distrustful "" security agencies "" in both Pakistan and India were one of the two main "" blockages "" holding back plans to liberalise trade , which the Sharifs believe will provide a desperately needed boost to Pakistan 's moribund economy . ""
Security agencies on both sides need to really understand that in today 's world , a security - led vision is obviously driven by economic security , "" he said .
"" Unless you have economic security then you ca n't have general security . ""
While the Sharif brothers , in common with most mainstream politicians in Pakistan , are impatient for a rapprochement with India , the military is far more wary .
Pakistan and India have fought three wars in the nearly seven decades since independence and tensions over the disputed province of Kashmir erupted in violence several times in the last year .
Pakistan 's powerful military has warned the Sharifs against making rapid concessions , particularly in the runup to India 's general election .
The incumbent Congress party is struggling to hold off a strong challenge from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party .
Manmohan Singh , the prime minister , has long favoured better relations with Pakistan and may still travel across the frontier before the polls , which are due in April or May.
At the same time jihadi organisations in Pakistan with considerable street power have noisily protested against any trade deals while much of the former Himalayan kingdom of Kashmir remains within India .
But the brothers are determined to make progress .
Sharif said disputes including Kashmir , cross - border water rights and the Siachen glacier â€ “ where soldiers from both sides are engaged in a gruelling , high - altitude standoff
â€ “ would only be resolved through "" dialogue and imaginative thinking "" .
"" If we remain hostage to our past then we will go nowhere , "" Sharif said in an interview at his private mansion in Lahore .
"" We have fought three wars and it brought nothing but devastation and destruction .
It brought miseries on both sides .
It added more poverty , more unemployment .
It solved nothing . ""
This week India expressed its annoyance with the slow pace of reform in Pakistan when Anand Sharma , India 's commerce and industry minister , cancelled a trip to Pakistan due to coincide with the second trade show to be held by Indian companies in Lahore on Friday .
Sharma said Pakistan had failed to enact trade - boosting measures that had been agreed upon , including the start of round - the - clock truck passage at one of only two border crossings and the opening up to trade of hundreds of currently restricted items .
Even though Pakistan and India share thousands of miles of border , common languages and many cultural traditions , trade is negligible .
Few goods cross through the sleepy border crossing at Wagah border , which sits between Lahore and the Indian city of Amritsar â€
“ just a dozen miles from each .
Some goods are traded via third countries such as the United Arab Emirates , a practice Sharif describes as "" very , very expensive "" .
India also continues to press Pakistan to tackle militants targeting Indian - held Kashmir , in particular Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) , the Punjab - based jihadist group that was responsible for the devastating terrorist attacks on the city of Mumbai in 2008 .
Sharif said he told Singh during a meeting in Delhi in December that the matter was with Pakistan 's courts and "" those who are found to be involved , there is no question they will be punished "" .
Indian officials say such assurances are not new and that Islamabad needs to "" walk the walk , after talking the talk "" .
Many observers , conscious of LeT 's historic relationship with Pakistan 's military intelligence agency , are sceptical that anyone will ever be brought to book .
Hafiz Saeed , founder of LeT , lives and preaches openly in Lahore despite a $ 10 m US government bounty on his head .
In recent weeks Maulana Masood Azhar , the chief of Jaish - e - Mohammed , a militant group that attacked the Indian parliament in 2001 , has also taken up a greater public role , even addressing a public rally two weeks ago .
But Sharif said India has its own hardline groups opposed to peace efforts , naming the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , a rightwing Hindu nationalist organisation which he said regularly protested against Pakistan .
Sharif said Islamabad had presented credible evidence of Indian involvement in the separatist insurgency raging in the troubled province of Baluchistan . ""
Both countries need to stop the blame game jointly resolve to move aside these roadblocks and move forward with a clear - cut agenda , "" he said .
Nonetheless , in a bid to appease hardline nationalists , Pakistan has dropped efforts to grant India "" most favoured nation "" status .
In a purely semantic reworking , it has opted instead for the less inflammatory "" non - discriminatory market access "" .
Indian officials said the issue of involvement in Baluchistan was raised at a strained meeting between Singh and Nawaz Sharif in New York last year .
"" The prime minister subsequently said he had seen no credible evidence from the Pakistani side to back the allegations and since then there has been no change in that , "" the Delhi official said .
Analyst Ashok Mehta , a retired Indian army general , said Sharif was wrong to say Indian "" security agencies "" were opposed to better relations with Pakistan , because many senior officers believed an improvement in relations with Pakistan "" would free us up to deal with the greater threat , which is China "" .
Mehta said that , outside Kashmir , the Indian army and intelligence services were "" subservient to the civilian leadership "" . ""
The big difference between security officials in Pakistan and India is that here they take orders from a civilian government , "" he told the Guardian ."
2014-05-21,"Narendra Modi , the prime minister elect of India , has invited the leader of the country 's hostile neighbour Pakistan to his inauguration in Delhi next week , in what analysts have hailed as a bold step to launch a policy of regional engagement .
If Nawaz Sharif were to attend the ceremony , it would be a first in the history of the two states , which both have nuclear arsenals and have fought four wars since gaining their independence from Britain in 1947 .
Repeated bids to improve relations have failed , though there have been incremental gains over the last decade .
Sharif , who won elections last year to become Pakistan 's prime minister for the third time , is among eight leaders of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) invited to attend Modi 's swearing in next Monday .
"" It 's an important gesture â€ ¦ as the largest country in the region , India should be reaching out to its neighbours .
This is a very accident - prone relationship , but very intimate too on another level .
We are cousins in a very real sense , "" said Raja C Mohan , one of India 's most respected foreign affairs analysts .
Nirmala Sitharaman , a spokeswoman from Modi 's Bharatiya Janata party ( BJP ) , said all the SAARC countries had been invited through the proper channels .
The invite poses a dilemma for Sharif , who leads the conservative pro - business Pakistan Muslim League , as many in the country and elsewhere in the Muslim world see the 63-year - old Modi as a hardline Hindu nationalist who harbours sectarian prejudices .
Aziz Ahmed Khan , a retired diplomat who served as Pakistan 's high commissioner to Delhi , said Modi had been "" really very shrewd "" with an invitation that the government will find it hard to respond to . ""
On the one hand it 's a good gesture that should be taken as a sign of peacemaking by Modi , but at the same time the baggage that he carries makes it very difficult for the government .
There is a widespread belief in Pakistan that he was behind the massacres in Gujarat . ""
Modi has been accused of allowing , or even encouraging , mob violence in the western Indian state in 2002 .
About 1,000 people , mainly Muslims , were killed in rioting that followed an arson attack on a train in which 59 Hindu pilgrims died .
Modi , who had been appointed Gujarat 's chief minister the year before , has denied any wrongdoing .
"" I 'm sure the government must be in a huddle wondering what to do , "" Khan said .
There was no official response from Islamabad several hours after the announcement , but officials at Pakistan 's high commission in Delhi confirmed they had received a formal invitation .
A meeting with counterparts at the Indian foreign ministry was scheduled for early evening .
"" Then we will see what is the substance of it , "" one said .
Modi has a brimming foreign policy in - tray .
Relations with the US have deteriorated markedly in recent years and , though commercial links with China have grown , Delhi is deeply concerned by the expansion of Chinese influence in the region .
The BJP has long called for a tougher stance on Pakistan , but the huge victory in the election also gives the new prime minister the political space to reach out to difficult neighbours in ways his predecessor , Manmohan Singh , weakened by corruption scandals and public discontent , could not .
After his own election last year Sharif 's administration had also suggested that the Indian prime minister attend his inauguration , but Singh declined .
Sharif has hailed Modi 's "" impressive victory "" and was the first overseas leader to call and congratulate him before counting of votes had even ended .
Tariq Azeem , a governing party senator and close Sharif confidante , said that although the prime minister was very keen on building ties with India , there were others in government who were wary of moving too quickly to embrace Modi .
"" There are people obviously who want to wait and see whether Gujarat man turns into New Delhi man , "" he said .
"" There is that fear and apprehension in some quarters . ""
He added that Sharif may be too busy to attend at such short notice , but that a senior member of the government would definitely attend .
In 1999 , during Sharif 's second term in power , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , India 's last BJP prime minister , rode a bus to Lahore to sign a peace accord , raising the prospect of normalised ties .
Three months later , however , the countries were at war again .
Relations warmed in the early part of the last decade , but broke down after Pakistan - based militants launched attacks in Mumbai in 2008 in which 166 people were killed .
Ties have improved slightly under Singh , but remain frosty .
Distrust is mutual , and there are regular skirmishes along the line of control in Kashmir .
Modi said during his campaign that talks could not be held with Pakistan until all violence stopped and senior BJP officials have regularly reiterated that view .
Modi , however , has coupled his demand with a call for a mutual effort to tackle deprivation in the region . ""
Bombs , guns and pistols have failed to do any good for the people of Pakistan â€ ¦ if India or Pakistan has to fight a war , it should be a war on poverty , illiteracy and superstition , "" Modi said last year in his first major speech as a prime ministerial candidate ."
2014-08-10,"Pakistan is bracing itself for huge street protests in the capital , Islamabad , this week amid political crisis that has resulted in cities ' petrol supplies being cut , clashes between police and the followers of a controversial cleric in Lahore , and demands by politician and former cricketer Imran Khan for the government to quit .
The chaos and political uncertainly comes a little more than a year after a landslide election victory swept Nawaz Sharif , a conservative businessman , to power for the third time .
Sharif 's thumping parliamentary majority led to a rare outbreak of optimism among Pakistan watchers who dared to hope the new prime minister had the mandate to achieve his aims of reviving a broken economy , making peace with India and tackling Islamist militancy .
But in the 14 months since he took office , Sharif 's authority has been undermined by Pakistan 's powerful military , Canada - based cleric Tahir - ul - Qadri and Khan â€ “ a demagogue politician who claims Sharif 's faction of the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) rigged the election .
Khan has vowed to bring Islamabad to a standstill on Thursday , the county 's independence day , when huge numbers of his supporters will flood into the capital .
He has vowed that they will remain until the government steps down and fresh elections are called .
Khan 's behaviour has baffled many analysts and diplomats who are not convinced the election was so flawed that Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) party was illegitimately denied victory .
Most international observers judged the 2013 polls to have been considerably better than previous general elections .
"" We did n't reject the election results immediately because we thought we could get relief from the courts , "" said senior PTI leader Shafqat Mahmood .
"" But now we have decided that everything we tried in parliament and the courts has not worked and so we have no recourse but to launch a huge protest . ""
Sceptical observers point out that Khan has no way to legally achieve his aims given the government has a huge majority in parliament and is unlikely to vote itself out of existence .
Nonetheless , the prospect of Khan 's "" Freedom March "" ( in reality , a motorised drive ) from Lahore to Islamabad on Thursday , has seriously alarmed the government .
Drastic steps have been taken to try to block the protest , including declaring a ban on gatherings of more than four people and giving the army responsibility for guarding Islamabad .
Other methods include the impounding of motorbikes and buses and the closure of petrol stations .
The motorway linking Islamabad to Lahore is likely to be shut down .
Critics say the government has mishandled the situation and should have allowed demonstrations to peter out during the sweltering monsoon conditions .
The government fears the presence of tens of thousands protesters in the capital could trigger violent confrontations creating an opening for an intervention by the army , which has seized power at several points in Pakistan 's history .
Addressing the press on Friday at his luxurious hilltop estate overlooking the capital , Khan said his supporters had the right to resist any attempts by the police or the army to enforce the ban on protests in the capital . ""
The police are not Pakistan 's police but Nawaz Sharif 's private henchmen , "" he said .
"" If they try to stop peaceful protest then there is going to be violence . ""
Sharif 's power has been challenged in the prime minister 's home city of Lahore , the capital of Punjab province .
Violent supporters of Qadri have been fighting against police in cities across Punjab .
Qadri enjoys the support of huge numbers of committed activists through his political party , the Pakistan Awami Tehreek ( PAT ) and his religious organisation , the Minhaj - ul - Quran .
He has long called for revolution , claiming Pakistan 's democratic structure is mired in corruption and must be swept away .
In recent days his supporters have clashed with police near his office in an upmarket neighbourhood of Lahore where the city 's authorities had attempted to stop activists commemorating the killing in June of 14 party workers during an earlier standoff with police .
Qadri has promised his "" Green Revolution "" will see the immediate incarceration of government ministers and the introduction of a "" 10-point revolutionary agenda "" .
Based for much of the time in Canada , he flew into Pakistan in June , when the government diverted his commercial flight to Lahore to prevent him landing in Islamabad where his supporters were waiting for him .
On Sunday Qadri announced he would also lead a "" Revolution March "" of his supporters on Islamabad , although the PTI and PAT have not formally joined their efforts .
On Sunday the police charged Qadri with murder , incitement to violence and treason after the death of a police constable who was wounded in confrontations in Lahore on Friday ."
2014-08-15,"A slow moving protest convoy led by former cricket star Imran Khan was pelted with stones by activists from the ruling party on Friday as two separate rallies demanding the sacking of the government headed for the Pakistani capital .
Khan 's so - called "" Freedom March "" , which aspires to topple the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif , was passing through the town of Gujranwala when an angry crowd attacked an elaborately equipped shipping container that had been converted to carry Khan and senior members of his Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf party ( PTI ) to Islamabad .
Television pictures showed the crowd of Sharif supporters insultingly waving their shoes at the PTI convoy and others smashing windows of cars in the long procession of vehicles that had set out of Lahore on Thursday .
One PTI activist suffered a head wound .
After the incident Khan abandoned the container in favour of an armoured vehicle to complete the journey .
The convoy was finally due to complete its nearly 200-mile journey on Friday night with an arrival in the capital that was likely to lead to a sit - in by thousands of activists as part of the PTI 's protest against alleged rigging in last year 's election , which Khan claims deprived him of power .
Fearing the potential for major unrest in the capital , the government had initially banned any demonstrations in Islamabad , but relented on Thursday in a development many analysts have taken as a sign of a possible behind - the - scenes deal that might see Khan drop his demands for the resignation of the government and fresh elections .
Instead , he is likely to be offered concessions on some of his calls for a detailed investigation of alleged voting irregularities in particular constituencies .
No independent election observers have backed Khan 's claim of massive electoral rigging in last May 's general elections which saw Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) win by a landslide .
Most of the PML - N 's seats were won in Punjab , the populous province where the PTI will have to make inroads if it is to win power .
Khan 's extremely slow procession down the Grand Trunk Road , the province 's most important commercial artery , resembled a rolling political rally as much as a protest march .
The government was quick to try and calm angry PTI activists by pledging a full investigation into the attack on Khan 's vehicle .
Also heading towards the capital was a separate protest "" march "" led by Canada - based cleric Tahir - ul - Qadri , who is calling for a "" Green Revolution "" that will sweep away a democratic system he regards as irredeemably corrupt .
His supporters , drawn from a countrywide network of mosques and schools , have in recent weeks been involved in violent clashes with police in Lahore .
The prospect of two large simultaneous demonstrations in Islamabad had created fears the powerful military , which has been at loggerheads with Sharif , might intervene to force out the government or even seize power in an outright coup .
But in recent days Sharif has appeared repeatedly at events celebrating the country 's 68th anniversary side by side with the country 's army chief , adding to speculation the military is determined not to fuel instability at a time when Pakistan faces multiple challenges .
In a reminder of the longstanding militant challenge , two airbases were stormed by separate factions of the Pakistani Taliban in Quetta , the capital of restive Baluchistan province .
The attacks by gunmen armed with automatic weapons , grenades and suicide vests were only repelled after nine hours of fighting ."
2014-08-18,"Politicians representing Pakistan 's third - largest party will quit their seats in parliament as part of a high - stakes effort by former cricket star Imran Khan to bring down the government of a country long blighted by political instability .
Shah Mehmood Qureshi , vice - chairman of Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) party , announced the plan on Monday following days of demonstrations in Islamabad against alleged fraud in last year 's election .
It was a dramatic escalation of the party 's dispute with prime minister Nawaz Sharif , whose faction of the Pakistan Muslim League ( PML - N ) won a crushing victory in last May 's general elections .
On Monday night Khan further raised the political stakes by leading his supporters on Islamabad 's sensitive "" red zone "" , a move that would likely spark violent clashes with security forces .
Khan claims a massive vote - rigging campaign deprived his party of victory , even though the PTI had never before won a significant number of seats and international observers said the election had been the cleanest in the country 's history .
Although Khan 's accusations have been dismissed by most election experts , it is feared a sustained campaign could undermine Pakistan 's fragile democracy .
The country has a history of military coups and army - backed dismissals of elected governments .
Last May 's election was the first transition of power between two democratically elected governments in Pakistan .
Several analysts described Khan 's dramatic decision to order his 34 members of Pakistan 's National Assembly to resign as a desperate attempt to regain ground lost after staging an underwhelming "" Freedom March "" from Lahore to Islamabad last week . ""
Step by step he is trying to delegitimise the government , "" said Najam Sethi , editor of The Friday Times .
"" He is trying to demonstrate his commitment to the cause and to remain a player after his dismal showing in the last few days .
"" Khan had promised to swamp the capital with a million of his supporters , but the crowd has rarely crept above some 20,000 people , and has frequently been far fewer .
The turnout has also been upstaged by a parallel protest by Tahir - ul - Qadri , a Canada - based televangelist who enjoys wide support through his network of schools and mosques in Pakistan .
He is also calling for the resignation of the Sharif government but , unlike Khan , wants the country to be ruled by a "" national government "" of technocrats , rather than freshly - elected politicians .
Khan faced media ridicule on Monday following a speech the previous evening when he called for his supporters to stop paying tax and utility bills as a form of "" civil disobedience "" .
The failure to raise significant revenue in tax is one of Pakistan 's main governance challenges .
Fixing the problem has been a long - standing demand of the foreign donors who sustain Pakistan 's basket case economy , including the International Monetary Fund .
On Monday IMF officials had to cancel an important trip to Pakistan because of Khan 's street demonstrations .
The Nation newspaper described Khan 's call for civil disobedience as "" desperate , bordering on manic "" . ""
Incitement to sedition does n't really work in a country where the state is already struggling to display its authority , "" it said in a withering editorial .
Khan 's party also came under fire for announcing its elected representatives would also resign from all of the country 's provincial legislatures , but not the one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) , where the PTI controls the government .
"" If they are challenging the legitimacy of last year 's votes then they should challenge it everywhere , including in KP , "" said Sethi .
"" But they ca n't because there would be a revolt in the party . ""
If the PTI boycotts byelections for the vacated seats then the way will be open for the country 's main opposition group , the Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) to regain some of the strength it lost in last year 's landslide defeat .
But Sherry Rehman , a senior PPP leader , said it was more important to protect Pakistan 's fragile democracy than to gain any party political advantage .
""
Any short term political gain will be very short term , "" she said .
"" The losers will be those who fought for the system to be constitutionally viable over the last six years . """
2014-08-18,"India has abruptly called off high - level talks with Pakistan after the Pakistani high commissioner in Delhi invited a Kashmiri separatist leader to tea .
The meeting of the two quarrelsome neighbours ' foreign secretaries in Islamabad next week would have been the first in 18 months .
It was scheduled after Pakistan 's prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , accepted an invitation to attend the swearing - in ceremony of his Indian counterpart , Narendra Modi , in Delhi three months ago .
The first signs of a relapse came during a visit by Modi to the Buddhist Ladakh region of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir province , when the Indian leader accused Pakistan of conducting a "" proxy war of terrorists "" and said it had "" lost the strength to fight a conventional war "" .
But Modi did not criticise Pakistan in his independence day address last Friday , raising hopes for the talks .
For several years , meetings between Kashmiri Muslim separatist leaders and Pakistani envoys in Delhi were a regular prelude to any major India - Pakistan dialogue .
The last one took place in April .
But this time India 's foreign secretary , Sujatha Singh , told the Pakistani envoy Abdul Basit : "" You can have a dialogue with India or with separatists . ""
Basit ignored the warning , and shortly after the Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah drove out of the high commission , Delhi declared the talks were off .
Yasin Malik , a Kashmiri leader , said : "" This shows India does not want to discuss the Kashmir issue with Pakistan , only trade .
They are pushing the new generation of Kashmiris on to the violent path . ""
Aziz Ahmed , a former Pakistani high commissioner , defended Basit 's meeting with Shah .
"" You have to consult these people regularly because they are part of Indian - held Kashmir and they have to be kept on board in order to find an amicable solution that is acceptable to everyone , "" he said .
Ahmed said India needed to recognise that Pakistan had considerably softened its stance over the years .
But India 's ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party said : "" This time it was the last straw on the camel 's back .
This time we 're telling Pakistan : you 'll have to walk the extra mile if you want to improve relations . """
2014-08-19,"Tens of thousands of anti - government protesters swarmed towards Pakistan 's parliament late on Tuesday night after using bolt cutters and cranes to swiftly remove barricades designed to keep them away from the most sensitive areas of the country 's capital city .
An estimated 50,000 protesters , led by an opposition politician and a Canada - based cleric , had been holding demonstrations in Islamabad for five days to demand the resignation of the government led by prime minister Nawaz Sharif .
But until Tuesday they had held back on threats to move on Islamabad 's "" red zone "" which houses parliament , the prime minister 's office and most foreign embassies .
Such a move risked sparking a violent confrontation with police and the army , which in an unusual move had in recent weeks been called in to buttress security in the capital , with about 700 personnel posted inside the red zone .
The challenge from the protesters puts Sharif in a difficult position .
Major bloodshed defending the red zone could create the conditions for intervention by the country 's powerful army , which has a long record of sacking civilian governments throughout Pakistan 's turbulent history .
At the risk of looking weak , Sharif opted to allow the demonstrators to move into the heart of the capital .
No attempt was made to block the progress of marchers by police , many of whom were armed with nothing more than sticks .
Protesters were even able to drive cranes into the capital to remove stacks of sea containers placed on key roads leading to the red zone .
In a tweet , his daughter Maryam Sharif said the prime minister had ordered police "" not to use any kind of force against the protesters "" in order to protect the many women and children among them .
Imran Khan , one of the leaders of the demonstrations , deliberately put women and children at the head of the marchers , while he was conveyed with senior party members on the roof of a specially converted sea container .
Despite repeatedly claiming in a speech earlier in the evening that he would lead a peaceful demonstration , many of his supporters carried sticks and were prepared for tear gas with goggles .
Khan , the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) party , is demanding the resignation of Sharif 's government which he claims won a landslide victory in last year 's general election on the basis of massive electoral fraud , although his allegations have not been supported by independent observers .
He has promised to turn the area in front of Pakistan 's national assembly building into a "" Tahrir Square "" , referring to the 2011 protests in Cairo that ousted president Hosni Mubarak .
On Monday he also announced the 34 members of his party who won seats will quit parliament .
He has joined forces with Tahir - ul - Qadri , a Barelvi cleric with a considerable support base , who also wants to see the resignation of the government .
Unlike Khan , Qadri does not want fresh elections but the establishment of a "" national government "" of technocrats .
The protests in the capital have already gone on for five days .
The prospect of the standoff continuing outside the nation 's parliament could see the army playing an arbitration role .
Late on Tuesday army spokesman General Asim Bajwa tweeted an appeal for "" patience , wisdom [ and ] sagacity from all stakeholders through larger national and public interest "" .
Over the last year Sharif has been weakened by damaging disputes with the powerful military establishment which removed him from power in the 1999 coup led by Pervez Musharraf .
Despite an outright parliamentary majority , the ongoing political crisis is likely to weaken him further and could make him reliant on the army for his political survival ."
2014-08-20,
2014-08-29,"Hamid Mir , one of the few remaining famous faces on what was until recently Pakistan 's most watched television station , runs a nightly gauntlet to get to his Islamabad studio .
For weeks the street outside has been full of rowdy supporters of Imran Khan , an opposition politician , who is leading street protests a few hundred metres away aimed at forcing out the government .
Khan 's supporters not only loathe the rule of the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , they also hate Geo , the news channel that Khan decries from the roof of a converted sea container , from where he makes daily addresses to thousands of supporters .
"" They regard Geo as the enemy , "" says Mir . ""
[ Khan ] is talking against my channel every night and his workers attack our journalists every day .
"" Some politicians have declined invitations to appear on his evening Capital Talk programme , saying they are unsure they can safely get behind the razor - wire topped wall recently erected around the building .
The mood has been tense ever since Khan and Muslim cleric Tahir ul -
Qadri launched parallel sit - ins on the streets of the capital this month .
The deep animosity of Khan towards the Geo - Jang media conglomerate that employs Mir is one element of a political crisis that has bitterly divided the media and the political class .
Many analysts also believe it has helped the military in its long - running battle for supremacy over the civilian government .
Mir , a veteran journalist often close to the centre of events , played an inadvertent role in triggering the current crisis when he was critically injured by gunmen who opened fire on his car as he was travelling through Karachi in April .
Even as he was unconscious in hospital his colleagues at Geo wasted no time in broadcasting explosive allegations that the attempted killing had been ordered on the direct orders of Zaheer ul - Islam , the head of the country 's powerful military intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence directorate ( ISI ) .
The accusation sparked fury from the army , who strongly rejected the unsubstantiated allegations and demanded that the enormously popular station be shut down .
But Nawaz Sharif , a prime minister determined to bring to heel a military that ousted him in a 1999 coup , very publicly backed Geo .
The standoff further soured relations with a military top brass already angry at Sharif for the high treason trial he ordered for the former dictator Pervez Musharraf and for the prime minister 's dogged resistance to army demands for military operations against the Pakistani Taliban .
It also nearly destroyed Geo .
Not only have some of the channel 's star names defected to rival broadcasters eager to eat into Geo 's once commanding audience share , the company is said to be rapidly losing money , after cable providers and advertisers were pressured into dropping the channel .
The network is now struggling along largely on money earned internationally from Pakistani viewers around the world .
Commercial pressure has recently been reapplied following Geo 's critical coverage of the Islamabad protests that failed to attract anything close to the 1 million people Khan had promised .
"" The people who are controlling Imran and Qadri say we are contributing to the failure of the protests because Geo is saying again and again that they failed to mobilise a million people , "" says Mir .
"" So again they are forcing cable operators to take us off the air . ""
For his part , Khan has blamed Geo for being complicit in what he claims was the industrial rigging of last year 's general elections â€ “ a claim that has not been supported by independent election observers .
Although Khan 's long sit - in outside parliament is ostensibly to protest against electoral fraud , most commentators believe he would not have launched his "" long march "" if Sharif had not been severely weakened by his bruising battles with the army .
Some fear Khan and Qadri may even have unwittingly helped cement a "" soft coup "" by the army , which will leave Sharif in power but subordinate to the military .
Mir believes the army had long been looking to nobble the country 's lively private broadcasters , many of whom have become craven supporters of Khan and the military .
"" They know they have to divide us , "" he says .
"" They learned their lesson in 2007 that when we are all united there is no room for their conspiracies . ""
Seven years ago , a united front by news organisations and lawyers ultimately sealed the end of Musharraf 's long military rule .
But despite his near assassination , which left two bullets inside him , and the beleaguered state of the company he works for , Mir continues to chide the army â€ “ he rounded off a recent show with a note to his viewers that "" interference of army in politics is treason "" .
And even though Geo , after weeks of being branded as an "" anti - state "" channel did eventually apologise to the army , Mir still insists that he was nearly killed by "" some elements of the ISI â€ ¦ including the head of the ISI .
I am not part of my organisation 's apology because I am a victim and I need justice . """
2014-08-31,"Pakistan 's army has instructed the country 's embattled government to solve its political crisis without violence on Sunday following a night of clashes in the capital between police and thousands of protesters demanding the prime minister step down .
The demand came after an emergency meeting of the army 's high command and was the latest intervention by the country 's powerful military in the drawn out standoff between the government and followers of former cricketer Imran Khan and populist cleric Tahir - ul - Qadri .
The army has toppled civilian governments in the past , including one led by the current prime minister Nawaz Sharif , either by directly assuming power in coups or by installing caretaker governments .
In language that underlined the institution 's undimmed ability to dictate events , an army statement said it was "" committed to playing its part in ensuring security of the state "" .
It added its "" serious concern "" about violence in Islamabad and that the situation should be "" resolved politically without wasting any time and without recourse to violent means .
"" Political accommodation appears unlikely , given that the government and its opponents are deadlocked over the future of the prime minister , who won a landslide victory in last May 's election that Khan claims was secured by massive vote rigging .
Khan and Qadri , who marched from the city of Lahore to Islamabad on 14 August in a bid to oust the government , insist Sharif must go .
The government has been at pains to avoid an ugly stand off with demonstrators , ordering police not to confront them as they advanced ever closer to the heart of the capital , even allowing them to hold a protracted sit - in on the road directly in front of parliament and other key government buildings .
But , on Saturday night , Khan and Qadri urged their supporters to seize Sharif 's official residence , forcing police to respond with tear gas and rubber bullets to swarms of demonstrators who succeeded in smashing a gate and flooding into the grounds of parliament .
Almost 500 people were injured and three died , although one was the victim of a heart attack .
The police response was criticised as excessive by some , though many of the protesters were equipped with gas masks and armed with bamboo staffs , slingshots and other weapons .
The main opposition Pakistan People 's party , which has generally supported Sharif throughout the crisis , criticised the crackdown .
And the Muttahida Qaumi Movement party , which has a significant vote block in parliament , joined calls for the government to step down .
Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day on Sunday , with some protesters using slingshots to fire glass marbles at police .
But , by night - time , it seemed neither Khan nor Qadri were preparing to provoke another confrontation , with Khan appearing on the top of the converted sea container in which he has been living for more than two weeks to announce he was going to have a rest .
The government will struggle to defend key buildings without using force in any future attempt to seize them . ""
Sharif is now in the tightest of corners , "" said commentator Mosharraf Zaidi .
"" The army does not want to intervene in this political dispute but it also clearly indicates that it will not defend prime minister Sharif . ""
A noticeably gloomy editorial in Dawn , a respected English - language daily paper , asked whether Sharif could survive Sunday 's crisis . ""
The answer , in these frantic hours , must surely be a miserable , despondent no , "" it concluded ."
2014-09-02,"Facts are a funny thing in Pakistan : there often arenâ€ ™ t any .
What you usually have to settle for , particularly in politics , is some kind of theory , ranging from the conspiratorial to the wild and woolly to the , occasionally , plausible .
Take the current situation .
Pakistan is in the grip of a tawdry political crisis .
Imran Khan says the May 2013 general election was rigged .
The government of Nawaz Sharif says its mandate to rule is legitimate .
The ever - lurking army says it is neutral .
Here we go again .
Sharifâ€ ™ s problem is that he won the May 2013 election outright .
And before May 2013 , Sharifâ€ ™ s problem was that many a political observer thought the election was his to lose .
In addition , Sharifâ€ ™ s problem is who he is .
Rewind to October 2011 .
A political earthquake rocked Lahore : Imran Khan the celebrity transformed into Imran Khan the serious politician as his party , the Pakistan Tehrik - i - Insaaf ( PTI ) , capitalised on disillusionment with the then government of the Pakistan Peopleâ€ ™ s party ( PPP ) to bring hundreds of thousands of people out on to the streets of Punjab .
The timing though of that historic rally was odd : elections were not scheduled until 2013 and there was no political crisis brewing to suggest an early election may be on the cards .
What was the PTI up to ?
Sharifâ€ ™ s party , the Pakistan Muslim League â€ “ Nawaz ( PML - N ) thought it knew : Khan had been encouraged by the then ISI spy agency chief general Shuja Pasha to build his party and focus on Punjab , because any gains for the PTI and Khan would be losses for the PML - N. In essence , the League believed that the army had calculated that the PPP was on its way out of office and that a third political force would be needed to check the PML - Nâ€ ™ s ascent to power .
Few really believed the PML - N then because , even if true , the argument was self - serving and didnâ€ ™ t address a basic problem : Khan was clearly tapping into a mine of public discontent with the PPP and PML - Nâ€ ™ s status quo politics .
But the PML - N was adamant and increasingly shrill in its complaints in the run - up to the May 2013 election : the party believed the army was covertly supporting the PTI to either ensure the PML - N did not come to power at all , or that if it did , it would be forced into a coalition with other parliamentary parties .
In the end , the PML - N did win an outright majority .
The PTI scooped up large numbers of voters in Punjab , but a first - past - the - post parliamentary system meant it won few seats .
The army would have to find a way to work with Sharif .
Or so it seemed .
Fast forward a year and Sharifâ€ ™ s mandate is dead â€ “ beaten lifeless by the volatile combination of an increasingly manic Khan and a religious preacher , Tahir - ul - Qadri , who does not even bother to camouflage his closeness to the army .
Facts may be a rare thing in Pakistani politics , but old truths are hard to dislodge : the army has used the present crisis to reassert its pre - eminence in the political arena .
The transition to democracy may continue in form , but the substance has been gutted .
What is the army afraid of ?
To begin with , democracy .
At the top of the heap in a declining state , the army knows that gains for democrats are losses for the army .
On the core interests of the army â€ “ its budget , its fantastic privileges , and national security and foreign policies
â€ “ the political mainstream in the country would make very different choices to the army .
In Sharifâ€ ™ s case though there is an element of the personal too .
Suspicion of politicians within the army is not uncommon , but it is particularly strong when it comes to Sharif .
Perhaps that is because the feeling is mutual in Sharifâ€ ™ s case , and he is the only politician â€ “ Punjabi , popular , powerful â€ “ who can act on it .
No other politician but Sharif could try and put a former army chief , Pervez Musharraf , on trial for treason .
And so Sharif is condemned â€ “ for what he represents and what he chooses to do .
It is difficult to feel sympathy for him though : a three - term prime minister should have learned the art of survival with a purpose by now .
For Sharifâ€ ™ s failures and the armyâ€ ™ s obsession though , it is Pakistan that must pay ."
2014-09-02,"Pakistan 's politicians have rallied behind the country 's embattled prime minister during a meeting of parliament convened amid violent street protests that some claim have been secretly backed by the country 's powerful army .
Senior politicians took turns on Tuesday to promise to defend the democratic system against protesters who are demanding the resignation of the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , just 15 months after he was elected .
The interior minister , Chaudhry Nisar , described the demonstrations led by former cricket star Imran Khan and populist cleric Tahir - ul - Qadri as a "" revolt against the state "" .
In recent days the weeks - long crisis has deepened .
The state - run broadcaster was briefly forced off air , deadly fights broke out with police on the streets of Islamabad and the perimeter fence of parliament was smashed , allowing protesters to set up a camp on the building 's lawns .
But it was not just the hostile crowds directly outside the chamber of the national assembly that concerned speakers during the debate .
The role of the army , which has ruled directly and through weak civilian governments for most of the country 's history , was also openly questioned .
Speaking to the joint session of Pakistan 's two houses of parliament , Fazal - ur - Rehman , the head of a major religious party , criticised the army 's behaviour during the crisis , which he said had created the impression protesters had been "" backed by a third party "" .
Newspapers have been more direct in their criticism of any army which has strenuously avoided riding to the government 's rescue .
Dawn , a leading English language daily , expressed outrage that the army instructed the government on Sunday not to use force against rioters attacking state buildings : "" It 's as if the army is unaware â€ “ rather , unwilling â€ “ to acknowledge the constitutional scheme of things : it is the government that is supposed to give orders to the army , not the other way around . ""
The Nation said it "" should be simply unacceptable "" for military commanders to tell elected politicians what to do .
Many Pakistanis are convinced the army has stage - managed protests ostensibly led by two civilians : Imran Khan and Tahir - ul - Qadri .
Both men , playing on widespread dissatisfaction with a democratic system that many believe only serves a corrupt political class , launched demonstrations on 14 August intended to try and force out the government .
Qadri has called for a "" Green Revolution "" while Khan has demanded the sacking of Sharif and a rerun of last year 's election .
He claims massive election rigging robbed him of power , but no independent observer group says fraud was widespread enough to change the landslide win for Sharif , leader of his own faction of the Pakistan Muslim League .
Although both men insist their movements are peaceful , they have used language certain to incite crowds which have varied from between just a few thousand up to an estimated 50,000 .
Things finally turned violent on Saturday when Khan and Qadri gave the order to try and seize the prime minister 's official residence , triggering clashes that left three dead and injured hundreds .
On Monday they launched an early morning raid on the headquarters of the Pakistan Television Corporation ( PTV ) , which they successful occupied .
But protesters , who have viciously attacked policemen in recent days , calmly left PTV when asked to do so by military men who they believe will eventually force Sharif out .
In his many speeches over the last fortnight Khan has frequently promised a "" third umpire "" would send Sharif packing .
Adding to fears of a military - backed plot , Javed Hashmi , president of Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf , parted ways with Khan after dramatically claiming the party leader had been acting under the directions of the army throughout .
Neither Hashmi nor anyone else has offered hard evidence to back up claims of a military plot to subvert democracy , although relations between the army and Sharif have been terrible in all three of his terms in office .
His most recent stint has been no different , with the army antagonised by Sharif 's efforts to firmly establish civilian supremacy over the army , not least with a historic â€ “ and provocative â€ “ high treason trial of Pervez Musharraf , the military ruler who ousted Sharif in 1999 .
Not everyone is convinced the chaotic events of recent days are really the result of a carefully plotted script .
"" People are stuck in old paradigms as if this was still the 1980s or 90s , "" said Kamran Bokhari an analyst at Stratfor , a private intelligence firm .
"" They treat the armed forces as a sort of all powerful , omnipotent monolith that has been completely unchanged by all the many other changes in Pakistan over the decades . ""
The army may well have grabbed the opportunity created by the crisis to clip Sharif 's wings , Bokhari believes .
But it is unlikely to have full control of Khan , whose behaviour has at times appeared impetuous .
If anything , Khan might believe he can force the army to do what he wants .
Hasan Askari Rizvi , a Lahore - based political scientist , said the army 's room to manoeuvre has been steadily reduced by the emergence of rival power centres over the past decade .
Those include everything from a burgeoning media sector to militant groups such as the Taliban , as well as parliament itself , which on Tuesday put on a powerful display of unity . ""
The problem for the army is that Pakistan has changed over the last seven years , "" said Rizvi .
"" It 's still the most powerful institution but it has to work under new constraints . """
2014-10-10,"The award of the Nobel peace prize to the Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi , an Indian childrenâ€ ™ s rights advocate , was aimed at supporting their â€œcommon struggle for education and against extremismâ€ � , the Norwegian prize committee said .
The joint award was quickly welcomed by leaders in both countries , but the award to 17-year - old Malala also drew some sceptical responses from Pakistani conservatives suspicious of western motives .
The Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , was among the slew of politicians to offer congratulations to Malala .
But there was no escaping the irony that Malala was almost killed for her work advocating education for children , narrowly surviving being shot in the head by the Taliban two years ago , and still lives abroad .
She is frequently accused by conservatives of selling out to the west .
Liaqat Baloch , a leader of the Jamaat - e - Islami , a rightwing religious - political party , said : â€œMalala is a Pakistani student and she is getting a lot of support and patronage abroad .
On the surface this is not a bad thing and we welcome this , and there is no objection to the award , but the attack on Malala and then her support in the west creates a lot of suspicions .
â€œThere are lots of girls in Pakistan who have been martyred in terrorist attacks , women who have been widowed , but no one gives them an award .
So these out of the box activities are suspicious.â€ �
Pakistaniâ€ ™ s only other Nobel laureate , the theoretical physicist Abdus Salam , was also the subject of a campaign of vilification in Pakistan , and is now largely forgotten in his home country because he was a member of the Ahmadiyya sect , seen as heretical by Pakistani Islamic authorities .
The Nobel committeeâ€ ™ s decision , announced in Oslo , was deliberately aimed at striking a delicate balance at a time of tension in India - Pakistani relations .
Malala is a young Muslim , while Satyarthi is a Hindu elder statesman of the child rights campaign .
They will share the prize money of Â£690,000 ( 8 m kronor or $ 1.11 m ) .
But the split award also reflected the dire state of childrenâ€ ™ s rights in both countries .
The Nobel committee said it was important to reward both an Indian Hindu and a Pakistani Muslim for joining â€œin a common struggle for education and against extremismâ€ � .
The committee argued that observance of childrenâ€ ™ s rights was essential for long - term peace .
â€œIt is a prerequisite for peaceful global development that the rights of children and young people be respected , â€ � the committee said in its announcement .
â€œIn conflict - ridden areas in particular , the violation of children leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation.â€ � Satyarthi , a 60-year - old veteran campaigner against child slavery and exploitation in India , said : â€œThis is an honour for all my fellow Indians , as well as an honour for all those children in the world whose voices were never heard before properly.â€ �"
2014-10-10,"The winners of the Nobel peace prize , the Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi , an Indian childrenâ€ ™ s rights advocate , said the award represented a huge boost to the cause of childrenâ€ ™ s rights around the world .
They also made it clear that they would seek to use the award to bring their two countries closer together and said they would invite their prime ministers , Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Narendra Modi of India , to the award ceremony in Oslo in December .
The joint award was welcomed by the two leaders , but the award to 17-year - old Malala also drew some sceptical responses from Pakistani conservatives suspicious of western motives .
Since escaping death when she was shot in the head two years ago by a Taliban gunman for attending school in Pakistanâ€ ™ s Swat valley , she has been living and studying in the UK .
Malala heard the news of her win during a chemistry lesson at school in Birmingham , while Satyarthi found out through Twitter before receiving the phone call from the Nobel committee in Oslo .
The two later spoke by phone and , according to Malala , agreed to combine their campaigns for child protection and education , and to work to build stronger links between their two countries â€œTodayâ€ ™ s world is fast moving because of the globalisation of the economy and it is high time that all of us take urgent steps to protect children and move towards a globalisation of compassion , â€ � Satyarthi , the 60-year - old son of a police constable in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh , told the Guardian in an interview in his crowded south Delhi office .
The laureateâ€ ™ s son , Bhawan , said : â€œHeâ€ ™ s a very down - to - earth man and so there were no tears or shouting or anything .
â€œThis will be a big encouragement to the movement but the real victory will be when child trafficking is finished .
This will send a strong signal to society not to employ child labourers and to the government to implement the existing laws.â€
�
Child labour is illegal in India but laws are rarely enforced .
Convictions for offences such as child trafficking are extremely rare .
Speaking to the press in Birmingham , Malala said â€œI believe the committee didnâ€ ™ t just give this award to me .
It is for all the children whose voices are not being heard around the world .
â€œThrough my story I want to tell children to speak for themselves , not to wait for someone else .
I stand up with all the children and this award is especially for them .
It will give them courage , â€ �
she said .
On Friday night in Mingora city in the Swat valley , Malalaâ€ ™ s home region , people celebrated the award , distributing sweets in her honour in the central square where the Pakistani Taliban once roamed freely .
â€œAll those who were opposed to Malala should review their opinion about herâ€ � said Neelum , a ninth - grade student and friend of Malala , who she described as one of the most talented girls she had ever met .
â€œI
imagine being her someday , â€ � Neelum said .
â€œ
She is not just an inspiration for the women of Swat but for the world
over.â€ � Ahmad Shah , a teacher in Swat , said Malala had â€œempowered the girls of Swat with her thoughts that education is importantâ€ � .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve only read about Nobel laureates .
Now we have one from our own village .
Itâ€ ™ s unbelievable and yet its true
, â€ � Shah added , his voice breaking with emotion .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s a flicker of hope in an age of darkness.â€

The Nobel committeeâ€ ™ s decision was deliberately aimed at striking a delicate balance at a time of tension in Indian - Pakistani relations .

So these â€ ¦ activities are suspicious.â€ �
In India , Tushar Gandhi , great - grandson of Mahatma Gandhi , the revered independence leader who became a proponent of non - violent protest , said that in recent years all Nobel prizes had been in the tradition of his famous forebear .
â€œMalala personifies non - violent resistance admirably and both she and Kailash Satyarthi also personify the commitment and solidarity that was the legacy of the work of all the illustrious leaders of [ the Indian ] independence movement , â€ � Gandhi said .
â€œUntil yesterday no politician was bothered or was interested in what he was doing and some were even irritated by him , now they will all sing his paeans .
I think my great - grandfather , with his sense of humour , would have laughed â€ ¦
He had long realised the hypocrisy of politicians.â€ �
Indiaâ€ ™ s home minister , Rajnath Singh , congratulated Satyarthi , tweeting : â€œShri Kailash Satyarthi is a champion of child rights whose work is now recognised internationally .
Congratulations to him once again.â€ �
Indiaâ€ ™ s defence and finance minister , Arun Jaitley , also used Twitter to congratulate Malala for the award â€œfor promoting girlâ€ ™ s right to education in the face of the Taliban diktatâ€ � .
There was no word from either countryâ€ ™ s leaders on whether they would accept the invitation to attend the award ceremony .
Recent days have seen one of the worst outbreaks of violence on the border between India and Pakistan for a decade , with about 20 killed and tens of thousands displaced by artillery barrages .
The exchanges of fire appeared to be easing on Friday night ."
2014-11-11,"With its shiny new articulated buses , freshly dug underpasses and dedicated flyovers , Islamabadâ€ ™ s new public transport system is supposed to be a symbol of a government that gets big things done .
But as a December deadline approaches before thousands of civil servants supposedly start taking the 15-mile Metro Bus journey for their commute into the heart of Pakistanâ€ ™ s capital , the final section of the route along the cityâ€ ™ s main avenue is a mess of giant holes and ripped up concrete .
Frantic construction work on the Â£265 m scheme ground to a halt in August when thousands of anti - government protesters , led by opposition politician Imran Khan and a cleric called Tahir - ul - Qadri , flooded into the city .
It is not just an important project that has been held up .
The protesters also succeeded in paralysing prime minister Nawaz Sharifâ€ ™ s government .
The industrialist won a landslide victory in 2013 with promises of reviving a dying economy , forcing a meddling army to finally accept the authority of elected civilians , and making peace with India .
More than 18 months later and every part of Sharifâ€
™ s ambitious agenda is seriously off track .
India has responded to Sharifâ€ ™ s peace overtures with an unprecedented upsurge in cross - border firing .
At home the government has been badly bruised by ferocious disagreements with the military , which earlier in the year succeeded in forcing the closure of one of countryâ€ ™ s most popular private news channels , against the governmentâ€ ™ s will .
And international investors have been seriously put off by the sight of thousands of protesters overwhelming the government quarter of the capital and smashing their way into the grounds of parliament in late August .
â€œBefore the protests we had a brilliant story to tell about Pakistan , â€ � said Mohammad Zubair Umar , chairman of the privatisation commission .
Last year , 2013 , had been a turning point for Pakistan , he said , pointing out that it was the first time a government had survived a full five - year term without being ousted in an army - backed coup .
It also saw the first successful transfer of power to another elected government .
â€œWe told investors that we now had the kind of political stability Pakistan never witnessed in its first 60 years , â€ � Umar said .
But many observers feared Pakistan might be reverting to type when Khan descended on Islamabad to protest against the 2013 election , which he claims was stolen from him
â€ “ something
independent election observers are highly sceptical about .
Multimillion - dollar transactions to offload shares in the countryâ€ ™ s Oil and Gas Development Company had to be postponed â€ “ foreign lawyers and financial advisers stayed clear of the country , let alone Umarâ€ ™ s office , which overlooks the parade ground Khan has taken over for his sit - in .
But despite the damage done , Sharif is determined to regain the initiative .
On 4 November he tried to inject some energy into the governmentâ€ ™ s effort to eradicate polio , which Pakistan has struggled to bring under control .
And on Friday he jetted off for a visit to Beijing following the deep embarrassment caused by the decision of Chinaâ€ ™ s president , Xi Jinping , to cancel a trip to Islamabad in the wake of the protests .
Sharif has told his cabinet to press on with implementing unpopular decisions , including weaning the public off unaffordable electricity subsidies as part of an effort to end rolling power blackouts that have badly stunted economic growth .
â€œHis political room to manoeuvre has narrowed and everything that was hard , on the economic reform programme , has got harder , â€ � said one diplomat .
And yet Sharif is showing no sign of making life easier for himself by appeasing the army , which was driven to distraction last year by an extreme act of provocation : the governmentâ€ ™ s historic decision to try a former army chief , Pervez Musharraf , for treason .
Allies of the prime minister say he has no desire to let off the hook the coup leader who ousted him from an earlier period as prime minister in 1999 .
Indeed , Sharif may even be emboldened by the ultimate failure of Khanâ€ ™ s street protests , which the former cricket star claimed would lead to the swift ousting of Sharif .
Conditions had seemed perfect for the army to demand Sharif step down in early September when thousands of protesters besieged the prime ministerâ€ ™ s house and even , briefly , seized control of the state broadcaster .
But Sharif survived when all of Pakistanâ€ ™ s politicians â€ “ except those loyal to Khan â€ “ appeared at a dramatic joint sitting of parliament to give their support to the prime minister .
Even though some protesters remain on the streets and Khan is threatening another big rally on 30 November , Umar says the crisis is in effect over .
â€œA similar crisis just 10 years ago would have forced out the government , â€ � he said .
â€œThe fact that parliament supported him proves Pakistan has changed.â€ �
Sharif has ordered an acceleration of an already ambitious privatisation programme , including a restructuring and sell - off of the state carrier Pakistan International Airlines , which will have to shed much of its large workforce .
â€œI was surprised because there are definitely some in the government who donâ€ ™ t think we should be opening up new fronts , â€ �
Umar said .
â€œBut if you donâ€ ™ t take these difficult decisions then what is the other option â€ “ just sitting like a lame duck prime minister and not doing anything?â€ �"
2014-12-17,"Pakistan buried its slaughtered children on Wednesday , as the prime minister on Wednesday promised a day of reckoning with militants behind the attack and the countryâ€ ™ s own history of backing some violent groups .
The brutal attack on a prestigious army school killed 148 , mostly students , in a bloody eight - hour siege that horrified even a country numbed by years of bombings , assassinations and suicide assaults .
Facing a wave of anger and grief , Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terror - related cases , and announced a dramatic shift in government policy towards extremist groups .
â€œWe announce that there will be no differentiation between â€˜goodâ€ ™ and â€˜badâ€ ™ Taliban
, â€ � he said , referring to the Pakistani militaryâ€ ™ s long history of clandestine support for those militant groups it believes support its own strategic objectives .
These have mostly been groups Islamabad sees as offsetting Indian influence , from violent separatist groups in Kashmir , to the Taliban in Afghanistan .
â€œWe have resolved to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated , â€ � he told a select group of politicians summoned to Peshawar , the site of the attack .
â€œ[The country ] must never forget these scenes.â€ �
Sharif also echoed army commandersâ€ ™ vows to step up military action against strongholds along the porous mountain border with Afghanistan .
With the country beginning three days of mourning , the armyâ€ ™ s chief of staff , Raheel Sharif , headed to Kabul for talks with the Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani , over tackling senior members of the Pakistani Taliban , based in the countryâ€ ™ s lawless east .
His top priority will almost certainly be to secure Afghanistanâ€ ™ s cooperation in capturing Mullah Fazlullah , the groupâ€ ™ s leader .
The tragedy that prompted the visit gave it urgency and gravity , but the irony of Pakistanâ€ ™ s request will be lost on few in the region .
For years Kabul has begged Pakistan to root out the Afghan Taliban leadership hiding inside its border , including its leader Mullah Omar .
Instead they have been tolerated , and sometimes supported , Afghan intelligence officials say .
In recent years though , the extremist violence that has tormented Afghanistan so long has become increasingly familiar across the border .
The school assault was unprecedented in its bloody sadism towards children , but comes after a string of other high - profile attacks , including on the international airport in the port city of Karachi .
Seven members of the Pakistan Taliban , or Tehrik - e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , scaled the school wall on Tuesday morning , some wearing suicide vests .
Inside they opened fire on students and teachers , including dozens attending a first aid training session in a large auditorium , leaving the rows of seats slick with blood and the walls pockmarked with bullets .
The siege lasted about eight hours , with commandos killing some of the attackers , while others blew themselves up .
Some of the dead were buried on Tuesday , but most of the funerals were to be held on Wednesday .
The father of one of the children , Akhtar Hussain , a labourer who said he had worked for years in Dubai to provide for his family , told the Associated Press : â€œThey finished in minutes what I had lived my whole life for , my son.â€ �
As he buried 14-year - old Fahad , he said : â€œThat innocent one is now gone in the grave , and I canâ€ ™ t wait to join him .
I canâ€
™ t live any more.â€ �
Analysts have long argued that the toll of insurgent attacks on Pakistani society and the army itself would eventually prompt a shift in attitudes inside the military , whose secretive ISI intelligence agency is widely believed to manage relations with extremist groups .
But the sweeping crackdown Kabul wants has so far not materialised , and Afghanistan has been reluctant to chase Pakistani militants while its own enemies are left in relative peace , drawing the two governments into a cycle of bloodshed and destruction .
That was reinforced on Wednesday , when insurgents attacked a bank in Afghanistanâ€ ™ s Helmand province , just as funeral rites for Tuesdayâ€ ™ s victims were getting under way .
At least 10 people were killed , Reuters reported .
Ghani , Afghanistanâ€ ™ s new president , wants to reset ties with Islamabad , and appears convinced that collaboration with Pakistan is the only path to peace for either nation .
â€œThe time has arrived for Afghanistan and Pakistan to act together against terrorism and extremism with honesty and effectiveness , â€ � Ghani said in a statement after the latest meeting , which also included the ISI chief , General Raheel .
Neither side disclosed the content of the meeting , but Pakistan said it had shared intelligence with Ghani .
â€œWe are hoping that we will see strong action from the Afghan side in the coming days , â€ �
the Pakistani army spokesman Major General Asim Saleem Bajwa said , adding that the new leadership in Kabul had shown it was willing to act .
However , Ghani is also a fierce nationalist , and is unlikely to agree any kind of long - term assistance tracking Pakistani Taliban in his country unless it is matched by a genuine crackdown on Afghan fighters sheltering in Pakistan .
It remains to be seen if Pakistanâ€ ™ s military leadership shares the prime ministerâ€ ™ s resolve , or if the civilian government will be able to crack down on groups who have carved out important roles for themselves providing services in a poor country with a weak state .
Their ambiguous position was on display at one of the funerals attended by the Guardian , where men with FIF placards mingled among the crowd .
A welfare organisation that makes a point of helping out at the scene of disasters , the Falah - e - Insaniyat Foundation is the â€œwelfareâ€ � wing of Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JuD ) , which is in turn the front for Lashkar - e - Taiba , the organisation accused of staging the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai .
All three organisations are proscribed by the UNâ€ ™ s terrorism sanction committee .
On Tuesday Hafiz Saeed , the leader of JuD and a man subject to a $ 10 m US bounty , took to the airwaves to largely exonerate the TTP of their crimes .
He said the school massacre been masterminded by India ."
2014-12-17,"Pakistanâ€ ™ s prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , has ordered a moratorium on the death penalty to be lifted for terror - related cases as families in Peshawar bury the 141 victims of the Taliban school attack .
With the country beginning three days of mourning , the armyâ€ ™ s chief of staff , Raheel Sharif , headed to Kabul for talks with the Afghan president , Ashraf Ghani , over tackling the senior Tehreek - e - Taliban members hiding on the Afghanistan side of the border .
His top prioritywill almost certainly be to secure Afghanistanâ€ ™ s cooperation in capturing Mullah Fazlullah , the Pakistan Talibanâ€ ™ s leader .
Responding to revulsion in Pakistan at the the atrocity , which left 132 schoolchildren dead , the prime minister approved an end to the death penalty moratorium , which was introduced in 2008 , for terror - related cases .
The move came after he chaired a meeting in Peshawar to discuss how to respond to the attack .
The moratorium applied only to civilians , and a soldier was executed in 2012 .
Hanging remains on the statute book and judges have continued to pass sentence , leaving about 8,000 people on death row .
The prime minister also echoed army commandersâ€ ™ vows to step up military action against Taliban strongholds in the federally administered tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan .
Some of the dead were buried overnight , but most of the funerals were to be held on Wednesday .
Nine members of the schoolâ€ ™ s staff were also killed .
Another 121 students and three staff members were wounded .
The school is run by the army , and many of the parents are military personnel .
The father of one of the children , Akhtar Hussain , a labourer who said he had worked for years in Dubai to provide for his family , told the Associated Press : â€œThey finished in minutes what I had lived my whole life for , my son.â€ �
As he buried 14-year - old Fahad , he said : â€œThat innocent one is now gone in the grave , and I canâ€ ™ t wait to join him .
I canâ€ ™ t live anymore.â€

As outrage and horror were expressed around the world , it remains to be seen whether the massacre will mark a turning - point in Pakistanâ€ ™ s ambiguous approach to militant extremists .
Pakistanâ€ ™ s intelligence agency , the ISI , has at times denounced the Pakistan Taliban while supporting its Afghan counterpart in an effort to offset growing Indian influence in Kabul .
It has also supported violent Kashmiri separatist groups responsible for terrorist attacks in India .
The speed with which the armyâ€ ™ s chief of staff decided to visit Kabul is significant , raising the question of whether Pakistan is finally prepared to work with the new Afghan president , not only to tackle Pakistan Taliban members hiding out in Kunar and Nuristan provinces , but also Afghan Taliban operating from the Pakistan side of the border .
Seven members of the Pakistan Taliban wearing suicide vests scaled the school wall on Tuesday morning before opening fire on students and teachers .
The siege lasted about eight hours , with commandos killing some of the attackers , while others blew themselves up .
Students said that female teachers were doused in petrol and burned alive .
Journalists allowed entry to the school on Wednesday reported seeing broken glass , rubble , childrenâ€ ™ s shoes and pools of blood in an auditorium where the army said about 100 of the victims had been killed .
An army spokesman , Maj Gen Asim Bajwa , who showed journalists round the school , said the body of the principal , Tahira Qazi , had been found among the debris .
She had locked herself in a bathroom but the Taliban threw a grenade into a vent , he said ."
2015-01-06,"Thousands of civilians have fled their homes as fighting between India and Pakistan spread on Tuesday along a 125-mile stretch of the disputed border splitting the Himalayan former kingdom of Kashmir .
At least 10 people have been killed by shelling and mortar fire since 31 December in the latest round of intermittent hostilities that have raged since the summer .
Though Narendra Modi , Indiaâ€ ™ s prime minister , surprised many by invitating Nawaz Sharif , his Pakistani counterpart , to his inauguration , tensions have been high since peace talks were called off in August .
Indian and Pakistani security officials have not spoken since 1 January , according to DK Pathak , director general of Indiaâ€ ™ s Border Security Force .
Pakistan has lost more lives and suffered more damage to property , he said .
â€œIt is not a happy situation and we would like the restoration of normalcy as fast and soon as possible , â€ � Pathak said .
â€œBut what can be done ?
If firing comes from their side we definitely have to respond.â€ � Pakistan in turn
accuses India of killing two of its men in an ambush on New Yearâ€ ™ s Eve .
About 10,000 Indians have now been displaced after the new fighting began last week .
â€œWe had a narrow escape and there is a war - like situation , â€ � Sham Kumar , 54 , from Sherpur village , told Reuters .
â€œPakistani troops are using long - range weapons .
It is the first time we have seen such intense shelling.â€ �
Adding to the tensions , at the weekend the crew of a fishing boat off the coast of India set fire to their craft and apparently killed themselves rather than surrender , according to Indian news reports .
Officials said this indicated that the crew were terrorists .
In 2008 , Pakistan - based militants landed in the Indian commercial capital , Mumbai , after travelling from Karachi , the southern Pakistani port city , and went on to launch a bloody raid in which more than 160 people died .
The US secretary of state , John Kerry , is expected to visit south Asia in the next few days .
He is due to attend an investment summit promoted by Modi at the weekend , and media reports say he will then travel to Islamabad .
Barack Obama will make a second official trip to India later in the month , seeking to strengthen ties between the worldâ€ ™ s two largest democracies .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947 , and Washingtonâ€ ™ s financial support to Pakistanâ€ ™ s military and government is a constant irritant in New Delhi , where Kerry is widely seen as pro - Pakistan .
Pakistan announced last week that the US ambassador had said a request had been made to Congress for a $ 532 m ( Â£350 m ) aid payment under an act co - authored by Kerry in 2009 .
Washington denied that on Monday , but not before drawing Indiaâ€ ™ s ire .
â€œHow the government of the United States of America decides to spend US taxpayersâ€ ™ money is entirely its prerogative , â€ � the foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said in a statement .
â€œHowever , India does not believe that Pakistan is showing â€˜sustained commitmentâ€ ™ â€ � against Islamist militants , he added .
The state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said no request had been made to Congress for a payment under the act , which requires Pakistan to cease support for extremist groups such as the Taliban and al - Qaida .
However , she said other funds were available to Pakistan .
In 2009 , under the Kerry - authored act , the US agreed to give an annual $ 1.5bn to Pakistan , and in 2013 it handed over the cash under a waiver despite what critics said was a lack of progress in countering Islamist militancy .
Funding for 2014 , the last year of the four - year plan , has not yet been released , Psaki said .
Washington has for years been trying to encourage a rapprochement between India and Pakistan .
In a statement , the Ministry of External Affairs in Islamabad said Pakistan was â€œopposed to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has been the biggest victim of terrorismâ€ � .
It added : â€œThe people and government of Pakistan are determined to eradicate this menace from our territory â€ ¦ On the other hand , the people of Pakistan see the escalation of tension by India â€ ¦ through continuous unprovoked firing and targeting of civilians , as an attempt to distract our armed forces from its valiant mission against all terrorists .
The baseless and preposterous Indian allegations regarding the so - called â€˜terror boatâ€ ™ from Pakistan are also in the same vein.â€ �"
2015-04-10,"Pakistanâ€ ™ s
parliament has dealt a blow to Saudi hopes of defeating Yemenâ€ ™ s Houthi rebels , with MPs voting overwhelmingly for the country to remain out of the conflict .
Fridayâ€ ™ s vote , which came as tensions continued to rise between Riyadh and Tehran over the conflict in Yemen , will make it extremely hard for the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , to offer anything more than symbolic help .
Saudi Arabia , a prized ally and generous donor to Pakistan , had called on Islamabad to provide warships , aircraft and even ground troops .
Last month Riyadh embarrassed Pakistanâ€ ™ s government by claiming it had already â€œexpressed desireâ€ � to participate in the operation .
MPs shot the plan down on Friday , however , passing a resolution saying that â€œPakistan should maintain neutrality in the Yemen conflictâ€ � .
It followed a week of debate in which politicians from across the spectrum called for the country not to become embroiled in what many regard as an overseas civil war .
Instead the resolution said Pakistan should play a mediating role , though it also promisese to â€œstand shoulder to shoulderâ€ � with Saudi Arabia in the event of an invasion or any threat to Islamâ€ ™ s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina â€ “ at present an unlikely scenario .
The national assemblyâ€ ™ s decision came as the first plane carrying medical supplies form the International Committee of the Red Cross landed in Yemenâ€ ™ s capital , Sanaâ€ ™ a .
Saudi fighter jets continued to bomb a number of targets close to the city , including the airforce headquarters , and in the south of the country near the port city of Aden , which has been the scene of heavy street fighting .
Pakistani opponents of military action argued that the country was already busy with major operations against its own Islamist rebels , including the Pakistani Taliban , and could not afford to get ensnared in Yemen .
With the struggle pitting a Saudi - led coalition of Sunni - majority countries against the Shia Houthi rebels , many also feared Pakistanâ€ ™ s involvement could make sectarian tensions inside the country worse .
In recent years there has been an increase in attacks by militant Sunni supremacists against Pakistanâ€ ™ s minority Shia population , including devastating bombings of neighbourhoods and places of worship .
A third factor making military action unpalatable to Islamabad is its need to maintain relations with its gas - rich neighbour Iran , which it hopes will help relieve chronic energy shortages should international sanctions against Iran be loosened .
On a two - day visit to Islamabad this week , the Iranian foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , lobbied the countryâ€ ™ s top decision makers , including Sharif and Pakistanâ€ ™ s military chief , Raheel Sharif .
Pakistan is torn by the need to remain on good terms with both Iran and Saudi Arabia , a country held in particularly high esteem by Sharif after it sheltered him following the 1999 military coup that ousted him from power .
Riyadh has also been a generous patron , handing Pakistan $ 1.5bn ( Â£1bn ) last year to help it shore up its foreign exchange reserves and launch large energy projects .
Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies see Iran as part of the problem in Yemen , accusing Tehran of meddling by sending arms and money to the Houthi rebels , who belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam , a charge Iran vehemently denies .
Riyadh says its involvement in Yemen is simply to support what it and the west see as the countryâ€ ™ s legitimate president , Abd - Rabbu Mansour Hadi , who fled to the Saudi capital last month .
Tehran and Riyadh have both stepped up their rhetoric , accusing each other of inflaming the conflict .
On Thursday , Iranâ€ ™ s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in his strongest condemnation yet , accused Saudi Arabia of committing genocide in Yemen and warned that its military intervention would ultimately backfire .
â€œSaudis are making a mistake , setting a bad precedent in the region , â€ � he said .
There are increasing fears in the Middle East that the fighting in Yemen might spiral out of control , with deeper Saudi involvement provoking Tehran to follow suit , leading to a full - scale proxy war of an even more sectarian nature .
At least 643 people , including children , have died and thousands have been wounded since the violence erupted in Yemen last year , and especially since the Saudis launched air strikes last month .
On Thursday alone , at least 20 Houthi rebels were killed in southern Yemen in eight dawn air raids by Saudi fighter jets .
According to the Saudi newspaper Arab News , the Saudi air force is using its new UK Typhoon jets for the first time in the Yemen campaign .
The air force has received 24 out of 72 Typhoon jets it ordered from the UK at a cost of $ 8bn ( Â£5.47bn ) .
Typhoons are generally equipped with 13 rockets as well as cruise missiles and anti - ground defence systems .
Figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show Saudi Arabia increased its imports of major weapons systems fourfold between 2010 and 2014 , compared with the previous five years , importing helicopters , armoured vehicles , and fighter aircraft .
Last month , Sweden announced that it had torn - up a decade - long arms agreement with Saudi Arabia after the two countries were embroiled in a human rights dispute .
But the UK government has sold Typhoon jets to the Saudis and is promoting further weapons sales to Oman , the UAE , and Bahrain ."
2015-05-12,"Putting old differences aside , Afghanistan and Pakistan are fighting the same enemy .
That seemed to be the message as the leaders of the two countries met in Kabul , pledging to work together to fight terrorism .
â€œI assure you , Mr President , that the enemies of Afghanistan can not be friends of Pakistan , â€ �
Pakistanâ€ ™ s
prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , said in a press conference on Tuesday during his first visit to Kabul since the inauguration of Ashraf Ghani as Afghan president .
Sharif came to the Afghan capital after Ghaniâ€ ™ s government worked for months to reboot relations with Pakistan .
The visit also followed a recent meeting in Qatar between people connected to the Afghan government and the Taliban political leadership , which raised hopes of restarting peace talks .
Reconciliation with Pakistan has been top of Ghaniâ€ ™ s agenda since his inauguration in September .
The Afghan president has called for cooperation on intelligence matters and previously hosted Pakistanâ€ ™ s army chief , General Raheel Sharif ( no relation to the prime minister ) , who was also part of Tuesdayâ€ ™ s delegation along with intelligence chief , General Rizwan Akhtar .
Ghani has also sought to soothe Pakistani concerns about Indian influence in Afghanistan .
Relegating India to the periphery of his foreign policy
, Ghani has sent a group of army cadets to an academy in Pakistan as opposed to India , where Afghan soldiers are normally trained , and suspended a request for Indian weapons .
For his part , Sharif vowed on Tuesday to help target militants hiding out in border areas , and to work more closely to fight regional terrorism .
â€œAny effort by any militant or group to destabilise Afghanistan will be dealt with severely and such elements will be outlawed and hunted down , â€ � Sharif said .
After years of accusing each other of nurturing terrorists to fight across the border , both countries now have relatively new leaders .
And the mutually friendly tone sounds sincere , said Scott Smith , director for Afghanistan and central Asia at the United States Institute for Peace .
â€œThe thaw in relations between the two governments is definitely real , â€ � said Smith .
â€œThe question is how long it will last.â€ �
Domestically , Ghaniâ€ ™ s foreign policy shift has been highly controversial and marks a stark departure from his predecessor , Hamid Karzai , who tried to strong - arm Pakistan and attempted to engage with the Taliban without consulting Islamabad .
People close to the former president are dismayed by what they see as a servile , one - way relationship , in which Ghani concedes too much without getting anything in return .
In an interview with the Guardian in March , Karzai warned Ghani not to bow to Pakistani pressure .
â€œWe want a friendly relationship but not to be under Pakistanâ€ ™ s thumb , â€ � Karzai said .
Karzaiâ€ ™
s opinion is one to take seriously .
The former president still holds influence and his public tirades might stoke discontent among people already impatient after more than a year of political gridlock .
To convince Afghans that he is not selling the country short , Ghani will need some tactical concessions from Pakistan .
â€œThatâ€
™ s where things can go wrong , â€ � Smith said .
â€œIf he doesnâ€ ™ t get enough soon enough , then he will be vulnerable to his domestic critics.â€
�
The change at the helm in Kabul does seem to have convinced Pakistan to engage in friendlier relations .
Abdul Qadir Baloch , a retired general now serving as the minister for states and frontier regions , said last yearâ€ ™ s election of Ghani had finally pushed Pakistanâ€ ™ s leadership to drop support for the Afghan Taliban .
â€œThe Taliban should understand that difficult days are ahead for them ,
â€ � he said .
â€œThe pressure is coming and they will not have anyone to look to for help.â€ � Baloch said the years when Afghan insurgents enjoyed security and sanctuary inside Pakistan were at an end and that both countries were now â€œon the same grid , on the same wavelengthâ€ � .
He said : â€œThey are to be killed and arrested wherever they are .
This side will kill them , that side will kill them.â€ �
However , with the launch of their annual spring offensive , the Taliban has made recent inroads in several Afghan provinces .
And while Pakistani politicians swear to fight the insurgency side by side with their Afghan partners , the countryâ€ ™ s military is accused of continuing to foment turmoil across the border .
Since last summer , military bombardments in North Waziristan have pushed more than 300,000 refugees into Afghanistan .
Following a Taliban massacre in December at a school in Peshawar , about 70,000 more undocumented Afghans have left Pakistan , according to the International Organisation for Migration .
Most have left after harassment from the authorities .
Still , Pakistanâ€ ™ s government claims to have done away with a distinction they have been accused of making for decades between so - called â€œgood Talibanâ€ � , who fought against a detested Kabul regime and their western and Indian allies , and the â€œbad Talibanâ€ � fighting for a full - blown sharia state in Pakistan .
Baloch said there was now â€œno question of good or badâ€ � .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have any good , and they donâ€ ™ t have any good .
We have bad and they have bad .
We have understood that now , â€ � he said ."
2015-07-10,"Narendra Modi , the prime minister of India , is set to make his first visit to Pakistan after accepting an invitation from his counterpart Nawaz Sharif .
The move , announced on Friday after a bilateral meeting at a regional summit in the Russian city of Ufa , brings a slender hope of a thaw in the relationship of the rival nuclear powers .
A series of recent rows and a fierce cross - border shelling last year had led most analysts to conclude there was little chance of a detente .
However , a joint statement issued on Friday after the meeting said both leaders recognised their â€œcollective responsibility to ensure peace and promote developmentâ€ � and included joint commitments on some of the most contentious issues between the two countries .
India and Pakistan were split in 1947 when they gained independence from Britain and have fought four wars since .
A stop - start peace process has been frozen since November 2008 when a group of Pakistan - based Islamic extremists attacked Mumbai ,
Indiaâ€ ™ s
commercial capital , killing 166 people .
Indian officials had previously refused to confirm Modiâ€ ™ s participation at the next summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation , which is being held in Islamabad , Pakistanâ€ ™ s capital , in 2016 .
But the statement said Sharif had reiterated an earlier invitation to Modi , which had been accepted .
Many remain sceptical .
â€œThe media always goes overboard when there is any India - Pakistan meeting and obviously if Prime Minister Modi travels to Pakistan next year , you will see the culmination of that .
But really , it again goes back to that basic thing [ that ] if there is any terrorist attack , all this is going to fall down , â€ � said Sameer Patil , a security expert at the Indian Council on Global Relations , a foreign policy thinktank in Mumbai .
Modi , who started his career with a hardline Hindu revivalist organisation and has made no secret of his nationalist vision of Indiaâ€ ™ s role in the region and the world , surprised many when he invited Sharif to his inauguration in May last year .
Senior Indian diplomats said the move was intended to gauge Sharifâ€ ™ s power within Pakistan , where decisions on foreign and security policy are effectively taken by the military .
Subsequent events â€œconfirmed our fearsâ€ � , one Indian diplomat told the Guardian earlier this year .
India has long argued that Pakistan shelters and sponsors Islamic militant groups such as Lashkar - e - Taiba , which is accused of being behind the terrorist assault on Mumbai .
Pakistan says India has failed to give it crucial evidence to prosecute the organisers of that attack and has repeatedly accused Delhi of backing separatist insurgents in its unsettled south - western state of Balochistan .
The joint statement said that both sides had agreed to discuss how to speed up the Mumbai case trial and that their security advisers would talk about issues connected to terrorism .
Modi and Sharif met during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ."
2016-01-13,"Pakistan said it had arrested members of the Islamist terror group widely blamed for a four - day attack on an airbase in India that threatened to wreck a thaw in relations between the two countries .
Islamabad announced on Wednesday that several individuals belonging to Jaish - e - Mohammad ( JeM ) had been arrested based on information supplied by India and Pakistanâ€ ™ s own investigations .
â€œThe offices of the organisation are also being traced and sealed , â€ � said a statement from the Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif .
The government said Pakistan was considering sending its own investigators to Pathankot , where six gunmen assaulted an airbase on 2 January , killing seven soldiers .
Past crackdowns on JeM ultimately failed to dismantle an organisation that continues to operate openly in Pakistan through its charity wing and numerous publications .
Wednesdayâ€ ™ s announcement is nonetheless a potentially significant step against an organisation long patronised by Pakistanâ€ ™ s military establishment as a proxy force against India .
The announcement was cheered by peace campaigners , who feared the Pathankot incident had been deliberately mounted to derail a renewal of high - level diplomatic engagement between the two south Asian countries , which have fought four wars since independence in 1947 .
Indiaâ€ ™ s foreign secretary , Subrahmanyam Jaisankar , is due to travel to Islamabad on Friday to discuss the resumption of the peace process between the neighbouring states , which has been stalled since the Mumbai terror attacks launched by Pakistan - based terrorists on targets in Indiaâ€ ™ s commercial capital in 2008 .
The meeting has hung in the balance as Delhi waited to see whether Islamabad would respond to the demand by the Indian prime minister , Narendra Modi , for Islamabad to take â€œfirm and immediateâ€ � action against those responsible for planning the Pathankot attack .
Many analysts suspect the incident , and an assault by gunmen on an Indian consulate in Afghanistan on 3 January , were deliberately intended to spoil historic overtures
Modi made on 25 December during a surprise visit to the Pakistani city of Lahore .
Some even feared that Pakistanâ€ ™ s powerful military establishment , rumoured to be unhappy with Sharifâ€ ™ s determination for rapid rapprochement with India , may have authorised the attacks .
JeM has long been associated with Pakistanâ€ ™ s military intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , which used the group as a proxy force to launch attacks inside Indian - held Kashmir , a Muslim - majority state that Pakistan claims for itself .
Masood Azhar , the groupâ€ ™ s leader , was arrested in the aftermath of a JeM assault on Indiaâ€ ™ s parliament in 2001 , but a court released him the following year .
Imtiaz Alam , the head of the South Asia Free Media Association , which campaigns for peace between the two countries , said the JeM arrests showed the military were serious in their oft - stated claim to be cracking down on all terrorist groups .
â€œThey are no more supported , even if some elements may have become autonomous and are doing their own private practice , â€ � he said .
â€œIt is a very good omen that Pakistan is taking the investigation seriously .
Even hawks like the Indian home minister says he has confidence in the Pakistani investigation.â€
�
Modi , a Hindu nationalist who won power in a landslide victory in 2014 , has repeatedly surprised observers with a series of unorthodox initiatives aimed at engaging with his counterpart in Pakistan .
He invited Sharif to his inauguration ceremony , but then allowed the armed forces to take part in a major artillery duel with their Pakistani counterparts after clashes along the contested border .
Senior officials later said that both moves had been designed to test Pakistanâ€ ™ s reactions and gauge the strength of its militaryâ€ ™ s influence on security and foreign policy .
The Pathankot assault , which dragged on for days before all the attackers were killed , has prompted fierce domestic criticism of Indiaâ€ ™ s security agenciesand the national security adviser , Ajit Doval .
Newspapers have reported poor perimeter security , coordination and decision - making â€ “
the Indian Express described â€œglaring gaps in planning , command , training and equipmentâ€ � â€ “ and ministers have been accused of making a series of misleading statements .
Underlining the complexity of evolving threats from terrorism in the region , Pakistan suffered an attack on one of its diplomatic missions on Wednesday when three attackers attempted to storm the consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad , the capital of Nangarhar province .
Local officials said at least seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed in an assault claimed by Islamic State , which has secured a foothold in Nangarhar .
The group claimed the attackers had succeeded in killing â€œseveral Pakistani intelligence officersâ€ � , but Islamabad said all of its staff were safe .

At least thirty people have been killed , and dozens injured .
Responding to the latest attack , Pakistanâ€ ™ s prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , said : â€œWe are determined and resolved in our commitment to wipe out the menace of terrorism from our homeland.â€ �
The attack is the latest in a long line of deadly insurgent attacks affecting Pakistan in recent years , as car bombs , suicide attacks and militant incursions continue to impact the country .

2016-02-22,"Laws that allow families to murder their daughters in the name of â€œhonourâ€ � and avoid punishment will be changed as soon as possible , Pakistanâ€ ™ s prime minister has promised .
Nawaz Sharif said the perpetrators of so - called honour killings must not be allowed to be forgiven by family members , in a challenge to sharia laws that could trigger a confrontation with religious conservatives .
â€œThis is totally against Islam and anyone who does this must be punished and punished very severely , â€ �
Sharif told the Guardian .
â€œChanging the law is something that needs to be done at the earliest possibility.â€ �
Sharif was speaking after the Pakistani premiere of an Oscar - nominated short documentary about â€œhonourâ€ � killings attended by senior cabinet members and diplomats .
Its director , Sharmeen Obaid - Chinoy , won Pakistanâ€ ™ s only Academy Award to date for Saving Face , her 2012 documentary about women disfigured by acid attacks .
She said toughening up existing laws would help change the climate in a country where the problem is widespread .
â€œBefore we can change mindsets we have to send the guilty to jail so people begin to understand that taking someoneâ€ ™ s life is a big deal and merits a lengthy jail sentence , â€ � she said .
According to the womenâ€ ™ s campaign group the Aurat Foundation , about 1,000 Pakistani women are killed every year for â€œbringing shameâ€ � on their families .
Some killings can be brazen , such as the 2014 killing of a woman by her family outside Lahoreâ€ ™ s high court .
Although religious leaders condemn the killings , there is wide support for the tradition under Islamic law that allows murderers to avoid punishment if they are forgiven by the family of their victims , a practice that sometimes involves the payment of â€œblood moneyâ€ � .
Such payments are unnecessary when the killer is a brother , father or uncle â€ “ he can simply be forgiven by the rest of the family .
Obaid - Chinoyâ€ ™ s 40-minute documentary
A Girl in the River tells the story of Saba Qaiser , an 18-year - old who survived being shot in the face by her father and uncle and dumped in a river .
The family said they had been humiliated and lost standing in the community after Qaiser married a man she fell in love with .
They had wanted her to submit to an arranged wedding to a relative the family considered to have higher social status .
Although initially determined not to forgive her father , Qaiser ultimately pardoned him after coming under intense pressure from male community leaders in her home town of Gujranwala .
In an interview featured in the film , Qaiserâ€ ™ s father told Obaid - Chinoy his attempt to kill his daughter had earned him greater respect among his neighbours .
The decision by Sharif â€ “ a veteran conservative politician who tried to introduce strict sharia law in the late 1990s â€ “ to confront the religious establishment has surprised some observers .
Mufti Kifayatullah , a leader of the Jamiat Ulema - e - Islam , a religious party , accepted that some Islamic laws were being misused to protect killers .
But he said any reform attempts would be resisted .
â€œRemoving Islamic laws shall never be tolerated as this country came in to being in the name of Islam , â€ �
he said .
â€œThe religious parties will not allow the government to solve the problem in this way.â€ �"
2016-10-10,"One of Pakistanâ€ ™ s most respected journalists has been barred from leaving the country after reporting on government concerns that the militaryâ€ ™ s support for jihadi groups was leaving the country internationally isolated .
Cyril Almeida , a prominent columnist and reporter for the leading Dawn newspaper , said he had been told he had been put on the â€œexit control listâ€ � days after penning a front - page story about a dramatic confrontation between Pakistanâ€ ™ s civilian and army leadership over militant groups that operate from Pakistan but engage in war against India and Afghanistan .
The story about the â€œunprecedentedâ€ � showdown between the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , and the armyâ€ ™ s spy chief triggered a storm of controversy when it was published in the English language paper on Thursday .
Almeida was booked on a Tuesday morning flight to Dubai for a long - planned holiday with members of his family but received word on Monday evening that he would not be allowed to board the plane .
â€œI am on the list
â€
“
I have seen it
and I have been told not to go to the airport , â€ � he said .
His news story had quoted unnamed senior officials who said they witnessed a remarkable showdown between Sharif and Rizwan Akhtar , the director general of the Inter - Services Intelligence directorate ( ISI ) , on 3 October .
According to Dawn , Akhtar was told Pakistan could only avoid international isolation if it took action against Jaish - e - Mohammad ( JeM ) , Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LeT ) and the Haqqani network .
JeM and LeT are jihadi groups dedicated to fighting against India , especially in the contested region of Kashmir , while the Haqqani network is a Taliban affiliate responsible for some of the deadliest attacks against local and Nato forces in Afghanistan .
India and the US have consistently alleged that all three groups receive clandestine ISI support , a claim Pakistan denies .
Dawnâ€ ™ s allegations were all the more incendiary because of their timing just weeks after a deadly militant attack on an Indian military base in the disputed territory of Kashmir that Delhi has blamed on Pakistan - based jihadis .
The government has repeatedly denied the story and announced on Monday that the matter had been discussed in a meeting with Sharif , Akhtar and the army chief , Gen Raheel Sharif .
In a statement Sharifâ€ ™ s office vowed â€œstern actionâ€ � for those responsible for a news story that â€œrisked the vital state interests through inclusion of inaccurate and misleading contents which had no relevance to actual discussion and factsâ€ � .
On Monday night Dawnâ€ ™ s editor , Zaffar Abbas , issued a statement on an official Facebook page standing by a story which he said had been â€œverified , cross - checked and fact - checkedâ€ � .
â€œThe elected government and state institutions should refrain from targeting the messenger , and scapegoating the countryâ€ ™ s most respected newspaper in a malicious campaign , â€ � the statement said ."
2016-10-28,"Police have fired tear gas at protesters near the Islamabad home of Imran Khan as the former cricketer turned politician vowed to ignore a government ban on demonstrations in the Pakistani capital .
Khan , leader of the Pakistan Tehreek - e - Insaf ( PTI ) , has vowed to shut down the capital to protest against what he alleges is the corruption of the prime minister , Nawaz Sharif .
The government banned all gatherings in the capital on Thursday in an effort to head off a repeat of Khanâ€ ™ s four - month long demonstration in 2014 which attracted tens of thousands of his supporters to the government quarter of Islamabad , some of whom stormed the offices of the state broadcaster and the lawns of parliament .
Police were deployed on Friday outside Khanâ€ ™ s hilltop mansion in the outskirts of Islamabad while shipping containers were used to block roads in the nearby city of Rawalpindi to try to stop PTI supporters from attending a rally called by Sheikh Rashid , a key Khan ally from the Awami Muslim League ( AML ) party .
In Rawalpindi , Khanâ€ ™ s supporters fought running battles with police , hurling rocks and resisting police baton charges .
Khan accused the prime minister of putting him under â€œhouse
arrestâ€
� , although there was no suggestion that he had been prevented from leaving his property .
â€œNawaz
Sharif put me in jail , Iâ€ ™ ll get out of jail and come after you again , â€ �
he said .
â€œYou have house arrested me right now , it doesnâ€ ™ t matter .
It doesnâ€
™
t matter to me , it doesnâ€
™
t matter to our workers .
We will come back even stronger.â€
�
Earlier he called for nationwide protests after a PTI youth wing meeting in Islamabad was raided by police on Thursday night and 38 activists arrested .
Party workers remain adamant that their planned protest in the capital will go ahead on 2 November , although many political analysts say Khan is pursuing a high - stakes strategy with a slim chance of success .
Khan has said next weekâ€ ™ s protests will bring a million people onto the streets and sit - ins will force the closure of schools , public offices and the main international airport .
He is also due to be joined by the supporters of Tahir - ul - Qadri , the leader of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek , a religious party capable of turning out large numbers of people .
In theory the demonstrations are trying to force an investigation into the affairs of Sharif after it was revealed earlier this year that his children owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands .
But in recent days Khanâ€ ™ s statements have suggested he would favour the countryâ€ ™ s powerful army stepping in to force the prime minister from office .
Although Sharif enjoys a hefty parliamentary majority , having won a landslide election victory in 2013 , his position was recently undermined after his government clashed with the military establishment .
The countryâ€ ™
s generals were angered by a newspaper leak claiming the government had warned the army that its protection of jihadist groups that attack Afghanistan and India from Pakistani territory was leading to international isolation for the country .
Often fraught relations between the army and government are currently more strained than usual as Sharif prepares to appoint a new army chief in the coming weeks ."
2016-11-01,"Imran Khan has abandoned plans to bring Islamabad to a standstill after Pakistanâ€ ™ s highest court agreed to his petition to launch an inquiry into corruption allegations against the prime minister .
Khan , the leader of the Tehreek - e - Insaf party ( PTI ) , had vowed to â€œlock downâ€ �
Pakistanâ€ ™ s capital on Wednesday as part of his campaign against Nawaz Sharif after the leaking of the Panama Papers .
He says the prime minister must explain how his children became owners or trustees of offshore companies that own expensive London property .
With thousands of Khanâ€ ™ s supporters bearing down on the capital on Tuesday , the supreme court offered a way out of the crisis , saying the PTI and the governing Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) ( PML - N ) had until Thursday to agree terms of reference for the judge - led inquiry or the court would decide them .
Sharif and his children deny any wrongdoing , but Khan has suggested that the familyâ€ ™ s offshore companies may have been used to hide â€œill - gotten wealthâ€ � or avoid tax .
The imposing supreme court building was surrounded by heavy security for a hearing that attracted leading politicians from the government and the opposition .
Islamabad had been braced for the arrival of thousands of Khanâ€ ™ s supporters , in a repeat of the PTIâ€ ™ s 2014 street protests that lasted four months .
Fearing violent confrontations in the heart of the capital , the government had taken extraordinary steps to head off the protests , including placing shipping containers across some of the access roads into Islamabad and using colonial - era legislation to ban gatherings of more than four people in Punjab , Pakistanâ€ ™ s largest province .
The precautions led Amnesty International to say the government was using â€œunnecessary and excessive forceâ€ � .
The PTI initially said that two of its supporters had died because of â€œexcessive use of expired teargas shellsâ€
� by police , but later withdrew the claim .
Speaking from his hilltop mansion on the outskirts of Islamabad , which has been surrounded by police and PTI supporters in recent days , Khan said the court decision was a victory â€œfor the downtrodden classes of Pakistanâ€ � .
â€œThis is what we wanted in Pakistan , to hold the powerful accountable , which has never happened in the history of our country , â€ � he said .
Instead of a protest , he said his party would stage a â€œthanksgiving rallyâ€
� on an officially designated parade ground some way from the sensitive government quarter that was the focus of the 2014 protests .
In response , the government ordered the removal of barricades blocking roads into the capital and began releasing detained PTI workers .
The impending protest had created a sense of crisis in Islamabad , where Sharif is embroiled in a poisonous row with Pakistanâ€ ™ s military , a powerful institution he had hoped to curb when he came to power in 2013 .
Some of the prime ministerâ€ ™ s aides feared violent clashes between government - controlled police and PTI workers would have provided a pretext for the army to force Sharif from power .
The army and the government have been at loggerheads over various issues , including whether counter - terrorism operations led by the military should be extended to Sharifâ€ ™ s home turf of Punjab and the oversight of a Chinese investment programme worth up to $ 46bn ( Â£38bn ) .
But relations deteriorated further last month when daily newspaper Dawn carried a front - page story with details of a security meeting , in which senior politicians warned top generals that Pakistan was becoming internationally isolated because the army was protecting militant groups fighting in Afghanistan and India .
The army said it considered the leak â€œa breach of national securityâ€ � .
Privately , military sources accused the PML - N of deliberately trying to undermine the army .
On Saturday , the government announced the resignation of the information minister , Pervaiz Rasheed , a longstanding ally of Sharif , as part of its inquiry into the affair .
Although the government denied that Rasheed had been the source of the story , the interior minister , Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan , said he should have tried to block publication of the article .
Some analysts said Khan was struggling to attract anything like the 1 million supporters he had promised to the Islamabad protest .
A few thousand activists had been seen attempting to enter Islamabad in recent days from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , where the PTI is in power .
The minister of state , Miftah Ismail , said Khanâ€ ™ s decision to call off the protest was a face - saving measure .
â€œI think PTI was unable to get sizeable crowd together and felt under pressure to call off their lockdown and save themselves embarrassment , â€ � he said ."
2016-11-26,"Pakistanâ€ ™ s prime minister has named his choice for the next head of the countryâ€ ™ s army after weeks of uncertainty , and just days before the position falls vacant .
A spokesman for Nawaz Sharif said the new chief of army staff would be Qamar Javed Bajwa , a lieutenant general currently in charge of military training .
He will take over from outgoing Raheel Sharif at a change - of - command ceremony on Tuesday .
The prime minister also selected a more senior general , Zubair Hayat , as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee .
The commander of the worldâ€ ™ s sixth largest army is among the most powerful men in the nuclear - armed state .
Talat Masood , a retired general , said the appointment of Bajwa would soothe current tensions between the military and the prime minister , who has repeatedly clashed with the outgoing army chief .
â€œGeneral Bajwa is not one of those who will try to assert his personality in order to dominate the political scene , or constantly be in the media , â€ � Masood said .
â€œHe is more reserved than his predecessor and that will help make the situation more harmonious with the government.â€ �
As army chief , Sharif earned huge popularity for the fall in violence that followed his decision to crackdown on domestic terror groups .
Some Pakistanis demanded that his term in office be extended but Sharif always insisted he would step down as scheduled after three years â€ “ the first army chief in two decades to do so .
The prime minister has long hoped to assert the supremacy of civilian rule over an army that cut short his second government in 1999 , when he was overthrown by a military coup led by Pervez Musharraf , the army chief of the day .
Since returning to power in 2013 , the prime minister has fallen out with the army over an attempt to prosecute Musharraf for treason , and the antics of a pro - government private news channel that accused the armyâ€ ™ s intelligence agency of attempting to assassinate a popular journalist .
More recently , the two sides clashed following a newspaper story leaked by one of the prime ministerâ€ ™ s aides that claimed the army was protecting Islamist groups that fight against India and Afghanistan .
Bajwa was selected for the role despite a vilification campaign on social media that spread claims some of his relatives were members of the Ahmadiyya community , an Islamic sect despised as heretics by religious hardliners .
He has held senior command positions in the countryâ€ ™ s mountainous north , including the contested region of Kashmir , where Pakistani and Indian troops have been exchanging lethal fire for months .
In addition to managing tensions with India , Bajwa is likely to continue his predecessorâ€ ™ s policy of fighting domestic jihadi groups , particularly the Pakistani Taliban .
Masood said the new army chief might also take a tougher line against militant groups that fight in Afghanistan and India â€ “ a longstanding demand of the international community .
â€œThe change of command gives him an opportunity to do that and my impression is that he believes it is necessary , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe will try to make Pakistan not become a reason for the world to point fingers.â€ �"
2016-12-01,"Donald Trump has heaped praise on Pakistan , traditionally a troublesome US ally , saying it is a â€œfantastic country , fantastic place of fantastic peopleâ€ � according to an official statement released by Islamabad .
The US president - elect made his effusive comments in a phone conversation on Wednesday with Nawaz Sharif , prime minister of the nuclear - armed state , whom Trump hailed as a â€œterrific guyâ€ � .
The statement by the governmentâ€ ™ s Press Information Department quoted Trump saying : â€œAs I am talking to you prime minister , I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long .
Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities .
Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people.â€ �
It is unlikely to be a verbatim transcript , with some of the phrasing sounding like the style of a Pakistani notetaker , or possibly prime minister Sharif himself , who is regularly teased for his style of English by the Friday Times , a weekly newspaper .
Some observers were surprised by the apparent tone of the conversation .
Although there have been worries that Trumpâ€ ™ s business interests might lead him to favour India whilst in office , the property magnate said he had nothing but respect for Pakistanis .
He said : â€œPlease convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people.â€ �
Trump also reportedly said he would â€œloveâ€ � to visit Pakistan , a country that has not been on the itinerary of a US president since 2006 , when George W Bush visited amid extraordinary security precautions .
It is unlikely Sharif was expecting such a torrent of praise when he phoned Trump to congratulate him on his election victory .
Relations between the two countries have been fraught for years , with the Obama administration despairing at Pakistanâ€ ™ s harbouring of the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network , two insurgent groups that have used Pakistan soil to launch attacks on US and Nato troops in Afghanistan for more than 15 years .
Current rows between the two countries include US demands for the release from prison of Shakil Afridi , a doctor who helped lead the CIA to the hiding place of former al - Qaida leader Osama bin Laden ; the withholding of $ 300 m in â€œreimbursementsâ€ � to the Pakistani army ; and the holding up of a financing deal that would have allowed Islamabad to by US F16 fighter jets .
But none of those issues appeared to weigh on Trump , who reportedly told Sharif : â€œYou are doing amazing work which is visible in every way.â€ � Pakistan will be cock - a - hoop over Trumpâ€ ™ s apparent enthusiasm for engaging with a country that has few firm international allies .
â€œI am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems , â€ �
Trump was reported as saying .
Narendra Modi , prime minister of India , is currently campaigning to diplomatically isolate Pakistan following a serious flare - up of hostilities in Kashmir , the contested Himalayan region the two countries have fought over three times since 1947 .
Earlier this year Modi succeeded in persuading Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Bhuta to pull out of a regional summit that was due to be held in Islamabad in protest at Pakistanâ€ ™ s alleged support for militant groups .
Whilst India is strongly opposed to third - party mediation of the Kashmir dispute , Pakistan desperately hopes to â€œinternationaliseâ€ � the issue .
This article was amended on 1 December .
It originally said the last US president to visit Pakistan was Bill Clinton in 2000 .
This has been corrected ."
2016-12-04,"In three phone calls with key Asian leaders this week , Donald Trump has once again upended expectations .
We may now indeed have a radical break in the US approach to the region .
The first of these , with Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan , came with a detailed text of the conversation released by the Pakistani prime ministerâ€ ™ s office .
He is reported to have lavished praise on Sharif and the country more generally in what appears to be Trumpâ€ ™ s typically solicitous approach to relationship building .
While not making any specific commitments or promises the detail of the call revealed by the Pakistan government makes life difficult for the US given how much time and effort it has put into improving its relations with India and may prompt unrealistic expectations in Islamabad .
Then in a call with the Philippinesâ€ ™ president , Rodrigo Duterte , the president - elect is reported to have endorsed Duterteâ€ ™ s anti - drug campaign that has unleashed lawless vigilantism in which more than 5,000 people have died .
This was the source of the breakdown in US - Philippines relations , with Duterte famously calling Obama a â€œson of a whoreâ€ � for criticising his approach .
While Trumpâ€ ™ s endorsementmay mend fences with the Philippines , it flies in the face of Americaâ€ ™ s decades - long commitment to human rights and the rule of law .
Then to cap it off Trump took a highly publicised phone call from the relatively new Taiwanese president , Tsai Ing - wen .
Since the US recognised the Peopleâ€ ™ s Republic of China and ended diplomatic ties to Taiwan in 1979 , no US president or president - elect has met or spoken to a Taiwanese president .
In so doing Trump has inflamed cross - Strait relations
â€
“ Beijing is blaming Taiwan for instigating the call â€ “ and cast doubts over the direction of US - China policy .
Indeed some believe that this could presage the end of the â€œone - China policyâ€ � and herald a new cold war .
There is much uncertainty about just what these conversations entailed , who prompted them â€ “
Trump tweeted that the call came from Taiwan but it could only have occurred with his teamâ€ ™ s cooperation â€ “ and what policy import they will actually have .
There is a risk in overstating their importance , it is early days and these were short calls .
But there does appear to be a thread to these conversations , particularly with Taiwan , that under Trump the US will adopt a hard - nosed realpolitik posture in Asia and that he is content to break with Washington orthodoxy even as it comes with real risks .
But the calls also display an inexperienced foreign policy team that is handling itself clumsily and causing problems that will give the new administration headaches .
In the case of China , depending on how Beijing chooses to respond , that headache could be severe .
Equally , the calls are ceding a lot , in narrative terms , to the foreign leaders using calls to frame relations with the US in advantageous ways .
That the US is allowing itself to be used in this way in striking .
Transition between administrations is always a difficult time in US foreign policy .
Based on the signals being sent this week , the Trump administration has ambition but also has much to learn about the complexities of managing the foreign dealings of the worldâ€ ™ s most powerful country .
It will be an interesting four years .

2016-12-05,"Pakistanâ€ ™ s prime minister has risked enraging religious hardliners by ordering one of the countryâ€ ™ s top universities to honour a Nobel prize - winning physicist from a minority sect whose members are banned from describing themselves as Muslims .
In an announcement that surprised many , Nawaz Sharif said he had given approval to rename the National Centre for Physics at the capitalâ€ ™ s Quaid - e - Azam University as the â€œProfessor Abdus Salam Centre for Physicsâ€ � .
A fellowship programme to support five physicists a year to study abroad for their doctorates will also be named after Salam .
The recognition comes 20 years after the death of a scientist who won the Nobel prize in 1979 for his work in theoretical physics .
Despite the international esteem in which he was held â€ “ and his role in helping Pakistan develop nuclear weapons â€ “ governments in his homeland have not dared embrace a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community .
The sect , established in British India in 1889 , is regarded as heretical by strict Muslims because Ahmadis believe the movementâ€ ™ s founder , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , was a prophet .
A central tenet of Islam is that Mohammad , the religionâ€ ™ s seventh - century founder , was the final prophet .
Because of the theological dispute , Ahmadis were declared to be non - Muslims in a 1974 constitutional amendment and further criminalised in 1984 when they were banned from â€œposing as Muslimsâ€ � .
It means Ahmadis run the risk of imprisonment if they are caught calling their places of worship â€œmosquesâ€ � , participating in the annual Eid animal sacrifice or even using common Islamic greetings .
Like those of many others buried in the town of Rabwah , a major centre for Ahmadis , Salamâ€ ™ s gravestone has been defaced so that the word Muslim is not visible .
In a recent reminder of the enduring passions surrounding the issue , the new chief of Pakistanâ€ ™ s army was falsely accused in the days before his appointment last month of having Ahmadi relatives .
Pervez Hoodbhoy , a physicist who has campaigned for 20 years for the facility at Quaid - e - Azam to be renamed after Salam , said Sharifâ€ ™
s action was a â€œtremendous developmentâ€ � that came after the prime minister saw him talking about the issue on a television show .
Later , Sharifâ€ ™ s office urged Hoodbhoy to make a formal request to the government for Salam to be honoured .
â€œThis shows that the most persecuted community in Pakistan is getting some kind of recognition , â€ �
he said .
â€œNawaz Sharif has shown courage and an astonishing degree of enlightenment.â€ �
He added that the former leaders Pervez Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto , both avowed liberals , had never risked praising an Ahmadi .
During general elections in 2013 , the opposition leader Imran Khan went out of his way to reassure voters that he had no intention of changing the laws that discriminate against Ahmadis .
Sharif however praised Salam as a â€œgreat Pakistaniâ€ � in January this year .
A month previously police in the prime ministerâ€ ™ s political base of Lahore took down anti - Ahmadi posters in one of the cityâ€ ™ s shopping markets .
Hasan Munir , deputy education director for the Amhadi community in Pakistan , said it was a â€œsmall but positive step in the right
directionâ€ � .
â€œThere is not even a single road or university that has been named after him , all because of pressure from the clergy , â€ � he said .
Although there is a centre named after of Salam at Government College University Lahore , the name board has been taken down from public display .
Maulana Allah Wasaia , head of Tahaffuz - e - Khatm - e - Nubuwwat , an anti - Ahmadi group , accused the government of trying to â€œplease its foreign mastersâ€ � .
â€œIf a matter has been constitutionally decided then the government should not make it part of larger debate , â€ � he said .
â€œWe should recall that Dr Salam himself left Pakistan in protest after Ahmadis were declared non - Muslims .
Naming a physics centre after a person who did not like Pakistan is strange and is a wrong message here.â€ �"
2017-05-12,"On Sunday Chinese President Xi Jinping will welcome world leaders including Russiaâ€ ™ s Vladimir Putin , Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Myanmarâ€ ™ s Aung San Suu Kyi to Beijing for what is billed as Chinaâ€ ™ s most important diplomatic event of the year : a two - day forum celebrating Xiâ€ ™ s
so - called â€˜Belt and Road initiativeâ€ ™ .
The Belt and what initiative ?
Even Chinese officials have struggled to define the awkwardly - named scheme and a flurry of music - themed propaganda about Xiâ€ ™ s signature foreign policy in the lead - up to this
weekendâ€ ™ s event has done little to clear things up .
â€œIt is not a solo song but a chorus , â€ � one veteran Chinese diplomat claimed cryptically this week .
â€œ[It is ] a Chinese solution to global economic blues , â€ � said the official news agency Xinhua .
Foreign minister Wang Yi has described the initiative as a â€œsymphony of all relevant partiesâ€ � .
In concrete terms , the Belt and Road initiative is an immensely ambitious development campaign through which China wants to boost trade and stimulate economic growth across Asia and beyond .
It hopes to do so by building massive amounts of infrastructure connecting it to countries around the globe .
By some estimates , China plans to pump $ 150bn into such projects each year .
In a report released at the start of this year , ratings agency Fitch said an extraordinary $ 900bn in projects were planned or underway .
There are plans for pipelines and a port in Pakistan , bridges in Bangladesh and railways to Russia - all with the aim of creating what China calls a â€œmodern Silk Roadâ€ � trading route that Beijing believes will kick start â€œa new era of globalisationâ€ � .
According to the global consultancy McKinsey , the plan has the potential to massively overshadow the USâ€ ™ post - war Marshall reconstruction plan , involving about 65 % of the worldâ€ ™ s population , one - third of its GDP and helping to move about a quarter of all its goods and services .
Some describe Xiâ€ ™ s scheme as the biggest development push in history .
But why Belt and Road ?
The Belt and Road initiative has two main prongs : one is called the â€˜Silk Road Economic Beltâ€ ™ ( the belt ) and the other the â€˜21st Century Maritime Silk Roadâ€ ™ ( the road ) .
Bewilderingly , the â€˜roadâ€ ™ is not actually a road but rather a sea route linking Chinaâ€ ™ s southern coast to east Africa and the Mediterranean .
The â€˜beltâ€ ™ is a series of overland corridors connecting China with Europe , via Central Asia and the Middle East .
â€œIt is a very confusing name , â€ � admits Peter Cai , the author of a recent report about Belt and Road , who blames Chinaâ€ ™ s propaganda - focused state media for failing to properly explain the concept to the world .
â€œThere is still a lot of confusion about what the Belt and Road initiative is and what it actually entails.â€
�
The initiativeâ€ ™ s
Chinese name - yi dai yi lu or â€œone belt , one roadâ€ � - rolls off the tongue far more easily .
When did it start and what has happened ?
The initiative was officially launched in September 2013 when President Xi used a speech at a university in Kazakhstan to call for the creation of a â€œSilk Road Economic Beltâ€ � .
The project was later expanded and re - branded with its current name .
Beijing has championed a number of achievements , foremost among them the $ 62 billion China - Pakistan economic corridor ( Cpec ) , a sprawling web of motorways , power plants , wind farms , factories and railways , that supporters say will spark an â€œeconomic revolutionâ€ � and create up to one million jobs in Pakistan .
Other high - profile schemes include a $ 1.1 billion port project in Sri Lanka , a high - speed rail link in Indonesia and an industrial park in Cambodia .
However , experts say that nearly four years after the initiative began most projects remain on the drawing board .
â€œWe really are at a very early stage of implementation , â€ � says Cai , a fellow at Australiaâ€ ™ s Lowy Institute .
â€œItâ€
™ s still early days to pass a judgement on the success or failure of the Belt and Road.â€
�
At this weekendâ€ ™ s conference , China hopes to put some meat on the bones of Xiâ€ ™ s pet project .
Why is the Belt and Road initiative so important to China ?
Observers say a number of overlapping goals lie behind Chinaâ€ ™ s â€˜Belt and Roadâ€ ™ campaign .
In many ways it is an economic plan designed to open up and create new markets for Chinese goods and technology at a time when the economy is slowing and to help export excess cement and steel capacity by shifting factories overseas to less developed countries .
Beijing also hopes Xiâ€ ™ s initiative will help boost the economies of less developed border regions such as Xinjiang by linking them with neighbouring countries .
But many believe the Belt and Road initiative is also a geopolitical gambit to boost Chinaâ€ ™ s regional clout at a time when Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s US looks to be stepping back from Asia .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about making China the dominant country in the region , â€ � says Tom Miller , the author of a book about the scheme called Chinaâ€ ™ s Asian Dream .
Cai said it was indisputable that Belt and Road would have geopolitical consequences , giving Beijing greater leverage over its neighbours .
â€œIt will give China more influence.â€ �
How do other countries feel about it ?
Xiâ€ ™ s initiative has been greeted with a mix of excitement and suspicion .
Miller , who has visited many of the countries involved , said many governments in central and south - east Asia were genuine cheerleaders .
â€œThere are certain countries , like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan , where it is literally keeping the lights on , â€ � he said , pointing to massive Chinese power transmission projects in those nations .
Others , however , feared that by becoming indebted to Beijing they would become â€œeconomic vassalsâ€ � .
Some countries , such as India , suspect the project is simply a smokescreen China is using to seize strategic control of the Indian Ocean .
Indiaâ€ ™ s prime minister , Narendra Modi , has accused Beijing of trying to â€œundermine the sovereignty of other nationsâ€ � and will shun this weekâ€ ™ s summit .
Many in the west are also wary .
Beijing has said 28 heads of state and government leaders will attend Xiâ€ ™ s forum but German chancellor Angela Merkel has turned down an invitation and US president Donald Trump is not expected to attend .
Only one G7 leader , Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni , has confirmed .
The UK will be represented by the chancellor , Philip Hammond , suggesting Downing Street did not want to offend Chinaâ€ ™ s leaders too much despite Theresa Mayâ€ ™ s decision to take a rain check ."
2017-07-28,"No prime minister of Pakistan has completed a full term in power since the country won independence 70 years ago .
Nawaz Sharif was a year away from doing so ; instead he has been ousted for a third time .
On Friday the supreme court disqualified him from office and referred the issue of his familyâ€ ™ s offshore assets to anti - corruption authorities .
Mr Sharif denies the allegations , but stood down at once ; his ruling Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz party is expected to nominate a successor shortly .
Though this leaves Pakistanâ€ ™ s politics in turmoil , it is a very international affair .
It was sparked by revelations in the Panama Papers â€ “ the unprecedented leak from an offshore law firm â€ “ concerning luxury London property , bought through British Virgin Islands companies linked to Mr Sharifâ€ ™ s children , who were minors at the time .
In 2008 , they used the Swiss arm of Deutsche Bank to borrow Â£7 m against the flats .
The files proved , in eye - opening fashion , that members of the political elite have not played by the rules their citizens obey .
The very wealthy realised long ago that they could maximise and conceal their wealth ( and its origins ) by exploiting the existence of multiple jurisdictions .
Journalists have taken note .
The German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung shared the data ; the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists arranged for teams from 80 countries â€ “ including a group at the Guardian â€ “ to collaborate in reporting .
Equally strikingly , authorities have begun to band together to tackle tax evasion and corruption across borders â€ “ sometimes through simultaneous raids .
The Panama Papers sparked the resignation of Icelandâ€ ™ s prime minister within days .
David Cameron came under intense scrutiny over his familyâ€ ™ s tax affairs .
Malta is still dealing with the political fallout .
Now Mr Sharif has gone .
The impact has been financial too : governments are tracing billions of dollars in unpaid taxes or other assets .
The European commission has published proposals to get tough on offshore tax schemes .
Efforts must not stop there .
The public register for beneficial owners of UK companies must be extended to British tax havens ; it must include trusts ; and a proper means of checking it must be introduced .
Accountability should not depend on leaks , however effective they have proved this time ."
