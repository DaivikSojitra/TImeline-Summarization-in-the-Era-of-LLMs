2007-09-21,"Two spouses of leading Democratic presidential candidates - Bill Clinton and Michelle Obama - are to visit London next month to try to tap into an increasing source of campaign funds from Americans living abroad .
With the 2008 presidential elections emerging as the most expensive in US history , Democratic and Republican campaigns are looking across the Atlantic for campaign funds .
In the first six months of this year , US expatriates donated $ 471,000 ( £ 235,000 ) to presidential candidates , a report by the Centre for Responsive Politics said , nearly as much as was donated in the entire 2000 election season .
Most of the money was raised in London , which accounted for $ 270,000 of the total .
The biggest beneficiary has been Barack Obama , who raised $ 194,000 outside the US in the first six months of 2007 .
Rudy Giuliani , the Republican frontrunner , took in $ 119,000 in the same period .
Hillary Clinton 's haul was $ 51,000 .
The focus on London sharpened this week with Mr Giuliani 's visit .
Next month Bill Clinton and Michelle Obama are to headline fundraising events .
Tickets to the Clinton event will sell for more than $ 1,000 .
The Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich , who is married to a Londoner , also made a recent visit .
By law , only US citizens and permanent residents ( green card holders ) are allowed to contribute to election campaigns .
But the 4 million to 7 million Americans living overseas have emerged as an increasingly important source of funds .
"" It 's not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things but it is definitely on the sharp increase , "" said Massie Ritsch , a spokesman for the Centre for Responsive Politics .
"" I think the candidates are looking for money wherever they can find it . ""
At a press conference in London this week , Mr Giuliani said : "" Given the expense of American presidential elections , every fundraising opportunity is important .
You 've got to take advantage of it . ""
With the race for the White House in full swing , candidates need to pay for television advertisements , private jet travel and staff .
Ms Clinton has led in overall fundraising , bringing in $ 63 m in the first six months of this year , compared with $ 59 m for Mr Obama .
Among Republicans , the former governor of Massachusetts , Mitt Romney , is ahead after raising $ 44 m .
Mr Giuliani raised $ 35.6 m .
The influence of money over US presidential politics has come under increasing scrutiny after a volunteer who raised $ 850,000 for the Clinton campaign was accused of extorting donations or secretly reimbursing donors - which is a violation of campaign financial laws .
There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign knew about the activities of the fundraiser , Norman Hsu .
The campaign has already said it would return the money after it emerged this month that he faced charges of defrauding investors .
But the scandal has strengthened the argument of those critics who believe money plays an outsize role in US politics .
"" It does seem like the more money they are raising the more problems their donors are making for them , "" Mr Ritsch said .
"" I think it 's a result of having to rely on as many people as you can to raise money for you .
You do n't have the control that a campaign might want . """
2007-11-28,"It 's nice to know that Barack Obama talks to his wife , Michelle , "" on occasion "" about the important work he does every day as a United States senator .
Michelle Obama , a graduate of Harvard law school and a former executive at the University of Chicago hospital , is by all accounts an impressive figure .
It 's not so nice to know that her husband doubts her service as supportive spouse , which includes acting as a sounding board and political adviser as well as raising two young daughters virtually on her own , would qualify her to be a senator herself one day .
"" I do n't think Michelle would claim that she is the best qualified person to be a United States senator by virtue of me talking to her on occasion about the work that I 've done , "" Obama told ABC news .
By putting his wife in her place , Obama of course is hoping to put Hillary Clinton in hers , casting her in the role of a "" wife of ... "" who is now trying to leverage her connections into a job at the White House .
The question of experience is now front and centre in the Democratic presidential race with Obama pounding away at the idea that Clinton has any right to claim her eight years as first lady on her resume .
In the last few days , Obama has questioned Clinton 's credibility to speak on economic issues and on international affairs .
It 's a great diversion of course from the question that Obama himself is trying to dodge : whether he has logged enough time in Washington - three years as a senator - to qualify for his own run .
Are n't we supposed to be past this ?
That old line : "" Behind every great man there is a great woman "" has been around for so long nobody remembers its exact origins , or the exact quote , any more .
Families like the Obamas , with two working parents , surely recognise the importance of a supportive spouse .
Feminists have argued for decades now that it is long past time to recognise and value the contributions made behind the scenes by the wives , partners , secretaries and assistants of high - profile men .
It 's not Hillary Clinton 's fault that American society is so backward that the only way a woman could ever have a fighting chance of getting on a presidential ticket is by having been married to a former president .
( Representation of women in US Congress : 16 % .
Representation of women in the Rwandan parliament : 49 % ) .
And , as everyone knows , Hillary Clinton never was just the supporting spouse , never quite got the hang of that adoring Nancy Reagan gaze or that Laura Bush glazed - over expression .
She was always a player .
That 's why the right hated her
so when the Clintons as a couple first emerged on the national political scene in 1992 , and Bill Clinton famously touted his candidacy as a twofer : vote for Bill and get Hillary for free .
It 's why novelty shops sell Hillary Clinton nutcracker dolls and why when she was called a bitch at a John McCain rally , a commentator laughed it off as a bit of light - hearted fun on the campaign trail . ""
What voter in general has n't thought that ? "" said Mike Allen of Politico .
In 1992 , Hillary Clinton had no intention of serving as a traditional First Lady .
By that point , she had worked for the biggest corporate law firm in Arkansas and served on the board of Wal - Mart .
She had chaired a state education reform commission .
And those were her very public roles - in addition to the support and strategic advice she gave Bill in the course of eight election campaigns in Arkansas and six terms as governor .
As she callously told NBC television in the spring of 1992 : "" I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas . ""
Clinton spent the next few months in campaign purdah , redeeming herself only by submitting to a cookie recipe contest with Barbara Bush .
But as the right well remembers Hillary was not really reformed .
As soon as the Clintons moved into the White House , Hillary demanded - and won - her share of power and recognition .
She reclaimed her maiden name , Rodham , set herself up with a First Lady office in the West Wing , and embarked on her disastrous project to remake America 's healthcare system .
When that went wrong , Hillary did take up ladylike projects - like that book on White House pets - but she also spoke up against female genital mutilation .
First Ladies do n't get issued written job descriptions .
Like the vague duties of a vice - president , who is required only to preside over the Senate in case of a tie vote and step in if the president dies or is temporarily incapacitated - the power of the First Lady rests on influence .
And nobody questions that Hillary had access or influence over Bill .
In fact , the right has always argued she had too much power .
Hillary knew full well
she was a First Lady only by virtue of being married to Bill .
In my book , Madam President : Is America Ready to Send Hillary Clinton to the White House , Melanne Verveer , Hillary Clinton 's chief of staff as First Lady , notes : "" The position of First Lady is a derivational position .
You only have it by virtue of your marriage .
You have not achieved it on your own . ""
But Hillary worked it . ""
Even among activist First Ladies , and I would put Lady Bird Johnson , Rosalind Carter and Betty Ford in this category , Mrs Clinton was absolutely the most involved , "" says Myra Gutin , a professor at Rider University who studies First Ladies .
So it 's hard to make a convincing case that Hillary Clinton was not deeply involved in her husband 's Administration .
She 's got the battle scars to prove it .

2008-01-18,"The woman who is introducing Michelle Obama is so excited and nervous she can barely get through the first few sentences .
Star power it seems is something Michelle Obama enjoys in her own right .
The gathering was supposed to be an intimate affair - 50 or 60 people , mostly women , gathered in the club house of a condominium complex to celebrate Michelle Obama 's 44th birthday yesterday .
There was a cake baked in the shape of a map of Nevada and small cupcakes dotted with candy confetti .
Annie Moore , a campaign volunteer , who shares a birthday with Obama , was given the honour of introducing her .
But that was as cosy and soft focus as it got .
Within minutes , Obama was making as compelling a case for her husband 's campaign as any he has delivered .
Dream , she urged .
Banish fear and cynicism .
Barack Obama can win , she said .
He can change the way America does politics . ""
If there is one lesson that we can gain from this race , do n't let anyone tell you what you ca n't , "" she said .
"" Our future is in our own hands . ""
The audience was hers .
Tall - she stands a touch under 6 ft - slim and naturally elegant , and a gifted speaker , Michelle Obama has been a commanding presence on the campaign trail .
She has been a crucial element in her husband 's campaign to win over women voters , dotting her speeches with references to her two young daughters and her struggles as a working woman .
And she is a powerful weapon in the battle for the votes of black women , many of whom are torn between voting along gender lines and race lines .
Her campaign activity will step up a gear this week as the Democratic race for the White House moves to South Carolina , the first state on the primary calendar with a significant African - American population .
From there , it 's onwards to Super Tuesday on February 5 , when four more southern states with significant black populations will hold their primaries - Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia and Tennessee .
For an older generation of voters , who are familiar and comfortable with the Clintons and doubtful - fearful even - about the prospects of sending a black man to the White House , Michelle Obama will be there with a ready answer :
It 's the right time .
Do not give in to your fears .
Political spouses are prescribed various roles on the campaign trail .
They function as enforcers - launching attacks that would be seen as too mean - spirited coming from a candidate .
They offer character references - living proof that the candidate is of upright and moral character and they can be powerful advocates of their partner 's agenda .
Michelle Obama does all that .
Like Bill Clinton , who has been burning up the campaign trail , dismissing Obama 's version of his stand against the Iraq war as a "" fairy tale "" , she is not afraid of going on the offensive - and she can be a formidable combatant in her own right .
In Las Vegas , Michelle Obama went straight for Hillary Clinton 's claims that her experience equipped her to be president - without deigning to use her name .
"" We have got two choices in this race .
We have the same old thing over and over again that has n't worked for regular folks in my lifetime .
And then we have Barack Obama .
"" Moments later , it was the turn of John Edwards - though once again Michelle Obama did not refer to him directly .
She dismissed his claim to be dedicated to the common man , noting to his career as a trial lawyer before he entered politics .
"" I am a lawyer , "" she said .
"" There are a lot of lawyers in this race and most of them made their millions before they decided to work for the people . ""
But while she is a strong defender , Michelle Obama 's greatest value to the campaign may lie in her ability to speak out directly on issues of race and her husband 's electability in white middle America .
At an awards dinner in Atlanta earlier this week , she made a point of holding up her husband 's victory in the Iowa caucuses as proof of his ability to appeal to voters across political and colour lines . ""
Ai n't no black people in Iowa , "" she said .
"" Something big , something new is happening .
Let 's build the future we all know is possible .
Let 's show our kids that America is ready for Barack Obama right now . ""
Michelle Obama 's ease at discussing race has as much to do with her own credentials as her husband 's claims to be able to transcend race .
Unlike her husband , the son of a Kenyan father whom he never really knew and a white mother from Kansas , Michelle Obama is rooted in family and the African - American experience .
She is the daughter of a working class family , raised in a tiny one - bedroom apartment on the south side of Chicago .
She is close to the family of the reverend Jesse Jackson .
As she is fond of reminding voters on the campaign trail , her trajectory from her humble beginnings in Chicago through Princeton and Harvard and the world of corporate law is , in its own way , as improbable as her husband 's .
"" I am not supposed to be here , she told the small crowd in Vegas . ""
According to every statistic . ""
But this daughter of a fire pump operator for the City of Chicago was an over - achiever even as a four - year - old , the age at which she learned to read .
She later won admission to one of the city 's first "" magnet schools "" for academically gifted children .
Michelle followed her older brother , Craig , to Princeton and then on to Harvard law school , where her professors ranked her among the best students they had ever seen .
She met the man who was to be her future husband 20 years ago at her first job at a corporate law firm in Chicago .
He was immediately smitten ; it took a month before she was persuaded to go out with him .
But within a few months , Obama had persuaded her to leave corporate America for public service and a job in the office of Chicago 's mayor .
The couple , who married in 1992 , have two daughters , Sasha and Malia , now nine and six .
When Barack Obama was elected to the Senate , Michelle and the children stayed behind in Chicago .
She said she wanted her girls to have a normal life - but she was also earning twice as much as her husband 's $ 162,500 salary as an executive at the University of Chicago hospitals and on corporate boards .
She gave up the job last May , to help her husband 's campaign .
She seemed a reluctant political wife at first , speaking openly about her resentment the campaign might take on her family life and the toll on their two younger daughters .
At her first big solo outing , in New Hampshire last June , she told the crowd she often felt overwhelmed by the competing demands of work , motherhood and now politics . ""
Sometimes I wonder , what is the cost of having it all ?
Sometimes we , as women , we 've convinced ourselves that doing it all is somehow a badge of honour , "" she says .
Michelle Obama 's candour about the campaign trail - and about her husband 's minor domestic failings - brought her trouble those first months on the campaign trail .
The New York Times columnist , Maureen Dowd , accused Obama of emasculating her husband in public because she joked about him forgetting to put the butter away .
But after those first few mis - steps , Obama found her stride and now on the campaign trail she is nearly as great a draw on the campaign trail as her husband .
At the Las Vegas birthday celebration , Moore 's excitement was undiminished .
"" That was awesome .
It was all I thought it would be , "" she said ."

With their husbands now favourites to fight November 's election , Cindy McCain , right , and Michelle Obama , left , were competing for the role of most patriotic spouse today .
The contest got going when Obama told a rally in Milwaukee that she had never really felt pride in America before her husband 's campaign . ""
Let me tell you something .
For the first time in my adult lifetime , I am really proud of my country .

2008-04-28,"For how long are we going to have to tolerate ( boring ) articles about Carla Bruni and her "" oh so chic "" ( boring ) wardrobe ?
Nikki Grant , by email
At least until their marriage ends or some other vaguely photogenic female appears vaguely connected to the international political or royal scene , whichever comes first .
Fingers collectively crossed for Michelle Obama , yeah ?
Hell , I would n't even mind that Russian gymnast - it 's hard not to love a woman who can give good leotard , you know .
The point is , God forbid we should ever live in a time where there is not a woman in the public eye whose every move can immediately be followed by newspaper articles , probably written at least a week before , that are little more than the following words strung together : "" Diana "" , "" classic "" , "" nation 's sweetheart "" , "" chic "" , "" gives him sex appeal "" , "" timeless "" , "" icon "" , "" style "" and , most crucially , "" Jackie Kennedy "" .
Note , though , the important interjection that the woman must only be "" vaguely connected "" , ie , not actually the political figure themselves .
First , because to reduce a female political figure to her clothes can occasionally look a little reductive ( though obviously to do it to a political wife is completely fine
- I mean , she 's just a wife , right ?
Tchuh ! )
But also because we do n't like our venerated female icons to have any power beyond what they pick out to wear that morning , and by "" we "" I mean "" the Daily Mail "" .
Hence the brief flicker of interest in the far more glamorous female members of the French government , only for them to be swiftly brushed aside .
But the Carla Bruni saga is an interesting one - well , more interesting than the endless plain skirt suits she wears .
First , it was n't so long ago that we were all supposed to hate her .
Tall , thin , young , former model , had more than one ex - boyfriend , marries someone more powerful and wealthy than you did ?
Bitch .
But then up she rolls wearing the kind of matchy - matchy skirt suits favoured by our Queen .
Oh my God , with those Dior outfits costing however many thousands of pounds , how does she manage to look so "" chic "" ( and we 'll return to that word in a minute ) ?
Wow , she must be a really special , talented and innately important person .
And wearing flat shoes ?
She 'll be splitting the atom next .
But this issue of what is decreed to be chic is , as you point out , Nikki , debatable .
Somewhere along the line someone seems to have mistranslated the word "" chic "" as the French for "" boring but inexplicably expensive . ""
Hermès bags , Cartier watches , matchy - matchy designer suits , plain Alaïa dresses , Chan ... zzzzzz ...

oh sorry ,
I seem to have hypnotised myself into a state of gullibio labelobsessiviama , the Latin name for when one 's head becomes so stuffed with useless crap from fashion magazines that you find yourself nodding dumbly like the Churchill Insurance dog at any old nonsense they tell you ,
no matter how patently stupid .
I mean , £ 26,000 for those bags that look like something in the sale bin at M&amp;S ?
Am I the only one who feels like the little boy , pointing at the emperor 's bare backside ?
Still , at least it 's only Carla that has to look at Sarkozy 's .
And maybe that 's what we 're really lauding these women for : their noble personal sacrifice for their country .
Which frankly , makes a helluva lot more sense than if we were all genuinely just getting excited over those pillbox hats .
Your reference the other week to no white shoes after Labor Day in the US made me wonder : what is the definitive list of fashion rules ?
James Westlake , London
The only rule that seems to exist about fashion rules is that - no matter how forced , tenuous and frankly illogical they must become to achieve this aim - they must rhyme .
So to take the most well - known example , "" blue and green must never be seen "" .
Why must they never be seen ?
I know not ; the fashion rhyming scribes do not clarify .
Some might query whether such colour - based discrimination is not , in fact , a tad racist .
But then , other colours come in for a similar level of scrutiny .
For example , there 's "" never brown in town "" which I used to think was an anti - drugs message but actually refers to the allegedly well - known rule counselling men against wearing brown shoes in the posh big city .
Anyway , you 're getting the hang of this now , are n't you ?
So let 's coin a few of our own .
How about , "" wearing too much red will give onlookers a pain in the head "" ?
Or "" stuff bought on the cheap will end up in a heap "" ?
Or "" never a flat shoe after two "" ?
Or "" When in the rain , high heels are a pain "" ?
No one ever said this would be easy ."
2008-04-29,"Any American liberals who could n't contain their anger at Barack Obama 's appearance on Fox News over the weekend should brace themselves , because Hillary Clinton is headed to The O'Reilly Factor tomorrow .

I 'm sure Clinton and O'Reilly can have a reasoned discussion about gas prices and not get into cultural issues .
Or maybe she can show him her cool balloon alter ego ."
2008-05-03,"One January afternoon at the University of South Carolina 's Children 's Center , in Columbia , Michelle Obama scrunched her 5 ft 11 in frame into a small white wooden rocking chair .
The state 's Democratic primary , which her husband , Barack , needed badly to win , was in 48 hours .
Obama picked up a picture book , flared her nostrils and began sniffing noisily , in the manner of a bear foraging in the woods for dinner . '
Boom !
Boom !
Boom ! '
she read to a group of pre - schoolers . '
The bear will tromp through the forest on his big hungry feet and ' - sniff , sniff , sniff - ' find that strawberry , no matter where it 's hidden . '
The kids burst into giggles .
Obama picked up another book , from the Olivia series . '
I have Olivia in my four - year - old class ! '
one boy yelled . '
Is she a friend of yours ? '
Obama asked . '
Yes . ' '
Is she a pig ? '
Soon , the story was over . '
Let 's see , ' Obama said . '
Maybe we have a special guest who will read to us . '
She got up from the rocking chair and walked over to a set of French doors . '
It 's Cocky ! '
the kids shouted as Obama threw open the doors to welcome an enormous red rooster , dressed in a basketball jersey .
She flung her arms around Cocky to give him a hug , a gesture somewhat thwarted by his plush pot belly . '
Cocky !
Let 's read one book together with Cocky . '
Obama selected another book and held it up to Cocky 's beak . '
Here you go , Cocky .
Can you read ? ' '
Cocky
, I love you ! '
a kid screamed .
Sharing the stage with a large , fuzzy piece of poultry might have daunted a more delicate sort of aspiring First Lady , but Obama took her eclipse by Cocky with the seen - it - all aplomb of one of the human characters on Sesame Street .
That day , she was wearing a pair of high - waisted pinstriped sailor pants , a grey cashmere sweater and a strand of pearls .
But , though she is stylishly appointed , she is not dainty .
She is often called ' regal ' but her bearing is less royal than military : brisk , often stone - faced ( even when making jokes ) , mordant .
Obama works out like ' a gladiator ' , a friend has said .
When people - they 're almost always shorter - ask her to pose for pictures , instead of bending her knees she leans at the waist .
Her smile is doled out sparingly , a privilege to be earned , rather than an icebreaker or an entreaty .
Obama , who graduated from Princeton , earned a law degree from Harvard and became , first , a corporate lawyer and , more recently , the vice - president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals .
She spent all but the first year of her childhood in a four - room bungalow on Chicago 's South Side .
Having traversed vast landscapes of race and class , often as a solo traveller , she evinces the discipline and , occasionally , the detachment of an army brat .
She can seem aloof from politics .
Her mother and her older brother both say that she has never once phoned them in tears .
Obama is cool in temperament .
More than anything , she seems to enjoy talking about her husband and her daughters ( Malia , nine , and Sasha , six ) .
She can give the impression , during the campaign 's endless round tables , that she 'd rather be talking to them .
Obama seems like an iconoclast precisely because she 's normal ( the norm for a candidate 's wife having been defined , in the past , as non - working , white and pious about the democratic process ) .
Her tastes , references and vocabulary - ' freaky ' , ' 24/7 ' , ' American Idol ' - if not exactly edgy , are recognisable , which , for a political spouse , makes them seem radical .
She calls the Iowa State Fair 's corn dogs and candied apples , obligingly gushed over by hopeful First Ladies every four years , ' stuff on a stick ' .
Here 's Obama , talking to me in her motorcade halfway between Sheboygan , Wisconsin , and Green Bay about Obama Girl , the young woman who professed her crush on Obama 's husband all over the internet : ' That was a little weird , because ... I just assumed there 's no way anybody 's gon na hear about that .
And one day Sasha comes home and says , "" Daddy has a girlfriend .
It 's you , Mommy . ""
And it 's , like , ""
Oh , shhhhhhhhh -
yeah . "" '
Swear word averted , barely .
Her lack of pretence has made her popular with those among the electorate , and the media , for whom prim Laura Bush seems out of touch .
Cindy Moelis , who has known Obama since they worked together in Chicago 's city hall in the Nineties , told me , ' I 've actually had girlfriends call me and go , "" You 're so lucky .
If I 'd only met her 15 years ago , I bet we would be best friends . "" ' '
Can Michelle Obama Be First Lady
No Matter
What ?
' pleaded the headline for a post on Wonkette , the political blog , about a gathering of candidates ' wives . '
Please do n't get all Botoxed and start acting like some sort of Stepford wife .
Please ? ' the post went on .
It 's not that Obama does n't know the anodyne , wifely things to say ( essentially , nothing ) .
She is , after all , a ' community and external affairs ' professional .
But her pride visibly chafes at being asked to subsume her personality , to make herself seem duller and less independent than she is , even in the service of getting her husband elected President of the United States .
In Wisconsin , I asked her if she was offended by Bill Clinton 's use of the phrase ' fairytale ' to describe her husband 's characterisation of his position on the Iraq war .
At first , Obama responded with a curt ' No ' .
But , after a few seconds , she affected a funny voice . '
I want to rip his eyes out ! '
she said , clawing at the air with her fingernails .
One of her advisers gave her a nervous look . '
Kidding ! '
Obama said . '
See , this is what gets me into trouble . '
Pundits have portrayed Obama as a taskmaster , demeaning her husband by acknowledging his morning breath and his body odour .
But the domestic carping serves Obama 's husband well , and this may account for her frequent recitation of the mundane details of their housekeeping arrangements .
By noting , for example , that Barack is ' the Harry Potter parent ' , and that she encourages him to find time to read to Malia and Sasha , Michelle makes Barack seem like a great dad and a guardian of young womanhood .
The contrast between their family life and that of the Clintons is implicit . '
Occasionally , it gives campaign people heartburn , ' David Axelrod , the Obama campaign 's chief strategist , admits . '
She 's fundamentally honest - goes out there , speaks her mind , jokes .
She does n't parse her words or select them with an antenna for political correctness . ' '
Michelle 's always been very vocal about anything , ' her mother , Marian Robinson , told me . '
If it 's not right , she 's going to say so .
When she was at Princeton , her brother [ Craig , now a university basketball coach , who was two years ahead of Michelle ] called me and said , "" Mom , Michelle 's here telling people they 're not teaching French right . ""
She thought the style was not conversational enough .
I told him , "" Just pretend you do n't know her . "" ' There is more to the Obamas ' relationship , however , than the caricature of Michelle as a ballbreaker to Barack 's ' Obambi ' ( the New York Times ' columnist Maureen Dowd 's term ) .
Consider the moment leading up to Barack 's career - making speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 .
The story the Obamas like to tell is that Michelle pulled Barack aside just before he took to the stage , warning him , ' Just do n't screw it up , buddy ! '
Someone who was involved in the preparation of the speech recalls a more nuanced dynamic , as Michelle calmed an irritable Barack . '
We were spending intense sessions tinkering with wording and commas , ' the person says .
' It was pretty tense , because everybody was picking at Barack and making suggestions .
He was getting a little irate .
Michelle was in the room , and she was kind of handling both him as well as some of the speech .
Without being overly directive , she was somebody that he could glance over to , almost a telepathic kind of relationship .
He was clearly looking to her for a reaction . '
Earlier on the day that Obama visited the nursery , she addressed a congregation in South Carolina , at the Pee Dee Union Baptist Church in Cheraw , a hamlet of about 6,000 known as ' The Prettiest Town in Dixie ' .
The church 's makeshift gravel car park was full .
After an invocation by the Reverend Jerry Corbett and an introduction by the mayor of Cheraw , Obama came to the pulpit . '
You all got up bright and early just for me ? '
she asked the mostly elderly , almost all - black crowd . '
Yes ! '
they roared .
Obama opened with some reminiscing . '
My people are from South Carolina , ' she said .
' I do n't know if y' all knew that ...
In fact , my grandparents retired back down here , and before their death they were living here , attending a Baptist church in Georgetown . '
Obama was playing to her audience - later she riffed on ' those relatives who have plastic on the furniture ' and reminded the churchgoers to get ' 10 other triflin ' people in your life ' out of bed and down to the polls on Saturday .
Her appearances at the church , and many like it , were a key point of strategy in a state that would be the first real test of whether or not Barack could attract significant numbers of black voters . '
In South Carolina in particular , because she had family from there , it made a lot of sense for her to speak in the African - American community , ' David Axelrod said .
After warming up the crowd , Obama launched into her stump speech , a 45-minute monologue that she composed herself and delivers without notes .
Obama has been open about the value of her ability to speak to black audiences in cadences that reflect their experience , but she makes clear her distaste for the notion that she is a niche tool , wielded by her husband 's campaign to woo black voters solely on the basis of their shared racial identity . '
I mean , I 've been to every early state , '
she told me , when I asked her about reports that she was ' deployed ' in the South to reach black audiences . '
I was "" deployed "" to Iowa , ' she said , making air quotes with her fingers . '
I was "" deployed "" to New Hampshire . '
The four times I heard her give the speech - in a ballroom at the University of South Carolina , from the pulpit of Pee Dee Union , at an art gallery in Charleston , and in the auditorium of St Norbert College , in De Pere , Wisconsin - its content was admirably consistent , with few of the politician 's customary tweaks and nods to the demographic predilections , or prejudices , of a particular audience .
After the speech , Obama did n't linger long with her well - wishers .
She can seem squeamish about politicking , put off by the awkward stagecraft of glad - handing and the small - group discussions - Michelle , five or six women , and , as she put it one day in Wisconsin , ' five thousand cameras ' - that her staff bills as ' intimate conversations ' .
But she thrives in large venues .
Cindy Moelis said : ' The first time she got feedback on being such a wonderful speaker , I think when people said , "" Wow , you 're really good at that , "" she goes , "" Why 's everybody surprised ? "" ' If Michelle Obama 's husband succeeds in garnering the Democratic nomination and then in winning the general election in November , she will be not only the first black First Lady of the United States but also one of the youngest since Jackie Kennedy .
Yet , for a potential revolutionary , Michelle Obama is deeply conventional .
She exudes a nostalgia , invoking the innocence and order of the past , as much as her husband beckons to a liberating future .
Listening to her speeches , with their longing for a lost , spit - shine world , one could sometimes mistake her , were it not for the emphasis on social justice , for a law - and - order Republican . '
It 's not just about politics ; it 's TV , ' she says , of our collective decay .
And , wistfully : ' The life I had growing up seems so much more simple . '
She is a successful working mother , but an ambivalent one : ' My mother stayed at home .
She did n't have to work . '
Her music of choice is Stevie Wonder , and has been since her childhood .
( At the Obamas ' wedding , a friend sang ' You and I ' . )
One of her favourite foods is macaroni cheese .
In The Audacity of Hope , acknowledging the appeal of the Reagan administration , Barack writes : ' It was related to the pleasure that I still get from watching a well - played baseball game , or my wife gets from watching reruns of The Dick Van Dyke Show . '
Obama draws a straight line from the way her parents , Fraser and Marian Robinson , raised her to the world as it ought to be .
For all her modern womanhood , she has not been tempted by rebellion . '
My lens of life , how I see the world , is through my background , my upbringing , ' she said , in South Carolina .
Fraser Robinson and Marian Shields , who both grew up on the South Side of Chicago , married in 1960 .
Craig was born two years later , and on 17 January 1964 Marian gave birth to Michelle LaVaughn , whom Fraser nicknamed Miche .
She and Craig looked so much alike ( and still do ) that people often mistook them for twins .
Fraser , who was partially handicapped by multiple sclerosis , worked shifts as a pump operator , while Marian tended to the children .
The family lived in a modest house that they rented from a relative .
Money was scarce but sufficient , and Saturday nights were spent at home playing Chinese checkers , Monopoly , or a game called Hands Down ( like spoons , with bluffing ) .
It was a simple time . '
I probably had two sleepovers my entire life , ' Craig said .
' We were home folks . '
For many years , the family drove to Dukes Happy Holiday Resort , in Michigan , for a week 's vacation .
The Robinsons went to church occasionally , but if they subscribed to any credo it was that of free thinking .
From a young age , Craig and Michelle were encouraged to make choices , and to contend with the consequences . '
More important , even , than learning to read and write was to teach them to think , ' Marian Robinson said . '
Craig became a basketball star at a parochial school , while Michelle went to Whitney M Young Magnet High School .
Michelle 's Class of 81 yearbook -
she was treasurer of her class - includes a picture of her as a serious - looking young lady in a bright yellow silk shirt .
She did not play varsity sports , even though people were always telling her she should .
Craig told me : ' That 's the best way to get her not to do something .
She did n't want to play just because she was tall and black and athletic . '
Craig was recruited to play basketball at Princeton , and Michelle - who figured she could cut it if he could - followed him there .
Princeton in 1981 was not particularly hospitable to minorities of any sort . '
It was a very sexist , segregated place , ' Angela Acree , who was Obama 's room - mate there for three years , recalled . '
We could n't afford any furniture , so we just had pillows on the floor , and a stereo . '
Their social lives revolved around gatherings at the Third World Center , rather than the university 's eating clubs . '
The white people did n't dance -
I know that sounds like a cliché - and they also played a completely different kind of music , whereas we were playing R&amp;B , Luther Vandross and Run - DMC , ' said Acree .
Obama went straight from Princeton to Harvard Law School .
After graduating , she became a junior associate , specialising in intellectual property law at the Chicago firm of Sidley Austin .
She worked there for three years , eventually becoming , as she says in her stump speech , disenchanted with ' corporate America ' .
She was hired as an assistant to the mayor , Richard Daley , and in 1993 she was appointed the founding director of the Chicago office of a public service programme called Public Allies , which places young adults from diverse backgrounds in paid internships with non - profit organisations .
An early appearance in the Chicago Tribune was in an article about Generation X - ers .
Obama told the reporter : ' I wear jeans , and I 'm the director . '
Michelle and Barack met at Sidley Austin , when she was assigned to advise him during a summer job .
Michelle 's colleagues warned her that the summer associate was cute . '
I figured that they were just impressed with any black man with a suit and a job , ' she later told Barack .
Despite her protestations - she felt that dating someone she worked with would be ' tacky ' - Barack began to court his boss . '
She took me to one or two parties , ' Barack writes , ' tactfully overlooking my limited wardrobe , and she even tried to set me up with a couple of her friends . '
Before the end of the summer , he 'd got her to agree to go out for a movie - Spike Lee 's Do the Right Thing - and an ice cream at Baskin - Robbins .
On holiday on Martha 's Vineyard in 2004 , Barack met Spike Lee at a reception .
As Michelle has recalled , he told the director , ' I owe you a lot , ' because , during the film , Michelle had allowed him to touch her knee .
Barack had a more bohemian attitude toward romance . '
We would have this running debate throughout our relationship about whether marriage was necessary , ' Obama told me . '
I was , like , "" Look , buddy
, I 'm not one of these women who 'll just hang out forever .
"" You know , that 's just not who I am .
He was , like , ' ( she broke into a wishy - washy voice ) '
"" Marriage , it does n't mean anything , it 's really how you feel . ""
And I was , like , "" Yeah , right . "" '
Eventually , he proposed to her over dinner at Gordon , a restaurant in Chicago . '
He took me out to a nice dinner under the guise of celebrating the fact that he had finished the bar , ' Obama recalled . '
And he got me into one of these discussions again , where he sort of led me down there and got fired up
and it 's like you 've got
blah
blah blah blah , and then dessert comes out
, the tray comes out , and there 's a ring ! '
The couple married in 1992 , and moved into a condominium in Hyde Park , Chicago .
Cindy Moelis recalled a dinner party the Obamas gave when they were newlyweds : shrimp and pasta , inexpensive art on the walls from their travels to Hawaii and Kenya .
Barack was not the life of the party . '
Because Barack was so smart , he was pretty serious when we were in our thirties .
I 'd poke him and say , "" Come on , let 's talk about the last movie you saw , "" ' Moelis said . '
At some point in our forties , I said to Michelle , "" You know , I think he 's so much grown into who he is now .
He 's so much more lighthearted . ""
Because he became a senator he had this wonderful outlet to be a policy person and to be intense , and when he got home he could relax and laugh and just have dinner with friends and talk about movies and basketball . '
Parenthood , far more than politics , has been the catalytic force in Michelle 's adult life .
She is passionate about being a mother , and about confronting the problems that working women face in making time for both their families and their professions .
When I asked if there was an issue she has worked particularly hard to bring to her husband 's attention , she replied : ' The attention that he 's focused on work - family balance ...
That is our life .
To the extent that we have challenges , and struggles , headaches that everybody else is going through ... those are our conversations . '
( Barack has candidly chronicled their struggle ' to balance work and family in a way that 's equitable to Michelle and good for our children ' , and its toll on their marriage . )
Last summer , Obama 's mother retired from her job as a bank secretary in order to look after Malia and Sasha when Barack and Michelle are on the road .
( The Obamas have a full - time housekeeper , and Michelle tries to see a personal trainer four times a week , but they do not have a nanny . )
Obama talks often of her reliance on a network of female relatives , friends and colleagues .
Her staff comprises a collection of mostly young women , practical yet fashionable , like their leader , efficient but not effusive .
When Barack was elected to the Senate , the Obamas decided that Michelle and the girls would remain in Chicago .
A local mother told the Tribune of their chore - swapping : ' This weekend was Hannah Montana , next weekend Michelle has soccer skills practice . '
One morning , during a round table at Ma Fischer 's , a diner in Milwaukee , Elizabeth Crawford , a recently divorced caterer with two children , brought up the subject of the eating habits of American families . '
I really , really hope that Barack will jump on that , ' she said .
Then , Obama suddenly departed from her script .
It was the most animated I saw her on the campaign trail . '
You know , ' she said , ' in my household , over the last year we have just shifted to organic for this very reason .
I mean , I saw just a moment in my nine - year - old 's life - we have a good paediatrician , who is very focused on childhood obesity , and there was a period where he was , like , "" Mmm , she 's tipping the scale . ""
So we started looking through our cabinets ...
You know , you 've got fast food on Saturday , a couple of days a week you do n't get home ...
And you start reading the labels and you realise there 's high - fructose corn syrup in everything we 're eating .
Every jelly [ jam ] , every juice .
Everything that 's in a bottle or a package is like poison in a way that most people do n't even know ...
Now we 're keeping , like , a bowl of fresh fruit in the house .
But you have to go to the fruit
stand a couple of times a week to keep that fruit fresh enough that a six - year - old ...
She 's not gon na eat the brown banana or the shrivelledy - up things .
It 's got to be fresh for them to want it .
Who 's got time to go to the fruit stand ?
Who can afford it , first of all ? '
The Obamas ' financial standing has risen sharply in the past three years , largely as a result of the money Barack earned from writing The Audacity of Hope .
In 2005 , their income was $ 1.67 m , which was more than they had earned in the previous seven years combined . '
Our lives are so close to normal , if there is such a thing when you 're running for president , ' Michelle has said . '
When I 'm off the road , I 'm going to Target to get the toilet paper
, I 'm standing on soccer fields , and I think there 's just a level of connection that gets lost the further you get into being a candidate . '
Just after Barack was elected to the Senate , Michelle received a large pay increase - from $ 121,910 in 2004 to $ 316,962 in 2005 . '
Mrs Obama is extremely overpaid , ' one citizen wrote in a letter to the editor of the Tribune , after the paper published a story questioning the timing of the award . '
Now , what is the real reason behind such an inflated salary ? '
Her bosses at the University of Chicago Hospitals vigorously defended the rise , pointing out that it put her salary on a par with that of other vice - presidents at the hospital .
( As it happens , Obama has spent most of her life working within the two institutions for which she most frequently claims a populist disdain : the government and the healthcare system . )
Michelle 's roots in the community predate her involvement with Barack ; in fact , he has written that it was one of the things that attracted him to her , awakening , after years of peripatetic soul - searching , ' a longing for stability and a sense of place that I had not realised was there ' .
Barbara Pace - Moody , the development director of Muntu , an African - dance company on whose board Obama serves , recalls meeting her , in the early Nineties , when they were both volunteers for a mentoring programme : ' We spent every Saturday with young women from the Chicago Housing Authority .
We had a big gala , and she and her sister - in - law took their own money and paid for the girls to get their hair done and set them up in a hotel downtown .
I remember thinking , "" Who is this Michelle Robinson ? "" ' More troubling to the Obamas ' image of civic rectitude is their entanglement with a campaign contributor named Antoin
( Tony ) Rezko in a 2005 real - estate deal .
( Rezko is now awaiting trial on corruption charges . )
The other Chicago connection that dogs the Obamas is Dr Jeremiah A Wright Jr , their pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ .
Wright , who drives a Porsche and references the comedian Bernie Mac in his unorthodox sermons ( ' Take what God gave you and say , "" In your face , mediocrity , I 'm a bad mamma jamma ! "" ' ) , officiated at Michelle and Barack 's wedding and baptised their two daughters .
Barack took the title ' The Audacity of Hope ' from a sermon that Wright preached .
In 2006 , the Obamas gave $ 22,500 to the church .
Wright espouses a theology that seeks to reconcile African - American Christianity with , as he has written , ' the raw data of our racist existence in this strange land ' .
In portraying America as ' a Eurocentric wasteland of lily - white lies and outright distortions ' , Wright promulgates a theory of congenital separatism that is deeply at odds with Obama 's professed belief in the possibilities of unity and change .
Barack 's advisers have tried to dismiss the criticisms of his association with Wright as a witchhunt by conservative blogs and talk - show hosts .
The candidate had invited Wright to give the convocation when he announced his presidential bid , but later withdrew the offer .
In February , I attended an Ash Wednesday service at the church .
When it was over , I asked Wright to talk to me about Michelle Obama . '
She 's from the ' hood , ' he said .
Within seconds , a minder rushed over to say that I was forbidden to conduct any interviews on the premises . '
We do n't want our church to receive the brunt of this notoriety , ' Obama told me .
I asked her whether Wright 's statements presented a problem for her or for Barack . '
You know , your pastor is like your grandfather , right ? '
she said .
' There are plenty of things he says that I do n't agree with , that Barack does n't agree with . '
When it comes to absolute doctrinal adherence , she said , ' I do n't know that there would be a church in this country that I would be involved in .
So , you know , you make choices , and you sort of ... you ca n't disown yourself from your family because they 've got things wrong .
You try to be a part of expanding the conversation . '
( She made a similar argument when I asked if she agreed with her husband in opposing gay marriage . '
It 's like you got ta do the baby steps ...
You do n't start with the toughest issues when you 're trying to unite a group . ' )
Obama does not avoid blunt discussions about race .
One year , she and Cindy Moelis , who is white , went to a spa in Utah to celebrate their birthdays . '
We were in the cafeteria , getting healthy food for breakfast , ' Moelis recalled . '
Everybody was , like , "" Hey , Michelle ! "" '
Moelis wondered aloud why nobody remembered her name . '
See any more six - foot - tall African - American women ? '
Obama replied . '
I did n't think so .
So stop taking it personally . '
Michelle 's perceived authenticity has been an asset to Barack .
Ron Carter , a former associate of the Black Panther Party who is the publisher of the South Street Journal , told me of a combustible situation that arose during Barack 's senatorial campaign , following a speech he gave at Liberty Baptist Church , in Chicago . '
There were lots of radicals calling into question his loyalty to the community , ' Carter recalled . '
She came out the back door , and there were a bunch of hoodlums ready to do a full - blast demonstration .
She put on her street sense and asked all the guys , "" Y'all got a problem or something ? ""
They all froze , guys who would slap the mayor , who would slap Jesse Jackson in the face , even . '
Barack has written eloquently about the pressure of assimilation for minority groups .
When I asked Michelle if she had felt that sort of pressure , she replied : ' What minority communities go through still represents the challenges , the legacies , of oppression and racism .
You know , when you have cultures who feel like second - class citizens at some level ... there 's this natural feeling within the community that we 're not good enough ... and it 's that internal struggle that is always the battle . '
She talked about her first trip to Africa - Barack took her to Kenya to meet his father 's family - and the realisation that , as much as white society fails to account for the African - American experience , so does any conception of pan - blackness . '
There 's the view among many black Americans that Africa is home , ' she said . '
But when you 're a black American you 're very much an American first . '
Marian Robinson told me that she did not know that Barack 's mother was white until long after she met him . '
He never talked about himself , ' she said .
Things had been going remarkably smoothly for Michelle Obama until mid - February .
Campaigning four days a week , she was drawing crowds in the thousands .
According to David Axelrod , she had urged the campaign to be aggressive in reaching out to female voters , and her husband had made significant inroads with a demographic that had been a Clinton stronghold . '
She 's pivoted her language to "" See how far we 've come "" as opposed to "" Do n't we have a long way to go ? ""
, ' one of Obama 's advisers told me , in Sheboygan . '
It 's weird , ' Craig Robinson said .
' It 's like if your sister 's a budding actress , and all of a sudden she 's Julia Roberts . '
Speaking at a rally in Wisconsin on 18 February , Obama remarked : ' For the first time in my adult lifetime , I am really proud of my country , and not just because Barack has done well , but because I think people are hungry for change . '
The sentiment - that America was in a mess , and Mrs Obama was not happy about it - was not a new one , but it instantly drew charges that she was unpatriotic .
Cindy McCain seized the opportunity to draw a sniffy contrast between the Obamas and her war - hero husband , telling a cheering crowd : ' I do n't know about you - if you heard those words earlier - I 'm very proud of my country . '
It was a manufactured controversy , but it reflected a real cavalierness on Obama 's part - not towards 9/11 and America 's armed forces , as her various critics had it , but toward the reality that it might be wise for a person whose spouse is running for president not to say something that could be construed that way .
The controversy over her brand of household humour may have been a matter of cultural misinterpretation .
But Obama 's blitheness about politics may have less to do with race than it does with class - conservative commentators pegged her as a paragon of elitist leftism - or , more likely , for a daughter of blue - collar Chicago , with personal disposition .
In our conversation , she came across as almost apolitical .
I asked her about the first time she voted . '
Oh , God , um , I 've voted every time that I could vote , but I do n't - it does n't stand out , '
she said . '
You know , that was just something you did .
You did n't not vote ...
But I , you know , it was n't like this moving experience for me , ' - she breathed in dramatically - ' "" I cast my first vote ! ""
' The self - assurance that colours Obama 's assumption that her personal feelings are some bellwether of American achievement is also palpable in her forceful declarations that her husband is the only person who can solve the country 's problems . '
I tell people I am married to the answer , ' she said , in a speech in Harlem . '
The man ... who I am willing to sacrifice , ' she called her husband , in Iowa .
There is a hectoring , buy - one - while - supplies - last quality to Obama 's frequent admonitions that Americans will have only one chance to elect her husband president .
Someone who has spent a good portion of her life gaining purchase has suddenly been asked to sell something , and she seems to find it slightly beneath her .
One to one , Obama is gracious .
A week before the Wisconsin primary , she made an appearance at the Hops Haven Brew Haus , in Sheboygan .
When it was over , I joined her in the back seat of a Ford Explorer for part of the ride to Green Bay .
Space was tight , and I could n't find anywhere to put my sludgy boots except practically on top of her black leather pocket - book .
( If a woman 's handbag is a window on to her soul , Obama really is normal : hers had an empty M&amp;Ms wrapper and an iPod sticking out of an unzipped compartment . ) '
You know what , let me move it because I can put it out of your way , ' she said .
Someone was trying to put something in the boot , which was locked . '
Oh , they 're trying to get in the back , ' she said , and moved to help , like a mother packing her charges into the station wagon .
The acrimony between the Obamas and the Clintons had been intensifying in the days leading up to the Wisconsin primary .
I asked Obama if she was worried about negative attacks on her husband .
She was diplomatic . '
We 've pretty much heard it all , ' she said . '
She 's very competitive , and she believes deeply in him and in what we 're doing , ' David Axelrod said later . '
I do n't think she 's a pacifist - if she thinks we 're being treated unfairly or does n't think we 're being aggressive enough in debunking attacks , she will say so .
She does not fold up into the lotus position and start chanting "" Kumbaya "" .
She 's against gratuitous attacks but she 's not against defending our position and making sure we do n't get punked . '
The competition between the two couples , and specifically between Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton , became explicit later when one of Michelle 's advisers pulled me aside and pointed out that Michelle had recently been given Secret Service protection . '
So that 's both spouses on both sides , ' the aide pointed out .
Back in the Explorer , I asked Obama if she thought that her husband , as the Democratic nominee , could take John McCain . '
Oh , yeah .
We got him , ' she replied .
When the conversation turned to the broader significance of Obama 's candidacy , I wondered if the burden of history weighed upon her . '
No , I just do n't think in those terms , ' Obama said .
' I 'm very much one foot in front of the other .
You know , we 're not there .
We 've got to win a bunch of states and delegates and , you know , this is a messy process .
And then there 's still a general election .
So I am so far away from history right now that it 's like , "" Why get caught up in that emotionally when there 's so much stuff in front of us that we have to do ? ""
Plus , I 've got kids , and , you know , what are we doing for spring break , and their birthdays are coming up .
I 've got plenty of stuff to worry about before my legacy in history and all that . '
In The Audacity of Hope , Barack Obama perceives a vulnerability in his wife , one so closely guarded that even her brother professed to me never to have noticed it .
There was ' a glimmer that danced across her round , dark eyes whenever I looked at her , ' he writes , ' the slightest hint of uncertainty , as if , deep inside , she knew how fragile things really were , and that if she ever let go , even for a moment , all her plans might quickly unravel . '
The Explorer rolled on to Green Bay ."
2008-05-20,"Voters head to the polls today in primary elections in Kentucky and Oregon , as Hillary Clinton continues her fight despite a growing sense in the Democratic party that Barack Obama will win the Democratic nomination .
Obama 's decision to hold a campaign rally in a critical swing state , the site of his first victory of the primary season , indicates he 'll embrace tonight 's results as a tipping point in the race .
The Illinois senator and his wife , Michelle Obama , will address a crowd in downtown Des Moines , Iowa , the state where in January Obama broke out with a crucial first win over rivals Clinton and John Edwards .
Obama 's aides expect that after the votes are counted in Kentucky and Oregon tonight , he will have attained a majority of pledged delegates , those awarded in primary elections and caucuses .
The campaign says that 's a signal the Democratic party has coalesced behind his candidacy .
He is expected to stop short of declaring victory in the nomination fight , however .
The candidates are expected to split the contests , with Clinton , a senator from New York , far ahead in polls in Kentucky .
Obama 's campaign anticipates a narrow victory in Oregon , where on Sunday 75,000 people attended a rally for him .
Obama is far ahead in the delegate tally and by most accounts the popular vote , and has enjoyed a steady stream of superdelegate endorsements in recent weeks .
Democratic party powerbrokers including John Edwards , George McGovern and Robert Byrd have aligned with him since the May 6 vote in Indiana and North Carolina .
But Clinton has vowed to soldier on , reminding voters that Obama has yet to clinch the nomination .
He has 1,915 delegates to her 1,721 , with 2,026 needed to win , according to the latest Associated Press tally .
She has implored voters to ignore Washington media figures she claims are counting her out , although her rhetoric has largely shifted away from attacks on Obama .
She will hold a rally tonight in Louisville , Kentucky .
"" I admit , this has been a long job interview , but this is the toughest job in the world , "" she told a crowd in Lexington , Kentucky , last night "" You know that .
And you know that the next president will not only face all the problems we could recite tonight , but there will be problems we ca n't even imagine that will end up on the desk of our president .
So as we think about this momentous election , you need to carefully consider the choice you are making .
I 'm asking for your support because I know I am ready to make these decisions . ""
Obama , meanwhile , has turned his attention to the general election and Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
He has cautiously avoided appearing to drive Clinton from the race , lest he alienate her large number of supporters .
"" I know this has been a long primary contest , so some Democrats have been worried that maybe the party is going to be divided , "" he said at a rally in Billings , Montana last night .
"" You know , you 've got Obama supporters over here , Clinton supporters over here .
Let me tell you something .
We are not going to be divided , because whatever differences exist between myself and Senator Clinton , we are unified in the idea that , whatever else happens in November , the name George W Bush is n't going to be on the ballot . ""
Puerto Rico votes June 1 and Montana and South Dakota vote June 3 ."
2008-05-22,"On June 1 people in Puerto Rico will go to the polls to vote for who should be the Democratic candidate for the US presidency .
Michelle Obama was making a high profile visit as putative first lady , and most of the advertising in San Juan that I could see was for Obama , while the governor Anibal Acevedo - Vila has endorsed him .
However , since Acevedo - Vila is under Federal indictment on campaign finance charges , the embattled governor may not be able to deliver the votes for his endorsee and it is highly likely that Puerto Rico will return a majority for Hilary Clinton - who will cite it as supporting evidence for her claim that she alone can pull out the popular vote .
There is just one small point .
While Puerto Ricans are US citizens , unless they move to the mainland , they can not vote in the actual general election in November - even though they can in the Democratic primaries .
The average white melanin - sensitive working class voter , whose support Hillary is so dangerously courting , could probably not distinguish between most Puerto Ricans and African Americans .
However , many Puerto Ricans can and do .
No matter what their appearance , few self - identify as black .
Puerto Rico is a standing reminder that Iraq is just the latest in a long line of US interventions and manufactured excuses .
The explosion on the battleship Maine , onto the Tonkin Gulf incident and then WMDs in Iraq , all display a continuity in enforcing liberation on other people whether they want it or not .
As a Spanish colony , Puerto Rico had more autonomy than as a "" liberated "" US territory .
In English , Puerto Rico is a commonwealth ; in Spanish , it is an "" Estado Libre Asociado , "" with shades of the Free State of Ireland .
On her husband 's behalf , Michelle Obama promised self - determination for the island without committing to any of the options , but the problem is that the islanders have generally been deadlocked on the options : statehood , status quo , independence or enhanced commonwealth status .
Puerto Ricans are proud of their heritage and their language , and deep in their hearts would probably like to be independent - but like their Caribbean neighbours in the French departments of Martinique and Guadeloupe , the material benefits of association with the metropolis outweigh the spiritual allure .
Puerto Ricans have the St Augustine dilemma , who in his debauched youth allegedly said : "" Give me chastity and continence , but not just yet "" .
Hence Puerto Rico 's indeterminate status .
Full statehood would end colonial status , and allow Puerto Ricans to vote for president and have a voice in the Federal laws that apply to the island , superseding local legislation .
It would also be a big boost for the Democrats in congressional and presidential races , which is why Republicans may not be so ecstatic about the prospect .
They would not make it easier by , for example , allowing more autonomy or an opt - out clause
The commonwealth status allows a hope of future independence , if ( for example ) they discovered oil under the island .
It also allows for more autonomy for local politicians and interest groups than statehood - but it is understandably seen as a continuation of colonial servitude by the vociferous minority .
In the meantime , Washington can be - like Cavafy 's barbarians - "" some kind of solution "" to local wrangling .
The indeterminacy has lasted over a century , which does not augur well for American nation - building exercises elsewhere .
But if the Puerto Ricans wanted to make sacrifices for humanity , they should really opt for statehood , and tilt the electoral balance in Washington , whatever mistake they may make on June 1 .

2008-06-05,"One week after her husband 's assassination , Jackie Kennedy gave an interview to Life in which she described his presidency as "" one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot ... there 'll be great Presidents again , but there 'll never be another Camelot "" .
Ever since , Camelot has , in American parlance , been a reference to the Kennedy era .
Robin Givhan , fashion editor of the Washington Post , last month described Michelle Obama 's look as "" Camelot with a tan "" .
Much has been made of Mrs Obama 's close mirroring of the most iconic of first ladies : the pearls , the shift dresses , the flipped - out bob , the preppy shots of colour , are all direct lifts from the early 60s Kennedy wardrobe .
But on Tuesday , as she took to the stage with her husband in Minnesota after the final night of primaries , Michelle Obama drew striking parallels with another American fashion icon .
She wore a simple purple shift dress , accessorised with a bold string of pearls and cinched with a wide black belt - an almost identical outfit to one worn by the character Carrie Bradshaw in a key scene in the film version of Sex and the City , currently on release .
It seems likely that with the Carrie - a - like outfit - unlike the Kennedy tributes - the similarity is accidental , an unconscious channelling of the style zeitgeist by Michelle Obama or an assistant .
But it is nonetheless significant for that .
At the heart of the Obama image is a potent combination of a deliberate , studied classicism updated with modernity and youth .
When Barack Obama addresses an audience , the elegant rhythms of his speech are brought up to date by his habit of dropping in quotes by his young daughters .
He began his Super Tuesday speech ( "" We are the ones we have been waiting for "" ) by telling the crowd that he had asked his daughters to come on stage but that the elder dismissed him with , "" Daddy , you know that 's not my thing .
"" It is the same story with their clothes : Michelle Obama might referencing Jackie Kennedy , but with the Sex and the City accents she looks far more modern than Cindy McCain , who resembles an outdated waxwork of a first lady .
Barack Obama 's own wardrobe has been striking in its simplicity .
His trademark is a slim - fitting black suit , and a sense of spit and polish ; a very starched white shirt , a very shiny dark shoe .
The dark tailoring gives him gravitas , and - in photos at least - adds presence to his slim figure .
( Those who have seen him in person often comment on how surprisingly thin he is . )
But this austere look is not short of admirers .
Lucy Yeomans , editor of Harper 's Bazaar magazine , describes him as "" lean and stylish - he definitely has something of the matinee idol about him "" .
Charlie Porter , associate editor of GQ , describes it as "" a potent combination to have a relatively young man who seems to be bursting with energy , and to be doing so in a suit .
Obama has managed quite a heady mix of turning himself into this inspirational figure to the young , while doing so in clothing that is totally sober . ""
The choice of black suits when all around him are dressed in Capitol Hill standard - issue dark blue sends a subtle signal .
It lends his image a quality more redolent of black - and - white photographs than of TV - strengthening that Kennedy - era association again - while also looking fashionable and idealistic rather than staidly businesslike .
It enables him to simultaneously hark back to American politics ' golden era , and to look forward to the future .
And although not skinny enough to satisfy the fashion purists - Jeremy Langmead , editor of Esquire , admits to wishing someone would cinch those trouser legs in a bit - Obama 's suits nod to the slim silhouette currently fashionable in menswear . ""
He is one of the few public figures to grasp the new mood in American tailoring prompted first by Thom Browne and now Tom Ford - the sort of slick and optimistic tailoring that is seen in BBC4 's Mad Men , "" says Porter .
Clothes are troublesome for male politicians , who have to tread a very fine line between looking like they care too much , and looking like they care too little . ""
Politicians have to pay attention to their clothes , "" says Langmead .
"" David Cameron has been taking advice from [ fashionable Savile Row tailor ] Richard James .
But they have to be subtle : remember the stick Michael Heseltine used to get about his attention to detail , his big hair .
That became his caricature ; that he was incredibly vain .
Obama manages to look fashionable without looking fashiony . ""
Guy Trebay , writing in the New York Times , reported that "" Mr Obama has managed to score hits with wardrobe choices - jackets nonchalantly slung over a shoulder , short sleeves in his heartland , neatly tailored suits on television - that somehow telegraph personal comfort without sacrificing authority . ""
But it is through Michelle 's wardrobe , rather than Barack 's , that the Obamas can send the strongest sartorial messages .
In the same way in which certain details of their relationship have been made very deliberately and politically public - that they saw Spike Lee 's Do the Right Thing on their first date , for instance - Michelle 's campaign wardrobe has been formulated , as Givhan put it in the Washington Post , "" specifically to help the viewer imagine her in the role of first lady "" .
As Yeomans puts it , "" Michelle makes constant references to Jackie O , but it 's done in a unfussy contemporary way , ensuring she effortlessly projects the image of a modern president 's wife .
"" The Kennedy homage is never a direct pastiche , for it has some key points of difference .
For instance , Michelle Obama 's pearls are always super - sized , and clearly fake .
In this way she can channel Kennedy - era chic , without detracting from the messages about her humble origins and feet - on - the - ground family life which play so well with voters .
And just as her husband 's suits nod to the catwalk , Michelle picks up on the colours of the moment : the royal purple of Tuesday 's dress has been a key shade in the wardrobe of another president 's wife , Carla Bruni , this season .
Banana Republic has a very chic purple shift dress in its autumn collection , and other labels are likely to follow .
The definition of a power couple is that they are more than the sum of their parts : that each shines even brighter when they are together .
The Obamas , Langmead notes , "" always dress to compliment each other , but not in a Beckham matchy - matchy way .
On Tuesday his lilac - blue tie looked great with her purple dress .
It helps to underline the chemistry that they clearly have together . ""
In this month 's Vanity Fair magazine , Michael Wolff argues that sex - sex as in sex , not gender - is now as significant a subtext in politics as race .
( This , he says , is Bill Clinton 's legacy . )
Wolff attributes part of Barack Obama 's appeal to being "" the credible and hopeful figure of a man who actually might be having sex with his smiling , energetic and oomphy wife ...
he represents our ideal of what a good liberal 's sex life ought to be "" .
If he is right , then this is one aspect of image that the great style icon Jackie Kennedy , to whom is attributed the quote , "" Sex is a bad thing because it rumples the clothes , "" failed to grasp ."
2008-06-08,"John Naughton , the perceptive new media commentator for The Observer , tackles the uncomfortable subject of what I now call ( à la Nick Davies ) "" digital churnalism "" .
In today 's column , How the net 's political dirt corrupts mainstream media , he illustrates how journalistic idleness - not to mention journalistic bias - can give legs to wild and false rumours that originate on the net .
Naughton makes his point by showing how reporters followed up some bunkum about a video alleged to show Michelle Obama making a racist statement .
He writes : Welcome to the media ecosystem , in which ' mainstream ' media have discovered that their new symbiotic relationship with the blogosphere sucks them into a downward spiral and an underworld of innuendo , lies and propaganda .
Then he explains how to avoid being caught out : As it happens , there is a way out of the morass , but it requires the application of old - fashioned journalistic skills and values .
Or , more prosaically , sceptical , investigative reporting .
The fact that something is circulating on the net is not , in itself , news - any more than is the fact that microbes circulate in drinking water .
And he concludes with this simple advice : If confronted with online rumours , investigate first , report later .
There 's no arguing with that ."
2008-06-11,"With her husband now assured of the Democratic presidential nomination , attention among nastier US rightwingers is turning to Michelle Obama .
You might think that her rise from a working class family in Chicago to graduation from Princeton and Harvard might be celebrated as a triumph for the American Way , but seemingly not .
Ed Hill , who anchors Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News , has already had to apologise for describing her exuberant gesture when Barack Obama secured the nomination as "" a terrorist fist jab "" .
One website - interestingly using an article from our own Daily Mail as its main source - derides her attributes of diligence and hard work that the Mail usually celebrates .
Quoting Mrs Obama 's reference to America 's "" horrible legacies of racism , discrimination and oppression ""

2008-06-12,"For the second time in a week , Fox News has put its collective foot in its mouth while covering Michelle Obama .
The latest embarrassing gaffe from the Rupert Murdoch - owned cable network came in an onscreen caption referencing the Democratic nominee 's vow to protect his wife from critics .
Outraged Liberals : Stop Picking on Obama 's Baby Mama ! was the message .
The misogynist and racist implications of the term "" baby mama "" -- frequently used in rap songs and most recently in a film about a white - trash surrogate mother -- apparently offended enough female employees inside the company that Fox executives issued a quasi - apology .
The choice of words was "" poor judgment "" , the network 's senior vice president says .
Coming just a few days after Fox pundit E.D. Hill bizarrely dubbed the Michelle - Barack dap a "" terrorist fist jab "" , this mini - scandal brings up a key question : Will Obama himself challenge these deliberate slights from Fox in the same way that he has worked to destroy the more insidious online rumor mill ?"
2008-06-18,"Say what you like about Michelle Obama - and people have been saying a lot about her recently , much of it unflattering - but the woman who could become the next first lady of the United States is not one to duck a controversy .
She showed that yesterday when she took to the set of The View , a TV chat show for women .
The most extreme comment lobbed at her to date was the jibe this month that the "" fist bump "" she gave her husband Barack on the night of his victory in the presidential primaries - placing her clenched fist against his - was a secret terrorist handshake .
So how did Michelle greet The View 's panel of five women waiting to quiz her ?
With a fist bump , naturally .
"" Should I be worried about doing that with you ? "" the comedian Whoopi Goldberg quipped . ""
Let me tell you , I 'm not that hip , "" replied Obama .
"" I got this from the young staff - it 's the new high five . ""
For the ensuing hour , the set of ABC 's popular daytime show resounded to the noise of stereotypes about Michelle Obama popping .
Elitist with a $ 300,000 ( £ 153,000 ) salary ?
She talked about her working - class father and her roots in poor south Chicago .
Black revolutionary ?
She revealed that one of her inspirations was the current first lady , Laura Bush .
Out of touch with ordinary Americans ?
She explained why she gave up wearing pantyhose years ago ( "" it feels better "" ) and how "" it 's fun to look pretty "" .
Not that it was n't all carefully choreographed .
As the New York Times made plain , her appearance on The View , together with a long interview she granted the newspaper , are part of an elaborate rebuttal exercise to counter her portrayal in the rightwing media as a hatred - filled black separatist by showing her softer side .
Over the past four months the attacks on her have intensified .
It began with her unguarded words in February , that "" for the first time in my adult life , I am really proud of my country ... "" .
The phrase has been replayed endlessly on Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News , omitting what she went on to say : "" ... because I think people are hungry for change . ""
Then Rush Limbaugh , the talk radio host , ran with rumours circulating on the internet that she had ranted against "" whitey "" at the pulpit of her former church in Chicago .
The Conservative magazine the National Review said she was "" America 's unhappiest millionaire "" and dubbed her "" Mrs Grievance "" .
Even the left - leaning Slate web magazine picked up the theme , with a piece by Christopher Hitchens asking whether Michelle was to blame for Obama 's troubles over his radical former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , in which Hitchens referred to a college dissertation she wrote in 1985 which alludes to black "" separationism "" .
Put all that together , and it spells trouble for the Obama campaign .
But the fight - back has begun .
In her New York Times interview she dismissed the "" whitey "" story as ridiculous . ""
Anyone who says that does n't know me .
They do n't know the life I 've lived . ""
On The View she told Barbara Walters , the veteran TV current affairs presenter , that she took the attacks in her stride , rationalising them in her mind as the need for the 24-hour news cycle to fill up space . ""
I wear my heart on my sleeve .
At some level when you put your heart out there , there 's a risk that you take . ""
As for her controversial remark about her pride in America , made at a rally in Wisconsin , she insisted she had merely being trying to say that people are engaged in the 2008 election "" in a way we have n't seen for a long time "" .
Echoing her husband 's mantra , she said her life story - born to working - class parents who worked hard and sacrificed to send her to Princeton - could only have been possible in America .
In the furore that followed the Wisconsin remarks she received support from Laura Bush who said her words had been misconstrued .
Obama returned the favour , saying : "" I 'm taking some cues "" from her .
"" There 's a reason why people like [ Laura Bush ] - because she does n't fuel the fire . ""
That summed up neatly the challenge now facing Obama and the new team around her that has been set up to counter a growing impression that she is fuelling the fire .
She has just taken on a new chief of staff , Stephanie Cutter , who as a former communications chief for Bill Clinton in the White House knows all about battling against negative imagery .
Before Obama went on The View , sporting a sleeveless black and white floral dress ( bought , she told us , in her favourite shop in Chicago ) , her husband gave her one simple piece of advice : "" Be good . ""
The couple never obsessed over politics at home , she said , because her two daughters , Malia and Sasha , insisted on talking soccer .
When her husband first raised the possibility of running for the White House her reaction was : "" No !
No !
Please do n't do that .
"" She had n't even wanted him to enter politics in the first place "" because I knew it was a mean business "" .
The woman who emerged was all smiles and softness .
But will it be enough to silence her detractors ?
The view from the US Such was her level of savvy and confidence , you would have been forgiven for thinking that Michelle Obama is one of the regular presenters of The View , a daily chat show with a similar format to the UK 's Loose Women .
She appeared relaxed , answering questions about race , diversity , motherhood and sexism .
Unfazed by questions about race relations and issues within the African - American community posed by Whoopi Goldberg , she echoed her husband 's belief that accountability and personal responsibility , alongside government initiatives , play a role in uplifting the black community - a point of view considered conservative by those who prefer to point on systematic racism .
An articulate , intelligent lady with a down - to - earth human side , Obama showed that she is far from a one - dimensional "" angry black woman "" , as some critics have tried to portray her . ·

2008-06-19,"The scrutiny of the candidates ' spouses is a traditional sideshow in the summer of a US election : but this time it has added spice , because the discussion of what kind of woman the country would prefer to stand beside the guy taking the oath of office occurs after a campaign that rejected the most plausible female candidate for presidency there has ever been .
Four election cycles since she traded cookie recipes with Barbara Bush in an attempt to deflect fears about her feminism , Hillary Clinton is forced to watch Michelle Obama going through the same process simply to gain a non - elected job that becomes available only through an accident of marriage .
The Democratic candidate 's wife appeared on The View , a US talkshow with an all - female panel , in what looked like an attempt by Obama media strategists to soften her image and correct an impression of black , leftwing militancy which has been spread on the web and picked up in other media .
We have come to accept that presidential candidates will have to address "" character issues "" , but to watch their partners being spun - and , in this case , specifically home - spun - induces fresh levels of depression with the political process .
Commendably , though , Michelle Obama went sufficiently off - message to suggest that she believes Clinton to have suffered from sexism .
Well , she should know : the same prejudice led to the need for her to make this appearance .
The sexual politics will become even more noxious if Senator Obama opts for a woman running mate .
Sharing the ticket with Hillary seems increasingly unlikely , but Katherine Sebelius , the governor of Kansas , remains a possibility .
If the job were offered , though , the governor might want to think hard about whether politics is ready for a gender shift , even in this secondary position .
Has there been any progress in the quarter - century since Geraldine Ferraro made history as the first female vice - presidential nominee but failed partly because of suspicion over her marital finances ?
Hillary Clinton did n't lose the Democratic nomination because she was a woman : it was her misfortune that her run coincided with the offer of an even more progressive and historic choice of candidate .
But it 's clear from the campaign that , even now in 2008 , non - male contenders have to face pressures that are never suffered by men : an antiquated , muttering sub - debate over how they dress , speak , feel and whether they provoke castration complexes in the male population .
The US broadcaster Katie Couric , the first fulltime female anchor of a nightly news bulletin , this week posted an angry video blog suggesting Clinton lost partly because of "" the continued and accepted role of sexism in America - particularly in the media "" .
Clearly , there was a testy empathy in Couric 's words , as she may attribute her low ratings at CBS to the possibility that a section of the population not only does n't want a woman in charge of the country but wo n't even tolerate a woman reading out the facts about what the guys who run the nation are doing .
Even so , only a redneck after too many beers could seriously argue with Couric 's central point .
There was chortling reporting of placards at Hillary rallies reading Iron My Shirt , and novelty Clinton nutcrackers on sale at airports .
Yet the public expression of similar prejudice towards Obama - signs , perhaps , reading Shine My Shoes or keyrings with simulation shackles - would , quite properly , lead to front - page outrage and criminal investigation .
Racism is no longer publicly acceptable , although Senator Obama 's polling performance in November will show if it remains privately an issue in America .
But sexism is permitted to thrive both overground and underground .
The sad spectacle of a Democratic candidate 's wife having to "" reposition "" herself on TV in case
she threatens his electoral chances , shows us that American politics still has a woman problem , which is not being addressed .
Woman leader ?
They have n't even got the hang of dealing with a leader 's woman yet .
Neither have we .
The fundamental unfairness is that visible political wives are accused of stridency and interference , while invisible ones are criticised for failure to stand by their men .
Comparison between the Major and Brown administrations has become standard - house price crisis , record poll lows , turning to jelly on the telly - but there is also a similarity in the missus business .
Both Norma Major and Sarah Brown are private people who chose not to compete with their vivid predecessors , Sir Denis and Cherie .
Norma Major , though , despite what we later learned to be tension in their marriage , was eventually forced to hover at John 's elbow for photo - ops and give interviews supporting him .
And , intriguingly , the Downing Street press machine was enthusiastically spreading the news last weekend that the banquet for President Bush at No 10 had been largely organised by Sarah Brown , who was credited with selecting the menu .
So Mrs Brown is good with food and Mrs Obama is not some scary femi - nazi after all .
The fact that such reassurances are still thought necessary is far from reassuring .

2008-06-19,"In America 's presidential race , a picture may be worth a thousand words - but give the phalanx of TV reporters , columnists and ever - twitchy bloggers a peek and it will yield so much more .
So when Barack and Michelle Obama pressed their clenched fists together this month , just before he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination , they sent the media into a spasm .
Their first question : what was it ?
A "" closed - fisted high - five "" , said the New York Times ;
no , a "" terrorist fist jab "" , according to Fox News ( who else ? ) .
But the fist bump ( or fist pound , as traditionalists would have it ) has been around since at least the 70s , when basketball players used it to congratulate each other .
Some say its origins lie in African - American culture ; others claim that the popular Hanna - Barbera cartoon characters the Wonder Twins started it off by touching knuckles and crying "" Wonder Twin powers , activate ! ""
Whatever , it is a gesture that has spread ; when Hewlett - Packard and Compaq announced their merger in 2001 , company bosses did not give photographers the expected handshake shot , but bumped their fists .
Teachers at Fujishima senior school in Fukui City , Japan , feature the bump in their class on American gestures , and suggest as accompanying dialogue : "" What 's up , yo ?
I have n't seen you in awhile ( sic ) .
"" There are limits to the gesture 's uses ( "" I would not advise fist - bumping your future father - in - law , "" advises a kindly woman from Debrett 's ) but it is more sincere than an air kiss .
And far better than a knuckle sandwich ."
2008-06-20,"Apparently Michelle Obama needs a makeover .
No less than the New York Times says so .
So let it be written .
So let it be done .
The most recent piece of fiction crafted by the mainstream media is that there is something wrong with Michelle Obama .
In the words of the Times , Michelle has a "" strong personality "" .
I do n't think they meant "" strong "" in a good way - like strong bones , strong bridges , strong families or a strong national defence .
In Michelle 's case , being "" strong "" is a liability , not an asset .
There is something about Michelle that the American media thinks is too much .
Is it that she is too confident ?
Too eloquent ?
Too intelligent or too compassionate ?
After declaring that she was just too much , on Wednesday , the New York Times followed up by inferring that Michelle needs to be made over into a softer version of herself , but I did n't see anything wrong with the original version we 've grown to know .
As critics have increasingly frothed at the mouth with charges that she is some angry , unpatriotic black radical , I ca n't help think of those iconic images of black women and girls during the civil rights movement .
Marian Anderson on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial .
Rosa Parks being fingerprinted and booked into jail .
Thelma Mothershed , Minnijean Brown , Elizabeth Eckford , Gloria Ray , Melba Pattillo , Carlotta Walls , Daisy Bates - the young black girls of the Little Rock Nine .
Images of black women and girls exhibiting grace and class while being buffeted by an onslaught of indignities , unjust laws and , in some cases , seething rage .
The truth is that any woman who would submit her children to the circus - like gauntlet that has become the presidential nomination process in this country , has a deep unwavering love for her country .
Only a woman who loved her country would be willing to sacrifice so much and endure the negative stereotyping , spurious rumours and the incessant chatter from prognostitutes psychoanalysing her decision to go sleeveless and wear the colour purple .
And so , on Wednesday , Michelle Obama found herself surrounded by the ladies of the ABC daytime talkshow The View , pontificating on the perils of pantyhose .
Because nothing says more about your spouse 's fitness to be the next leader of the free world better than your ability to chew the fat on national television about eschewing painful undergarments .
Having declared her to be flawed , the mainstream media could now push a new narrative and chronicle her transformation into an adoring candidate robo - wife with no true voice of her own .
Michelle Obama does n't need a makeover .
She was a classy , eloquent spokesperson for her husband 's candidacy .
What needs making over are the puny little minds of the editorial decision - makers in this country who once again are forcing an accomplished professional spouse of a man seeking high office to contort herself to fit into their tiny little archaic boxes .
Political campaigns , being the risk adverse sheep that they are , follow the media 's lead .
Thus every four years they force the country to watch a very public lobotomy via daytime talkshows , fluff pieces in supermarket tabloids and magazine bake offs - minimising a woman 's professional accomplishments in favour of reminding us that she can bake a mean cookie .
They did it to Hillary Clinton .
They did it to Teresa Heinz Kerry .
They would have done the same thing to Elizabeth Edwards .
And they are doing it to Michelle Obama .
All of these women are accomplished in their own rights and have been vocal surrogates for their husbands ' campaigns .
In Michelle 's case the cookies are shortbread with lemon zest topped with dried fruit and nuts .
Nuts is exactly what we are for allowing the mainstream media to drag us on yet another cycle of their election year lunacy where they force professional women to jettison their careers , their education and their professions to become cookie - baking candidate robo - wives .

2008-06-21,"Are we witnessing the bleaching of Michelle Obama ?
Not so much in terms of race or skin colour , more in terms of how benign , how eerily beige in manner she seems determined to come across .
Appearing on women 's US daytime chat show The View , with Whoopi Goldberg and Barbara Walters , the wife of the Democratic candidate revealed homely nuggets such as the fact that her husband has bad habits like never taking the trash out or failing to understand that a lady needs time for her hair .
All the really important stuff then .
In fairness , Ms Obama did explain her fist - bump when Barack won the primaries ( just the new high five , taught to her by young staff ) ; the ' first time I am really proud of my country ' remark ( good old media misrepresentation ) .
As for Hillary for VP ... she 's just glad that decision has nothing to do with her .
But never mind all that :
Michelle does n't wear tights anymore because they get torn . '
It 's fun to look pretty , ' she trilled .
At which point , one thought - is it that time so soon ?
Who 's going to ring Stepford and tell them that one of their robots is malfunctioning ?
One does n't want to be too harsh on Michelle Obama .
It ca n't be easy having your husband 's political enemies cast you as a cross between Louis Farrakhan and the Wicked Witch of the East ( Black Power division ) .
Moreover , at least Ms Obama made a conscious decision to ' rebland ' if you like .
Over here , conversely , another self - made woman spent the week fending off attempts to make her private life seem more colourful than it actually is .
Or as seemed to be implied by Culture Secretary Andy Burnham with his much - quoted remark about how strange he thought the ' late - night , hand - wringing , heart - melting phone calls ' between Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti and the recently resigned shadow Home Secretary David Davis while they were discussing how to oppose the 42-day detention period .
We keep hearing that Chakrabarti has n't come out of this so badly ; strong , dignified , she is threatening legal action and standing firm with the equally happily married Davis .
It is Burnham who looks deliciously like a parliamentary Norris Cole , Coronation Street 's resident malicious gossip , the only difference being that Norris usually does the dirty far more subtly .
However , despite the general air of scorn and disbelief , it does n't follow that Chakrabarti has n't been hurt , a fact of which she must be painfully aware .
All those years , she has not only worked hard , lobbying , making assured appearances on Question Time , but also , miraculously she has avoided the hoary old charge of ' using her sexuality ' ( almost an unofficial blooding for the political female ) .
All this is now undermined by a sleazy smear that would never have made it on to the lavatory wall of Westminster had she been male ?
If you ask me , Chakrabarti has lost a lot .
It does n't matter if it 's known to be untrue ; what counts is that , however briefly , she was no longer purely defined publicly as the high - profile director of Liberty , but reframed as an MP 's floozy , the Tracey Temple of civil liberties .
With this in mind , do n't let him off too easily , Shami - make him grovel .
On a wider level , it 's interesting : one week , two countries , two high - profile women - both reduced , for different reasons , one self - instigated , one not , to the status of mere chicks , bits on the side for the powerful men in their midst .
It was perhaps inevitable that the first casualty of Barack Obama 's campaign would be his wife 's personality , that Michelle Obama would feel obliged to play it whiter than white in more ways than one .
Similarly , Chakrabarti was perhaps dreaming to think she would n't be boorishly accused of using her sexuality at least once .
Seemingly , it makes no odds how much power there is swirling around in the political arena or even who it belongs to .
Ultimately , unless they 're very lucky or careful , high - profile females are assigned pretty much the same supporting roles women get in Hollywood - wives , girlfriends , sidelined bits of fluff - floozies under the skin .
Well , that 's one in the eye for female passivity , is n't it ?
Can you ' catch ' violence ?
Is it infectious ?
Last week , at Uxbridge magistrates ' court , Naomi Campbell was sentenced for assaulting police and airline staff , her crimes including hitting , kicking , throwing yet another mobile and yelling : ' I 'm going to screw you like a motherfucker . '
Meanwhile , outside the court , photographer Kirsty Wigglesworth is said to have bumped Sky presenter Kay Burley in the face with her camera , to which Burley responded by briefly strangling her .
No , wait .
Burley says : ' I did not put my hands around her neck . '
And here is the picture of Kay Burley not putting her hands around the photographer 's neck .
Yet another violent incident , involving bikini - clad jelly wrestling between two female Cambridge students , is perhaps too complicated to go into here .
Suffice to say that the loser punched one onlooker and butted another .
The obvious response to all this is : ladies , please !

Still , let 's try to accentuate the positive .
After all , females are always being slammed for being sly and passive - aggressive .
Now here we are being aggressive - aggressive .

Vive la France and pass the Gauloises So much for cheese - eating surrender monkeys .
Where the smoking ban is concerned , the French are the only ones to fight back .
Not only are they setting up ' open house ' smoking parties ( a rebel group has formed on Facebook - ' For the Great Comeback of Parties in Flats in 2008 ' ) , but there are even ' unofficial ' restaurants , where diners can ' smoke inside ' .
Even I , as an ex - smoker , feel emotional reading those words .
For how long , my friends , were we cast out like pariahs on to pavements , to struggle in the wind and rain , with our soggy matchbooks ?
Pathetic , smelly addicts we might have been , but where was the compassion ?
Or even the lighters ?
And what of national pride ?
Every time it was announced that somewhere was imposing a ban , it would be confidently predicted that the people would never accept it , that there would be street riots .
Instead , everywhere , Dublin , New York , even here in Britain , smokers just rolled over like a big girl 's blouse .
It was as if we did n't have the heart for the fight - or was it the lungs ?
How wonderful , then , to hear about the ' freedom smokers ' taking France by wheezy , gaspy Gauloises - stinking storm .
Many are likening it to the US prohibition era ( instead of speakeasies , smokeeasies ? ) , but essentially is n't it just another wing of the French Resistance ?
In fact , it seems a very Second World War thing altogether .

2008-07-09,"In an age of divorce and single parenting , it was the picture of the model American family : dad , mum and two charming children .
American voters , meet the Obamas .
Barack and Michelle Obama let down their guard this week to grant their first interview en famille to Access Hollywood with daughters Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 .
The two girls - who occasionally squirm with boredom - discuss such family fare as sleepovers , date night , ice cream , their father 's disinterest in shopping and how he embarrasses them in front of their friends by shaking their hands .
But their television debut could be their last major appearance .
Today , Obama said he regretted exposing his daughters to a mass television audience .
"" I do n't think it 's healthy and it 's something that we 'll be avoiding in the future , "" he told ABC television .
However , Leslie Morgan Steiner , who writes on work and motherhood , saw the appearance as part of a conscious effort by Obama to reassure voters that he has a model American family . ""
He is very very savvy about the fact that this is so incredibly important to American voters , "" she said .
"" He is saying : ' I am really a family man .
Look at these two beautiful girls ' . ""
In today 's segment , the Obamas talk about keeping in touch on the phone while he is on the campaign trail , and maintaining the romance in their 15-year marriage .
Malia reveals the couple holds hands .
"" Sometimes people think it is embarrassing , "" she said .
"" I like it . ""
Elsewhere , she chides her father for trying to shake her friends ' hands instead of just saying hello .
"" She basically avoids me embarrassing her by giving these tips , especially when I 'm around her friends , "" her father laughed .
He also admitted that his daughters tune out during his public speeches .
Steiner suggested one key audience of the television interview was former supporters of Hillary Clinton , who are mainly women with children , and that Obama might not done the interviews if his children were boys . ""
This is all about family and girl power and I am a man who supports strong powerful women of any age in my life .
"" Political candidates have long been conscious of the fine balance between projecting an image of a healthy family life and being accused of exploiting their own children .
While Obama featured his wife and daughters in a Christmas Eve ad in Iowa , the children have largely remained out of sight .
Michelle Obama has spoken repeatedly of her desire to give her children a normal childhood .
Before school broke for the summer , they were mainly at home in Chicago .
But political progeny are playing an increasingly important role on the campaign trail - for good and for ill .
In 2000 , Republican operatives working on George Bush 's nomination campaign helped spread a rumour that John McCain 's daughter , Bridget , who was adopted from Bangladesh , was actually his African - American love child .
Bridget was just 8 years old at the time .
In this year 's Republican primaries , McCain 's elder daughter , Megan , blogged her father 's campaign across New Hampshire .
John Edwards , the former vice - presidential candidate , uprooted his young son and daughter from their schools in North Carolina and took them on the road with him .
Chelsea Clinton gave up her job to campaign fulltime for her mother .
So far as Steiner is concerned , Obama 's family is a definite political asset .
With his textbook nuclear family of wife and two children , "" he does an in credible job of convincing us he is so typical when he is not , "" Steiner said ."

2008-07-14,"The latest cover of The New Yorker , featuring Barack and Michelle Obama , has prompted a storm of protest , as Suzanne Goldenberg reports .
This video clip shows how it is being reported across most of the mainstream US media .
Called "" The Politics of Fear , "" it shows Michelle as a revolutionary in military fatigues , packing an AK-47 , and her husband dressed like the Muslim ( a false claim he has been denying for months ) .
It is meant as a satire , to point up the worst of the prejudiced , smearing characterisations that have dogged the couple over the course of the campaign .
But satire , as so often , can be read two ways .
It has been described as "" offensive "" and "" trash "" and "" disgusting "" and "" just as bad as Fox News . ""
So Rachel Sklar has done a Q&amp;A with David Remnick , the magazine 's editor to explain his motives in publishing it .
I ran the cover because I thought it had something to say ...
it does hold up a mirror to the prejudice and dark imaginings about Barack Obama 's - both Obamas ' - past , and their politics .
I ca n't speak for anyone else 's interpretations , all I can say is that it combines a number of images that have been propagated , not by everyone on the right but by some , about Obama 's supposed "" lack of patriotism "" or his being "" soft on terrorism "" or the idiotic notion that somehow Michelle Obama is the second coming of the Weathermen or most violent Black Panthers .
Did you consider that it might be co - opted by Obama opponents as anti - Obama propaganda ?
If so , did that possibility give you pause ?
It always occurs to you that things will be misinterpreted or taken out of context .
That 's not unusual .
But I think that 's the case of all political satire ...
The fact is , it 's not a satire about Obama - it 's a satire about the distortions and misconceptions and prejudices about Obama .
I think this one may well run and run ."

2008-07-15,"The controversy over the New Yorker 's cartoon parody of Barack and Michelle Obama has all the makings of a summer storm : lots of thunder and lightning accompanied by an intense but brief downpour , after which the skies clear and the sun comes out .
Say , is that a rainbow over there ?
But before Barry Blitt 's image of the Obamas as gun - toting , fist - jabbing , flag - burning Black Panther ( she)/Islamist ( he ) terrorists fades away completely , let 's take a few moments to review what we learned about the media and candidate , and what it might tell us about the campaign ahead .
1 .
Should the New Yorker have run the illustration ?
Well , of course .
Why not ?
Blitt 's parody neatly encapsulated every paranoid right - wing conspiracy about the Obamas , right down to the portrait of Osama bin Laden on the Oval Office wall .
There 's a legitimate case to be made that the illustration was neither sufficiently unhinged nor funny enough to get the point across , a position taken by Richard Adams of the Guardian and by Joel Achenbach of the Washington Post .
But I laughed , and I suspect many others did , too .
Context is everything .
Jason Zengerle of the New Republic is troubled that the illustration only works if you already know that the New Yorker is liberal .
Put it on the cover of the conservative National Review , he says , and the reaction would be entirely different .
So ?
The fact is that it did appear on the cover of the New Yorker , which is n't just liberal but is also elitist , self - aware and dripping with irony - which means , therefore , that it can only be taken as parody .
Unless there are people who might take the message seriously .
Which brings me to my second question .
2 .
Will the cover harm the Obama campaign ?
Not likely .
On Monday , the liberal organisation Media Matters for America was making much of an online survey by the ultraconservative website World Net Daily in which some 60 % of respondents agreed with the proposition that "" The image is n't too far from the dangerous truth about the Obama family . ""
But it does n't matter what the far right believes .
According to a poll taken this past spring , 10 % of all Americans and 16 % of conservative Republicans , believe Obama is a Muslim .
Do you think David Axelrod lays awake at night scheming to move those benighted folks into the Democratic column ?
Liberals and leftists who are complaining about the cover - and they are legion ( 2,473 comments to this Daily Kos post when I checked on Monday evening ) - are , I suspect , mainly pissed off because they believe they 've been sold out by an ideological ally .
Consider , for instance , a blog post by the Washington Monthly 's Kevin Drum , who writes that he laughed when he first saw the cover , but then became very , very concerned .
"" If artist Barry Blitt had some real cojones , "" Drum writes , "" he would have drawn the same cover but shown it as a gigantic word bubble coming out of John McCain 's mouth - implying , you see , that this is how McCain wants the world to view Obama .
But he did n't . ""
But that would n't have demonstrated testicular fortitude so much as it would a descent into political agit - prop .
The New Yorker 's editors almost certainly favour Obama , but they also understand it 's not their job to get him elected .
3 .
Did the Obama campaign overreact ?
In a word , yes .
By condemning the cover as "" tasteless and offensive "" , the campaign gave the issue considerably more juice than it otherwise would have had , tacking perhaps another 12 to 24 hours onto the news cycle .
That 's hardly a surprise .
Since wrapping up the nomination in early June , the vaunted Obama machine has been stumbling around some .
All Democratic candidates move to the centre for the general election , but in Obama 's case you can really hear the gears clanking .
The way he handled his daughters ' appearance on the television programme Access Hollywood - surprising and annoying many in the media by letting them do it in the first place , then trying to take it back - was inartful at best .
None of this is particularly serious .
But the campaign 's overreaction to what , after all , was a piece of satire that appeared in a magazine sympathetic to Obama was in keeping with the missteps of the past few weeks .
Obviously both Obama and John McCain , who 's doing his own stumbling around , ought to take a month off , for their sake and ours .
And , oh yes , I promised to say what all this means for the campaign ahead .
My answer : Damn little .
Sorry ."
2008-07-16,"Offence , like beauty , is in the eye of the beholder , as has just been proved again by the response to this week 's New Yorker cover showing Barack and Michelle Obama dressed respectively as a Muslim and a terrorist .
It 's actually a pretty good gag , satirising the shitrain of rightwing smears the Obamas are currently enduring , and Barry Blitt 's cartoon accurately depicts precisely what their enemies accuse them of being .
But although its context – the front of a beacon of metropolitan liberalism like the New Yorker – should make the object of the joke obvious , we no longer live in obvious times .
Worse , in recent years there 's been a growing recognition on all fronts that taking offence is an enormously powerful aggressive weapon , used by Zionists , Muslims , Christians and every other special interest group you care to think of .
So it 's depressing but unsurprising that Obama 's campaign team have chosen not to get the joke , and instead accused the cartoon of being "" incendiary "" , "" irresponsible "" , "" tasteless "" and "" offensive ' , even though their man is not the direct object of the satire .
Nonetheless , it seems that we 're all obliged to feel and share the pain of collateral damage too , and in a way you can hardly blame the Obama camp for using the cartoon as a pretext for utilising the potent political tactic of taking offence .
That 's because taking offence is all about totally silencing your opponents .
If I say you 've said or drawn something offensive about me , it means that whatever you 've produced is so beyond the boundaries of acceptable public discourse that you should never have done or said it in the first place .
In other words , you must shut up and slink away in shame .
I , therefore , win the argument , and that 's an end to it .
So even though Blitt 's cartoon was clearly on the Obamas ' side , in repeating – albeit ironically – their enemies ' smears , it offered an opening to deploy the classic , aggressive , taking - offence defence in order to wrongfoot the Republicans and their more rabid supporters .
The Democrats know that there 's no point in seeking to shame all the rightwing nutjobs disseminating the initial poison .
But rather brilliantly , in refusing to accept New Yorker editor David Remnick 's "" it 's clearly a joke "" response , Obama 's supporters have been able to imply the deadly dangers of irony .
By attacking the cartoon , they 've guaranteed that it 's now been yanked irreversibly from the context where irony could be any kind of defence at all and , thanks to the internet , into a far wider arena .
They 've thus been able to play the "" wife and servants "" gambit that was deployed during the Lady Chatterley trial : what if this image is seen by the wrong people ?
People who believe it might be "" true "" ?
This way , the focus is switched from shameless rightwing maniacs on to "" irresponsible "" liberals , who through careless use of irony are doing the devil 's work for him .
Liberals , as we all know , are infinitely shamable , so – in political terms –
it pays to divert the offence defence through them .
Which means , if the whole thing works , that the the electorate 's minds are sown with the idea that even an ironic attack on Obama is offensive – and only in part because of his ethnicity and his father 's religion .
And that means that ultimately all attacks on Obama become offensive , and anyone who engages in them places themselves beyond decent human society .
So in the end , with luck , your man is beyond criticism , because all criticism of him is literally unspeakable .
Cartoons are singularly susceptible to this kind of political response because they 're a rich and ambiguous mixture of disrespect , humour , sarcasm , satire and voodoo .
But that 's also why they work , whatever strategies their victims play against them – and even if , all too frequently , irony is still scratching its arse in bed by the time raw politics has goosestepped five times round the world ."

Although he does make a few more substantive points about parenting , gender politics , and right - wing criticisms of Michelle Obama in this Marie Claire Q&amp;A , which therefore narrowly avoids being anointed the Definitive Obama Puff Piece ."
2008-08-20,"As the focus this week turned to Barack Obama 's choice of running mate , his other crucial partner continues to show that the Democratic nominee is n't the only Obama breaking down barriers .
Michelle Obama is well on her way to becoming the first African - American first lady .
But in a country that has a long way to go in terms of racial and gender justice , her reception has been far from warm .
In the wake of the rank misogyny directed at Hillary Clinton throughout her campaign , it 's time for American feminists to defend Michelle Obama with the same passion and vigour : the attacks are worse and the consequences more dire .
Media coverage of Obama has packed a nasty racism - sexism combo that is quickly becoming a national disgrace .
First a Fox News segment captioned a picture of Michelle as "" Obama 's Baby Mama "" , a disparaging term for unmarried mothers .
Rightwing commentators have called her an "" angry black woman "" and "" Obama 's bitter half "" , while the National Review ran a cover story dubbing her "" Mrs Grievance "" .
Then came the notorious , if satirical , New Yorker cover , where she was featured as having a large Afro and toting a machine gun .
Like it or not , it matters what the American public thinks of Michelle Obama .
A recent poll showed 61 % of Americans say the potential first lady plays a role in how they vote .
While there has been positive media - such as Michelle Obama 's appearance on TV and on magazine covers - the underlying messages put out by the press reek of racism , sexism , and of a country unable , or unwilling , to see a black woman in a position of power .
As one Washington Post commentator , Sophia A Nelson , wrote , for women who face this daily , it is far from shocking .
"" We 're endlessly familiar with the problem she is confronting - being looked at , as black women , through a different lens from our white counterparts , who are portrayed as kinder , gentler souls who somehow deserve to be loved and valued more than we do . ""
Thankfully , this assault is n't going entirely unchecked .
Blogs such as Michelle Obama Watch are holding news outlets accountable for inaccurate , sexist and racist characterisations .
But that 's not enough .
It 's time for feminists in the mainstream movement , many of whom are still stinging over Clinton 's loss , to not just pull out all the stops for Barack , but to also use their considerable political power , money and influence to defend Michelle .
When Clinton was still campaigning I received daily emails from various women 's organisations , furious about the way the media was treating their candidate .
These days , however , my inbox is fairly empty .
And the press releases and action alerts I do get about Michelle Obama seem to lack the outrage and fervour of past Clinton - focused statements .
That 's not to say women 's organisations are n't up to the task .
The National Organisation for Women , for instance , has shifted the focus of their Media Hall of Shame to attacks on Obama .
But feminists should be up in arms .
Because as shameful as the treatment they 're getting is , our silence is even more so .
Michelle Obama recently told a room full of women that "" [ we ] need an advocate in the White House now more than ever before "" .
And after eight years of the Bush administration , truer words were never spoken .
But Michelle Obama also needs an advocate in us .
We have an opportunity to show the world that racism and sexism are not acceptable , that they have no place in public discourse , and that those with power will not just speak out against injustice - but will scream , full volume .

2008-08-25,Michael Tomasky on tonight 's speech by Michelle Obama
2008-08-25,"The four - day Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party 's first black presidential candidate was scheduled to kick off in Denver today with a speech by Michelle Obama tackling claims that he is elitist and un - American .
In her first major speech since her husband 's campaign for the White House began 20 months ago , she was due to try to show the human face of a candidate that his rival , John McCain , portrays as celebrity - driven and out - of - touch with working - class America .
In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech she said she would present their family as typically American .
"" My father was a shift worker , a worker for the city all his life .
"" It was not a privileged upbringing : "" No silver spoons , no magic .
Just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off . ""
"" I think our stories are the quintessential American stories . ""
Her speech was part of a three - pronged approach by her husband 's campaign team for the convention : flesh out his personality , elaborate on his policies and present the Democratic party as united .
Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens all this year , his life - story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans .
He has failed to connect with white working - class males in key states such as Ohio , partly on race grounds but also because he is viewed as a dilettante .
After two White House election defeats at the hands of Republicans , there is nervousness among Democrats in Denver about whether Obama can overcome the negatives stacked against him .
That concern was not helped today by a CNN poll showing him in a dead heat with McCain , at 47 % for each .
Obama had held a seven - point lead in last month 's CNN poll .
For most of the campaign , Obama has kept his family , other than Michelle , in the background .
But his wife , two daughters and other relatives visited the convention centre this morning to provide an early photo - opportunity and to scout out the hall ahead of her speech .
In an interview with the Denver Post published today , she said she would use her speech to share stories about "" the values that drive him , experiences that shaped him , and why I believe he will be an extraordinary president .
I 'll also share stories about my life and my background with the country . ""
Previewing his wife 's speech , Obama told supporters yesterday , at the end of a day campaigning in Wisconsin : "" You 'll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how we 're raising our kids .
And I think what you 'll conclude is : He 's sort of like us .
He comes from a middle - class background .
He went to school on scholarships .
He had to pay off student loans .
He and his wife had to worry about child care .
They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids . """
2008-08-25,"The Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party 's first black presidential candidate opened yesterday with a string of speakers , including his wife Michelle , lining up to offer glimpses into his personal life .
The aim of the first day was to flesh out his background and to make more human a candidate suffering from accusations from his rival , John McCain , that he is celebrity driven , elitist and out of touch with working - class America .
In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech , Michelle Obama said she would present their family as typically American .
"" My father was a shift worker , a worker for the city all his life .

Obama had a seven - point lead in last month 's CNN poll .
The Democratic chairman , Howard Dean , brought his gavel down to mark the start of the four - day convention , one of the most important in the party 's history .
He told the 4,000 delegates in the hall , and the 15,000 journalists either in the hall or tents nearby , that the convention "" will demonstrate to all Americans why we need Barack Obama and Joe Biden [ his vice - presidential running mate ] in the White House "" .
For most of the campaign , Obama has kept his family , other than Michelle , in the background .

As Michelle Obama gave her first major speech since her husband launched his bid for nomination 20 months ago , the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain told fundraisers in Sacramento , California , that his wife , Cindy , was to visit Georgia to assess the humanitarian situation after the conflict with Russia .
McCain 's campaign team see foreign affairs as their candidate 's strong point and believe he was helped by the conflict .
His wife 's presence in Georgia will help bring the issue back into the US election campaign ."
2008-08-26,
2008-08-26,"Michelle Obama succeeded last night in her opening - night audition for the role of first lady .
She was poised and open , humble and forthcoming , patriotic , and above all a champion for her husband .
I disagree with my friend Mike Tomasky - schmaltz on Michelle Obama would smell false , and what the audience was looking for was genuine sentiment .
Sell it too hard and you lose us –
this is not a woman who normally gets treacly and weepy .
If she 'd tap - danced too hard about patriotism , I would n't have bought it , and neither would have America .
Obama 's task last night – made infinitely more difficult by the relentless coverage of her "" proud "" gaffe some months back – was to define herself and her marriage not outside of race but not entirely defined by it either .
You could hear it in the moment early on in her speech when she called herself first a "" sister "" and there was a beat , small but noticeable , before she went on to talk about her relationship to her impressive biological brother .
But of course Michelle is also a "" sister "" in the African - American sense , and I 'm quite sure that pause , that nod , did not go unnoticed in the wider audience .
But beyond that split - second , and an applause line for the 45th anniversary of when "" Dr King lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation "" , the emphasis of Obama 's text was on countrywide wholeness - not about racial separation or the efforts of men and women of colour in an ongoing battle for a united country , but about universal struggles .
Dr King was mentioned in the same breath as the battle for women 's suffrage , and both of those historic struggles were wrapped up in a package that addressed all working men and women , black and white , red state and blue state .
This was a speech that was the child of senator Obama 's historic Democratic convention address in Boston in 2004 .
Just listen to how she went on : I stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history - knowing that my piece of the American Dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me .
All of them driven by the same conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early each day to painstakingly dress himself for work .
The same conviction that drives the men and women I 've met all across this country .
The other day a prominent German journalist commented to me that he believed the reason President Bush 's tremendous lack of public support had n't had a negative impact on McCain was almost entirely based on racism .
Americans , he mused , are still unclear about a black president .
That 's why , he said , Barack Obama had failed to pull ahead of McCain in the polls .
A random white politician would have done better .
While I find that summation of the close polls too simplistic , the dance of racial recognition and ultimate transcendence was certainly on stage last night .
Patriotism sold any harder than Michelle Obama 's crescendo simply would n't have worked :
All of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wo n't do - that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be .
That is the thread that connects our hearts .
That is the thread that runs through my journey and Barack 's journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight , where the current of history meets this new tide of hope .
That is why I love this country .
This is her patriotism .
It might not be enough for everyone , but I was sold .
Patriotism as defined by Michelle Obama was about a unified vision of the country , a unified struggle .
She did n't need to say she sits beside her children when they are sick , or stands behind her husband when he runs for office .
It was clear .
It helped her cause that nothing looked more like Camelot than Sasha and Malia Obama - so clearly in love with their parents - coming out to greet their mom , poised in her turquoise dress .
And that nothing sounded more normal , as Noam Scheiber at the New Republic pointed out late in the evening , than a brother vetting a boyfriend by basketball , or a father dressing slowly to overcome his encroaching disease but refusing to give up the honour and privilege of raising a family .
The Obamas have been all about revealing the normalcy of non - whiteness from the beginning of this campaign , and nothing could have been more normal than Michelle Obama 's narrative in Denver .
Last night Michelle Obama was a "" mom "" and a "" daughter "" and a "" wife "" and an American .
Well - layered beneath those wholesome titles came her credentials as a lawyer , a working woman , a success in her own right .
This was a first - class bid to be first lady .
Michelle Obama understands , whether she likes it or not , what is required of her in the run for the White House and the office of the first lady .
Last night she met those expectations with aplomb ."
2008-08-26,"When you win the nomination as the candidate of change , what do you do with those you have defeated and displaced ?
That is the delicate but vital party management question that Barack Obama is facing at the Denver convention this week .
It is an especially acute question in the light of the unprecedented closeness of the contest with the long - time favourite Hillary Clinton .
And on Monday evening , day one of the convention , Obama decisively revealed his answer .
Obama 's overriding priority in the early part of this convention week has been to prevent Denver degenerating into a repetition of the primary race .
With election day just 10 weeks away and the polls narrowing between him and John McCain , Obama has to do everything possible to prevent the week from being a repetition of the inward - turned battle between himself and the Clintons .
By the time he himself takes the stage tomorrow he has to have made the Democrats look outwards and focus on fighting McCain .
That was why Michelle Obama was deployed in such a high - profile role as the keynote speaker on day one .
There were many other reasons why Michelle Obama was always going to be a pivotal figure at this convention .
She is the prime witness to Obama the human being rather than Obama the political phenomenon .
She has to turn away some of the rumbling resentment , inevitably racially tinged in some cases , against his and her pride in what they are achieving .
And she has to accustom Americans to the radical thought of a black first family .
But above all she was chosen to deliver the opening night keynote speech in order to say what nobody else except the candidate himself can say so clearly : This is Barack Obama 's party and this is Barack Obama 's convention .
Do not underestimate the sheer boldness of this .
To bemoan the lack of policy or the absence of attacks on McCain in Michelle Obama 's speech is , I think , to miss the point .
It takes political nerve - perhaps even reckless nerve - to tell the dynasties , baronies and interest groups that have dominated the Democratic party over recent decades that they do n't have things all their own way now .
But that , by her very presence at the podium as well as in what she said , is what Michelle Obama was stating on Monday night .
The key question , therefore , is whether the Democratic dynasts will accept those terms .
There was plenty of evidence on Monday night that they are doing so .
The appearance on the platform of Ted Kennedy , and everything that he represents , was the most dramatic and symbolic example of it .
Kennedy chose his brother 's words about passing the torch to a new generation of Americans deliberately .
It was an act of homage both to JFK and to Obama .
But he was n't the only one to accept Obama as liege lord .
Almost wholly unnoticed by the media , Jimmy Carter made an early evening visit to the rostrum to say the same thing .
So , in a remarkably low - profile appearance considering her political clout , did House speaker Nancy Pelosi .
The crucial question for the week as a whole is whether the Clintons and their cheerleaders will be able to summon the same levels of pragmatic dignity as the Kennedys and the Carters .
The stakes for them are far higher of course .
They both , Hillary in particular , have future political careers to mull .
If Obama loses in November , Hillary will overnight become the Democratic frontrunner again for 2012 .
For now , though , the Clintons have little choice but to grin and bear it as Obama ushers them firmly and faster than they wish towards the door marked the political past before he heads off towards the future ."
2008-08-26,"I 'll confess I was n't thrilled by the aspiring first - lady 's dress .
The colour ( an off - turquoise ? ) did n't favour Michelle Obama 's lovely skin tone , and it clashed with the blue background onstage at Denver 's Pepsi Centre .
I was reminded of John McCain 's speech the June night when Obama effectively clinched the nomination , given in front of what one Republican described to conservative pundit William Kristol as a "" dumb green puke background "" .
In addition , the large broach or ornament in the center of Obama 's dress was an intrusive distraction from her delicate neckline .
I expressed all this to my girlfriend last night while we were watching the proceedings on television , and she , an ardent feminist who is hypersensitive to hints of male sexism , whacked me on the arm .
I reminded her that I have written about Barack Obama 's physical appearance .
And whether or not it ends up in my news reporting , I always privately note McCain and Obama 's attire -- for example whether they are wearing suits and ties or open collars , rolled - up sleeves , whatever .
There is unquestionably a political element to a critic of Obama 's wardrobe .
My guess is the Obama camp , which needed to portray Michelle Obama last night as a regular , non - threatening , not - too - sexy American mom , wanted her in the softer - toned dress that does n't strike of high - fashion .
I would have preferred her in black ."

2008-08-26,"Michelle Obama , who could become the first African - American first lady in January , tonight gave a personal and sentimental account of life with her husband in a primetime speech intended to bring his narrative into the homes of millions of American voters .
In her first major speech since Barack Obama launched his presidential campaign 20 months ago , she was loudly welcomed by the 4,000-plus delegates at the Democratic convention in Denver waving "" Michelle "" banners .
She went on to speak about Obama as a husband and father who lived his life imbued with American values .
One of the biggest cheers of the night came when she offered an olive branch to the Clinton camp , praising her for her success in advancing the women 's movement .
Clinton had "" put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher "" .
Michelle Obama lacked the rhetorical ability of her husband and failed to arouse the audience in the way he is capable .
The final ovation was loud but not prolonged .
The insights into Obama family life were carefully designed to counter jibes from his Republican rival , John McCain , that he is too fond of his newfound celebrity status , that he is elitist and out of touch with working - class Americans .
She insisted that in spite of all his success since he launched his White House campaign 19 months ago , "" the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in love with 19 years ago "" .
She tried to counter accusations raised by the Republicans about her patriotism after an out - of - context remark she made in January suggesting she had not been proud of the US before Obama won the Iowa caucus that month .
In her speech , she pointedly described the US as a "" great country "" in which everyone had the chance to rise .
The loud response when she began the speech eclipsed even that given an hour earlier on a surprise appearance by senator Edward Kennedy , who is suffering from a brain tumour .
The four - day convention is scheduled to culminate on Thursday with the formal endorsement of Obama as the first African - American presidential candidate with a serious chance of reaching the White House .
Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens all this year , his life story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans .
Before Michelle Obama spoke , the convention saw a short video describing her early life in Chicago 's South Side and her relationship with Obama , who joked that she had been won over when he bought her an ice cream .
She was introduced by her brother Craig , who spoke about their early life together and insisted she would be the first lady .
Her mother was also in the audience .
She portrayed Obama as having come from humble beginnings and as a patriot who shared American values .
He had worked as a community oganiser in Chicago alongside people who believed , "" like you
and I believe , that America should be a place where you can make it if you try "" .
In one of many sentimental passages , she won a round of applause when she said he had been unchanged by his success and illustrated it with a description of the birth of their first child : "" He 's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer , inching along at a snail 's pace , peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror , feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands , determined to give her everything he 'd struggled so hard for himself , determined to give her what he never had : the affirming embrace of a father 's love . ""
After she finished , Obama , who is not due in Denver until Wednesday , joined the convention by video to praise his wife and to invited his children to comment on her speech .
"" I think she did good , "" one of them said .
The children then waved at the screen saying , "" love you , Daddy "" .
As Michelle Obama intervened on behalf of her husband with her first major speech since he began his campaign 20 months ago , Cindy McCain also went into action .
John McCain told fundraisers in Sacramento , California , that she is to visit Georgia to assess the humanitarian situation after the conflict with Russia .
McCain 's campaign team sees foreign affairs as their candidate 's strong point and believes he was helped by the conflict .
Her presence in Georgia will help bring the issue back into the US election campaign .
"" She is on her way to the little country of Georgia , "" said John McCain , who criticised Russia 's involvement ."
2008-08-26,"Marc Steiner is in Denver blogging for the Center for Emerging Media
Well , it was fascinating sitting in the Pepsi Center last night .
It was something I have never experienced before .
Watching Michelle Obama , so much came to mind .
Some positive and some troubling .
I harkened back to the time when I was 18 years old , at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City .
It was 1964 and blacks were being killed , injured and arrested for trying to live freely as Americans .
They forced to live under apartheid in America 's south .
Out of that in Mississippi came an African American woman , a sharecropper who had been beaten and arrested for fighting for her civil rights
Her name was Fannie Lou Hamer , and she led the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party .
We were at the Democratic National Convention demanding to be seated in the hall .
MFDP was the true representation of freedom in America .
She gave an impassioned speech from the heart , of living under the vilest oppression in America .
And now there was Michelle Obama standing on stage , beloved by so many .
Vilified by those who may never get it and for whom the African American life and experience is so foreign .
Yet here we are at a moment when America 's first lady may be black .
Tears came to my eyes with just the sheer joy of how far we have come .
It was a handing of the mantle to a new generation in the Democratic party , from Jesse Jackson to Caroline Kennedy to Chelsea Clinton to Craig Robinson to Barack and Michelle themselves .
Ted Kennedy handed on the baton to the next generation while holding to the values he believes the Democrats should maintain .
It was , for that party , a historical and moving moment .
There is a lot to question here , though .
The power of large corporations looms large over this convention - from their logos on the bags delegates receive to the expensive receptions they underwrite .
Big Coal is everywhere , trying to clean up its image and buy the votes and minds of delegates .
Anti - union and right - wing Coors has its beer flowing freely for thirsty delegates .
So , while change is soaring through the air , some things have not changed ."
2008-08-26,"Let me try to place Michelle Obama 's speech within the context of how quickly the Obamas have moved up politically from a highly successful black couple to post - racial symbols on the brink of the presidency .
I think it helps to explain a few things that have been troubling voters who 've been sitting on the fence , and , frankly , that have been troubling me as well .
At National Review Online , Byron York observes that Mrs Obama 's sunny , family - centric speech was entirely different in tone and substance from one she gave in North Carolina just a couple of months ago . ""
In Charlotte , "" York writes , "" her America was a dark and ugly place , where people who work hard are knocked down by sinister forces - a place where even young children burst into tears when they realise the deck is stacked against them . ""
The homepage teaser for York 's commentary - "" Radical Makeover "" - says it all .
York is not wrong .
Earlier this year , Lauren Collins wrote a profile of Michelle Obama for the New Yorker that was largely sympathetic , but that also portrayed her as someone whose campaign portfolio included appearing before African - American audiences and indulging in the sort of racial grievances that her husband eschews .
Then there is the Obamas ' long , long association with the Rev Jeremiah "" God Damn America ! ""
Wright .
Even if it can never be shown that Barack Obama was sitting in the pews for one of Wright 's more unhinged sermons , it is simply not credible to believe the Obamas did n't know what kind of church they belonged to and what Wright stood for - the good , yes , but the bad as well .
What we 're seeing , I think , is a smart , charismatic couple who charted a route to power and influence within liberal and African - American circles , only to discover rather suddenly that they had set the bar way too low for themselves .
Hanging out with folks such as Wright and fossilised 60s radicals like William Ayers , and occasionally throwing some racially charged red meat to your long - suffering black constituents , is good politics if you think your ceiling is Chicago and Illinois .
It 's not good politics at all if you want to be president .
Like all successful politicians , Barack Obama is a bit of a chameleon , taking on the characteristics of his environment .
So , too , is Michelle Obama .
Who is the authentic Michelle Obama , the fiery speaker of May or the smiling mother of August ?
Both .
And before you condemn some of her more inflammatory rhetoric , keep in mind that she is , in fact , a black woman who , we can be sure , has experienced her fair share of racism - perhaps more than her husband has , given his unusual personal journey .
I began by saying I find some of this troubling .
What I mean is that I find it troubling in a political sense .
The choices the Obamas made do n't bother me , mainly because I expect politicians to act like politicians , and I am rarely disappointed .
But I do n't think the Obamas have adequately explained their choices to uncommitted voters .
Moreover , I do n't think they can .
Despite the terrific speech Obama delivered on race following the first wave of the Wright controversy , Obama 's overall behaviour concerning that relationship - including his decision , finally , to break all ties with Wright - has been transparently phoney .
( Not to say that Obama and Wright remain buddies in secret .
Their falling - out , I 'm sure , is genuine . )
The truth is that Wright was useful to Obama at one time but became a liability once Obama decided to go national .
I do n't mean to come off as quite that cynical .
No doubt the bond between the Obamas and Wright was genuinely strong at one time , and Wright seemed to go out of his way to invite a rupture this past spring .
But , again , like nearly all successful politicians , Obama has a not - very - admirable tendency to use people and then move on .
By trying to reinvent themselves as thoroughly as they have , the Obamas risk coming off as inauthentic , and of being pilloried as hypocrites .
The truth , I suspect , is that they both harbour some sense of racial resentment , but that it 's just a small part of who they are .
And they have decided that Americans ca n't handle the truth .
And they may be right .
But by pretending to be just a little too perfect , they 've put themselves at some risk .
For one thing , you can bet that Jeremiah Wright is merely on hiatus , and will make a splashy return this fall , either on his own or through Republican attack ads .
For another , York 's exercise today is merely a more intellectually rigorous version of what the likes of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh deliver every day , as they continually bash away at Michelle Obama for saying she was "" proud "" of her country for the first time , among other alleged transgressions .
If the McCain campaign and its allies can succeed in portraying the Obamas as angry blacks , that will go a long way toward ensuring Republican victory in November .
I 'm sceptical that the Obamas can stop them from doing it .
And the biggest obstacle is their own past , and their perceived need to deny it ."

Yet Michelle Obama only had to step up to the speaker 's rostrum in Denver to make it clear , before she even opened her mouth , that there is , and was always going to be , a second question in play in this election , nearly but not quite as important as the first : is America ready to elect a black first lady too ?
This is n't a trivial question .
There have been many speeches by African - American politicians at the conventions of both parties down the years - mainly to the Democrats , of course .
So the ground has been prepared for the idea that an African - American man would eventually make a presidential nomination acceptance speech one day .
But the ground has not been similarly prepared for an African - American woman to take the audition to be the nation 's first lady .
Given all the mystique , the conservative mystique , that surrounds this role - ask Hillary Clinton , 1992-vintage , if you are in any doubt about that - Michelle Obama is at least as much of a pioneer as her husband .
To all but a small audience of political specialists , Michelle Obama is also a total unknown as a person .
So she had two tasks to perform in this speech : first to breakdown all the racial stereotypes that still cling to a post like that of first lady and , second , to introduce herself to the electorate in her own right .
Any fair judge must surely say that she did the second with fantastic assurance and allure .
I also think she cracked it pretty brilliantly with the first question , but it would be naïve not to accept that this will not be easy .
The two questions obviously impact on one another .
If America is ready for Michelle Obama , and for the portrayal of Barack Obama that she offered in her speech and in the many videos which dotted the agenda of the first evening of the Democratic convention , then some of the cultural and character questions which make this such a unique election may be answered in the Democratic candidate 's favour .
In this context the most interesting thing we learned this evening about Barack Obama is that when he first asked Michelle for a date years ago she turned him down .
The Obama charm , in other words , does not carry everything before it after all .
It can be resisted .
He 's like the rest of us after all .
Paradoxically this resistibility helps Obama , because it makes him more human .
To many foreigners , the extent to which the American election process focuses on the candidate 's partner is somehow suspect , proof perhaps of the whole system 's lack of seriousness , in some contexts another snobbish hook on which anti - Americans can hang their coats .
Even to many Americans themselves , the idea that the candidate 's wife ( as it still has been in all significant cases ) has to take a public audition along with her husband certainly is peculiar too .
It certainly was n't always thus .
Until the 20th century indeed , not even the nominated candidate had to make a speech at the convention , never mind his wife .
But the presidential audition is nowadays irredeemably a family affair .
The wife , the kids , the brothers and sisters , the parents - they all have a role .
One can wish it otherwise - but wishing it different wo n't make it so .
And by these criteria , Michelle Obama did a hugely skilful job .
She had to persuade the doubters that she was n't , as the stereotype has it , another angry black woman .
But she did this in a highly principled way , stressing that the struggles of the past were coming to fruition in the Obama candidacy –
the pride was unmissable and rightly so – but presenting them in the hegemonic rhetoric of the American dream .
That 's where the current of history meets the new tide of hope , is how she put it , in fluent Obamese , before adding the key line that "" That is why I love this country . ""
That brought the house to its feet .
At that moment one knew she had done as well as she possibly could have hoped .
It was mission accomplished .
Job done - for now ."
2008-08-26,"Usually it 's a blessing from the Lord himself when a political speech is shorter than you 'd anticipated , but Michelle Obama 's 21-minute address to the convention on Monday night was one of those rare speeches that would have done well to be a little bit longer .
I 'll say another thing one rarely says about such speeches :
I think it could have used more schmaltz .
Her task tonight was to tell white Americans that her family is normal and patriotic .
Do n't get me wrong .
It 's appalling that this was her task .
It infuriates me that stupid and dishonest right - wing apparatchiks jump up and down creating controversy around this accomplished and serious and polished and , incidentally , obviously quite normally American woman .
And it infuriates me that stupid yakkers on cable television , needing to fill time , pick up these stupid right - wing tropes .
But that 's how it works , and that 's what she needed to do , and I think she could have done it a little more cloyingly .
I know , cloying is bad .
But in a circumstance like Monday night , cloying could be good .
In politics , it rarely hurts to be obvious and shameless .
So I think that maybe Michelle could have talked more about her and Barack 's courtship , about sitting at their daughters ' bedsides when their fevers ran to 103 , about watching American Idol with them … you name it .
The schmaltzier the better .
Normal American family .
Normal American family .
Maybe I 'm wrong and she did that .
The film that preceded her speech , in which they talked about how they sealed their budding relationship over ice cream cones , worked pretty well .
Her statements about her late father were certainly genuine and the sort of stuff most people can relate to .
The moment at the end , when Barack came up on the big screen , started out with promise and seemed like an inspired idea .
But it went on too long , and he forgot what city he was in , saying "" St. Louis "" once instead of "" Kansas City , "" and when he started talking about his host family , the camera did n't pan out to them at the right moment .
If these things are n't going to be choreographed to a fare thee well , there 's not much point in doing them .
But maybe the girls were cute enough that it was all right .
She 's a very impressive woman who faces enormous and unfair pressure .
She cuts a distinguished figure .
But I guess I 'm left feeling that she should have made the speech more personal than it was .
And I 'd note that the speech 's political rhetoric was still grounded in the hope / change gear that many observers ( me included ) have begun to think is yesterday 's news .
It may be that it 's "" the wife 's job "" to be upbeat and talk like this , and Obama himself will downplay that language by Thursday .
Or it may be that the campaign still believes that that rhetoric can carry it .
If the latter , that seems like a problem .
Outside of Michelle , the night was n't really negative enough .
Again , that could be by design .
Presumably the Clintons and Joe Biden , and to some extent Obama himself , will rip McCain and Bush into pieces .
They ca n't have three more nights like this ."
2008-08-26,"The US punditocracy was united in its praise for Michelle Obama 's speech last night .
Roger Simon at the Politico asks "" Could the Democrats be about to nominate the wrong Obama ? ""
Well , probably not .
But Michelle Obama , Barack 's wife , gave an awfully good speech at the Democratic National Convention here Monday night .
While Barack can sometimes soar off into the clouds , Michelle tends to keep things down to earth .
Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Daily News notes that never before Michelle Obama had an aspiring first lady given "" a memorable political - convention speech "" .
Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara wrote : One can only hope that someone had the foresight to hand out Obama / Biden ' 08 tissue boxes on the floor of Denver 's Pepsi Center .
Because between the cancer - stricken Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 's surprising and heart - wrenching reassurances and Michelle Obama 's graceful speech , the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention was punctuated as often by tears as it was by applause .
Some , including my boss Mike Tomasky , were more critical .
Tomasky wanted Michelle Obama to lay on the "" schmaltz "" even thicker , although he says he is "" infuriated "" that , given all the challenges facing our country , the Obama campaign has to spend an evening proving how normal and American her family is .
James Carville , a long - time Hillary Clinton supporter , said the Dems wasted an opportunity to slag on McCain and the Republicans .
He said on CNN : The way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal -- Michelle Obama will talk about Barack Obama personally , Ted Kennedy was a very personal , emotional speech .
But I guarantee on the first night of the Republican Convention , you 're going to hear talk about Barack Obama , commander - in - chief , tax cuts , et cetera , et cetera ."
2008-08-26,"Live from the Democratic convention The carefully choreographed effort to keep the Democrats unified kicked off with glitz , as tens of thousands of convention delegates and others descended on the Pepsi Centre in Denver to cheer first Edward Kennedy and then Michelle Obama , who offered an olive branch to supporters of Hillary Clinton .
Things will get dicier today , with pro - Clinton street demonstrations planned , and Clinton delivering the headline speech — followed by tomorrow 's roll - call vote , in which the former first lady 's name will be on the ballot .
The order of voting will be carefully orchestrated in order to give Clinton some votes before cutting things off and declaring Obama the winner by acclamation .
Michelle Obama does n't have her husband 's rhetorical gifts , Ewen MacAskill writes in today 's Guardian , but the purpose of the event was to soften her image , and she went to great lengths to emphasise her patriotism , after Republicans used a remark she made at an event in January to call it into question .
It was part of "" what may be the most closely managed spousal rollout in history , "" the New York Times concluded .
Alarmingly , Colorado police arrested four people in Denver , reportedly seizing high - powered rifles , walkie - talkies and camouflage clothing , but they refused to confirm local media reports linking the arrests to a possible assassination attempt against Obama .
Today at the convention "" Renewing America 's Promise "" is the official theme .
Technically , the keynote speaker today will be former Virginia governor Mark Warner , but the "" prime - time speaker "" — and the one who really matters — is Hillary Clinton , who 'll be closely watched to see how strongly and successfully she urges the party to unify around Obama .
He wo n't be present : he 's on the campaign trail in Missouri , arriving in Denver tomorrow .
I 'll be liveblogging her speech at blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman .

Tomorrow it 's Rudy Giuliani 's turn ."
2008-08-26,"While there was no surprise in Michelle Obama claiming that her husband would make an "" extraordinary president "" , the way in which she did it was always going to attract scrutiny .
The general consensus seems to be that she ticked all the right boxes , lauding American values , emphasising her husband 's humble beginnings and that he had benefited from the opportunities which exist in the USA and praising Hillary Clinton .
Wired.com called the speech "" heartfelt and earthy "" , reporting that her words met with "" almost universal praise "" on the micro - blogging service , Twitter , with even a Republican praising her .
Marjorie Valbrun , on Root , writes that Obama may have appeared tame compared to her public image
but she "" stood squarely in her place , with the quiet confidence of someone who believes she has every right to be there "" .
However , her performance was destined to be overshadowed by news that three men arrested just outside Denver may have been involved in a plot to kill Barack Obama .
Details remains sketchy at the moment but media reports suggest one of the suspects told police the plan was to shoot the US presidential candidate and that they were linked to white supremacist groups .
Michelle Obama had earlier tried to quell the focus on race , telling delegates : "" You see , Barack does n't care where you 're from , or what your background is , or what party , if any , you belong to . ""
But from Valbrun 's observation that Obama 's speech "" represented a conscious shedding of any attributes that could be even remotely suggestive of an ' angry black woman ' , "" to the details of the "" assassination plot "" , last night 's events were a reminder that the issue of race is not going to disappear ."
2008-08-26,"While attention in the US was focused on Michelle Obama 's convention speech yesterday , another aspiring first lady was heading for Georgia .
Cindy McCain , the wife of the Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , flew to Tbilisi for a meeting with the Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili .
McCain was also due to visit Georgian soldiers wounded in the brief conflict with Russia over the breakaway South Ossetia region .
She is travelling with the UN 's World Food Programme on a trip first reported by Time magazine .
The wealthy beer heiress told the magazine that overseas missions were an "" important part of what I 'm about , what makes me tick "" .
The McCain campaign said the timing of the trip , which coincided with the Democratic national convention in Denver , was a coincidence .
"" She 's on the phone with the World Food Programme ; he 's on the phone with Saakashvili , "" the McCain adviser Nicolle Wallace told Time .
"" It was a great picture of what they 'll be like in the White House . ""
McCain told the magazine she was concerned about landmine proliferation in Georgia .
Since the conflict , earlier this month , Georgia has been a favoured destination for US politicians , especially those involved in the presidential campaign .
Barack Obama 's vice - presidential nominee , the foreign policy expert Joseph Biden , travelled there before being named on the ticket .
The current vice president , Dick Cheney , will go there next week .
Both Obama and McCain have denounced the Russian incursion into its neighbour 's territory , although McCain 's rhetoric was markedly more aggressive .
He has sought to use the conflict , which broke out while Obama was on holiday in Hawaii , to emphasise his foreign policy credentials . ""
Senator McCain has talked for years about the dangers of Russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbours , "" the McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann told the Washington Post earlier this month .
Russia was today continuing to defy the west by recognising the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian region , Abkhazia .
Moscow has pulled back most of its forces from Georgia but is keeping troops in a large buffer zone around the breakaway regions , claiming they are needed to guarantee security ."
2008-08-26,"Every politician begins a speech with the words "" It 's wonderful to be here "" – but it 's rare for that sentence to be freighted with as much poignant meaning as it carried when uttered by Senator Teddy Kennedy at the Democratic convention in Denver on Monday .
The mere fact of his presence on stage , just three months after his diagnosis of brain cancer , delighted and relieved the crowd at the Pepsi Centre .
Rumours earlier in the day had said the 76-year - old senator would be able to do no more than attend , watching the ( meticulously - produced ) video tribute to his life and career from the stalls ( a much better video , it has to be said , than the one that introduced Michelle Obama an hour later ) .
Instead , Kennedy walked his distinctive waddle to the podium , his white hair visibly interrupted by a shaved patch , and delivered a traditional barnstormer of a partisan speech .
The voice wavered , but it never mattered .
Delegates waved their Kennedy placards , chanted "" Teddy !
Teddy "" and sent waves of affection and admiration his way .
All of which should be carefully noted by Hillary Clinton .
For 28 years ago , at the 1980 convention , Ted Kennedy was the Democrat who had been defeated in a bitter primary contest .
His presidential ambitions seemed to have been dashed forever ; the best years of his political career were surely behind him .
Yet here he was nearly three decades later , revered as the liberal lion of the Democratic party , respected for his legislative accomplishments , especially those related to what he called "" the cause of my life "" , the still - unfinished work of providing universal healthcare .
And here 's the thing .
Earlier the man who defeated Kennedy in 1980 , Jimmy Carter , was also on stage in Denver .
He was received warmly but stirred none of the devotion that poured out for Kennedy .
He was n't even allowed to make a speech ( a pre - appearance video had to suffice ) .
So this is the lesson for Hillary .
Even if she never runs for president again , even if she never makes it to the White House , but dedicates herself instead – as Kennedy did – to a lifetime of service in the senate , she could yet be a giant of the Democratic party .
And in 2036 , who knows , it could be she who receives the ovations – while former President Obama can only look on ."
2008-08-27,"Hillary Clinton had a job to do last night , and the rapidly emerging consensus was that she did it .
Until she took to the podium , the convention had felt rather low - key - no surprise , since emphasising Barack and Michelle Obama 's comfy familiarity had been the goal .
But Clinton 's message of unity - peppered with plenty of strikes against John McCain and George Bush — set the venue alight .
Though self - congratulation certainly was n't lacking , Clinton drove home the point that , in the words of the blogger Ezra Klein , she was "" a Democrat , not a Hillaryite "" — an unmistakeable signal to her most hardline supporters that they had to move beyond anger at the failure of her candidacy .
Obama is due in Denver tonight , in advance of his open - air nomination speech tomorrow .
But Clinton 's speech does n't mean party unity is now a given : the other Clinton is due to speak today , and Obama campaign aides are reportedly worried about what he might say , because he 'll say whatever he likes .
Today at the convention Today 's official theme is "" Securing America 's Future "" , and the keynote speaker today is Obama 's running - mate Joe Biden , another man not averse to a bit of loose - cannon ad - libbing .
Evan Bayh and John Kerry are among the others due to address the convention .

"" It makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities .

Amusing campaign badge of the day "" Ask me how many houses I own , "" mocked - up to look like an official McCain campaign badge . ...

( Next week , you wo n't be able to forget it . )

Mitt Romney remains the favourite , with Joe Lieberman and Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty not far behind ."
2008-08-31,"Have n't the Obamas done well these past few weeks ?
Just on Friday I heard a presenter on Fox "" News "" admit , with pain palpable , that it was "" guaranteed ""
Barack would be "" at least 10 points up "" in the polls .
On Fox News !
But accolades from rightwing propagandists are nothing compared with this .
Kate Moss is over ; Sienna who ?
The UK high street has decreed that this season 's fashion icon is none other than ...
Michelle Obama .
Sort of .
It 's not so much Obama who has prompted such adulation , but a very specific dress of hers : the purple shift she wore in Minnesota in June when her husband clinched the Democratic nomination and she , famously , did the fist - bump with him .
Now , it is no exaggeration to say that this dress caused near hysteria among the fash pack : it prompted the New York Times to write an adoring piece about her wardrobe under the headline "" She Dresses to Win "" .
The paper ruminated that the colour was "" symbolically rich , even if its message may have been so subtle as to be subliminal "" .
Symbolism , schmymbolism ; that colour looked hot on her ,
something the high street noted , too .
Purple has long been neglected and Obama reminded the world just how flattering it can be .
Now everyone 's suddenly got a bit of regal Michelle purple ( which is very different from Ribena purple ) .
Reiss , for example , has tricked out a gorgeous strapless evening dress in the shade .
But let 's face it , it was really about the dress as a whole .
For those who ca n't afford the $ 900 version by Maria Pinto , as worn by Obama , there are many other options .
Benetton has a similar one in wool for £ 41.90 , while Banana Republic 's version goes for £ 85 .
The best is probably from Whistles , in the first collection by Jane Shepherdson , former saviour of Topshop , for £ 175 .
It will be interesting to see if Obama 's elevation to the pantheon of style icons encourages the fashion industry to improve its notoriously horrendous record when it comes to hiring models who are anything other than Caucasian .
Frankly , I would n't bet the house on it .
But hey , Obama has already brought purple in from the cold
and she 's not even in the White House ( yet ) .
Who knows what other subjugated shades she might yet redeem ."
2008-09-12,"Perhaps because the most important runway this season at New York fashion week was n't in the city 's traditional venues but on CNN , as the country became increasingly obsessed with Michelle Obama 's shift dresses , Cindy McCain 's wardrobe expenditure and , of course , Sarah Palin 's glasses , the shows themselves often felt a little limp in comparison .
Fashion designers reacted by trying to outdo the competition , with a combination of glitzy parties , celebrities and canny , publicity - seeking timely references , thus making this New York fashion week , dull clothes aside , one of the more memorable for years .
Here is a guide to everything you need to know .
Political support
As the rest of America obsessed over Sarah Palin and lipstick - sporting pigs , New York designers showed their love for Obama .
Diane von Furstenberg and Marc Jacobs were prominent Clinton supporters , but both loyally - or disloyally , depending on your point of view - stuck with the Democrats and bigged up Barack .
Anna Wintour hosted an Obama fundraiser , but her enthusiasm might have waned after the Obama team sent out invitations on which they referred to their host as "" Ann Wintour "" .
Yet the runways told a different story .
This week 's fashion icon was Cindy McCain , with stiff hair and Mad Men - style 1950s dresses becoming increasingly popular .
The asymmetric hemlines on dresses indicated a similar confusion : are we optimistic about the economy or not ?
Who knows ?
The most politically sensitive moment happened at the 3.1 Philip Lim show when actress Elizabeth Banks , who plays Laura Bush in the upcoming Oliver Stone film W , was seated opposite the president 's daughter , Barbara .
No wonder the fashion world 's confused .

At Diane von Furstenberg hemlines were generally long and dresses floaty and shapeless , while at Calvin Klein otherwise simple shifts were pulled into origami like shapes that almost made the models look like they had big hips .
Trousers were generally loose and 3/4 length from everyone , while skirts were ( showing the influence of Mad Men again ) full and falling below the knees , even from such usually sexy designers as Michael Kors .
Meanwhile , Marc by Marc Jacobs and Matthew Williamson both had very young collections , with , respectively , romper suits and mini ruffled dresses .

2008-09-25,"When the New Yorker dedicated one of its July covers to a cartoon depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as violent , radical terrorist sympathisers -- a decision earnestly described as "" satire "" -- the reaction was near - universal disgust .

They recreate the now - iconic New Yorker pose for the latest edition of Entertainment Weekly magazine , which bears the headline "" This Crazy Election "" .
Click the link above to take a look -- and just try not to laugh at Colbert 's saucy wink ."
2008-09-29,"When Michelle Obama was photographed exuberantly hula hooping with her daughter , "" hoopers "" on both sides of the Atlantic jumped for joy .
Those who have already caught the hooping bug - and there are legions of them - claim this retro activity does not just tone the midriff , but burns a fearsome amount of calories ( as many as 100 every 10 minutes ) , boosts your mood and your sex life , provides spiritual enlightenment and , apparently , can even be used to promote world peace .
One hooping exercise class , Hoopnotica , is now so popular that , according to US Vogue magazine , its Los Angeles - based sessions have waiting lists "" worthy of a fashion It item "" .
So , is hooping just another bonkers exercise fad , or are these giddy gyraters really on to something ? ""
Hoop Guy "" , aka John Parnell , 55 , from Nuneaton , in Warwickshire , discovered hula hooping two years ago when someone brought one along to the juggling and circus skills class he was teaching .
"" I was instantly hooked , "" he says .
"" It took me about three minutes to get the knack and I was off . ""
He became so obsessed that he now manufactures hoops ( hoopguy.com ) , runs hoop dance classes and trains hooping teachers around the UK .
It 's certainly a good form of aerobic and toning exercise , with Beyoncé for one , claiming that hooping is what keeps her abs hard .
Virgin Active health clubs now offer Hulaerobics classes in 20 of their nationwide clubs .
They have also recently woven hooping into their new School Yard Antics sessions across all 72 of their clubs , along with other "" good , old - fashioned yard games "" such as hopscotch .
Nostalgia clearly has a big part to play in the hooping trend .
The physical benefits do seem impressive though . ""
Initially , it 's about core stability , "" says Jane Chinery , group exercise trainer at Virgin Active .
Like Pilates , "" there 's a lot of focus on posture , the pelvic floor and pulling in the abdominal muscles "" .
Once you have got the hang of it - and everyone will get some level of competence by the end of the first class - it becomes more aerobic , with dance steps and elaborate hand and arm movements .
Keen hoopers can graduate to the Hula Funk class , where hooping becomes a kind of dance that , says Chinery , is "" even more aerobically intense .
It can be as gymnastic as you want .
"" Much is made of hula 's effect on the waistline ( hula hooping went stratospheric during the 1950s , when women 's waists were particularly cinched ) .
While no form of exercise can "" spot reduce "" fat , hooping will tone up your abdominal muscles and those that run up your flanks , and this could certainly help you to shrink a bit at the midriff .
Parnell sends me a home exercise DVD and a hoop (
surprisingly huge at 100cm/40
in - you have to watch the ornaments if you try it indoors ) .
The basic technique , ie keeping the hoop from dropping to your ankles , is easy to master and within about 60 seconds I can feel the muscles tighten not just around my tummy and sides , but in my bottom ( you have to bend slightly at the knees , with one foot in front of the other , and sway back and forth , rather than circle , your hips .
As Chinery puts it , "" this seriously tones the butt "" ) .
Within a minute , I am breathing faster and can feel my heart pumping .
I also feel about nine years old again - an unexpected bonus .
Many see hula hooping as a performance art , a cross between circus skills and modern dance .
Parnell , for example , teaches the work of Christabel Zamor , or "" HoopGirl "" as she is known in the US .
She has devised a form of hula dancing that involves mesmeric spinning , whirling , stepping and thrusting .
This , says Parnell , is nowhere near as intimidating as it sounds ( the DVD I try is , indeed , relatively easy to follow and it certainly keeps you interested ) .
Parnell teaches hoopers of all ages and abilities and has sold hoops to people in their 80s .
Chinery says one of her Hulaerobics classes contains both a 19-year - old and a 60-year - old , while in Tahoe , in California , a 102-year - old woman recently credited some of her physical agility to her hula sessions .
Some people even find a spiritual dimension to the activity , and the repetitive swirling rhythms certainly do feel quite meditative once you get going .
Sacred Circle , a Californian new - age hooping organisation , describes the "" whirling sufi dervishness "" of the hula as "" a tool to access your own joy , higher truth and awareness "" .
In a different vein , Melody Moezzi , an American author , lawyer and activist , has started her own Obama - supporting , human rights organisation , Hooping for Peace .
In The Hooping Life - a forthcoming American documentary about the craze - a man who suffers from depression tells how "" the soothing kind of rocking in the cradle motion "" of the exercise calms him . ""
When you have a 40 in hoop around you , no one can encroach on your personal space , "" agrees Parnell .
"" You can switch on your iPod , go out into the garden , close your eyes and you 're gone . ""
A woman in the same film enthuses : "" Every hooper says their sex life has improved .
"" It is unwise to start hooping without talking to your doctor if you have a diagnosed back problem or if you are pregnant .
Generally , however , there seem to be very few downsides and a great many benefits .
Hooping , says Chinery , can help prevent back pain because it strengthens your core muscles .
What 's more , she says , women who become pregnant and are already hooping do not need to stop .
One blogger hula - ed with abandon for the whole nine months .
She also says that hooping helped tone her up after childbirth .
As she puts it : "" I 'm one sexy hooping momma "" . ·

2008-10-22,"From the moment she appeared on the vice - presidential campaign stage , with her serious but hintingly sexy spectacles , that dramatically swept - up hair and working mom suits paired with surprisingly high heels , Sarah Palin has pitched her style perfectly , treading a tricky line between heartlands mom and all American bombshell that could not fail to appeal to her rightwing fans .

But all public images are hard to maintain on an international stage and it turns out that Palin 's down - on - the - ranch look has been more high maintenance than Michelle Obama 's "" elite liberal east coast "" look .
Since early September , the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) has spent more than $ 150,000 dressing the Palins , shopping at department stores across the country .
According to financial disclosure records , there was a $ 75,062.63 spree in Neiman - Marcus in Minneapolis , Minnesota and $ 5,102.71 in New York .
Other purchases included a $ 92 romper and matching hat with ears for Palin 's baby , Trig , at a baby store in Minneapolis .
It is unlikely that her fellow "" American moms "" have such a budget .
The Republicans have been trying to pitch themselves as the party for the heartland 's hardworking man : Cindy McCain appeared at the Republican national convention in an outfit costing around $ 300,000 .

It is likely , though , that McCain , a multimillionaire , and Obama spent their own cash , whereas money for Palin 's makeover has come from the RNC 's own funds , and some have questioned the legality of such spending .

2008-10-31,"The WashPost today delivers an astonishingly excellent editorial in support of the scholar Rashid Khalidi .
It is harshly critical of McCain 's reprehensible attacks :
For the record , Mr. Khalidi is an American born in New York who graduated from Yale a couple of years after George W. Bush .
For much of his long academic career , he taught at the University of Chicago , where he and his wife became friends with Barack and Michelle Obama .
In the early 1990s , he worked as an adviser to the Palestinian delegation at peace talks in Madrid and Washington sponsored by the first Bush administration .
We do n't agree with a lot of what Mr. Khalidi has had to say about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict over the years , and Mr. Obama has made clear that he does n't , either .
But to compare the professor to neo - Nazis -- or even to Mr. Ayers -- is a vile smear .
One thing to be hoped for in a putative Obama era is that under morally decent leadership , this country and its political / media establishment will grow out of the habit of assuming the worst about anyone with an Arab - sounding name , itself part of a broader nativism that is driven by conservative definitions of what constitutes a real or good American .
Khalidi was born in this country , as the Post points out , and is as American as Joe the Unlicensed Repairman and AWOL Country Singer .
We desperately need political leadership that asserts that sort of thing plainly and without apology .
OK , now Mike the Pundit has to write a column for the Saturday print paper , expressing his down - home pundit values -- his taste for a complex pinot noir , some crisp arugula , gruyere imported from France ( natch ) and various alien ideologies .
Later today I have to catch my flight back home ( again , naturally , merely flying over middle America rather than setting foot in it ) .
But I 'll try to put up a few more posts and do a video in between .
Cheers ."
2008-11-02,"When Michelle Obama gets into trouble , it 's because she 's too warm , too strong , too real .
If Cindy McCain is disliked , it 's because she 's too icy , too breakable , too fake .
Obama offers the controversial ' fist bump ' as a greeting ; McCain has to wear a wrist brace because of a handshaking injury .
The two candidates ' wives could n't be more different and the contrast between them has provided yet another media - friendly dimension to a presidential race that hardly needed added zest .
While the Republicans have been running an ' Ordinary Joe ' campaign , Cindy McCain wears Oscar de la Renta and five - carat diamond earrings .
( Her net worth is a reported $ 100 m ; her income for 2007 was $ 4.2 m . )
In the week when Sarah Palin 's campaign - funded designer trousseau made headlines , Michelle Obama went on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and , while extending her sympathy to Palin for the sartorial scrutiny she was experiencing , said she herself was wearing ' a J Crew ensemble ' she 'd bought online with her own money .
( Michelle Obama 's entire outfit can now be purchased in the J Crew sale for under $ 300 . )
Even with Hillary Clinton and Palin to suggest that the political landscape is more complicated for women now , these are still the questions that count for a prospective First Lady :
What does she wear ?
How does she smile ?
Has she taken his name ?
Does she have a job ?
Cindy McCain is a first lady in the old mould - mould being the operative word .
Standing just behind her husband at every stop on the campaign trail , she seems pale , remote , and stiff to the point of automation . '
Stepford ' is a word that has been linked to her frequently ; matters are n't helped when she appears not so much to have departed from a script , as blown a fuse .
She said that Mother Teresa ' prevailed upon ' her to adopt a Bangladeshi orphan with a cleft palate ; it was later discovered that Mother Teresa was not there when McCain visited the orphanage .
She said she 'd been to Rwanda during the genocide ; it turned out she 'd been to Zaire after the violence had ended and looked over the border .
A serious addiction to prescription painkillers , that led her to steal from her own charity and cause people who had helped her to lose their jobs , has been turned into a recovery success story .
Cindy , according to a friend of the McCains , would ' walk on broken glass barefoot ' if it would help her husband in his campaign - virtually the same words Jackie Kennedy used about her successor , Lady Bird Johnson .
Michelle Obama , on the other hand , has been quick to tell us about her husband 's morning breath and his failure to take out the rubbish .
Earlier this year , she was considered an unpredictable , potentially dangerous factor in the campaign ( ' Will Michelle Obama Hurt Barack ? '
was a question asked on the cover of Time magazine last summer ) .
Right wingers labelled the fist bump she exchanged with her husband at the Democratic National Convention a ' terrorist fist jab ' .
She said she was proud of her country for the first time , and that went down as profoundly unpatriotic .
Her domestic anecdotes were having a questionable effect on his popularity .
Yet she has turned this tricky reputation around , campaigning on her husband 's behalf when he visited his dying grandmother in Hawaii , and overtaking her Republican counterpart in every opinion poll .
Most important , she has done more than ' humanise ' the candidate , as is traditional : she has actively bolstered his identity in the public imagination .
He is a mixed - race half - Kenyan who was brought up in Hawaii and needed to seem less foreign to voters ; she is an African American who grew up on the South Side of Chicago , then went to Princeton and Harvard and became a lawyer .
These women 's plans for the future are as distinct from each other as their performances on the campaign trail would suggest .
Cindy McCain , who dislikes Washington , has suggested she would , as First Lady , attempt to emulate Princess Diana - she supports some of the same charities , and is keen to devote herself further to global philanthropy , a full - time prospect she and her husband have disagreed about in public .
Michelle Obama , who has focused on addressing working women , has no illusions about keeping the high - powered hospital executive job she 's scaled down in order to get her husband elected .
Careful not to seem like another Hillary in the East Wing , she voices modest hopes . '
When people ask , "" what kind of First Lady will you be ? "" , ' she recently told Vanity Fair , ' I 'm going to try , in all this , to be honest , hopefully funny and share important parts of me with people , hopefully in a way that will help them think about their lives and avoid the mistakes we may have made in our lifetime .

2008-11-03,"Well , hello there !
If it is n't my buddy "" Chief Editor Korir "" at African Press International , the Norway - based African news agency that has been exciting Obama conspiracybloggers for weeks now by promising to release an incriminating set of tapes in which Michelle Obama yells at a reporter , accuses all her husband 's critics of being racists , and offers good seats at Obama 's inauguration in return for much - coveted favourable coverage from API .
Over the last few days , the agency 's unprepossessing free Wordpress.com website has been posting details of complex legal negotiations , purportedly between it and Fox News , involving a "" Canadian lawyer "" and representatives of Fox shuttling between Oslo , New York and London .
Yesterday , it claimed Fox had ignored an ultimatum to broadcast the tapes .
The agency now says it will "" announce the final move Monday morning "" , though I think we can be fairly confident that this wo n't involve anything so straightforward as just publishing the tapes on its own website .
A shame -- and yet I have to say that , all along , as I rode the rollercoaster of this most eyebrow - raising of election tales , I had a tiny suspicion that this was how it would end ."
2008-11-06,"Michelle Obama may not be attending presidential strategy meetings this week , but the next first lady is grappling with a to - do list as long as her husband 's as she moves her family to Washington .
At least one adviser is already in place : the White House chief usher , hired by the secret service , who will help Michelle Obama procure security clearances for household staff and begin remodelling the presidential residence for the Obamas .
But she has to hire a social secretary to plan state dinners , a chief of staff to navigate charity engagements , and a press secretary to field a certain flood of media requests - like the Vogue magazine cover that is already in the works . ""
Starting with Eleanor Roosevelt , it 's been a long - standing tradition to photograph the first lady , "" a spokesman for the fashion bible said yesterday .
"" So needless to say , we are very interested in working with Mrs Obama . ""
The new first lady , who combines an impressive intellect with beguiling modesty , is a high - powered lawyer whose salary tops her husband 's , but she has vowed to avoid a policy role in the White House aside from advocating for military families .
Amidst the whirlwind of President - elect Obama 's transition , his wife must decide whether to take her cue from Laura Bush , who preferred to avoid the spotlight as first lady , or Hillary Clinton , who drew fierce criticism for diving into political combat after her husband 's election .
Still , Michelle Obama 's confidantes and White House veterans agree that her combination of executive experience and down - to - earth style are exactly what is needed to handle the fishbowl of the presidency . ""
Mrs Obama , like her predecessors , will understand over time -
it 's not something they fully appreciate on the first day - the enormous power and consequence that comes with the position they hold , "" Melanne Verveer , who served as chief of staff to now - Senator Clinton , said in an interview .
"" You can make things happen in a certain way that advance the priorities of the administration .
She 'll find her way that is unique to her .
She has a lot of energy , smarts , commitment . ""
Comparisons to Jackie Kennedy , another young first lady with school - age children , have followed Michelle Obama since the campaign began .
The new first lady 's fashion sense certainly harks back to the 1960s heyday of Camelot , but Michelle 's vow to remain "" mom - in - chief "" to her daughters also recalls Mrs Kennedy 's graceful approach to the job .
Letitia Baldrige , the social secretary to Jackie Kennedy , predicted that the sheer logistical tasks facing a new first lady could keep Michelle occupied for the first year of the Obama administration . ""
The first foreign visitor [ under Obama ] will have enormous attention put on him , "" Baldrige said in an interview .
"" Do you get the big allies like Great Britain or France , or get an Arab country ?
I 'm sure they 're already agonising over this . ""
Michelle Obama faced harsh scrutiny in February after Republicans attacked her for telling voters that her husband 's victory made her proud of America "" for the first time in my adult lifetime "" .
Since that trying experience she has warmed to a more traditional role , hosting military spouses at town - hall events and appearing on softer US chat shows .
"" My priority will be making sure my family is happy and settled , "" Michelle Obama told Glamour magazine in a recent interview .
Even a seemingly minor choice such as her attire , however , can have a greater impact than she yet imagines .
The mid - priced J Crew and Donna Ricco ensembles she has worn on TV prompted record sales for both designers .
The red Narcisco Rodriguez dress she donned on election night already has sparked a fashion - world debate over its eye - popping pattern .
Baldrige quipped that "" we should all lay off and let her dress the way she wants to , "" while adding valuable advice for Michelle Obama : "" And help the American garment industry , too .
If you get something that can be copied and sold by an American manufacturer , that 's one way the first lady helps [ businesses ] . ""
Though the next first lady has so far eschewed a Hillary - esque advisory role , by all accounts she remains her husband 's closest confidante .
Her past job leading Public Allies , a youth training programme in Chicago , also positions Mrs Obama to adopt community service as a pet cause .
Asked days before the election whether the economic crisis could delay any ambitious youth - service plan , Michelle gave an answer that hinted at her first - lady style . ""
That fortunately is n't my job , "" she laughed to Newsweek magazine .
"" How much do you invest in what ?
What do you scale back on and how ?
We 'll have to look to the president for those answers . """
2008-11-07,"It seems only appropriate to check in , one last time , with African Press International , purportedly a Norway - based news agency that we came to know and love during the election campaign as the possessor of incriminating tapes of Michelle Obama , the future First Lady .
According to reports on API 's website , the organisation came this close -- seriously , this close -- to having the tapes aired on Fox News , but was foiled at the last minute by legal difficulties and Fox News 's bad behaviour .
( And also by the fact that the tapes are imaginary , but leave that aside for now . )
So now that the election is over , has API nobly accepted defeat and moved on to new things ?
I suspect you can guess at the answer : of course not .
"" It 's not over yet ! "" the site declares .
"" Obama will be stopped by the tape !
We fear the repercussions though , but the priority must be given to the truth , and one should not be dictated [ to ] and held hostage by fear . ""
Apparently the plan now is to release the tape between now and the time at which the College of Electors formally meets to vote in Obama as president .
There is also going to be an anti - Obama protest march in Washington , starting at "" Capital Hill "" .
OK , whatever .
I still ca n't work out what API is -- the work of a fringe conspiracy theorist , a hoax designed to goad the fringe conspiracy theorists , or some kind of semi - real organisation spewing racist nonsense at the same time as occasionally carrying apparently genuine news stories --
but it 's been an entertaining distraction from time to time over the last few hectic weeks .
And now it is time never to think about it ever again .
Bye , API !"

2008-11-07,"After Michelle Obama , the happiest woman in the world about Barack Obama 's victory should be Tzipi Livni .
Israelis are no fools .
Despite their vaunted independence and prickliness when the world appears to be telling them what to do , Israelis do n't need a weathervane to know which way the winds blow .
Perhaps if John McCain had won , Israelis would have felt empowered to choose Bibi Netanyahu to be their next prime minister .
But with Obama 's blowout , Israelis can sense that Americans have tired of the Bush administration 's blank cheque approach to dealing with Israeli settlements and the conflict with the Palestinians .
Clearly , Israelis do not take their marching orders from Washington .
But I think the spirit of the US election will have a substantial impact on the upcoming Israeli election .
Though Obama campaigned as somewhat of a hardliner on issues like Iran and Jerusalem to ensure support from the Jewish community , I do not believe he will govern or implement policy as a hawk .
Nor will he be the anti - Israel pushover imagined by McCain and Jewish Republicans .
He will not govern from ideology or even primarily from a sense of altruism .
He will be a hard - headed realist trying to hold fast to a set of overarching principles .
Despite promising Aipac that he would never accept a divided Jerusalem ( and finessing that statement the following day ) , Obama will indeed accept such an eventuality .
Livni is in effect endorsing this option , making it easier for Obama to do so as well when the right time comes .
Though he has said Hamas is not a partner for peace , I think he realises this is not a realistic approach if you want to bring the entire spectrum of Palestinian opinion into a peace agreement .
At some point in the next four years , both the Israeli and US governments will be talking to Hamas .
Perhaps not directly , but they will be talking .
There is no other way .
Obama will probably also come down somewhere close to the Geneva Initiative / Saudi peace plan provisions for a return of the vast majority of West Bank territory while retaining the largest and oldest settlement population centres .
Essentially , he will have an opportunity to turn back the clock to Taba in 2000 and see if he can get it right this time .
Equally important is what happens in Israel .
In the short term , Ehud Olmert will be Israel 's prime minister .
Given Olmert 's seminal interview in Yediot Ahronot in which he essentially conceded the entire progressive analysis of the conflict over the past 40 years , we can assume that Olmert and the Obama administration might achieve substantial progress on issues like negotiations with Syria and perhaps with the Palestinians .
But I do n't think that Israel will be willing to allow Olmert to seal a deal in any of these matters given the election upcoming on February 10 .
What happens on that date is crucial to the future of the entire region .
If Netanyahu , the leader of the Likud opposition and until recently the frontrunner in the polls , wins , then it will be a cold day in hell before peace agreements are signed with either the Syrians or Palestinians .
In addition , we can expect continuing bellicosity toward Iran ( and vice - versa ) .
Certainly an Israeli attack against Iran is in the cards , along with escalating violence toward the Palestinians .
One should expect Hamas to forgo its six - month - long truce and return to Qassam and terror attacks .
No matter how deft Obama 's policy is , I do n't see any way he can make progress with the rejectionist Likud in power .
No one should make any mistake that Netanyahu is capable to doing a Sharon and becoming a pragmatic moderate when faced with governing ( as opposed to campaigning , which always brings out the worst in Israeli politicians ) .
Netanyahu is no Sharon .
He is an opportunist and ideologue at the same time , but he is not pragmatic in the way that Sharon was .
Lately polls have confirmed that another scenario is possible .
After facing down two Orthodox parties which were shaking her down for large financial incentives to join the governing coalition she was attempting to broker , Livni 's popularity has increased substantially .
Current polls show her with a slight edge over Netanyahu .
It should be noted that such polls are extremely volatile in Israel and there are several political lifetimes between now and February .
That being said , if we project that Livni wins the election , then the sky 's the limit .
We will have an eminently pragmatic US president and a newly pragmatic Israeli prime minister .
Both are deeply serious politicians who understand that there is a lot riding on their success , not just for their respective countries and the region , but the world itself .
This is where the skill and persuasive powers of a President Obama will be called for .
He must forge an alliance with Livni that carries both Israeli and American Jewish opinion before it .
He must also sell the deal to both the Palestinians and the Syrians .
The latter , in particular will require a major break with past US policy .
We must bring the Syrian regime back in from the cold to which it was subjected for the eight years of the Bush administration .
Obama must do this not so much because he admires Bashir Assad , but because doing so will likely transform the region .
Peace with Syria opens the possibility of normalisation of Israeli relations with Lebanon .
And finally , "" turning "" Syria will further isolate Iran and bring Syria into a closer relationship with the west .
Regarding Iran , if an Obama administration can destroy the Iran - Syria alliance while at the same time persuading the ayatollahs that he is willing to open a dialogue with them on issues of interest to them ( including normalisation of relations ) - then perhaps a compromise could emerge on Iran 's nuclear research .
I believe that if the Bush administration can broker a deal with North Korea as appears likely from latest developments , then there is no reason Obama could n't do the same with Iran .
I think the prevailing notion of Obama administration Middle East policy should be that there are no permanent enemies , only permanent interests .
Peace must be a permanent and prevailing interest .
And peace is achievable ."
2008-11-10,"When George Bush acts as host to Barack and Michelle Obama on a visit to the White House today , it will be an increasingly rare event for the US president as he starts to step out of the limelight .
The fast - disappearing leader will give the incoming tenants a tour of their new home before settling down for talks on the presidential transition , of which the top issue will be the economic crisis .
Although all presidents tend to fade in the final months before handing over power , Bush is fading faster than most .
Speaking to staff on the White House lawn last week he promised he would set a frenetic pace in his final days in office - "" a sprint to the finish "" - but his daily diary offers scant evidence of this .
As on so many days over the past few months , his daily schedule for Friday , published by the White House for the benefit of journalists , read : "" No public events . ""
After the visit of the Obamas today , Bush 's schedule for the rest of the week appears thin - mainly ceremonial duties , ahead of hosting a summit of world leaders on the recession .
But , as with today , all eyes at that meeting , at the end of the week , are more likely to be on Barack Obama than on Bush , with leaders more concerned about what the next president will agree to .
Bush is an increasingly isolated figure in the White House , with most of his original team having retired .
He appears to be fretting about his legacy , and argues , as does Tony Blair , that history may judge him more favourably than his present record poor ratings suggest .
White House aides and friends say Bush is an emotional man , upset by poll ratings .
His mood would not have been helped by the thousands who gathered outside the White House on Tuesday for a noisy celebration of not only the election of Obama but the imminent departure of Bush .
He was not seen to peek out from behind the curtains but aides suggested that if they could hear the honking horns and cheers , then so could he inside the White House .
Bush was largely absent from the election campaign , and the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , ensured he was seldom seen in public with him .
Bush understood early on why McCain needed to maintain distance but became more and more agitated as the senator increasingly disowned his policies .
The snub continued into election night when McCain , in an otherwise gracious speech conceding defeat , paid tribute to Obama and others but again failed to mention Bush .
The lack of media interest in Bush was apparent at the White House briefing on Friday , taken by one of the press secretaries , Tony Fratto .
Only about 30 journalists were present , with most of the others in Chicago for Obama 's first press conference as president - elect .
Fratto could not entirely command the attention of those journalists present , even though he was talking about the economic crisis and the latest damning set of unemployment figures .
Many of the camera crews kept focused throughout the briefing not on Fratto but on the Reuters correspondent who was bitten the previous day by Bush 's dog , Barney .
Bush has 71 days left in office .
Bill Clinton used his final days to try to persuade the then Palestinian leader , Yasser Arafat , and the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Barak , to agree to the elusive Middle East peace deal .
But there are few opportunities left on the foreign stage for Bush .
Clinton famously , or notoriously , pardoned 140 people in the closing hours of his presidency and Bush too is expected to conduct a similar final review .
But while Clinton still has involvement on the international stage , through his multimillion aid foundation which helps Africa , and Blair has remained engaged , as head of a Middle East peace effort , Bush could well settle for retirement , retreating to his ranch in Crawford , Texas .
He told the staff gathered on the White House lawn last week : "" As January 20 draws near , some of you may be anxious about finding a new job , or a new place to live . ""
He added : "" I know how you feel . """
2008-11-13,"Great piece by the ever - insightful Rebecca Traister of Salon on the disappointing domestication of Michelle Obama .
This Harvard - trained lawyer with views about the world that are obviously strongly held seems destined , at least for now , to set all that aside and be the grateful and gracious mom and wife :
And now , she is in the unenviable yet deeply happy position of being a history - maker whose own balancing act allowed her husband the space to make his political career zip forward
, his books sing , his daughters healthy and beautiful , and his campaign succeed .
In having done all this , Michelle Obama wrought for herself a life ( temporarily , at least ) of playing second fiddle .
Then again , did she have a choice ?
Traister 's unspoken answer to this question is no , of course , and alas she 's correct .
This is in large part because the Obamas have to stay miles away , for political reasons , from anything that smacks of the Clinton "" two for one "" talk circa 1992 and 1993 .
I would hope that over time , she 'll be able to take a more substantive public role in certain aspects of policy making .
But that will take a while .
Things do change , though .
The media tend to assume that Americans want nothing but old - fashioned corn pone from the First Family .
But maybe Americans are n't as reflexively tradtionalist as the media make them out to be .
If they were , after all , Obama never would have been elected .
And Cindy McCain would have won all those polls about who would make the better First Lady .
After all , she 's blonde and pretty and rich and a stay - at - home wife .
But Michelle tended to have slightly better poll numbers than Cindy throughout the campaign .
So I think all is not lost ."
2008-11-14,"Cherie Blair passes on advice to Michelle Obama : learn to like the back seat .
Labour 's election coordinator , Douglas Alexander , says the party is infused with resolve , not fatalism , about its prospects at the next general election .
The Independent 's Adrian Hamilton says this weekend 's economic summit wo n't count for much unless US president - elect Barack Obama takes part .

Plans to impose minimum prices on alcohol in Scotland received a boost yesterday after a study found higher taxes led to a reduction in drink - related deaths .

2008-11-17,"The one sour note to resound through the jubilation at the election of Barack Obama was an undercurrent of fear and loathing of the dress Michelle Obama wore on election night .
Most newspapers were too high - minded to refer to it , but reaction trickled through the internet and surfaced in USA Today , where a poll revealed that twice as many people hated the gown as thought it irrelevant or OK : "" It looked as if someone out trick - or - treating has thrown a can of red paint on her . ""
It was dubbed "" firework fashion "" , "" definitely a lava - lamp look with a volcanic nod to her husband 's Hawaii "" .
"" It looked like it was made from velvet , satin , Spandex and Elmo muppet fur ! ""
One blogger complained that she could hardly listen to Obama 's speech "" for fear of that dress "" ; another accused its Cuban - American designer of duping his hapless client into wrapping herself in the Cuban revolutionary flag .
At no time would what she wore be more significant than on the night of November 4 2008 , when , win or lose , the eyes of the world would be upon the Obama family as the four of them processed on to the stage in Grant Park , Chicago .
If Michelle had dressed herself and her daughters for defeat , she could hardly have chosen anything more saturnine .
Seven - year - old Sasha was dressed from head to foot in black : black dress , black hose , black shoes .
Ten - year - old Malia was just as black about the legs , but her dress was blood - red .
Any colour is better than pink , but these robust choices hardly strike one as girly .
The girls ' odd outfits were clearly chosen as foils to their mother 's dress , which was all black with an eye - burning red panel that splattered itself down the front like a geometrical haemorrhage , held in by a criss - cross sash of black .
The red extended upwards almost to the neckline , and downwards to mid - thigh , petering out top and bottom in a sort of cast - off splatter .
The effect of the strong contrast was to turn a mere frock into a poster in the most disturbing colours known to man , the colours of chaos .
The juxtaposition of a rectangle of red on a black field is what we might expect to find on a flag or a shield .
Coral snakes and venomous spiders signal their destructive potential by the display of similarly violent contrasts .
For several years , Michelle has been listed among the world 's best - dressed people .
In the 69th poll run by Vanity Fair to establish the International Best Dressed list for this year , she came top of the women .
There is no possibility that her choice of election - night dress reflected mere inadvertence - because in a presidential campaign , nothing is left to chance .
Even her decision to wear dresses - as distinct from suits , whether with pants or skirts - was calculated to foreground her femininity .
Her kitten heels make sure that her bigger head never out - tops her husband 's .
Curiously , at the same time as the fashion press is lauding her relationships with designers , Michelle has been at pains to emphasise that she shops downmarket .
In June , when she was invited to guest - host an NBC talk show , she chose a Donna Ricco black and white "" tank leaf print dress "" in stretch cotton sateen , which sold off the peg in selected boutiques for $ 148 and online for a mere $ 99 .
Within a day , the dress had sold out and women were queueing up to place orders for the reissue .
In October , Michelle told Jay Leno that the three - piece yellow ensemble she was wearing on his show was from J Crew ( total cost about $ 450 ) .
Historically , Michelle was much less likely to be seen wearing Donna Ricco or J Crew .
The purple silk sheath dress that she teamed with a black Azzedine Alaïa belt for her appearance at her husband 's side when he won the Democratic nomination was by Chicago - based Maria Pinto .
That dress earned universal praise for its elegance , boldness and simplicity , though some jibbed at its sleevelessness .
For election night , Michelle went further upmarket .
Her sensational dress was designed by Narciso Rodriguez for his next spring / summer collection .
The original is at least eight inches shorter than the Obama version , and the neckline a good six inches lower .
The splash of red , rather than pouring halfway down the thigh , ends above the crotch and extends from hip to hip , with a small flare on each breast , avoiding entirely the butcher 's apron effect .
The Grant Park version of this cute and sexy dress was a travesty .
Rodriguez is saying nothing .
We may never know if he agreed to wreck his design by customising it for Michelle - or how he felt when he saw that she was wearing it with a black cardigan .
The Obama organisation used to be proud to tell us that Michelle does n't have a stylist .
I bet she does now ."
2008-11-18,"At least one source of domestic strife is to be banished from the Obama White House : Barack Obama is under pressure to give up his beloved BlackBerry .
Aides worry his email could get hacked and , no less serious , all presidential correspondence is meant to be retained for posterity .
They reportedly want to do what Michelle Obama - who was recently spotted slapping her husband 's hand as he checked email during his daughters ' soccer game - has probably itched to do for years : grab the machine out of Obama 's tightly curled fist , shove it in a drawer and lock it away for ever .
As someone who has wrestled with CrackBerry addiction myself , I want to reassure the new president that he can get through this .
He needs to focus on the positive : now , at last , time off really will be time off .
On long journeys , he can gaze out of the window , rather than have his head down , glued to a little screen .
Family time really will be family time , not just hours spent with his body present but his mind still at work .
He will find his mental batteries start recharging , the creative thoughts flowing again - because , with the BlackBerry gone , he will be able to step off the hamster wheel and think .
I want to say all those things and yet I hesitate .
For the President of the United States may be the one person in the world who really does need a BlackBerry .
Not because he is so important and therefore must be able to deal with issues instantly : that was true of his predecessors in the non - BlackBerry era and somehow they managed .
No , Obama needs a BlackBerry so that he can have at least one line out to the real world , a source of information - and casual communication with friends -
that does not have to first pass through the filter of his advisers .
Most of us would have more human contact if we gave up our BlackBerries : Obama may be a rare case of the reverse ."

2008-11-19,"Michelle Obama 's fashion savvy may earn her a spot on a future cover of Vogue magazine .
But her political influence has already won over Bellingham , Washington based publishing company Bluewater Productions , which plans to feature the future first lady in the third book of its Female Force comic book series .
The quarterly publication showcases women who are pioneers in modern history .
Michelle Obama joins female forces Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin , whose biographical comic books will be released early next year as part of the series .
Even though Michelle Obama has yet to move into the White House , and Clinton and Palin fell short of their political goals in 2008 , Bluewater 's president , Darren Davis , thinks the three women have forever changed US politics .
"" They 've changed the way people look at government , "" he said .
"" Nobody ever thought there would be a female president .
Nobody ever thought there would be an African - American first lady .
Nobody ever thought there would be a female vice president , aside from Geraldine Ferraro .
( They 've ) really changed society , so in 2012 we really could have a female president . ""
The book will follow Michelle Obama from her youth on Chicago 's South Side to her career as a lawyer , through the 2008 presidential campaign and Election Day .
It is scheduled to be released in April 2009 .
Bluewater 's final Female Force book of 2009 will feature Caroline Kennedy , rounding out the political theme .
For 2010 's books , Bluewater is planning on featuring influential woman in the media , like Barbara Walters , Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart ."
2009-01-02,"One of the world 's top climate scientists has written a personal new year appeal to Barack and Michelle Obama , warning of the "" profound disconnect "" between public policy on climate change and the magnitude of the problem .
With less than three weeks to go until Obama 's inauguration , Professor James Hansen , who heads Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , asked the recently appointed White House science adviser Professor John Holdren to pass the missive directly to the president - elect .
In it , he praises Obama 's campaign rhetoric about "" a planet in peril "" , but says that how the new president acts in office will be crucial .
Hansen lambasts the current international approach of setting targets through "" cap and trade "" schemes as not up to the task .
"" This approach is ineffectual and not commensurate with the climate threat .
It could waste another decade , locking in disastrous consequences for our planet and humanity , "" the letter from Hansen and his wife , Anniek , reads .
The letter will make uncomfortable reading for officials in 10 US states whose cap and trade mechanism - the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - got under way yesterday .
The scheme is the first mandatory , market - based greenhouse gas reduction programme in the US .
Hansen advocates a three - pronged attack on the climate problem .
First , he wants a phasing out of coal - fired power stations - which he calls "" factories of death "" - that do not incorporate carbon capture .
"" Nobody realistically expects that the large readily available pools of oil and gas will be left in the ground .
Caps will not cause that to happen - caps only slow the rate at which the oil and gas are used .
The only solution is to cut off the coal source , "" the Hansens wrote .
Second , he proposes a "" carbon tax and 100 % dividend "" .
This is a mechanism for putting a price on carbon without raising money for government coffers .
The idea is to tax carbon at source , then redistribute the revenue equally among taxpayers , so that high carbon users are penalised while low carbon users are rewarded .
Finally , he urges a renewed research effort into so - called fourth generation nuclear plants , which can use nuclear waste as fuel .
Hansen argues that the current emphasis on reduction targets combined with carbon trading schemes make it too easy for countries to wriggle out of their commitments .
He cites the example of Japan 's increasing coal use , which it has offset by buying credits from China through the clean development mechanism - an instrument set up by the Kyoto protocol - yet China 's emissions have continued to increase rapidly .
China has overtaken the US as the biggest polluter in the world .
Hansen has been one of the most prominent advocates of action to tackle climate change since he first spoke on the issue in the 1980s .
His testimony to the Senate featured in Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth and he has received numerous honours for his work on the issue , including the WWF 's top conservation award .
Professor 's wish list •
Moratorium on and phasing out of coal power stations without carbon capture
, what Hansen calls the "" sine qua non for solving the climate problem "" .
Coal CO2 emissions are the same as those of other fossil fuels combined .
•
Raising the price of emissions via a "" carbon tax and 100 % dividend "" .
This is a tax mechanism to "" decarbonise "" the economy without a net take from taxpayers .
Low carbon users are rewarded while high users are punished .
•
Urgent research on "" fourth generation "" nuclear power with international co - operation .
This offers one of the best options for nearly carbon - free power , according to Hansen .
It would also help to solve the nuclear waste problem by using that material as fuel ."
2009-01-06,"The Obamas settled into their first day in Washington yesterday , with daughters Sasha and Malia attending their new school and the president - elect trying to inject a sense of urgency into congressional ­leaders about tackling the recession .
The first family took up residence in the capital early , staying at the historic Hay - Adams hotel opposite the White House , so the children could start school on time .
Michelle Obama , who flew into Washington with the girls on Saturday , with the president - elect following a day later , accompanied Sasha , seven , to the Sidwell Friends school 's campus in Bethesda , Maryland , on the outskirts of the capital .
She then took Malia , 10 , to the main Sidwell campus in the city .
Barack Obama 's team released pictures of the family in their hotel suite dressed for school .
The president - elect left three hours later in a motorcade to Capitol Hill for talks on his economic stimulus package in Congress , which starts today .
In keeping with his campaign promise to adopt a bipartisan approach , he met Democratic and Republican leaders .
He had pressed Congress to have a bill ready for signing on his desk on 20 January but congressional leaders dampened his hopes , saying there was little prospect of such a bill being ready before the middle of February . ""
The reason we 're here today is because the people 's business ca n't wait , "" Obama told reporters .
His proposals , not surprisingly , were welcomed by the Democrats .
Republican leaders gave a mixed response , saying they welcomed proposed tax cuts but were concerned about the overall size of his stimulus package .
Obama is proposing a package totalling between $ 675bn ( £ 462bn ) and $ 775bn , of which up to $ 300bn would be in tax cuts .
Single workers are to receive $ 500 each in cuts , while businesses will get in total more than $ 100bn of the funding .
The scale of the proposed tax cuts will disappoint some liberals , who have been looking for huge New Deal infrastructure projects that would help create jobs .
While the economy is Obama 's top priority , other problems are beginning to pile up , including finding a replacement as commerce secretary for Bill Richardson , who withdrew from the post on Sunday because of an investigation into a business deal in his home state of New Mexico , where he is the governor .
One of the few other remaining vacancies – head of the CIA – was filled yesterday .
Democratic officials said Obama had chosen Leon Panetta , former White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton and a Democratic congressman .
In an early taste of troubles ahead with Congress , Dianne Feinstein , the Democratic chair of the Senate select committee , was dismissive of Obama 's choice of Panetta .
Saying she had not been informed of the selection , she hinted she was unhappy over his lack of experience : "" My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best - served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time . ""
Retired admiral Dennis Blair is Obama 's choice to be director of national intelligence , according to Democratic officials .
The Obamas take up occupancy of the White House at midday on 20 January .
The president - elect was in nostalgic mood on the plane taking him to Washington after locking up the family home in Chicago on Sunday . ""
Malia 's friend had dropped off an album of the two of them together , "" Obama said .
"" They had been friends since preschool and I just looked through the pages and the house was empty and it was a little tough , it got me . """
2009-01-07,"Out for the Obamas There were reports the American commentator Ann Coulter had to have her mouth wired shut after breaking her jaw , but it was n't going to keep her quiet for long .
Her new book - Guilty :
Liberal "" Victims "" and their Assault on America - is out next week and , among many other things , she attacks Michelle Obama 's dress sense : "" Her obvious imitation of Jackie O 's style ... would have been laughable if done by anyone other than a media - designated saint . ""
Coulter also continues to refer to "" B Hussein Obama "" , to ensure we do n't forget the president elect has an Islamic heritage .
Because , obviously , Muslims are evil .
Do n't you think the world is brightened by such a satirist as Coulter ?
Because she ca n't genuinely be such a lunatic .
Can she ?

2009-01-16,"Woman 's Hour ( Radio 4 ) is always strong but yesterday it was superb .
Beginning with an analysis of what the first lady 's role has been in the White House , and what it might be in the form of Michelle Obama , it moved on to an incisive discussion of what Mrs Obama 's husband might do for women when president , with host Jenni Murray in total command of the details of US legislation .
This could easily have filled the whole programme , but there was much more to fit in - an interview with the young engineer , Emily Cummins , who has built a fridge powered by sunshine ; a chat with Edna O'Brien about Byron ( in which Murray cast impartiality to the wind and chipped in with an outraged , "" He was appalling ...
He had them living in a menage a trois , competing to see who could be most passionate ! "" ) ; and a discussion with Harriet Wistrich of Justice for Women on the importance of the new bill before parliament that proposes a defence for people ( usually women ) who kill after enduring sustained abuse .
At the end of her segment Edna O'Brien gasped , "" Oh , how quick !
It 's over - there were other things I wanted to say ! ""
"" That 's always the way , "" said Murray ."
2009-01-20,"Michelle Obama got dressed today knowing that every thread of the outfit she picked for the moment she became first lady would be forensically inspected for meaning .
Her choice was a dress and coat in Swiss wool lace , lined in French silk , designed by a Cuban - American fashion designer , Isabel Toledo , and made by a team of Chinese , Polish and Spanish seamstresses in Toledo 's New York studio .
As the images were beamed around the world , the colour was being described by many commentators as gold , with all the regal connotations of that colour ; the New York Times , however , judged it to be the rather more subtle and sophisticated shade of lemon grass .
Toledo herself , who only knew for sure that her outfit had made the cut when she saw it on CNN today , described it as an "" optimistic "" colour , that "" had sunshine "" .
The bold choices that characterised her campaign wardrobe made Michelle Obama a fashion icon even before the election .
Today was her first attempt to blend her own , very modern image with the venerated position of first lady .
Stung , perhaps , by the lukewarm reception to the daring black - and - red dress she wore on election night ( one wit described that as "" an apron designed by Mark Rothko "" ) she seemed to lean a little too heavily on recent precedent today .
In her richly textured lace , and abiding by a now old - fashioned convention of a matching dress and coat , Obama appeared to be "" channelling "" the stately look favoured by Barbara and Laura Bush on state occasions , rather than the sleek , pared down image of Jackie Kennedy , to whom she has often been compared .
What lifted the outfit were the accessories : sleek leather gloves ( which she used to hold the Bible during her husband 's swearing in ) and Jimmy Choo pumps in a smartly offbeat shade of olive .
From a fashion - watcher 's perspective , it was Malia and Sasha Obama who stole the show today .
Not even Aretha Franklin 's spectacular hat could compete with a virtuoso display of on - trend colour - blocking by the first daughters , in their contrasting coats and scarves .
Malia , 10 , looked terrific in electric blue and black while Sasha , 7 , hit it out of the park in this season 's hot orange - and - pink colour combination .
You heard it here first : orange and pink is the new red , white and blue ."

It was the first of 10 ball appearances for the Obamas ; by the end of the night the plainly exhausted first couple were running on fumes , and wrapped up their evening two hours ahead of schedule , at 12.45am .
What 's happening today :
The Obamas and the Bidens are at a traditional post - inauguration prayer service at the National Cathedral right now , but after that , it 's a busy day of administration business .
Obama is due to meet with the joint chiefs of staff to discuss Iraq and Afghanistan -- General David Petraeus is coming back from Iraq to join in -- and with his economic advisers .
The Obamas will also hold an "" open house "" reception at the White House ( the guests include ordinary supporters , but tickets were distributed some time ago now ) and we expect Robert Gibbs 's first briefing as White House press secretary , though as of yesterday he was still trying to figure out how to use his computer .
The Geithner hearings continue , and there 'll be a formal vote on Hillary Clinton 's nomination as Secretary of State , which she 's expected to win easily .
Down to business : As an initial measure , Obama seeks a 120-day halt to legal proceedings at Guantanamo Bay , and halts all the last - minute new regulations the Bush administration was putting through , so that he can review them .

2009-01-22,
2009-01-22,"On Tuesday , Michelle Obama became first lady .
By yesterday morning , she had a new title , courtesy of the Washington Post : the leader of the fashionable world .
The level of interest in her wardrobe goes way beyond that of recent first ladies .
The American people may have been very fond of Laura Bush , but they did n't want to dress like her .
Some first ladies matter , sartorially speaking , and some do n't , and
not since Jackie Kennedy has a first lady mattered this much .
It does n't hurt that Michelle is young , tall and good - looking .
But there is more to it than that .
She looks wonderful in a totally different way from any previous first lady , and that matters .
The image of a 6 ft tall black woman walking down Pennsylvania Avenue and into the White House symbolises the fact that things really can change for the better , and sometimes sooner than we hoped .
Right now , that is a message we all want to hear , which is perhaps why we 're so obsessed with all things Michelle .
Barack Obama used his inauguration speech to show us he has stomach for the fight ahead , and he expects the same of us .
With hindsight , I guess it was dumb to think he was going to stand up there and announce he had found $ 700bn dollars down the back of the White House sofa , and called in a favour from the Almighty to have the ice - caps refrozen .
Still .
We want , we need the Obamas to make our hearts sing .
And that 's where Michelle comes in .
For the ceremony , she dressed herself and her daughters in a riot of glorious , vibrant , unexpected colour .
Her coat and dress were a glinting , greenish - gold .
( We 're calling it lemongrass , or maybe citrine . )
They were a daring choice even before she added the avocado leather gloves and clashing bottle - green patent shoes .
Malia , the elder daughter , wore periwinkle blue and black , overturning once and for all the old wives ' tale that blue and black do n't work together .
Sasha - the sassy little one - wore tangerine with candy pink , which really should n't work but just totally , totally did .
The shades were in themselves a neat celebration of a black first family - not many white skin tones could carry off a tangerine scarf , after all - and the contrast with Laura Bush in her cool , patrician seal - grey was positively joyous .
No less telling than the clothes themselves were the labels inside them .
Michelle 's coat and dress for the ceremony were by Isabel Toledo , a 47-year - old Cuban - American designer who is well known to fashion insiders but has almost no profile among the public .
On a day when titans of American fashion from Oscar de la Renta to Donna Karan were falling over themselves to dress her , Michelle chose a designer who is hugely respected within the industry but whose advertising budget stands at zero dollars .
When it came to getting changed for the evening , she appeared in a one - shoulder ivory gown by Jason Wu , a 26-year - old Taipei - born , American - based designer whose name was previously known only to close readers of those New Hot Names To Watch lists in fashion magazines .
"" Our minds are no less inventive , "" her husband told us on Tuesday , "" than when this crisis began . ""
By showcasing little - known American designers of diverse heritage , the new first lady deftly illustrated both the depth of talent and endeavour in the huge American fashion industry , and her skill as a cheerleader for it .
The shoes for both events were Jimmy Choo ; the bold jewellery - huge cocktail rings , long drop earrings - an extension of the fondness for statement jewellery she displayed during the election campaign .
It takes a woman who understands the power of clothes to create two fashion moments out of one day , which is what Michelle Obama did .
For the ceremony she presented a happy family in a bright colours ; for the evening ball , with the children in bed , she gave us the newlywed image of a dark - suited man taking to the dancefloor with his bride in floor - length ivory , on the first day of a new chapter in their lives .
The first look is about modernity , optimism for our children 's future ; the second is about eternal values , vows and promises .
She knows what she 's doing , this lady .
In fashion , at least , our future is in safe hands ."
2009-01-23,"It is obvious which woman is expected to be a key - if unofficial - adviser to the new US president , and from her Princeton education to her green leather gloves , we know plenty about the first lady , Michelle Obama .
But other women are set to be central to Barack Obama 's White House too , including well - known figures such as Hillary Clinton , Valerie Jarrett and Jill Biden .
Some consider Obama to be a distinctly feminist choice of president - the current cover of Ms magazine depicts him in a T - shirt with the slogan , "" This is what a feminist looks like . ""
But questions have also been asked about whether he has made enough female appointments ; only five of the 20 cabinet - level posts in his administration have been given to women .
One commentator sniffed that "" the numbers really are n't any more impressive than [ those of ] any other previous president "" .
Is this a new era for women in US politics then ?
We shall have to wait and see .
For now , what the women of the current Obama White House may lack in quantity , they will , we hope , make up for in quality .
Hillary Clinton , secretary of state Clinton , of course , needs no introduction .
At 61 , she has given up her Senate seat after eight years , and has a lot to prove in her new role .
Doubts linger over whether she is too independent or ambitious to be secretary of state , which has been called "" the second most prestigious job in the country "" .
Will she be able to achieve what she wants while hovering in second place ?
Or is she just biding her time until another presidential bid ?
Also , can she keep that pesky husband in check ?
Whatever happens , she will be fascinating to watch .
Jill Biden , second lady
The 57-year - old wife of vice president Joe Biden was the unsung hero of the presidential election , and although she does n't have an official political role in the Obama White House , she promises to be a high - profile role model for working women .
A mother of three and grandmother of five , she worked a four - day week as an English teacher in Delaware until last December , and was seen marking school work on the campaign bus .
She is currently looking for a teaching job in Washington .
Biden is originally from Pennsylvania , where her father was a banker and her mother stayed at home to bring up five daughters , of whom Jill was the eldest .
She took her first job at the age of 15 , and said in an interview in 2007 that she "" wanted my own money , my own identity , my own career "" .
Wary of marrying into politics , she only agreed to marry Joe after he had proposed five times .
Biden is known as discreet , loyal and principled : many of her school colleagues were surprised to discover that her husband was a senator - she had n't mentioned it .
What else ?
She has two master 's degrees and a doctorate , runs five miles a day , used to be a model , and set up a breast cancer charity in honour of four of her friends .
Janet Napolitano , homeland security secretary Napolitano , 51 , is a New York - born Italian American , and former governor of Arizona , with a background in law .
A fighter and an idealist , she was diagnosed with breast cancer while attorney general of Arizona , and famously gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention three weeks after a mastectomy .
Napolitano is single , and is not exactly an advocate of work - life balance - she reportedly often works 19 - 20 hour days .
But do n't let that put you off .
A huge basketball fan , she also loves whitewater rafting and hiking , and has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro .
Susan Rice , UN ambassador Rice , 44 , a mother of two , is a Rhodes scholar who became the youngest ever assistant secretary of state - in Bill Clinton 's administration - and the first African - American woman to be US ambassador to the UN .
Unapologetically ambitious , she most recently acted as senior foreign policy adviser to Obama and is not afraid to speak frankly about conflict in Africa or the need for military intervention .
( This does n't necessarily make her a hawk .
She supported Obama because of his stance against the Iraq war . )
Supporters call her "" brilliant "" .
Critics , however , describe her as "" inflexible "" .
Hilda Solis , labour secretary Born in California to parents who came from Nicaragua and Mexico , Solis , 51 , was the third of seven children and helped raise her younger siblings , before going on to become the first Hispanic woman to serve in the state senate .
Described as having "" patience , passion and guts "" , she is known for her devotion to environmental causes .
Solis was originally a supporter of Hillary Clinton , and Obama actively sought her on his ticket because of her appeal to Hispanic voters .
Her appointment is seen as a sign that Obama supports "" green jobs "" - and wo n't put environmental issues on hold just because of the economic climate .
Lisa Jackson , Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA )
chief
The first African - American head of the EPA , Jackson , 46 , is a Princeton - educated chemical engineer and was , most recently , commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection .
Amidst general optimism about Obama 's choices , Jackson 's appointment has been harshly criticised , with detractors saying that she has a "" disastrous record "" , and one report claiming that she failed to use her authority to speed up the cleaning process in seven toxic waste sites in New Jersey .
She is seen as a member of Obama 's inner circle .
Valerie Jarrett , senior adviser Known variously as "" Barack 's rock "" , "" the other half of Obama 's brain "" and "" the female version of Barack "" , Jarrett , 52 , is one of the Obamas ' closest friends and is now a senior adviser - the only woman in a team of four .
She responded gracefully to mealy - mouthed concerns this week that Michelle Obama is too outspoken to be first lady , saying that she "" would call her thoughtful , honest and candid "" .
Jarrett has been close to the family since July 1991 when she hired Michelle to work for her in the offices of Chicago mayor Richard Daley .
The meeting was fateful : Jarrett has said that she felt that she "" had "" to hire the future first lady ( at that time , Michelle Robinson ) because their backgrounds and life choices were so similar .
Both women gave up promising careers in corporate law in exchange for jobs where they hoped to "" make a difference "" .
Jarrett has an impressive track record : she has chaired the Chicago Stock Exchange and retains her title as CEO of Chicago real estate management and development giant
The Habitat Company where she has worked for more than a decade .
Her role in the Obama administration is shrouded with mystery .
Insiders describe her as the ultimate big - sister figure for Obama , a sounding board , unofficial strategist and brilliant diplomat .
After a short - lived marriage to her childhood sweetheart ( who died shortly after their divorce ) , she was a single parent to her daughter Laura , now 22 and at Harvard Law School .
Looking at the White House on Tuesday , she said , "" You have to pinch yourself to think that that 's home . ""
Desiree Rogers , White House social secretary Rogers , 49 , is a communications powerhouse who has worked in everything from the energy sector to the arts .
An arch networker and possible fashion rival to Michelle , she has been interviewed for the February issue of US Vogue .
The Obamas are nothing less than old family friends : Rogers 's ex - husband played basketball with Michelle 's brother .
She has a reputation as the ultimate hostess and is very much a part of the Chicago socio - political scene , where her closest friends include Oprah Winfrey and Valerie Jarrett .
Rogers regularly tops lists of the most powerful African - American women in the US and her favourite saying is apparently : "" Laissez les bon temps rouler . ""
( Let the good times roll . )
From now on she is responsible for every White House social event ."
2009-01-24,"As first weeks go , the first lady 's star could hardly have shone brighter .
With a green - gloved hand holding the Bible her husband used to take the oath , Michelle Obama took charge of her role .
Her first 100 hours in the White House saw her lauded for her choice of inauguration outfits - pale yellow for day , striking one - shouldered design for the evening 's balls - and her openness .
After that dazzling debut , the rest of the week was decidedly non - glamorous as the pattern of Michelle 's life began to take shape .
Daughters Malia and Sasha went back to school on Thursday and Michelle went back to her packing crates , the White House said .
"" Her primary focus this week is getting the kids settled .
She is focused entirely on getting unpacked and getting the kids up and running , "" said her spokeswoman , Katie McCormick Lelyveld .
That projection of a down - to - earth first lady is crucial to Michelle Obama 's successful navigation of the entirely uncharted terrain as the first African - American first lady .
Much is expected of her in a role circumscribed by tradition .
"" There will be expectations heaped upon her that maybe will not have been heaped upon first ladies in the past , "" said Kuae Mattox , a spokeswoman for Mocha Moms , an organisation for black stay - at - home mothers .
Mattox said there was pressure on Obama to offer up her family as a role model , and to raise issues of the financial disparities between black and white families as well as the achievement gap for African - American children .
Since arriving in Washington , Michelle has spent her days taking the girls to school and supervising homework .
She has moved her widowed mother , Marian Robinson , from Chicago to the White House to help with the transition .
The focus on family has disappointed some women , who complain about the "" mummy - fication of Michelle "" .
Michelle redefined herself on the campaign trail from high - powered corporate lawyer to wife and mother after she was accused of being unpatriotic and overly critical of her husband .
She gave up her job at the University of Chicago hospitals and said her job as first lady would be as a mother .
But those who know her from Chicago do not expect her to remain on the sidelines for long .
What happens next depends on her .
She has repeatedly expressed an interest in highlighting issues of work - life balance , and also to do something for military spouses .
What she does not intend to do is weigh in on policy , said Valerie Jarrett , an adviser to the president in an interview this week .
"" What she often says is , look , my husband 's surrounded by experts in the field .
I 'm not looking to be the foreign policy expert .
I have plenty to do with my role , "" said Jarrett .

2009-01-26,"Michelle Obama , first lady of fashion , etc and so forth .
But is n't the real style icon in this crew Jill Biden ?
Charlotte Dove , by email
That 's right everyone - a mere six days after the event , Ask Hadley is having an Obama special !
First with the news !
Only 144 hours after everyone else !
And so to Jill : I am so with you , Charlotte , she is totally our go - to girl for fashion thrills .
Oh , calm down .
In this Dawn of a New Newspaper Headline Cliche , etc , etc it is , of course , heretical to criticise Barack and anyone who has ever possibly claimed a tenuous connection to him , even if he did actually give quite a disappointing inauguration speech but , um , in a really good way .
And yes , Michelle is a fine - looking woman , although some of us might suspect that has more to do with her innate fine - looking - ness than the bright clothes she puts on the fine - ness .
Man , with a figure like that she 'd have to work hard to look bad and , really , what with all the walking on water the Obamas are doing these days , she just does n't have time for such nonsense .
But in short , I think we 're getting the measure of the Michelle modus operandi
: she likes dresses , she likes brights and she is not afraid of an odd shape .
Let 's see how much we can milk this for over the next eight ( fingers damn well crossed ) years .
Jill , however , is a relatively overlooked proposition for us to claim as our own .
Like Michelle , Jill is - and I 'm going to use the Latin techical term , so hang on tight - a lookeritus .
This can be translated as "" several types of awesome and pretty rocking with it "" .
This is obviously of enormous assistance in looking good .
But I am enormously taken by Jill 's waspy look in general .
The woman is a J Crew catalogue made flesh , a Gap advert who walks among us .
Her personality ( if you have n't seen the YouTube clip of her unembarrassedly embarrassing her husband on Oprah , you really have n't lived .
Literally , have not lived ) and her back story
( she 's the second wife who brought love and happiness back into the widowed Biden 's life - like , so Jane Eyre !
Sorta ! ) definitely affect this column 's judgment about our Jill and her style , and quite right , too .
That is why lovely Michelle looked fabulous in her matching yellow dress and coat combo , and Nancy Reagan - who often wore something similar - looked like a witch .
It also explains why I can not make up my mind about Laura Bush 's outfit for inauguration day , not because the woman lacks personality , but because her face was looking suspiciously smooth and , um , tight .
Seriously , her eyes now look like Cartman from South Park when he gets angry with Kyle , like two inverted Pac - Mans .
Laura :
no amount of self - mutilation will ever atone for the sins of your husband .
I 'm concerned that we are now going to spend the next four years reading about how well the Obama daughters dress .
Is n't there something kind of weird talking about the fashion sense of two girls under 11 ?
Joanna Marks , by email Depends on who you 're talking to , Joanna .
If you 're talking to a slightly creepy gentleman who is a little too knowledgable about the wardrobes of the Obama girls , then , yes , there is something kinda weird going on .
If , however , you are talking to a level - headed friend or , say , journalist , who is merely expressing aesthetic appreciation for what Michelle picks out for her daughters to wear , then I fail to see any need to call child protection services .
There are a lot of well - dressed children kicking around these days :
Suri Cruise ; Violet Affleck ( daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner ) ; the Biden grandchildren ( obviously ) , just for example , and I feel it would be downright rude to their parents not to note how fabulously these small children co - ordinate their pie - crust blouses with their extensive range of bright shifts , woolly tights and mary - jane shoes .
I do , however , hold up my hand and shout "" whoa "" at the idea of buying designer clothes for children ( Do you want to raise a Paris Hilton ? )
and the idea that children should be described as "" style icons "" .
Seriously , have we learned nothing from Liza Minnelli ?
It 's a child , not a chihuahua , ie , not a plaything on which the mother should project her weird dress - up fantasies .
Note how I have not once mentioned Elizabeth Hurley and her fondness for dressing her son Damian like Little Lord Fauntleroy .
We are in a new era of tolerance and there is no room for mean sarcasm .
This week ."
2009-01-29,"Perhaps because they are the parents of two little girls , but the Obamas seem awfully concerned about White House guests breaking stuff .
At a White House reception for Lilly Ledbetter this morning , Michelle Obama told assembled supporters : "" Thank you for joining us today for this important event and welcome to the White House .
Feel free , walk around , touch some stuff , just do n't break anything . ''
The day after the inauguration , the Obamas welcomed 200 members of the public into the White House .
Obama told a young man in a black sweater , "" Welcome , enjoy yourself .
Roam around .
Do n't break anything . ""
The warnings seem at odds with Obama 's relaxing of etiquette strictures in other realms -- dress codes , meeting schedules , for instance ."
2009-01-29,"In a development that should finally silence those sneerers who suggest that the new regime at the Telegraph has degraded its news values , the august publication today follows up a Perez Hilton post asking :

This was a congressional invitation , not from the White House , to be the main speaker at yesterday 's national prayer breakfast .
Blair is still big box office in the US .
Brown will have his turn when the prez joins the G20 in London on 2 April .
But , as you probably saw , the Obamas were present for yesterday 's breakfast and the president said nice things about "" my good friend "" ( which ca n't actually be true , not yet ) , how he "" did it first and perhaps did it better than I will do "" .
That 's a stretch , too .
It 's not yet clear how history will view the Blair premiership .
As with Bill Clinton , there 's a general sense of missed opportunities , though it 's too soon to say , either at home or abroad .
Those Iraqis , for instance – they had elections last weekend that went off so quietly
you hardly read anything about them .
There again , Blair has had far less impact trying to move the Palestine / Israel peace process forward than he had initially hoped or expected .
Today 's Mail got excited about the 31 references Blair made to God in the course of yesterday 's speech , which warned Obama that he will need "" not cheerleaders but partners , not spectators but supporters "" . ""
So Blair does do God , "" shouted the paper , which always gets overlooked in parliamentary surveys
– the Lords produced a thoughtful one yesterday – on the growth of an intrusive surveillance society .
That misses the point , too : Blair is no longer an elected British public official and can say what he likes .
It was n't him that said he "" did n't do God "" either – it was his atheist bagman , Alastair Campbell .
Blair illustrated residual British disdain for mixing politics and religion – a healthy disdain , says me – by telling his audience that he 'd once wanted to say "" God bless the British people "" at the end of some crisis broadcast .
But officials had slapped him down . ""
Really , prime minister , this is not America , you know . ""
So he said it anyway in Washington yesterday : "" God bless you all . ""
The papers are full of economic gloom and allegations of British complicity in the supression of torture , not to mention alleged Whitehall nudge - nudge briefing against Rachel Reid in the Afghan official secrets case .
Disturbing stuff .
Yet Blair , tanned and trim , wafts serenely above it all .
He touched down in Heathrow just after breakfast , but he 'll be back on the other side of the pond again soon .
He plans to open a US branch of his Faith Foundation to promote religious understanding this year , with Obama 's apparent blessing .
At yesterday 's session , both men apparently quoted near identical passages from the Bible , Qu'ran and Torah to explain how moral law binds together all faiths . ""
Tony and I did n't coordinate here .
There is a little serendipity , "" explained the president .
Ah , a president who uses "" serendipity "" .
I feel better already ."
2009-02-06,"If the election of Barack Obama was to usher in a new age of respect , generosity and cooperation , someone may want to pass on the memo to Etta James .
The soul legend has ripped into Beyoncé , threatening to "" whup [ the singer 's ] ass "" for her inauguration ball rendition of At Last .
Beyoncé performed the song for Barack and Michelle Obama 's first dance , which took place at the ball on 20 January .
"" You guys know your president , right ?
You know the one with the big ears ? ""
James asked from the stage of Seattle 's Paramount Theatre . ""
Wait a minute , he ai n't my president .
He might be yours ; he ai n't my president .
But I tell you that woman he had singing for him , singing my song —
she 's going to get her ass whupped . ""
"" Her song "" was originally written in 1941 , by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren .
Part of the Orchestra Wives musical , At Last first charted in a version by the Glenn Miller orchestra .
Only decades later did it become Etta James 's calling - card – and perhaps her best - known tune .
When Beyoncé played the role of Etta James for last year 's Cadillac Records film , she performed At Last for the soundtrack .
Before the premiere , Beyoncé said James was happy with her rendition . ""
She told me , ' I loved you from the first time you sung , ' "" the 27-year - old told MTV News .
Now , however , things seem to have changed .
During her gig last week , the 70-year - old savaged Beyoncé 's performance . ""
The great Beyoncé , "" James sneered .
"" I ca n't stand Beyoncé .
She has no business up there , singing up there on a big ol' president day , gon na be singing my song that I 've been singing forever . ""
At the time of the serenade , Etta James was dealing with complications from gastric bypass surgery in 2003 .
But she watched the dance on TV , according to the New York Daily News , and told her son that the performance "" was great "" .
"" She was [ just ] a little down that she was n't well enough to be there , "" her son said .
Maybe in the James family , "" a little down "" is code for "" blood - boilingly enraged "" ."
2009-02-10,"From the day after Barack Obama was elected president , Women 's Wear was speculating that wife Michelle might grace the cover of America 's fashion bible , Vogue .
Now it 's official .
Michelle Obama will smile out from newsstands all over the country this March , in a magenta sheath by Jason Wu ( who also designed the first lady 's white , one - shouldered inaugural gown ) .
Photographer of the Queen and Suri Cruise Annie Liebowitz shot the cover and eight - page inside spread , which accompanies an article in which Obama speaks about motherhood - and of course , her personal style .
Every first lady since Lou Hoover ( except for Bess Truman ) has been photographed by the magazine , but Mrs Obama will only be the second to be on the cover .
The first ?
Her husband 's secretary of state , Hillary Clinton ."
2009-02-11,"After confirming yesterday that Michelle Obama would appear on its March cover , Vogue has posted the text of Andre Leon Talley 's interview and a slideshow of the spread .
The first lady is like a one - woman J Crew PR machine .
First she told Jay Leno that "" You can find good stuff online "" - she was wearing a cardigan and skirt from the prepster staple brand .
Then daughters Sasha and Malia were outfitted in Crew Cuts for inauguration day .
Now among the Jason Wu and Narciso Rodriguez dresses is another ensemble from J crew , a salmon cardigan and matching blouse and knubby - tweed , knee length skirt .
The "" Michelle "" cardigan is $ 50 at jcrew.com ."
2009-02-12,"Although Michelle Obama has admitted - shockingly , considering the context - that she is less interested in clothes than politics and children in her upcoming interview in Vogue , after less than a month in the White House she is already proving to wield greater influence over the fashion world than the industry has known in years .
Designer Jason Wu is the most obvious example of her impact .
Just a few weeks ago he was an unknown dressmaker .
Then Michelle wore a white one - shouldered dress he designed to the inauguration ball .
As a result his press office has been swamped with requests for tickets for his show at New York fashion week next week .
The hugely successful UK - based fashion retail website , netaporter.com , is about to start selling Wu 's designs alongside their more established designers , including Givenchy and Alexander McQueen .
Most flattering of all for Wu , the American brand ABS , which makes clever copies of red carpet designs , has already started copying Wu , as well as Isabel Toledo , another relatively little known designer favoured by Obama .
And things can only get better for Wu this month : Obama is wearing a dress by him again on the cover of Vogue .
However , after Vogue 's editor - at - large , André Leon Talley , who also did the interview with Obama in the magazine , went on CNN last night and said that the cover was "" not about her being a fashion icon , we 're not trying to put her on a pedestal "" , Wu might well wonder if a backhanded compliment is still a compliment .
Nonetheless , Obama 's fashion choices are still a matter of national fascination .
In today 's New York Times , Cathy Horyn and Eric Wilson reveal the woman behind Obama 's clothes with a tone of triumphant unmasking not seen in the US press since the revelation of Deep Throat 's identity .
It turns out to be Ikram Goldman , a boutique owner in Chicago , who contacts designers she thinks Obama might like and suggests they make clothes for her based on Obama 's measurements .
Notably , Goldman favours young and relative unknowns , such as Wu and Maria Cornejo , as opposed to the American fashion bigwigs , such as Oscar de la Renta and Michael Kors , much to the old guard 's disapproval .
But surely Michelle should be bigging up the little people ?
Is n't that very Obama - ish ?
After all , as Michelle says in her Vogue interview , "" If I can have a [ style ] impact , I want women to feel good about themselves and to have fun with fashion . ""
Fashion making women feel good about themselves ?
It truly is a new dawn ."
2009-02-12,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 13 February 2009
In the article below we said February 2008 was a bad month for Hillary Clinton because she lost the New Hampshire primary .
In fact she had won that primary the previous month Her husband has broken one barrier by becoming the first black president of America , but Michelle Obama has busted through an even stuffier establishment by appearing on the cover of the next issue of US Vogue .
She is only the second First Lady to appear on the front of the most influential fashion magazine in the world , and the excitement around her appearance a week before it hits the newsstands disproves the theory in the fashion world that black women do n't make for commercial covers .
There is more internet buzz about Annie Leibovitz 's shoot with Obama , a fortysomething , black lawyer , than was ever sparked by the magazine 's current cover girl , Blake Lively , a very slim , twentysomething , white actress .
In an interview inside , Obama talks more about her plans for the White House than her clothes .
At times , the interviewer , Andre Leon Talley , seems embarrassed to ask her about fashion .
He recalls the first time he met her : "" Do I remember what Michelle was wearing ?
Not at all .
What I do remember was how informed she was on so many topics . ""
Although politics might not come to mind when one thinks of US Vogue , its editor , Anna Wintour , has made her leanings well known .
As well as co - hosting fundraisers for Barack Obama during the election , she berated Hillary Clinton in the February 2008 issue for backing out of appearing in the magazine , because , Wintour alleged , she had a "" fear of looking too feminine "" .
Wintour signed off with the memorable line : "" This is America , not Saudi Arabia .
"" It was the start of a bad month for Clinton : she then lost the New Hampshire primary , although it is difficult to know whether voters were swayed more by Obama 's rhetoric or by Wintour 's quip .
Ironically , Clinton was the first First Lady to appear on Vogue 's cover , in 1998 ."
2009-02-15,"Call it the Michelle Obama effect : each time the first lady chooses an outfit for a major event , the reputation of a fashion designer soars .
But the impact of the Michelle look has never been felt as strongly as now .
The public 's fascination with the 45-year - old 's style has put the spotlight on her favourite designers at New York Fashion Week .
One has already hit the catwalk , sending ripples of excitement through the fashion world .
Jason Wu , recently a little - known designer who grew up in Taiwan , has become one of the most talked about names in the industry since Michelle chose his frothy gown for the Neighbourhood Inaugural Ball last month .
Last Friday his new - found reputation was sealed when a standing - room - only audience watched the catwalk show of his autumn / winter collection .
His parents - Jennifer and Hank Wu , who had flown over from Taipeh - were a few seats behind Anna Wintour , editor - in - chief of American Vogue .
After all , here was the designer who had created the pink sheath dress that Michelle wears on the cover of Wintour 's March edition .
"" It 's great to see that you can look powerful without forgoing femininity , "" said Sally Singer , fashion news director of American Vogue .
"" She looks like a grown - up but also looks pretty . "" What is increasingly clear is that the first - lady look is one women want to mimic and retailers want to sell .
Wu said he has had three times as many appointments made by buyers this season - and he is n't the only Michelle favourite making a breakthrough .
Designs by feminine , dressy label Thakoon and chic , minimalist Zero + Maria Cornejo line , who both show tomorrow , were frequently worn by Obama during the presidential campaign and the labels ' profiles have risen from cult status to international recognition .
Michelle wore a Thakoon dress in August 2008 when she joined her husband on stage as he accepted the Democratic nomination .
"" There was a lot of talk about Thakoon then , it was the big deal in all the showrooms , "" said Dickon Bowden , buyer for the London store Dover Street Market which stocks many of Michelle 's favourite designer brands .
"" There 's definitely been an impact , "" added Gabrielle Sirkin , who works for label Zero + Maria Cornejo .
"" We 've had interview requests from editors who do n't normally even attend our show .
We 're also looking to expand our stockists - we 're heading to the UK to look at stores outside London . ""
Singer said the Obama effect works in different ways : "" For Thakoon , she showed his clothes have a life off the catwalk and off fashion girls .
To see this 5 ft 11 in woman looking fabulous in Thakoon is a great sign for retailers .
For Cornejo , Obama gave her fashion credibility . ""
Narciso Rodríguez , a Cuban American designer whose clothes Michelle wore for her husband 's victory speech in November and to attend the "" We Are One "" concert last month , shows on Tuesday .
Proenza Schouler , another American fashion favourite who has gained wider recognition thanks to Michelle 's taste , shows on Wednesday .
Cuban - born designer Isabel Toledo , who created the yellow dress Michelle wore for January 's inauguration ceremony , will not show at fashion week , but a retrospective of her work will be held at New York 's Fashion Institute of Technology in June .
But not all the coverage has been positive .
Ikram Goldman owns the Ikram boutique in the Obamas ' hometown of Chicago and acts as intermediary for most of the first lady 's dealings with designers .
Her boutique stocks the labels with which Michelle has become more associated .
"" It 's strange to think that the wife of the leader of the free world would choose clothes from only one store , when there is a wealth of clothes out there from other designers , "" Arnold Scaasi , a designer who has dressed Hillary Clinton , Jacqueline Kennedy and Barbara Bush , recently told the New York Times But Ikram only influences one part of Michelle 's wardrobe .
She loves the high street , often wearing Gap , H&amp;M and Banana Republic with the designer items .
And while the first lady talks about wearing clothes she loves and that fashion should make women feel good about themselves , she rarely endorses brands .
One of the few endorsements she has given , during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in October 2008 , was to J Crew , a US high - street staple which started as a mail - order catalogue range .
She turned to the audience and said : "" Ladies , we know J Crew .
You can get some good stuff online . ""
In her Vogue shoot , Michelle also models exclusive designs from J Crew 's new lines .
So for those who ca n't afford the designers stepping out in New York it seems there is an altogether cheaper way to achieve the Michelle look .
The world 's greatest asset to designer clothes : the first lady , wearing ...
Jason Wu
The 26-year - old designer , who was born in Taiwan and raised in Canada , started his label , which specialises in pretty dresses , in 2006 , using funds from his family and from a job he has had since the age of 16 creating $ 400 designer dolls for Integrity Toys .
Thakoon
From his first collection in 2004 , Thakoon Panichgul 's label has been beloved by women who like elegant , feminine designs .
Panichgul , 34 , was born in Thailand and raised in the US , working as a fashion writer before launching his label .
Maria Pinto This Chicago - based designer , 51 , has been a long - time favourite for Michelle , who has worn her vibrantly coloured dresses since 2004 .
Pinto started her own business in 1991 but hit the headlines when Michelle wore one of her creations to the Democratic convention .
Narciso Rodriguez
The son of Cuban immigrants , Rodríguez was born in New Jersey in 1961 .
He worked with Calvin Klein and Donna Karan before launching his own label in 1998 .
Best - known of the designers favoured by Obama , his clothes have been worn by Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Winslet .
Zero + Maria Cornejo
Born in Chile , raised in the UK , now living in New York , Maria Cornejo is known for chic suits and elegant designs with an emphasis on draping and silhouette .
She 's worked for UK designer John Richmond and French label Tehen and launched her own line in 1997 ."

2009-02-17,"Michelle Obama is no longer first lady of the United States .
She 's been demoted from wife of the president to the position of mistress â€ “ "" mistress to American fashion "" .
That 's her latest title , handed down by the New York Times 's crack investigative fashion reporters .
They recently made the scandalous allegation that Obama , an attorney and former hospital executive , does not spend the bulk of her time huddling with fashion designers pouring over patterns and fabric swatches .
Instead , she appears to have delegated all fashion mistress responsibility to a Chicago boutique owner named Ikram Goldman .
Sacrilege !
Quick , rescind that Vogue cover !
Americans bristle at the thought of Obama playing any public policy role but enthusiastically foist the fate of the entire multi - billion - dollar fashion industry at her feet .
We do n't want her to use her expertise as a hospital executive to shape healthcare policy but are perfectly happy to demand that she be held responsible for ruling American fashion , a position she never asked for nor expressed any interest in holding .
While I am no fashionista , occasionally I like looking at pretty clothes .
However , the whole "" Michelle Obama fashion goddess "" meme has officially jumped the shark .
Enough already .
This past summer , the fashion editors declared that Obama would be the second coming of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , as if she did n't have her own unique style .
Then these same people declared that Obama would need a makeover , as if there were something wrong with her in the first place .
Next they declared that Obama would single - handedly save the fashion industry , which is odd considering that Obama is an attorney and executive , not a fashion designer , stylist or editor .
No doubt , as first lady , Obama is a walking billboard , an advertiser 's dream .
I had no idea what the heck J Crew 's "" Crewcuts "" was until she dressed her daughters in the line from the shopping mall retailer .
She can drag a struggling fashion designer from obscurity and cause retail websites to crash by donning a dress , a sash , shoes or green leather gloves .
On inauguration night , Michelle Obama Watch , my site about all things Michelle Obama , crashed the hour that Obama 's inaugural ball gown was revealed , as people raced to see "" who "" she was wearing .
The ball gown post has one of the most active comment threads in the history of the blog .
Some comments portrayed her fashion choices as a character flaw that made her unworthy of being first lady .
The Black Artists Association caused a mini uproar when it whined to Women 's Wear Daily that Obama failed to wear any fashions designed by an African - American on inauguration day .
"" It was our day ! ""
Lamented Amnau Eele , the association 's president .
Funny , I thought all that security , pomp and circumstance was about the peaceful transfer of power , not black fashion designers .
It 's not just Obama 's clothes that we 're obsessing over , but her hair , her skin â€ “ even the shape of her rear end .
It 's like a mass public vivisection where we project all of our hopes , dreams , fears , neuroses and psychoses on to one person .
The latest chicanery and foolishness is this shocking revelation that Ikram Goldman is serving as Obama 's fashion gatekeeper .
Its amazing that the New York Times dedicated two reporters to cover this scandal when every other week there appears to be a new story indicating that the newspaper is hurtling toward obsolescence or on the verge of bankruptcy , whichever comes first .
I mean , its not like they should be focusing on the impending collapse of the entire US banking system occurring right in their backyard .
Ultimately , the pouting fashionistas in the New York Times article are n't really upset that Obama has a fashion gatekeeper .
They 're distressed because she does n't have the "" right "" gatekeeper .
By "" right "" I mean a gatekeeper approved by the New York Times fashion writers and the east coast fashion elite .
For all of their braying about exclusion , Obama 's only real transgression is departing from the fashion status quo by selecting lesser - known American designers from diverse backgrounds .
She 's wielding her fashion influence
â€ “ just not in the ways they would like .
I actually find it refreshing to find out that Obama is handing over her fashion mistress duties to someone else .
It shows leadership and professionalism by delegating responsibility for something that is not a priority .
I would expect no less from a former hospital executive who once was her husband 's boss but now is being relegated to being a high - profile mannequin .
Just because the nation is obsessed with what Obama wears does n't mean she has to join us in our obsession by playing the role of national dress - up doll .
The fashion industry should n't be looking to Obama to be their saviour or patron saint .
It 's not her responsibility .
If they want to be saved , they can save themselves ."
2009-02-17,"Dodging the pearls of wisdom cast from old hands is one of the more tiresome aspects of starting a new job .
Michelle Obama , however , might welcome some friendly tips on how to survive the next four years from a woman who spent a decade at the side of one of the most powerful men in the world .
According to Cherie Blair , much of being a good prime minister 's wife - or first lady - boils down to knowing your place and when to bite your tongue .
"" It 's a strange thing , is n't it ? ""
she told the US magazine More . ""
In a world where women are speaking out more , a political wife is almost more disenfranchised .
Once upon a time you could say : ' Well , he 's got his views , and I 've got my views . '
But ... it 's almost like you can not afford to express any separate views . ""
Worse still , she said , the basic partnership of marriage can also fall victim to power struggles once a husband has been elected to high office .
"" Whatever it is you 're doing as first lady , it is not equal to being president of the United States .
Your husband comes home at the end of the day , and you want to say : ' Look , I 've had a hard day too . '
And he says : ' You know , I 've been on the phone to the president of China . '
There is no answer to that , is there ? ""
A circumspect first lady should also remember that while she can have influence , "" she can not be seen to have power "" , she added .
"" She needs to identify causes that she wants to take on but from an angle that is n't the hard policy angle . """
2009-02-24,"She is the world 's most famous celebrity photographer , whose portfolio contains some of the most iconic images of the past 30 years , not least the glamorous pictures of Michelle Obama on the latest cover of Vogue .
As such Annie Leibovitz is hardly the kind of person you would normally associate with going to a pawn - broker .
But it seems that in these unusual times even the likes of Leibovitz need to find cash in unusual places .
The photographer has turned to a company called Art Capital that specialises in lending money with fine art as the collateral .
The New York Times disclosed yesterday that Leibovitz has borrowed about $ 15 m ( £ 10 m ) from the firm in two tranches .
Records show she secured the loan partly against property , but also by putting up as collateral the copyright , negatives and contract rights to every photograph she has ever taken or will take in future until the loans are paid off .
Such an exceptional step , involving in essence the pawning of her entire life 's work , may in Leibovitz 's case be explained by the tumultuous few years she has been through .
Her long - time friend Susan Sontag died in 2004 , and she has been in costly litigation over the renovation of some of her properties .
But Leibovitz is part of a wider trend that Art Capital and other specialist lending institutions like it say has intensified since the start of the global economic crisis last autumn .
Wealthy individuals and institutions have increasingly turned to the firm for help – numbers have risen by 30 % to 40 % since before the crash .
"" What 's amazing is that individuals and institutions who previously we thought were untouchable are being deeply affected .
People who were truly enormous financially are now scrambling , "" said Ian Peck , joint owner of Art Capital .
The numbers tell the story .
Art Capital expects to make about $ 120 m in loans against art this year , up from about $ 80 m in 2008 .
Some of that has gone out to several hedge - fund managers , hit by the Wall Street collapse , who have put up striking contemporary and modern art works .
The company 's offices , which are located next door to the designer Vera Wang 's wedding dress showroom in Madison Avenue , resemble one of New York 's more select art galleries , which to some extent is what it is .
Currently on display are a set of black and white photographs from the 1930s and 40s by the Magnum photographer Ernst Haas , as well as a room full of Old Masters including 17th century works by the French painter Simon Vouet and Francisco de Zurbarán from Spain .
Among the art works that have recently been taken in by the company , and put into secure and climate controlled specialist art warehouses for safekeeping , are pieces by Willem de Kooning , Mark Rothko , Andy Warhol , Henry Moore and even Picasso .
Cash - strapped clients have borrowed money against vintage film posters , antique teddy bears and valuable scientific instruments .
Peck has also witnessed casualties of the recent spate of Ponzi schemes – fraudulent pyramid scams – come pleading for help with art collections as collateral .
But in these most desperate of cases , he said , the company would rarely become involved .
"" If someone is at death 's door financially , we ca n't help them .
Several times a month we see refugees from Ponzi schemes ; their stocks are gone ,
the money 's gone and they are looking at their hard assets .
"" The spike in business to financial firms that lend against art is being reported across the US .
Other prominent artists have also become involved in using their own work to generate funds , including the film director Julian Schnabel .
ArtLoan , a company specialising in this work in San Francisco , told the New York Times its growth in the last year had been "" exponential "" .
Another New York outlet , Fine Art Finance , deals with clients who can put up art and antiques valued at a minimum of $ 2 m .
It lends up to $ 100 m for up to 20 years .
Firms like ArtLoan and Art Capital typically lend out 40 % of the value of the art works they take in , making most of their profit by charging interest of 6 % to 18 % .
Peck said only about one in 10 of the deals end in default .
"" Our aim is to avoid defaulting at all costs .
Given the trouble involved in a default , it 's better karma and business not to . ""
Even if the works are not sold , and remain in the client 's ownership awaiting their return in better economic times , Peck admits that this is intensely emotive stuff .
"" It 's akin to giving up your home , particularly for people who have built up collections over many years .
People do n't feel emotionally about stocks and bonds , but they certainly do over art . ""
In the case of Leibovitz , Peck insists that very few places could have coped with her request for money based on her images .
"" We 're pleased to have her as a client and it 's a very good fit .
We are one of the few –
if not the only – lender who could have valued her body of work ; that 's a fairly esoteric thing to value . ""

The Obama family will be getting a dog in April .
The much - anticipated announcement came from Michelle Obama during an interview with People magazine .

Obama said the presidential pooch will arrive at the White House in April after daughters Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , return from spring holiday .
The choice of a rescue dog will bring joy to animal rights groups who have been urging the Obamas to adopt a pet from a shelter .
Senator Ted Kennedy should also be pleased with the selection .
He owns two Portuguese water dogs , and lobbied hard for the breed .
The First Lady said the family is still sorting out what to call the dog .

But this week Michelle Obama revealed that they have settled on a Portuguese water dog , a sort of aqua - capable super - poodle also favoured by that most famous of Democratic pedigrees , the Kennedys .
It is , says the Kennel Club , "" a very intelligent and tremendously energetic Fisherman 's dog with great swimming and diving traits "" - and more to the point it does n't shed hairs .
No doubt the family will come to love their new companion , the latest in a line of White House animals , the oddest of which was President Taft 's pet cow Pauline .
But by choosing a refined breed ( albeit one with suspiciously European ancestry )
the Obamas have stuck to an unjust tradition .
Of the 113 or so dogs that have curled up in the Oval Office , only two were mongrels .
Amy Carter 's puppy Grits was soon sacked for biting people , but President Johnson 's rescued mix - breed
Yuki became famous for howling along with the leader of the free world in front of guests .
Everyone knows that while pedigree dogs may have the looks , mongrels have all the sense , and Yuki was smart enough to live a rags - to - riches life .
Found at a Texas petrol station by one of LBJ 's daughters , he flew into retirement with the president on Air Force One .
President Obama 's ascent has been hardly less spectacular .
Can he not bring along one stray pooch on his coat - tails ?"

2009-03-05,"According to a report in Wednesday 's Guardian , Michelle Obama is being criticised for wearing clothes around the White House that expose her arms .
Fashion journalists have dismissed the look as out of season and too informal , while a congressional aide said it could lead to more expensive heating bills .
While I admit to buying a copy of the latest issue of American Vogue with Obama on the cover , and interviewed inside , because I felt – for political rather than fashion reasons – it represented a landmark moment , I 'm as frustrated as many by the relentless focus on what the First Lady wears .
As Helen Pidd notes in defence of Obama 's right to bare her arms , something Pidd herself often does to stay cool : "" What 's the problem with showing a bit of arm ? ""
But this story is interesting because it throws light on the issue of perceptions about how women 's bodies are controlled in different locations , most frequently discussed in relation to the hijab .
For Pidd goes on to write in her piece : "" Last time I checked , neither Michelle nor I lived in an Islamic state where seeing more than a lady 's irises is believed to send men on the road to ruin . ""
Pidd 's statement makes a sweeping and damaging generalisation about the many women and men in various Muslim countries .
On a recent visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran , for example , I noticed that in some cities , including Tehran and Esfahan , many women subverted the state - enforced rules of the hijab – with veils pushed back on their heads to reveal heavily styled hair , and belts clasping loose - fitting clothes tightly around their waists – without , as far as I could see , attracting the attention of the police or forcing men down "" the road to ruin "" .
It also elides the whole point of Pidd 's piece : that in the west , too , as she reveals in this account , women 's bodies are likewise policed .
Of course , in the US or the UK , you can not be arrested – or worse – for violating a legally required dress code in public , but attempts to control what women wear , or not , are still pervasive .
With International Women 's Day this Sunday , it 's a timely reminder of the limitations and risks in an imperialist ( or , indeed , imperialist feminist ) view of gender equality , which not only ignores the contextual and complex reasons why some women wear the hijab and why other women resist it even when it is a legal requirement – it also fails to interrogate the west 's own role in inhibiting women 's rights , not least when it comes to the control over women 's bodies and what they wear .
As Joan Wallach Scott argues in The Politics of the Veil , Muslim modesty in the form of wearing the veil has been condemned by many in the west , including some western feminists , as a refusal to engage in what are seen to be "" the ' normal ' protocols of interaction with members of the opposite sex "" , which can be read as a discomfort with a gender system seen as different from the west 's own : an Islam that oppresses women against a west that liberates them .
This , Scott points out , conveniently forgets previous arguments ( also made by some western feminists ) about the sexual exhibitionism of western society , with gender equality becoming "" synonymous with sexual emancipation and availability "" .
Furthermore , following Frantz Fanon 's reading of male colonisers ' aggressive attitudes in unveiling women – "" it is baring her secret , breaking her resistance , making her available for adventure "" – Scott concludes that the practice of unveiling , when forced through law or invasion , can itself be a form of violence , enacting a vision of western gender equality and "" a belief in the innate desire of women for emancipation in western terms "" .
Hence it is another "" version of the civilising mission with all of its racist and colonial implications "" .
Now this may seem a long way from a discussion about Michelle Obama 's preference for wearing sleeveless shirts and dresses .
But it is related .
A dichotomous view of Islam and the west when it comes to gender equality does n't help any women or men , wherever they may be located ."

2009-03-16,"Are biceps the new breasts ?
David Brooks of the New York Times thinks Michelle Obama "" should not be known "" – tut tut – "" for one body part . ""
In Maureen Dowd 's recent column , he even advised the first lady to "" put away "" her beautifully toned upper arms , as if they were a set of secondary sex organs .
Over at Huffington Post , Bonnie Fuller fired back , suggesting that "" wimpy "" , "" Republican lite "" Brooks needs to get his own sorry biceps to a gym .
I 'm tempted to say that her reference to "" jiggly girly - man arms "" was below the belt , but my geography would be off – and Brooks was asking for it , even if Dowd is the one who told on him .
The first lady is transforming us into a nation of bickering biceps - watchers , unable to agree on the meaning of her upper body parts , much less whether they should be covered or celebrated .
The Frisky 's Wendy Atterberry thinks Dowd 's triumphalist interpretation of Michelle 's arms ( "" a reminder that Americans can do anything "" ) is just plain daft .
What 's with the "" mythologising "" Atterberry asks .
Like the J Crew outfits women are buying en masse , the first lady 's biceps are quickly becoming the next must have on our list .
Women at every stage of life are finding ways to emulate Michelle , wanting to bond with her physically , whether through exercise or the display of flesh .
I just ca n't imagine feeling this way about Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton , can you ?
Neither seemed to be physically in love with herself the way Michelle is .
No wonder her body lends itself so nicely to political myth .
Not very long ago – before Michelle took centre stage –
the female clavicle was being hailed as the new cleavage .
( Those of us who regard our breasts as a private treat are always in need of alternative cleavage . )
A demure collar bone peeping out from a flowing V - neck blouse makes two bare biceps seem positively risqué .
But when you consider some recent options – exposed thongs , derrieres , navels and tummies – bare biceps seem quite genteel .
This is a loftier form of cleavage than anything we 've recently experienced .
Butt cleavage is saucy and profane , while the ladylike clavicle evokes a passive jewel .
We needed something to bridge those extremes , and we have it in the wholesome sensuality of a prominent woman 's beautifully formed arm .
Compared with Madonna 's overworked - looking biceps , Michelle 's are less theatrical and more feminine .
As a trendsetter , the first lady is , of course , more accessible than Madonna , whose tastes and whims are a little daunting .
Michelle connotes style , Madonna fashion , whether we 're talking biceps or clothing and demeanour .
Why should n't the first lady display her arms ?
I disagree with pundits and bloggers who say she 's wearing too many sleeveless dresses .
Nevertheless , I think we should avoid treating the female biceps as a visual trophy .
Whether we oppose or welcome its display , it 's a mistake to get too fixated on a particular muscle .
In our short - sighted quest for a toned appearance , too many women resort to quick and dirty methods to shape a specific muscle when we should be thinking more holistically .
The fitness industry is built on gadgets and machines that enable us to avoid using our own body weight to get in shape .
And sometimes this approach prevents us from appreciating how all the parts work together .
Getting your arms to such an exalted place involves the use of many different muscles .
Indeed , Michelle should n't be known for "" one body part "" but rather for the way she uses her lats , traps , rhoms and delts – muscles in the back and shoulder – to get there .
Dowd 's preoccupation with Michelle 's biceps as a "" symbol of American strength "" reminds us that the bicep is a showy muscle , ripe for comic symbolism .
Think of Popeye .
Or think of the American economy just a few years ago .
I 'd be more impressed if the symbol of our strength were the first lady 's less - talked - about triceps .
This is the harder muscle to train , and a real challenge for most women .
Also , the state of your triceps is what really determines whether you should go sleeveless in the first place .
Michelle 's are unimpeachable ."
2009-03-17,"While Democrats from around the country strategised in Denver over how to win the White House for Barack Obama this summer , a high - level conclave of a different sort was taking place in a hotel room near by .
The Obama girls and then vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden 's grandchildren held a sleep over during the August convention , Vice - president Joe Biden said last night .
The futon - level summit , held over popcorn , was proposed by 10-year old Finnegan Biden and Sasha Obama , then 7 , and brokered by Michelle Obama and Biden 's wife Jill .
Also said to be present were Malia , 10 , Biden grandchild Maisey , 8 , and several of Biden 's brothers ' grandchildren .
According to Biden , who described the evening in remarks to a group of Democratic fundraisers last night , as many as nine children watched television together that evening .
He described the "" absolutely true story "" of the negotiations leading up to the event . ""
Pop , Pop , I got to talk to you , "" Finnegan told him , grabbing him by the coat as the family left the convention hall .
"" We need a sleep - over . ""
Biden said at first he thought she wanted a sleepover with him .
He said he sleeps out in a tent on a lake with his grandchildren in Delaware . ""
No , no , no , no , no , Pop , "" she said , according to Biden .
"" You know , Sasha is already talking to Bawack . ""
"" I beg your pardon , baby ? ""
Biden said he replied .
"" We want a sleep - over tonight .
We want a sleep - over where Sasha , Malia "" and their cousins .
"" Pop , can we clear out a room and take the beds out ? ""
Biden said he then spoke to Jill , who called Michelle , "" and Michelle was already on it . ""
He continued : "" They cleared out the room , put down futons , they had popcorn and stuff .
And they 're , I do n't know , seven , eight , nine little kids in there , black and white .
And as I left , the TV was on and they were watching , I do n't know , Mermaid or one of those programs that I 've watched many times with my grandchildren ...
"" I did n't have any doubt after that why the hell
I took this job , why I was running , "" Biden said about seeing the kids together . ""
Sounds corny , but I mean it . """
2009-03-20,"Just beyond the new swings the Obamas have installed for Sasha and Malia in the grounds of the White House , the first lady yesterday [ Friday ] and 26 Washington schoolchildren began digging a 1,100-square - foot organic kitchen garden on the South Lawn .
"" My girls like vegetables more if they taste good , "" said Michelle Obama , looking almost too chic to get dirty in a belted sweater and black patent leather boots .
"" Especially if they 're involved in planting it and picking it , they were willing to give it a try . ""
Nearly everyone who has called 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home has added personal touches to America 's most famous backyard .
Bill Clinton laid a running track , Jimmy Carter 's daughter Amy got a tree house , and Dwight Eisenhower put in a putting green to hone his golf game .
But Obama 's seemingly simple move is seen by many as a political statement akin to Eleanor Roosevelt 's 1943 victory garden .
Food activists , led by the California chef and Chez Panisse founder Alice Waters , have been lobbying for an organic White House garden since 1993 .
Now they are celebrating what they call a new "" victory "" garden .
It sent out a message , Waters said , "" that everyone can grow a garden and have free food "" .
Others are less sure .
Chef and writer Anthony Bourdain , who penned Kitchen Confidential , caused a stir in January when he said : "" We 're all in the middle of a recession .
Like we 're all going to start buying expensive organic food and running to the green market .
There 's something very Khmer Rouge about Alice Waters that has become unrealistic . ""
The White House said materials for the garden , from seeds to mulch , cost $ 200 ( though that figure does n't account for labour provided by the White House staff , who will perform most of the maintenance ) .
Today , the fifth - grade students from Bancroft Elementary , who will help harvest the peppers , carrots and spinach later this year , seemed happily unaware of such disagreements between culinary giants , giggling as they raked and shoveled . ""
So today is getting the soil ready .
Then we 'll come back in a couple of weeks to actually do the planting .
And then sometime in June , right - right around the time that school is over , hopefully we 'll have lots of great vegetables and fruits .
We 'll harvest them and then we 'll bring you guys into the kitchen in the White House , "" the first lady said .
Despite the youngsters ' enthusiasm , the first lady acknowledged that some of them might still be somewhat ambivalent about vegetables : "" Let 's hear it for vegetables , "" she shouted , eliciting a cheer . ""
Let 's hear it for fruits ! ""
she said to more cheers .
Then : "" Did I hear a boo ? """
2009-03-21,"Mothers are caught between the allure of traditional images of nurture and the aspirations of autonomy formed by women in recent decades .
As the stories of Jade Goody , Julie Myerson and Michelle Obama have shown , the dilemmas faced by mothers are not only personal dramas but the subject of collective fascination and bemusement .
Christian cultures created the two most charged images of motherhood : the Madonna , a young mother with a child on her knee , and the Pietà , the mother mourning her son .
The belief in a God born of a woman made birth and motherhood an utterly public concern .
Cities in which respectable women were kept indoors for reasons of modesty - like Juliet 's Verona - also displayed statues and murals of the Virgin Mary dandling the child Jesus on her knee or offering him her breast .
The most private thus became the most public .
In their attempt to reduce street crime , the councils of Italian Renaissance cities cultivated and maintained sacred images , above all Madonnas , at entrances to neighbourhoods and on prominent buildings - CCTV for a pre - modern age .
With this cherished mother looking down , it was thought , men would be less likely to pick pockets , harass women , or pee in the streets .
No king , emperor , general or president had or has quite the power to make us reflect on the rights and wrongs of our actions as do mothers and grandmothers .
Such female authority was the byproduct of social arrangements we would describe as patriarchal .
Men handled the family 's property , engaged in politics , war and leisure with other men .
The domestic sphere was left to women .
This meant not only caring for the family 's material needs but also for their moral formation .
Then as now , most women worked as well as tending to households .
And so women were charged with nurturing the young and training them ; the home was the space of women and children , of the familiar and reassuring : food , song , prayer and play .
Where learning scripture was considered central to becoming a man , boys were removed from home at an early age to be taught by men .
In commercial and warring societies , training removed adolescents from home as they entered spheres of male sociability .
Lives in the military or in industry were intensely competitive , and often associated with physical hardship .
Mothers and sisters , aunts and grandmothers at home - be it the medieval manor house or the Amerindian village - reminded young men of comfort and solace , of their debt to those who had taught them their first words .
How does this history affect our lives ?
While we share in the cultural heritage that made mother the quintessence of nurture and suffering , and are moved by Michaelangelo 's Pietà or Schubert 's Ave Maria , much has changed .
Mothers are no longer solely imagined as inhabiting and guarding the home and its mysteries .
In societies where women have access to education , citizenship and careers , mothers inhabit the same sort of spheres of culture and politics as their offspring .
They face the same challenges at work and on the streets .
Mothers are no longer made mysterious by their ageless dark garb , and are no longer solely dependent on the implicit backup of the father 's sternness .
This new motherhood is colourful , and it is messy .
Mothers sometimes pose as the Madonna or the Pietà .
But most of the time they write the scripts as they go along .

2009-03-23,"After spending much of the weekend in the garden , spade in hand bent over at 90 degrees , it is cheering to read that I was not alone .
Michelle Obama – while reportedly wearing a pair of Jimmy Choo boots – has also been out working her back 's flexor muscles as she breaks the ground of the White House 's new vegetable garden .
As I mentioned in a blog post following the US elections last November , I was one of many hoping that the Obamas would answer the call of the WHO Farm Project who were attempting to persuade the new inhabitants of the White House to plant a "" victory garden "" , just as Eleanor Roosevelt had done during the second world war .
Michelle Obama appears to have been won over by the idea and has commandeered a local junior school to provide some extra enthusiasm and – who can blame her ?
– free labour .
Now to the interesting bit : what have they chosen to plant in their garden ?
In the first reports I read , the only detail I could find was that there would be "" peppers , peas and spinach "" , but , thanks to the WHO Farm Project website , I 've now been directed to a graphic produced by the New York Times which maps out exactly what will be planted in the garden and where .
It looks a delight at first glance : a "" y ""- shaped path lined with nasturtium , zinnias and marigolds , guiding you through 18 separate vegetables beds .
The ever - invasive mint is sensibly positioned off to one side in its own bed .
And the soft fruit and rhubarb get their own separate beds too .
It 's something of a fantasy garden for most of us , but there are some curios contained within .
Where are the potatoes ?
Surely , all vegetable gardens should contain at least a few sweet , creamy earlies ?
In fact , there are no tubers or root crops at all .
And why is there so much spinach and salad ?
Eleven out of the 18 beds are given over to them , with a further five earmarked for peas .
It was the Victorian poet laureate Alfred Austin who said : "" Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are . ""
Therefore , reading between the lines , one suspects someone in the White House is on a health kick , with a no - nonsense diet that 's low on the carbs and high on the greens .
Personally , if I was lucky enough to be tending such a fine plot , I would be thinking beyond the four - year cycles that come with the territory at the White House and be planting the most presidential vegetable of them all – asparagus .
( What better welcome gift than that to your successor ? )
I would also be tempted to throw in some globe artichokes , a long row of potatoes and even the odd fruit tree or two along the borders .
And how about some Jerusalem artichokes to help "" lift "" the atmosphere at those dull state dinners ?
( Although the White House would have to be careful here for fear of being accused of pro - Israel bias . )"
2009-03-24,"Michelle Obama has begun to dig up a 1,100 sq ft patch of the White House lawn where she intends to grow 55 varieties of vegetables for the first family 's meals and state dinners .
Far from a novelty , her action makes her the latest in a long line of White House gardeners .
The first presidents of the US , whom Barack Obama so often quotes in his speeches , were all passionate gardeners : it was because George Washington missed his garden at Mount Vernon so much that he refused to serve a third term , setting the precedent for the two - term presidency .
John Adams was the first president to live in Washington DC .
One of the first instructions he gave was for a vegetable garden to be laid out to the northeast side of the White House .
Adams was a hands - on gardener who leaped into a pile of manure on Edgware Road ( then just fields outside London ) when he was the American minister in Britain in the 1780s to investigate its contents , proudly declaring that it was "" not equal to mine "" .
During Thomas Jefferson 's presidency , cows grazed in the grounds of the White House .
He designed the west wing to include a greenhouse ( though it was never built ) and grew at his garden in Monticello 250 varieties of vegetables including tomatoes ( one of the first Americans to do so ) , 27 varieties of kidney beans , 20 varieties of lettuce , Mexican peppers , artichokes , asparagus , sea kale , tarragon and cucumbers .
His expertise was so respected that even the capital 's city surveyors asked his opinion on when and how to prune the trees along Pennsylvania Avenue .
Michelle Obama 's decision to plant a vegetable garden is an important political and symbolic statement about the future but it also echoes the beliefs of the founding fathers .
They thought not only that gardening was the healthiest of all occupations but that the American people should be encouraged to grow a wide variety of vegetables to improve their diet .
When Jefferson judged his services to his country he ranked the introduction of olive trees to the US alongside his writing of the declaration of independence .
The Obamas may be interested to look at his Garden Book in which he meticulously recorded all his vegetable failures and successes , for Jefferson said there is "" not a sprig of grass that shoots uninteresting to me "" .

who ?
She had n't even set foot on the plane yet , and Mrs O has all but obliterated last year 's Carlamania from the fashion history books with an outfit that draws a direct bloodline between her look and the wardrobe with which Jackie Kennedy wowed Europe in 1961 .
Mrs O 's look - a white coat edged in black by Thakoon Panichgul , one of her favourite young New York designers , over a black shift by Michael Kors - is slightly retro , reassuringly classic , and classy in an accessible , vaguely European - looking way .
The grosgrain trim and clean , uncluttered lines of the coat , along with the double strand of pearls at the throat , call to mind Chanel .
Essex , Tuesday evening
Stansted airport has its very first fashion moment .
Michelle Obama will forever be to Stansted Harrods Terminal what Anita Ekberg is to the Trevi Fountain .
This is the Brand Michelle we know and love : the lady owns chartreuse right now .
After showcasing her mastery of bright - on - bright colour blocking , a top story from the spring / summer 2009 catwalks , with her daughters ' inaugural coat - and - hat combinations , Michelle here shows she has moved on with impressive speed to acid brights with black , which will be autumn 's big trend .
The black coat and yellow dress - by Jason Wu , who shot to fame when Michelle chose his one - shouldered ivory gown for the inauguration ball - was cinched with her favourite Azzedine Alaia belt .
Barack , we know , does n't get this belt : he calls it "" the Star Trek belt "" .
Downing Street , yesterday morning
For breakfast with the Browns , and a visit to a cancer charity with Mrs B , Michelle wears a pale , sparkly blush - toned cardigan with a mint gingham pencil skirt , both by the solidly American middle - market label J Crew , and snakeskin effect courts .
After the high - octane , front - page - friendly glamour of her arrival outfit , this deft change of fashion tack highlights her woman - of - the - people credentials .
A cardigan , skirt and pearls is a look every British woman understands , but with a dash of sunny , spring - like optimism in the preppy gingham and bare legs , and a touch of Obama glamour in the spangles .
Buckingham Palace ,
yesterday afternoon Earlier in the day , President Obama mentioned that his wife had been giving a lot of thought to what to wear to meet the Queen - let 's be honest , who would n't ?
Clearly , she decided to play it safe , which is a great shame for those of us who were hoping to see the first sighting of a studded Azzedine Alaia bondage belt in Buck Palace .
The Queen , who was looking particularly perky in a pink frock with signature sensible bag , and Michelle Obama both share a taste for block vivid colours .
But clearly not wanting to risk a bold shades fashion face - off ( can you imagine the horror ? ) on her debut royal visit , the first lady retreated back into the effortless Jackie O monochrome look she favoured for boarding the plane in Washington on Tuesday .
With her hair pulled neatly back ( it 's rumoured that the first lady is travelling with her personal hair stylist ) , Michelle 's choice of ballerina - length black skirt with layers of net beneath and the pearls all play up her youth .
This rather results in her looking ever so slightly like she 's dressed up to visit her grandparents , which while cute is not quite as statement - makingly fabulous as her Stansted exit , which definitely wins the battle of the looks thus far ."

This is pretty amazing , it 's an oasis – an oasis that 's necessary for people who are struggling .
The building actualises their journey in so many ways .
"" As she left the centre , crowds greeted her with cheers and shouts of "" Obama , Obama "" .
She said : "" I was delighted to be invited by Sarah Brown to help wish Maggie 's a happy first birthday in London .
Community jewels like this centre should always be celebrated .
"" I was impressed with the centre 's warm and caring environment and enjoyed meeting the people who work and get services here . ""
Speaking after the first lady 's departure , cancer patient Namina Turay described her as "" warm and friendly "" .
She said : "" It 's her first official visit and this is a great honour .
It 's such a privilege , she 's so natural and really easy to talk to .
"" The warmth and patience she showed and the time she took to engage with everyone was greatly appreciated .
"" It was the first of a series of engagements and meetings that Obama will share with Brown , as part of her debut on the global stage .
She will accompany the president when he meets the Queen at Buckingham Palace later today .
At a summit dinner for the spouses of leaders at 10 Downing Street tonight , she is expected to be seated between Harry Potter author JK Rowling and Olympic gold medallist Dame Kelly Holmes ."
2009-04-01,"Homegrown style – but on a budget – was the watchword for both Michelle Obama and Sarah Brown today as their husbands grappled with the faltering world economy .
The first lady has been feted for her chic fashion sense and elegant use of colour while the prime minister 's wife more often sticks to classic suits .
Today Mrs Obama arrived at Downing Street in a fresh , colourful combination while Mrs Brown looked smart in navy .
But the two women 's outfits had a lot in common – both had been carefully chosen to support their native fashion industry .
Obama looked dazzling in a sequinned champagne cardigan paired with a mint pencil skirt , both from American mid - market brand J Crew , an outfit that will have cost her $ 454 ( £ 318 ) .
As every girl who shops on the high street knows , it is the accessories that make or break an outfit .
Obama did not put a foot wrong in low - heeled animal - skin - print heels and her signature pearls .
Fashion watchers had wondered how Brown would compete with her famously stylish American counterpart .
But the PM 's wife 's choice of designer showed off her political as well as fashion nous .
Her simple navy dress was made for her by American - born , London - based designer Britt Lintner , who makes all her clothes in the UK .
Lintner combines her fashion business with a career in finance and decided to design her own clothes to provide practical but feminine workwear for professional women .
She only designs dresses in subtle but flattering outlines and muted colours to ensure the wearer always looks "" professional , polished and practical "" .
Crucially , her designs – while not going for high - street prices – are never more than £ 500 a dress and are designed to be worn season after season .
Brown paid around £ 450 for today 's outfit and has been a "" good customer "" of the company since she wore one of their designs to the London Fashion Awards , a spokeswoman said .
Her accessories were a little more muted than Obama 's but she too knows the importance of good quality shoes .
The black patent round - toed courts were from high - end high - street chain Russell and Bromley – the brand that hit the headlines in 2002 when Theresa May wore a pair of their leopard - skin - print heels to deliver her keynote party chairman address to the Conservative conference .
Brown also wore a simple silver necklace from Astley and Clarke , an online designer jewellery retailer .
Lintner said : "" I am thrilled to be able to dress such a successful and intelligent woman .
I think the choice is significant because of the link between Britain and America . ""
I make dresses for women who work .
I wanted to be able to throw on a dress , go to work and not have to think about it for the rest of the day .
Whatever is in her diary a woman wearing one of my dresses will know she will look appropriate . ""
Calgary Avansino , Vogue magazine 's executive fashion editor , said that both women had dressed to reflect their own style .
"" They were never going to turn up in similar things .
Their personalities are obviously so different , "" she said .
"" But I think they both are obviously trying to send a very clear message that they can wear what the average women would wear and still look great and that they are not above it . ""
They are showing support for every person , every family in their countries ; it is exactly the right message . ""
Michelle 's outfit was springy and upbeat ; it was a gutsy outfit .
She is not scared of colour ; she knows she can use it and that it creates a sense of positivity .
And I like the little detail in the shoes which worked even though she was wearing a printed skirt and embellished top . ""
Sarah was much more reserved and conservative but it suited her and
I 'm glad she chose navy not black . ""
She said that comparisons of Brown 's semi - opaque black tights with Obama 's bare - legged look were unfair . ""
Michelle has such a great skin tone it is so much easier for her to go bare - legged .
I do n't think Sarah should have worn nude tights –
they can give you a false sense of security –
but I think she should have gone more opaque for a more flattering look . ""
But she said : "" Part of me thinks it is completely sexist to look at two intelligent , successful women and talk about whether they are wearing tights or not .
I do n't think fashion is the first thing either of them think about .
They do so much else .
"" Of course their husbands could take refuge in the safety of dark suits and ties in co - ordinating blue hues .
But their choice of shoes spoke volumes about the two men : the prime minister played it safe in ultra - traditional , well - worn Oxfords while the president opted for a more modern cut and a highly polished finished ."
2009-04-01,"Michelle Obama , lawyer , campaigner and first lady of the United States , made her debut on the international stage yesterday , accompanying her husband on a visit to No 10 .
The couple exchanged warm greetings with Gordon and Sarah Brown at 8 am , before the two men peeled off for talks ahead of today 's G20 summit .
Before embarking on her first official engagement in the UK Michelle Obama started the day in a suitably British fashion : with a cup of tea .
The two women then travelled in convoy to Maggie 's Cancer Caring Centre , which provides support , information and advice for people affected by the disease .
Sarah Brown , patron of the charity , introduced the first lady to Laura Lee , the chief executive of Maggie 's .
Obama handed over a present , and was rewarded with a slice of cake and , inevitably , another brew .
She later shared make - up tips in a session for women who have cancer , telling them that her own make - up artist took part in similar sessions .
She was introduced to Trudi Cogdell , who is having chemotherapy to treat breast cancer , and her two children , Maysie , eight , and Presley , five , who crafted Easter cards while their mother chatted to the visitors for 15 minutes .
As Obama went to leave , she was given a card by Maysie , who showed herself to be a diplomat - in - waiting , decorating the front of the envelope with the star - spangled banner and the back with the union flag .
Obama 's parting words to Namina Turay , a 32-year - old whose breast cancer is in remission , were "" keep it up "" .
The first lady then returned to Winfield House , the residence of the US ambassador .
This plush building in Regent 's Park is the Obamas ' pied - a - terre for the duration of their visit to London .
Obama was later reunited with her husband for the next major engagement of the day : an audience with the Queen at Buckingham Palace .
The evening engagement - a summit dinner for the spouses of leaders at No 10 - saw her husband dine separately with other presidents and prime ministers , while she was seated between Harry Potter author JK Rowling and Olympic gold medallist Dame Kelly Holmes ."
2009-04-01,"Two hours before the G20 leaders tested each other over their Downing Street dinner last night , Michelle Obama gracefully resolved one of the conference 's lesser controversies .
What would the first lady wear to meet her veteran British counterpart , the Queen ?
Carla Bruni - Sarkozy , the French president 's wife , had decided to stay away , unwilling to be outshone by Michelle Obama , according to bitchier global analysis .
President Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa also emerged wifeless from his limousine for the royal reception at Buckingham Palace .
So did King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , possibly for more practical reasons .
His Mercedes S - class could not have contained more than a few of them .
In any case , most eyes in London were fixed on the American pair , so much more distinctive and glamorous then the average G20 summiteer .
"" How can you tell them [ the leaders ] apart ? "" as Prince Philip was later overhead confiding to the Obamas .
He too is distinctive in his way .
At his mid - morning press conference with Gordon Brown , Barack Obama had hinted at domestic indecision in the wardrobe department .
"" Michelle is really thinking that through , "" the president remarked as he piled on praise for the Queen 's "" decency and civility "" .
A few minutes early for their royal meeting - protocol dictates that fellow heads of state do not have mere audiences - Michelle Obama emerged from the Beast , the president 's fortress of a Cadillac .
She was wearing a regal black coat .
Beneath it were glimpses of a black skirt and cardigan over a white blouse and a double string of pearls .
Critics of her sartorial informality , evident earlier in the day , could have no excuse for sniping .
Inside the palace , up to 150 guests , five each ( including finance ministers ) for the 19 delegations , plus EU , UN , IMF and other important acronyms , were greeted by a top royal line - up , including the Prince of Wales ( his wife turned up ) , and the dukes of Edinburgh , York and Kent .
The G20 celebs drank assorted wines and soft drinks in the state reception rooms and nibbled mini - Cornish pasties .
Perhaps stung by suggestions that his gift of a box DVD set to Gordon Brown in Washington did not convey the requisite degree of warmth , the First Visitors brought a gift for the Queen that managed to combine thoughtfulness , modernity and a dash of history : an iPod loaded with video footage of her 2007 visit to Virginia .
The Queen repayed the compliment with a very personal present of her own - a signed portrait of herself and Prince Philip ."
2009-04-01,"Barack and Michelle Obama landed on the tarmac at Stansted Tuesday night looking to many like nothing so much as a 21st - century Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy – stylish , charming , youthful .
That 's what they were expected to look like .
But the comparison to Camelot long ago passed into cliché .
It 's a damaging image – both for the Obamas and the United States .
A lot has changed in the last half century .
Even in 1961 , appearances were n't quite what they appeared .
The Obamas , and in particular the first lady – who the Huffington Post has dubbed the "" new Diana "" – would do well to shuck all these tragic parallels .
Part of the problem with the Kennedy matchup comes with how dismal it makes us look now .
When the Kennedys arrived in Europe in 1961 , the duo represented the unlined face of a youthful , post - war , ascendant America , a country where Detroit was king and a man was promised to be on the moon by the end of the decade .
The cultural revolutions just vaguely rumbling in our country that would sweep the latter half the decade were the same youthquakes crashing in Europe , with America , as often as not , at the forefront .
Our sexy image was just coming into its prime .
It did n't matter that the Kennedys came from patrician roots , from families that hoisted them into their social positioning –
he was the political member of the Rat Pack , she was the pinnacle of new American femininity .
Their well - coifed presence was a bridge between the social upheavals of the late 1960s and the refined generation that preceded them .
America was on the rise , and a handsome young couple was at the helm .
The Obamas , on the other hand , have a harder task .
Now we 're in a moment where instead of a young couple representing the youth and vitality of America , we have a young couple trying desperately to prove America is still young and vital .
It 's a lot to demand of the Obama image .
Perhaps their presence on the continent will remind Europeans of the original American dream – the "" story that could only happen in America "" – and will push aside the ailing image of America many Europeans are holding on to now : one that 's decrepit , ossified and falling apart .
This first couple is coming to repackage the tarnished American brand .
They must try to convince Europe that they – not
the bankers or the auto industry or
the stock market free fall – represent the real America now .
That they stand for a young , vibrant , multi - racial , immigrant America .
The America that shimmers with possibility – in ways that Europe has yet to achieve for its citizens , let alone its immigrant populations .
But convincing London and Paris will be much harder than any one could have imagined even this summer .
The new version of this country – call it Gobal Financial Disaster America , has proved to be so much worse for our image than simply Imperialist America .
The golden couple 's sheer star power has been asked to reestablish America 's place in European minds , at a moment where global anger is focused on our recession , China is calling for a new global reserve currency and , back in Detroit , Italy 's Fiat is volunteering to save Chrysler .
It 's no surprise that Obama took his well - educated , well - muscled , beautiful wife along on the trip .
The photos will certainly be better for it .
But can glamour alone make Michelle Obama serve as the ultimate shuttle diplomat ?
Should she have to ?
To be fair to the Obamas , there 's another reason the couple should shun the Kennedy comparison – one that historian Gil Troy shared in an email .
When Kennedy famously declared himself simply the "" man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris , "" the line was barbed , not humble . ""
True , Michelle Obama is generating the kind of excitement Jackie Kennedy generated , but Mrs Kennedy upstaged President Kennedy , "" says Troy .
"" JFK was making the best of a bad situation , but he envied his wife 's popularity , bristling a bit at Charles de Gaulle 's flirtation with Jackie .
Even more ominous if the comparison holds , while that first European trip was triumphant for Jackie
, it was a disaster for Kennedy . ""
At the meeting which counted – a superpower summit with Nikita Khruschev of Russia in Vienna – Kennedy failed . '
He savaged me , ' Kennedy later confessed to James Reston of the New York Times , bruised by Khruschev 's blustering performance when they met .
For the first time in his life , it seemed , ( or certainly in a long time ) , Kennedy met someone impervious to his charm .
Obama may too .
"" We may wrestle over the whether it is better for a leader to be feared than loved , but there can be little doubt that for both the Obamas and America , either is preferable to the alternative : pity ."
2009-04-01,"OBAMAS TOUCH

Barack and Michelle Obama touched down at Stansted last night , and on every front page this morning .
For those who are interested , Michelle Obama is in a white outfit boarding Airforce One in Maryland , and a yellow number when she gets off in Essex .

The Sun 's line involves Obama bypassing traffic jams by using a helicopter , "" Meanwhile his entourage of 500 staff drove in a giant motorcade through busy roads jammed still further in the run - up to tomorrow 's talks on the world economic slump , "" it says strangely .
The Independent , meanwhile , has a useful graphic on how to avoid / join the protests today .
Obama seems to be carrying the hopes of everyone on his shoulders , everyone but Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy , according to the Guardian 's front page .
A bout of Franco - German solidarity threatens to undermine Obama 's leadership and block any talk of fresh stimulus packages at the summit .

None of the papers dispute Darg 's claims but many take issue with the size of his payout , comparing it unfavourably to the case of Marine Ben McBean who was offered £ 161,000 after losing an arm and a leg in an explosion in Afghanistan .
The Express blames excessive compensation payments for killing off British stoicism and encouraging the nation to look for uneven paving stones to trip over .
The Sun drafts in various figures to describe the award as "" disgusting "" and "" compensation culture gone mad "" .
Confronted by the Daily Mail outside the high court , Darg refused to talk , "" keeping his left hand in his trouser pocket "" .

The beautiful rolling chalk hills of the South Downs have finally been designated a national park , 60 years after first going on the national park shortlist .

Rare species that inhabit the downland and heath include colonies of barbastelle and Bechstein 's bats , woodland butterflies , nightjars and musk orchids , according to the Times .
The Guardian says that although much of the land within the new park is already protected from development , national park status would bolster that protection .

2009-04-02,"Success as a modern first lady calls for the gifts of a silent movie star : a larger - than - life glamour that radiates from the screen , an indefinable ability to capture the mood of the moment , and the ability to communicate with the public largely in semaphore .
Jackie Kennedy , of course , was as if to the manor born ; Hillary Clinton never looked comfortable being seen and not heard .
Laura Bush overcame her shyness to master the art , but by then she was sidekick to a show nobody wanted to watch .
Michelle Obama is a natural .
While Sarah Brown , a clever and determined woman , has grown steadily in confidence in her role as political spouse over the last 20 months , her American counterpart looked at ease from the start .
This week , Michelle Obama faced her first major challenge on the international stage .
She may have passed her American screentests with flying colours , appearing on the cover of Vogue in her first month in the White House , but the delicate negotiations in London , against the backdrop of high - profile protest , posed a new test .
With electorates newly suspicious of elites and worried for their future , the G20 leaders and their wives knew that every step taken meant walking on political eggshells .
Barack Obama and Gordon Brown have international interpreters and banks of microphones , policy pronouncements and footnoted treatises to help them deliver their messages loud and clear .
Their wives , by contrast , have only clothes , body language , and the knowledge that their schedule of appointments , however painstakingly planned as non - political , will be minutely observed for clues written in diplomatic code .
The wives ' every gesture - Sarah Brown making tea in a pot , Michelle Obama putting an arm around the Queen - is beamed around the world , but the images are accompanied by Chinese whispers , rather than direct quotes .
An image of the first lady and the Queen chatting while both looking at the floor , was captioned in the media with the information that they "" appeared to be discussing their shoes "" , although no one evidently heard their conversation .
Almost exactly a year ago , Carlamania swept these shores when Carla Bruni - Sarkozy dazzled court and country in an enchantingly formal wardrobe of made - to - measure Christian Dior couture .
What a difference a year makes .
What looked charming and delicious then would look Marie Antoinette - ish now .
Michelle Obama 's first coup was in tuning her wardrobe to a pitch of sunny , homely optimism , rather than sparkling glamour .
For most of the visit the sleek , dynamic shift dresses which have been a feature of her wardrobe were replaced by low - key outfits made up of skirts and tops in colours whose deliberate almost - mismatch lent them a casual tone : a blush - pink cardigan with a mint gingham skirt on Wednesday , a peacock - and - turquoise combination on Thursday .
When she did wear a dress , it was styled not to look like one : the zingy lemongrass Jason Wu frock she wore on arrival was layered with a black coat and belt , while the monochrome Isabel Toledo dress chosen for the Downing Street dinner was disguised as a two - piece ensemble .
The sequinned cardigan and check skirt were bought from J Crew , a midmarket American retailer whose clothes the Obama family often wear ; instead of changing accessories with each outfit , Michelle Obama wore the same double string of pearls throughout the visit .
These are minor details , but ones which help fix the first lady in the public perception as "" real "" .
On their daytime appearances together , it was noticeable that while Sarah Brown appeared dressed as if for a day at the office , in her dark , solid colours and opaque tights , Michelle Obama 's feminine skirts and detailed cardigans gave her the air of a woman having coffee with friends .
This was significant , because this tone of female comradeship came to be the defining feature of her visit : greeting cancer sufferer Trudi Cogdell and her daughters with the words "" come on - big hugs "" ; presenting Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron with volumes of nursery literary classics for their children ; charming the Queen to the extent that the two women stood with their arms around each other ; making a surprise visit to the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson girls ' school .
Whether or not the blue Argyle cardigan with the sequin trim is chic is not the point here .
( Even I can see that . )
The success of this trip for Brand Michelle was not that the international public think of her as more beautiful , or even as more stylish , but that they like her more , they relate to her more , and they trust her more .
Carla Bruni may have seduced every man she met last year , but this year Michelle Obama charmed us all ."
2009-04-02,"While the men got on with the business of digging us out of our economic and political hole yesterday , the developed world 's second most important assembly were left to concern themselves with issues of a more artistic bent .
The conundrum of how to be a modern first lady was apparent when the G20 spouses gathered at the Royal Opera House for a cultural interlude followed by lunch .
My role as "" compere "" , on Sarah Brown 's invitation , offered me a glimpse of what this group of intelligent , capable women get up to while their husbands are busy attempting to solve the problems of the known universe .
Academics , economists , lawyers , businesswomen : the qualifications in the room made for a highbrow coffee morning .
It was disappointing not to find a few more husbands of presidents and prime ministers in the mix , but clearly miracles do n't occur over mere decades in politics .
And politics was definitely not on the menu .
Kids and how to cope with the demands of this heavily judged but unpaid job were a pervading theme of the conversation .
Sarah Brown , dressed as soberly as Michelle Obama sparkled , still managed to shine , performing her hostess duties in head - girl style : supporting the shy , standing back for the gregarious , and generally displaying the level - headed backroom diplomacy for which she is becoming appreciated .
Brown was the facilitator , but the star was Mrs Obama .
She arrived resplendent in green and turquoise , accepting the attendant fuss with good humour and a discernible slice of healthy cynicism .
Distributing hugs and handshakes wherever she moved , she looked like a woman trained in the art of being centre of attention .
When I asked if she 'd been prepared for the hysterical reception they had received everywhere , she replied with a girlish grin that nobody could be prepared for such an experience .
Yet conversations such as the one the day before - when she attempted to excite the Obama girls with details of her visit to the Queen , and they preferred to tell mum about their April Fool 's antics at home - kept life in perspective .
Her mission , she said , was to make sure her daughters , who will still be young when they depart the White House , are equipped for life beyond the bubble .
Another conspiratorial smile radiated from the First Lady 's face when we "" girls "" were asked to move into the auditorium .
A description she confided that you loathe in your thirties , and embrace with great enthusiasm after 40 .
Michelle 's arrival elicited gasps from the kids in leotards and an unmistakable buzz among her fellow "" spouses "" .
Yet she seemed remarkably relaxed for someone who had just arrived in a convoy of cars with a full secret service platoon in her wake .
Over our "" light lunch "" , Svetlana Medvedeva , wife of the Russian president , and I attempted a discussion , through her translator , about our love of books .
She was proud to reveal that Marx 's Das Capital is again a bestseller in Russia , and says real readers , among whom she clearly numbers , are rereaders .
She cited Bulgakov 's The Master and Margarita as a novel offering fresh insights at each stage of our reading lives .
On my right was the less earnest presence of the Thai prime minister 's wife , Pimpen Vejjajiva , a professor of mathematics , who confided that her Eton educated husband is a fan of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , a meal she rustles up for him once a month .
What was most apparent at this once - in - a - lifetime gathering is that , whatever we think of the Masters of the Universe , they have extremely good taste in women .
The spouses included grandmothers and mothers , career women and career wives - all engaging with the complicated challenges of taking a back seat while in most cases being qualified to ride upfront .
Maybe one of these days we 'll see women like these at the summit , and a few more boys at the sideshow ."
2009-04-02,"Whoever briefed Michelle Obama on the things one does and does n't do with one 's hands when one meets the Queen must be wondering what went wrong .
Within minutes of their first encounter at Buckingham Palace yesterday , America 's first lady broke royal protocol by doing the unthinkable : she gave the Queen a hug .
The monarch , for her part , responded with equally flagrant disregard for convention by returning the gesture .
Proceedings had begun innocuously enough following the Obamas ' arrival at the palace - polite handshakes , a curtsey and chit chat with the Duke of Edinburgh , who asked the president how he 'd managed to stay awake all day .
Then , at the "" getting to know you drink "" , there was an exchange of dialogue between Michelle Obama and the Queen ( they seemed to compliment each other on their shoes ) .
At this stage , with everything going so swimmingly , the first lady put her arm around the Queen .
The monarch appeared awkward at first , but after this initial surprise and hesitation , she seemed to respond positively by putting her arm round Obama 's waist .
So it was not quite a major diplomatic incident .
And does it reflect a softening of the royal protocol that forbids physical contact with the Queen beyond handshakes ?
The Queen is widely regarded as formal but close observers point out that a number of traditional rules for dealing with the monarch have been relaxed in recent times .
Bowing , for example , is no longer required .
Nor is Michelle Obama the first person to have initiated physical contact with Elizabeth without ending up in the Tower .
At least four people are known to have broken this rule , the first being Alice Frazier , who hugged the Queen in Washington in 1991 during her 13-day US visit .
The second was Paul Keating , the then prime minister of Australia , dubbed the "" Lizard of Oz "" by the British tabloids after he was photographed with his arm around her in 1992 .
The third was John Howard , Keating 's successor in 2000 ( though he subsequently denied there had been any contact ) , and the fourth was the Canadian cyclist Louis Garneau in 2002 .
Despite the outrage in some quarters , the Queen appeared to take no offence at their actions .
Keating stayed as the Queen 's guest in her private Balmoral home ."
2009-04-03,"I forget who it was who said that if you can fake sincerity you 've got it made .
Alas , there is some truth in that observation , but the genuine article is much better , and sometimes we get it â€ “ and know it .
In all the over - pitched rhetoric and pomp which unavoidably accompanied the necessary hard work at the G20 summit this week there was one moment of emotional authenticity which will stay with me long after many important details of the summit communique have done their work ( or not ) and been forgotten .
It happened at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school in north London , a state school where 50-plus languages are spoken and where Michelle Obama addressed 100 teenage girls after watching the choir sing Whitney Houston 's Believe .
As you can tell from the tremble in the voice during this YouTube clip the first lady seems genuinely affected by what she has seen and heard .
But if you stick with Part II she also manages to deliver her important message about "" love , strong values and a good education "" .
It is , she said , what has taken her from working - class South Side Chicago to the White House with no built - in advantages â€ “ except a "" stay - at - home mom "" and an increasingly disabled father ( he had MS ) who insisted on struggling in to work .
Michelle Obama is not an elected public official , but she 's married to one who has also prevailed over considerable adversity , only just starting the really hard part too .
So we can be impressed by a performance which combines discipline with evident emotion .
"" I do hugs , "" she is reported as saying to the girls , who promptly behaved as if she were Whitney Houston .
Authentic emotion in public life is tricky .
Tony Blair was good at emotional connection , Bill Clinton even better .
In the long run over - reliance on tricks of empathy â€ “ "" I feel your pain "" â€ “ often turns against a politician , as it did against those two .
Watching Barack Obama this week , he struck me as very private , a reserved and thoughtful man , who weighs eloquent words carefully : Professor Obama .
His remarkable memoir , Dreams From My Father , while telling the reader a great deal , also contains striking omissions .
""
No Drama Obama "" can hit the rhetorical high notes , but he also does reticence , perhaps his instinctive position .
A disciplined wife whose voice can tremble with near - surface emotion can be an asset , though discipline ( which Cherie lacked ) is the key .
There is no winning formula in public life .
Thatcher was most authentic as a warrior , less so empathising , though she had her soft side .
Ronald Reagan made audiences feel cheerier .
Churchill wept like a leaky tap , Attlee was admired for a reticence which was just as authentic and recognised as such .
Nicholas Sarkozy sometimes behaves like a man in therapy .
As for Nelson Mandela , the man whose control over his own emotions made a great contribution to the peaceful resolution of a great historic wrong , he must have bottled up unimaginable distress and kept up that winning smiling .
Fake ?
Sometimes , perhaps , but fundamentally sound .
And people watching knew it ."
2009-04-03,"Some people thought it might be Oprah , others thought Michael Jackson ; one or two even mentioned the rapper Lil Wayne .
Jo Dibb , head teacher of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school in north London , had had to tell her students and staff two weeks earlier that a special guest was coming on Thursday , but aside from enlightening her deputy head , she was sworn to secrecy about who it would be .
Soon , however , someone joined the dots about the other event going on in London this week .
"" Most of the money was on Michelle Obama , "" 16-year - old Judith Di Bello , a year 11 student , said yesterday , "" but we really did n't know .
Barack Obama was the first one people thought of , but then people realised that of course he was going to be busy "" .
She first knew for sure that her well rehearsed presentation , on student participation in school decision - making , would be delivered in front of the American First Lady while she was waiting backstage , and saw a burly secret service man in a smart suit and earpiece .
Shortly afterwards , Obama was presented to a breathlessly excited group of young women , and a scarcely less gleeful group of their teachers .
The G20 communique may yet prove to change the world , but for the students in the EGA assembly hall on Wednesday it is the visit of the First Lady which , they were a little giddily insisting yesterday , will go on to shape theirs .
Beaming warmly as students sang and danced , addressing them as "" diamonds and wonderful girls "" , and encouraging a spontaneous mob of hugs and high fives as she finished her address , Obama at one point appeared a little choked by her own words .
"" I 'm an example of what is possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by people around them , "" she told them , adding "" you too can control your own destiny . ""
They left the hall , said Judith , believing exactly that .
"" I felt as if she knew me and she was talking about my life .
She said ' it might be difficult but you can do it , ' and I am about to do my GCSEs
and I 'm having last minute panics .
She reassured me that I can do the things I want to do .
"" One of her friends had decided to attend voluntary extra revision classes over the Easter holidays , she said , and "" most people are feeling really inspired now . ""
The First Lady 's sparkly cardigan , meanwhile , had sparked a lot of envy from the students .
Also , "" She 's so tall ! ""
Dibb herself is n't absolutely sure how the visit came about , though she suspects it may be related to an offer , some weeks ago , from the US embassy to send someone to the school to talk about the civil rights movement .
The delegation that first was clearly struck by the school 's ambition in spite of its conspicuous inner city challenges - 55 languages are spoken by EGA 's 1,000 students , only a third of whom have English as their first language .
Dibb and the First Lady chatted a little between performances , she said , mostly about the Obama 's daughters , Sasha and Malia . ""
She said they were coping better than their parents with all the changes .
And she told one of our girls , ' Sasha would love you because you 're such a good dancer , and she loves dance . '
Really thoughtful and personal to each one .
"" Judith rushed to the stage at the end too , but did n't manage to get a private word .
"" I do feel a little bit jealous about that ! "" she admitted .
"" Someone went to shake her hand , and she said , ' No , I do n't do that .
I hug . ' """
2009-04-03,"Picking through the debris of the G20 summit I ca n't help but remember a favourite saying of Tony Benn 's , the one about politics being about "" issues , not personalities "" .
His own career has long belied the claim .
So do the dynamics of this week 's London conference .
It 's always a subtle blend of both .
Let me confess right away that I was mesmerised by the summit pictures of Silvio Berlusconi sticking himself between Presidents Obama and Medvedev , a hand on each shoulder , and posing like a tourist .
How could he ?
Very easily in Berlusconi 's case .
He 'd do it to God .
Rather more delicately intriguing is another bit of what : was the Queen or Michelle Obama first to put their arm around the other ?
Does it matter , I hear you shout .
No ,
but it 's interesting .
This morning 's media consensus is that the summit achieved more than might have been expected , less than might have been hoped .
More on important matters like expansion of the IMF 's credit facilities , so important to fragile developing economies , more on bank and tax haven regulation ; less on additional fiscal expansion and toxic assets ; little on greening the global economy , albeit it more than last time .
Hedge funds will be regulated for the first time .
Whoopee !
But hedge funds were not the ones that screwed up .
It was highly ( but poorly ) regulated banks that did it .
Offshore tax havens will be brought into line .
Whoopee again !
But great states could shut them all down tomorrow ( by turning off the electricity for starters ) and choose not to .
We call it hypocrisy .
Will Gordon Brown have woken up happier this morning ?
It 's another mixed issues / personality question .
I 'd like to think he leapt out of bed whistling and gave Mrs B a big kiss , but have my doubts : happy is not what he 's here for .
Yet this was probably the high point of Brown 's premiership , his moment in history , competently hosting the first truly representative global summit of its kind , one that might – might – come to be seen as turning a very nasty corner .
Only time will tell .
Nicolas Sarkozy , whose excitable blend of issues and personality may well be a function of his height , was quick to declare himself a winner and proclaim that the 1945 - 2009 Bretton Woods era of international finance is finally over .
That is likely to be true , not because of what he and Angela Merkel insisted upon in the ExCel centre yesterday , but because China has quietly retaken its place at the centre of world affairs after a 500 year trip to the loo .
India too , perhaps , though that is less clear .
Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , seems to eschew the personality cult , probably because China overdosed on that sort of thing under Chairman Mao and is still in recovery mode .
India 's cerebral PM , Manmohan Singh , has an election looming fast , one he may lose .
So does Brown within 14 months .
The summit can have done him no harm , may equally do him little or no good .
How – and if – it impacts on jobs ( 3,000 lost yesterday , but signs of a credit recovery too ) , business liquidity , mortgages and the rest is what will decide the election .
None of that is remotely clear as the summiteers fly home or on to the Nato summit in Strasbourg where Franco - German ideas about a more regulated world will not stretch to putting their troops into harm 's way against the Taliban as it extends its hand - chopping enthusiasm into Pakistan .
What is clear is that Professor Obama – as I have decided to call the president occasionally – can do the glad - handing , and being pawed by Berlusconi , with sufficient grace , whatever his private thoughts .
He laid the special relationship on with a trowel for London 's benefit this week .
Even the demonstrators on the street seem to have given him a gentler time than they would have given You
Know
Who .
Likewise Michelle Obama , whose evidently heartfelt ( her voice cracked ) pep talk to teenage schoolgirls at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school is worth a YouTube look .
I defy even the blogosphere hard men – come on , you know who you are – not to be a little touched .
By such simple messages ( "" love , strong values and a good education "" ) lives are changed .
Me , I liked the blue outfit too , whatever the fashionistas say .
I remain intrigued by the royal protocol scandal which excited the US network TV commentators yesterday .
They love to see us as strange , quaint and exotic and probably imagined that the street demos were all royalist .
How dare she touch the Queen !
From clips I 've seen it does look as if Mrs O slipped her arm around Her Maj and was reciprocated .
But no , the Mail has a revisionist version this morning from royal biographer , Michael Thornton .
He suggests the Queen gets the significance of the Obamas , liked them and decided to push the boat out with a rare royal pat – what Guardian expert Dr Peter Collett calls a "" power touch "" .
Naturally a sassy Harvard - educated woman from the South Side of Chicago is going to touch back .
So that makes it all right .
What a relief !
You may not know this
but , contrary to stereotype about those stuffy Windsors , Her Maj has been expressing personal warmth towards a host of African leaders ever since Kwame Nkrumah took Ghana to independence in 1957 and the Queen to the dance floor .
Nelson Mandela gets away with calling her "" my friend , Elizabeth "" , which is like squeezing her knee .
So new best friends from Kenya - Hawaii - Middle America must be all in a day 's work ."
2009-04-03,"Just when it seemed that the Princess Diana and Jackie Kennedy comparisons could get no worse , Michelle Obama arrived in France yesterday braced for a two - day wardrobe marathon with Carla Bruni - Sarkozy .
Bruni - Sarkozy , the president 's former supermodel wife , had stayed away from London 's G20 summit in what appeared to be a deliberate attempt by the Elysée to hog the limelight for a Carla - Michelle meeting on French soil during the Nato summit .
Bruni - Sarkozy wore her standard opening outfit for all international occasions : a variation on the demure , grey coat .
( Traditionally , this heralds the appearance of a staggering ballgown for the official dinners to follow ) .
Michelle Obama wore fuschia and black .
Both outfits had pussy - bows at the neck .
They were braced for another round of fashion metaphors today when they visit Strasbourg cathedral while the summit is under way .
Bruni - Sarkozy and Michelle Obama have very different backgrounds .
One is an Italian - born millionaire who grew up in castles and went to Swiss finishing school before becoming one of the world 's highest - paid models and relaunching herself as a folk singer .
The other is a Princeton and Harvard - educated lawyer from working - class Chicago who has been praised for helping dig a vegetable patch in the White House garden .
But any hint of rivalry was far off the mark .
The Sarkozys idolise the Obamas .
Rather than fashion , Bruni - Sarkozy was more likely to talk about her newly launched charity work for Aids research and women in Africa ."
2009-04-03,"If proof were needed that Sarah Brown is quickly becoming the style template for working women , it is that the phones in Britt Lintner 's atelier in a mews in west London have been ringing all week .
Brown has worn several of Lintner 's dresses before , but the photograph of her welcoming Michelle Obama to Downing Street on Wednesday , wearing a navy knee - length dress with a buttoned front , was the highest - profile yet .
And while the men ( and two inconvenient women ) are thrashing out the plan to save the world , what are we concerning ourselves with ?
What their wives are wearing .
"" I can not believe , when we 're in the middle of this historically important time , that we 're worried about the clothes , "" Lintner says .
Me neither .
The thing is though , Lintner is an interesting woman .
As well as running her fashion business , she works for a hedge fund , and has two children under 20 months .
She also has some strange views , to me at least , on feminism and borderline sexual harassment in the workplace , but we 'll come on to that .
I ca n't help
but like her , though .
She bristles with energy and , being from the States , has that same kind of easy intimacy that Michelle Obama has been dazzling us with all week .
Her face is all delicate curves and sharp angles , her hair swept up to reveal pearl earrings and she is wearing one of her designs , a blue dress with a retro A - line and demure slash at the front .
She looks like a character from Mad Men .
Lintner , 38 , met Sarah Brown through a mutual friend in 2007 .
"" She called me and left a message , saying ' I need a frock . '
I 'll never forget she called it a frock , which to me , being American , sounded really sweet .
Very British .
"" She goes to her desk and brings back a framed picture of Brown at the British fashion awards wearing a dark velvet dress . ""
She looks good does n't she ?
She 's really smart and she gives incredible advice .
She wo n't know this , but she has become a bit of a mentor for me .
She gives me good advice on how important [ your children 's ] early years are .
I think I said something like ' Oh , my plan is to work hard now and when they get older ... '
She said ' Do n't take their younger years for granted ' .
"" It must be such an irritating position for Brown to be in , to have every outfit scrutinised . ""
She 's magnificent about it .
All these comparisons - whether it 's with Carla Bruni or Michelle Obama - she 's just being herself .
She 's genuine , sincere , warm .
She 's a strong woman and I respect her enormously . ""
And she 's rather beautiful , I think ( I still ca n't believe we 're talking about how pretty or not the prime minister 's wife is ) .
"" She is .
She has beautiful skin , hair and eyes .
She has a beautiful face .
She looks good in V - necks , and she has a great waist so I try to emphasise that .
I shy away from too much colour because it leaves room for people to criticise you . ""
Lintner says they never talk about Gordon , "" or politics , or the economy .
We keep it to safe areas - the clothes , babies .
I do n't think her priorities are fashion , but of course she cares and wants to look good .
"" It is depressing to think women will always be judged on what they wear , but less so for Lintner , who is building a successful business based on dressing women for the workplace .
And dressing them in dresses ( on the rails around her showroom , there are just two pairs of trousers ) , which raises questions that go a bit deeper than the best cut of a frill .
"" I think the biggest mistake is that women try to look like men , "" she says .
"" The dresses are , for me , about women embracing their femininity . "" I can imagine the women who come to Lintner , women who have spent their entire careers in trouser suits perhaps , being a little unnerved by the thought of wearing a dress to work every day .
"" I have to convert them but they get it .
A dress is easy - it works in the office and for drinks after work with clients .
"" Did she find that men treated her differently when she started wearing dresses to work ? ""
I actually think I 'm better received .
I 'm not afraid to be a woman
and I think men appreciate that .
I 'm not trying to act like a man .
I would be as bold as to say it 's actually a label for men .
Is that bad to say that ?
Because men appreciate a woman looking like a woman .
I do n't want this to have a feminist slant at all .
That 's not my style . ""
See , to me , she seems as good a feminist as any , no matter how you might feel about people who work for hedge funds .
The business magazine Management
Today once named Lintner as one of a handful of young female "" leaders - in - waiting "" .
Does she not consider herself a feminist ? ""
No ! ""
she shrieks .
"" Why should I be ? ""
What makes her so sure she 's not one ? ""
To me , ' feminist ' sounds anti - male .
I 'm pro - women , while not being anti - male .
I do n't want women to act like men , to diss men . ""
She says that forging a successful career in the City , if you are a woman , "" is as hard as you want to make it .
You know what you 're getting into .
It 's as simple as that .
You know it 's a man 's world
so either you sign up and play by the rules , or you do n't do it .
"" Or perhaps you try to change it ? ""
What 's the point ?
It works the way it is . ""
She gives me a bright smile , but concedes that women have a far tougher time when they have children and has seen several female colleagues drop out of their careers when they became mothers .
"" It 's an equal game until you have kids .
When you have children , you need to have flexibility .
I think it 's very difficult to work in any industry without that . ""
Looking as she does - beautiful , obviously - and having worked in the notoriously sexist financial world for years , she must have received plenty of comments .
"" I loved every one of them !
Why not ?
Who does n't like to flirt ?
If it got too sexist , I 'd just ignore it .
But ' You look beautiful today ' .
What 's wrong with that ?
"" I must have a slightly horrified look on my face because she says , "" Do you disagree ?
Because you look feminine .
"" But at the Guardian where , as everyone knows , the dress code is sackcloth and sandals , there probably is n't the same fight to be taken as seriously as male colleagues as there is on a trading floor .
Or maybe I 'm wrong about it all and power suits are just as dated a feminist armour as dungarees .
"" There is a line that you should n't cross , "" says Lintner .
"" You can look professional and feminine , but if you move an inch to the left you can get it all wrong and then the wrong perceptions start .
I 've seen women wear clothes that are too tight , too short .
You can wear dresses if you wear them in the correct way .
There is a formula and I 'm refining it to get it right , where you 're taken seriously and respected , but still look like a woman . ""
Lintner was born in Dallas ; her father worked for IBM and her Swedish mother was one of those glamorous Pan Am air stewards .
After a degree in economics , she came to London and worked at investment bank Lehman Brothers . ""
Then I woke up at 30 and thought , ' I 've done everything that everyone - my parents , my peers - expected me to do .
What do I want to do ? '
I had a good title at Lehman and I was making good money
and I thought , ' this is n't it ' .
"" She phoned her boss from holiday and said she was n't going back . ""
It was scary .
I remember calling my parents , sobbing , because I did n't know if I was doing the right thing . ""
She took an MA in art history , then a summer course in fashion design and realised there was a gap in the market for feminine , stylish work clothes .
In 2006 , she put all her savings into setting up her business .
"" I had no idea what I was doing .
I can sew a button , but that 's it , so I found a pattern cutter and a seamstress
and it grew from there .
You come up with the idea for the dress , then you tweak and tweak .
After working with numbers for so long , it 's rewarding to have something you can touch and feel . ""
Despite her inexperience , Lintner does have an instinct for what makes women look good .
"" I feel silly when people call me a fashion designer , because I do n't think I am .
I 'm not driven by trends , I 'm driven by needs . ""
When a former employer offered her a job in a hedge fund , it was too good an opportunity to turn down .
"" I need my day job for inspiration and I need it to fund this .
Every single penny I made in my life went into this , then when Lehman went bust [ in September last year ]
every other penny I had in my stock , which I had n't sold , went up in smoke , "" she says , then quickly adds : "" Not that I feel sorry for myself . ""
Her day job is where she tests every dress she designs before it goes into production .
"" I can see if people think the colours are too bright , too hot , too low - cut , or shows too much thigh . ""
After the birth of her second child six months ago , the financial crisis meant Lintner was back at work after four weeks .
"" There were things I was working on that I did n't want to sacrifice .
I had to keep my job ; I need my job .
What 's hard is trying not to let other people make me feel guilty [ about being a working mother ] .
I get a lot of comments like , ' I hope you 're spending time with your kids . '
I 'm with them in the mornings and evenings and all weekends .
I could n't stay at home all day
and I 'm a better mother because of it .
"" This is Lintner 's typical day : up around 6 am with her children , into work by 9 am , home at 6 pm to put the kids to bed , then dinner with her husband , who also works in finance , then she works on her fashion business . ""
The key is being organised , "" she says .
"" I have a wonderful team , so I delegate , and
I know I 'm lucky to be able to afford a great nanny .
It 's like I have these switches in my head
- I switch between all my jobs .
When I 'm at home being Mom , the phone is off , email is off .
"" It is n't a great time to be a small business , especially one which caters for women in the kind of jobs that are dwindling , but Lintner says her clothes are ideal for recession dressing .
At around £ 500 for a frock , they are not cheap , but they are beautifully made and wo n't date .
Investment pieces , if you like .
"" I place a lot of importance on clothes , "" she says .
"" Feeling confident in what you 're wearing is empowering and people react to that .
Looking the part can push you over the edge into a job , into winning an opportunity .
So it is really important .
I always say good clothes open doors . """
2009-04-04,"There was a strange stillness last week in Islington 's Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Language College on the last day of term .
It was n't just that the school had finished a day early and it was a training day for staff and a revision day for pupils soon to take their GCSEs .
Nor even that the sun had finally decided to shine for the start of the Easter holidays .
It was that , 24 hours earlier , an event so surprising and extraordinary had happened in this very ordinary - looking London school that the few people milling around its lobby had the air of having experienced some freak natural phenomenon - a hurricane , perhaps , or a tidal wave or , as actually happened , a visit by the first lady of the United States , Michelle Obama .
At the culmination of the Obamas ' first visit to Britain , she visited the school on Thursday and , the next day , staff and students all seemed to be suffering some sort of post - traumatic international celebrity icon syndrome .
In the hallway , I met Nuria Afonso , 15 , and Shereka Phipps , 15 , both wearing the dazed expressions of people who still ca n't quite believe what has just happened . ""
She hugged us ! "" said Nuria .
"" Can you believe that ?
She .
Hugged .
Us !
It was amazing .
Amazing . ""
And she shook her head .
They were both in the school choir and had spent the past few weeks rehearsing for a performance in front of what they 'd been told would be "" a very special guest "" .
"" We did n't know she was coming !
It was complete shock .
We only found out on the day .
Nobody knew .
The staff did n't know .
We had to guess .
And we guessed pretty much everybody .
And it was n't until she was there , on stage , that we found out .
It was mental .
"" It was , in a whole host of ways .
Because in a week in which Michelle Obama managed to dominate almost every news bulletin , and in which her wardrobe , or at least discussion of her wardrobe , threatened to eclipse the entire G20 summit , she somehow managed to rise above the role that the combined forces of the Anglo - American media seemed determined to create for her .
Newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic endlessly commented on her clothes , her shoes , her fashion choices , the "" controversial "" blue plaid cardigan that she wore to visit the school , even though the only remotely "" controversial "" aspect of it was that certain female , waspish fashion writers decided not to like it and , which , according to Google , has so far drawn 1,925 news articles all its own , including one from the Huffington Post , which gave it the inevitable moniker "" Argyle - gate "" .
And yet , what the fashion commentators nearly missed was that the visit to the school not only produced the most emotional moments of her entire visit , but that the speech was also a profoundly moving , very personal statement of her political purpose and the new role that she is still in the process of creating as the president 's wife .
It was the only speech she made during her trip , and the school had , apparently , been deliberately chosen :
girls - only , inner - city , its pupils , of whom 20 % are the children of refugees or asylum seekers , speak a total of 55 different languages and 92 % of whom are from a black or minority background .
It was her first speech , she pointed out , as first lady on a foreign visit ; she mentioned it several times , in fact , as if she was having problems believing it herself .
And then , carefully , using personal stories and anecdotes , she drew parallels between her life and those of the girls in front of her , at times appearing close to tears .
"" I want you to know that we have very much in common .
For nothing in my life 's path would have predicted that I would be standing here as the first lady of the United States of America .
There was nothing in my story that would land me here .
I was n't raised with wealth or resources of any social standing to speak of ...
"" If you want to know the reason why I 'm standing here , it 's because of education .
I never cut class .
Sorry I do n't know if anybody here is cutting class .
I never did .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
I loved being on time .
I loved getting my work done .
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world . ""
A day later , those words were still buzzing in the air .
"" I definitely agree with that , "" said Shereka .
"" Being smart is cool .
I want to work hard and do really well
and then I want to go to university and become a criminal justice lawyer .
"" Why a lawyer ? ""
Because I believe that everybody has rights . ""
Both Nuria and Shereka closely followed the US presidential election and said that , even before her visit , Michelle Obama had inspired them both , girls born thousands of miles away , personally .
"" You can relate to her story .
She said , ' I 'm a working - class girl . '
And more or less all of us are working - class .
She made it .
And it made me think : if she can do it , so can I. ""
For a lesson in how to empower young women , you could do no better than to listen to Michelle Obama 's speech in its entirety .
The news bulletins picked up its highlights , the point where , very close to tears , she said : "" When I look at a performance like this , it just reminds me that there are diamonds like this all over the world .
All of you are jewels .
You are precious and you touch my heart .
And it 's important for the world to know that there are wonderful girls like you all over the world .
"" Why do you think she was so moved , I asked Nuria and Shereka . ""
Well , I mean , we was fabulous , "" said Nuria .
"" We was really good . ""
"" I think she saw a bit of herself in us , "" said Shereka .
Even a day on , it 's impossible not to be heartened by how much these girls were touched .
Brenda Mensah , 16 , who sang the solo , said her parents only found out from watching the news , "" and my dad was just screaming and screaming and my mum had two mobile phones pressed to her ears
and we had relatives in Ghana who 'd seen me and my uncle from the States rang
and he 'd seen me "" .
She was nervous , she said , and then she was n't . ""
When I saw her there , my eyes popped .
They were like eggs .
And then she gave me this encouraging smile and my confidence
just went up , it went sky - rocketing .
I 'm still flying now . ""
But then , this is what the speech , what Michelle Obama 's political agenda , is all about .
It 's about trying to promote a role for women , particularly young women , that goes beyond discussions of the relative merits , or not , of Argyle cardigans .
More than anything else , it was an attempt to imbue them with the confidence to make good choices .
What 's interesting , of course , is the way in which she so naturally filled the Diana role , a role that , until now , we seemed to have forgotten we needed , or that ever existed .
Gill McLay , the school 's receptionist , who is as starry - eyed as any of the pupils , said some of the staff were crying , "" and I almost was .
She 's just got that human touch , has n't she ? ""
She has .
She had already "" hugged "" the Queen - their hands had rested momentarily on each other 's backs .
Or as the Daily Mail put it , "" an electrifying moment of palpable majesté : a breach of centuries - long protocol ... "" and which the New York Daily News noted was last attempted by Paul Keating , the Australian prime minister in 1992 , which promptly landed him with the nickname "" The Lizard of Oz "" .
She had been the star of a spouses ' dinner hosted by Sarah Brown and attended by what a Downing Street spokesman called "" the cream of British womanhood "" , including JK Rowling , and Dame Kelly Holmes .
And she had visited Maggie 's Cancer Caring Centre at Charing Cross Hospital , where another of her unscheduled hugs had occurred with Trudi Cogdell , a 38-year - old mother of five , who has advanced breast cancer .
There 's no denying that she has a Diana - ish effect .
Cogdell told reporters that she 'd been told Michelle Obama would stand "" a few metres away .
But as soon as she walked in the door , she came and sat down right next to me .
She said , ' Come on , big hugs ' , and she cuddled me and my children . ""
But for all the hugs , Michelle Obama is no Diana
and it was her visit to the school , and more particularly the speech that she delivered there , that thwarted the attempt by the Anglo - American press to reduce her Democratic politics and feminist principles into nothing more than a fashion cypher whose sole purpose is to have her clothing choices beatified by their mutual consent .
She 's as much an ideologue as her husband and , while Barack Obama is having to make hard choices in an ever - worsening economic climate , what the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson speech demonstrated is how Michelle Obama has become the political yin to his yang ; the up to his down .
Jo Dibb , the headteacher , is n't quite sure why , out of all the schools in London , hers was picked . ""
A piece of paper landed on my desk saying , ' Would you like a talk from the US cultural attaché on civil rights ? '
and I gave it to the librarian and said , ' Do n't feel obliged ' .
But she went ahead and organised it
and he was apparently very impressed by the quality of the girls ' questions . ""
And then the next thing I know , I 'm coming back from lunch , and my PA says , ' You 'd better sit down .
The US embassy has just called and asked if you 'd like to have Michelle Obama give a speech at the school . '
"" There 's no doubting the huge sense of achievement that everyone at the school feels .
Or the pride they take in it .
Brenda Mensah said : "" We are always involved in good things .
Islington schools always get a bad press .
But EGA is getting better and better by the day .
We all come together as a team .
I 'm so proud of it .
Definitely . ""
But Islington schools do get a bad press .
For years , Islington 's schools have been held up as textbook examples of both Labour 's failures and the hypocritical double standards of some of its politicians .
And it 's hard not to wonder if there was any Downing Street input into the choice of location for Michelle Obama 's speech .
It 's not just Tony Blair who refused to send his children to the borough 's schools .
Emily Thornberry , the local Labour MP , who lives a couple of streets away , sends hers to a grammar school 13 miles away in Potters Bar ; Margaret Hodge , MP and former Islington council leader , sent hers to schools in neighbouring Camden ; and , most recently , Boris Johnson spoke of "" extracting "" his children from the state system "" because I live in Islington "" .
"" Did he really say that ? ""
Dibb asks .
"" If he did , I think that 's very , very sad . ""
In its last Ofsted inspection , the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was declared "" outstanding "" and , although it sits in a network of streets dominated by council estates , just a few hundred yards away are the Georgian villas of Barnsbury , including Richmond Avenue , where the Blairs used to live , now the haunt of City lawyers and bankers , all of whom refuse to send their children to the local school .
Islington schools have always been what Dibb calls "" a hot potato "" .
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson opened in 1960 as Risinghill Comprehensive , one of the country 's first , but was shut down five years later for being "" too liberal "" .
After years of bad press , it has picked itself up and is outperforming all expectations : it 's just that the middle classes , who live nearby , refuse to believe it .
Is there a political analogy in here ?
That the government has delivered on education but we 're all just too stubborn to believe it ?
Or is it just a coincidence that , out of all the schools in all of London , the one closest to Tony Blair 's old house just happened to be picked , the one that Boris refuses to send his daughter to ?
Or is it the reverse ?
A stark illustration of the claim by the Sutton Trust , an educational charity , that the type of social mobility so dazzlingly embodied by Michelle Obama has actually worsened under Labour .
How much more damning can it be that it takes an American politician to find something so positive and inspiring in a school shunned by its own MP ?
Whatever .

As you know , I agree broadly that this is the tone we should be striking internationally , and this week it pretty much worked .

2009-04-13,"Tens of thousands of children crowded the White House lawn today to roll Easter eggs , eat healthful snacks and play games , with some skipping school to accept Barack Obama 's invitation to frolic on the White House grounds .
The 30,000 children , parents and other well - wishers enjoyed a day - long series of music , games and food , courtesy of Michelle Obama , who is the event 's official host .
Pop star Fergie sang the national anthem , and Ziggy Marley was scheduled to perform .
"" Our goal today is just to have fun , "" the first lady told the children from a balcony overlooking the south lawn .
"" We want to focus on activity , healthy eating .
We 've got yoga , we 've got dancing ,
we 've got storytelling , we 've got Easter egg decorating .
We 've got basketball - a little soccer , as well .
And we want everybody to think about moving their bodies .
"" Vice - president Joseph Biden and his wife Jill Biden arrived with an Easter bunny .
Michelle and the president wore casual dress .
Seven - year old Sasha sported a blue headband , purple skirt and hot pink tights with black and white trainers , 10-year old Malia wore a navy blue and light blue striped sweater and blue pants .
The White House ordered more than 30,000 wooden souvenir eggs ( made from ecologically sustainable timber ) , and also prepared 13,000 boiled and dyed eggs for the children , White House aides said .
The president , Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha kicked off the day , which also featured games led by professional athletes and local high school sport stars .
"" All the kids were having fun , "" President Obama said later .
"" It reminds us why we do the work we do . ""
The White House said the first White House easter egg roll took place in 1878 when President Rutherford Hayes invited Washington children gathered at the gates onto the grounds .
It has taken place every year except during the World Wars and during President Harry Truman 's renovations in the 1950s .
This year , the White House distributed tickets online .
Guests came from 45 states and Washington ."
2009-04-15,"Barack and Michelle Obama made $ 2.7 m ( £ 1.8 m ) last year , mostly from sales of the president 's books , and donated $ 172,000 to charity , according to the couple 's tax return released this evening by the White House .
The couple also reported income from the US Senate , where Obama drew a salary until he resigned shortly after winning the presidential election , and from the University of Chicago hospitals , where Michelle Obama worked as an administrator .
Obama 's Dreams from my Father has been on the New York Times best seller list for 142 weeks , and his 2006 political tome
The Audacity of Hope , 67 .
The couple donated to 37 charities , including $ 25,000 in contributions to Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere ( Care ) and the United Negro College Fund .
They paid more than $ 47,000 in tuition to the University of Chicago Laboratory School , where daughters Malia and Sasha attended before the family moved to Washington in January .
The Obamas paid $ 933,000 in taxes to the federal government and the state of Illinois .
The self - made millionaires earned nearly four times the 2007 earnings of George and Laura Bush , who are wealthy in part due to Bush 's family holdings .
Obama 's 2009 salary as US president is $ 400,000 ."
2009-04-18,"This article is the subject of a legal complaint made on behalf of Mr Stefano Pilati .
We have agreed to publish a response from Mr Stefano Pilati which may be found here .
It is a sign of a quiet revolution in an industry where image is everything : for the past three months the fashion bible Vogue has put a black woman on its cover in America .
The move has sent ripples though the fashion industry , which many have long regarded as discriminating against black models in favour of an aesthetic idealising a very Caucasian image of beauty .
But no longer .
The great moment came in March when America 's first black first lady , Michelle Obama , stared from the cover of Vogue .
She was followed in April by the singer Beyoncé .
Now , in May , it 's the turn of black model Liya Kebede .
The covers have been hailed by some as the moment fashion finally came to terms with its less than stellar record in celebrating non - white models .
It has been mirrored by a greater visibility of black models on the runways of fashion shows and a new fetish for Africa that is sweeping through many design houses . ""
Fashion , and Vogue , are celebrating diversity , "" said Edward Enninful , a top stylist and fashion director who works closely with the magazine .
But the impetus for the changing attitudes could lie a long way from the world of haute couture and its powerful designers .
The key is Michelle Obama .
There is little doubt that she is the biggest political icon to hit the fashion industry since Jackie Onassis .
Her face stares from magazine covers , her favoured designers become overnight sensations and the clothes she wears often sell out in the shops as soon as she is seen in them .
Some have complained at the triviality of the phenomenon , saying that as America faces the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , that the media focus on Michelle 's newest dress is trivial at best and irresponsible at worst .
But that ignores the real powers of fashion .
Fashion houses and their models can influence the way millions of Americans think , act and feel about themselves .
That can be for ill - with the modern obsession with thinness .
Or it can be for good - in the shape of Michelle .
A black woman - and also a well - built , professional , educated , older woman - is staring out from the magazine stands and asking Americans to be like her .
It was a debate that raged across the newspapers and blogosphere in the early days of the Obama presidency , sparking furious arguments and pithy headlines on both sides .
The source of all this acrimony ?
Not climate change , not healthcare and not Afghanistan or Iraq .
No , for many people the real hot topic of conversation in the wake of Barack Obama 's inauguration was Michelle 's predilection for baring her arms .
There is no exaggerating the fascination that the American media have with her .
Her clothing choices fuel endless segments on cable news and countless column inches in print and online .
An entire website , Mrs O , has been set up to catalogue every fashion move that Michelle makes .
When she chose a dress from Jason Wu to be her inaugural gown , it catapulted the designer to overnight success .
Wu had set up his label only in 2006 ; now he is one of the hottest names in the fashion world .
That in turn is revealing a new economic power in fashion for black people ( after all , the colour that never goes out of style is the green of a dollar bill ) . ""
Michelle Obama and her daughters are forcing advertisers to have a new interest in black beauty , "" said Qianna Smith , fashion editor at Essence magazine .
Everyone is obsessed . ""
She has got an innate sense of how she wants to look .
It goes beyond clothes .
Jackie O had it .
Princess Di had it .
Michelle Obama has it , "" said Enninful .
It probably helps that Laura Bush - who had Michelle 's job for the past eight years - definitely did not have it .
Though Laura Bush remained popular , even as her husband plumbed the depths of national disdain , she was never adopted by the fashion industry .
She wore variations on the same homespun fashions for most of the decade .
Michelle Obama has been very different .
Though it would have been easy to play it safe , she has made a conscious decision to make fashion statements .
They are not radical .
She favours black and keeps her chosen designs classic , but they are nonetheless statements .
"" I admire it a great deal .
She has an endless sense of style .
Has anyone made an impact so quickly as she has ?
The Obamas have not been in office for 100 days yet .
Imagine what it might be like after four , or even eight , years , "" said Tai Beauchamp , a fashion expert and a former deputy editor at Vibe Vixen magazine .
Indeed .
But what is truly remarkable about Michelle 's emergence as the epitome of American grace , style and fashion is that it was not so long ago that Middle America was supposed to be terrified of her .
In 2008 , as her husband and Hillary Clinton battled for the Democratic nomination , Michelle was often seen as a potential weak spot .
Vicious internet rumours swirled around her political opinions .
She was portrayed by critics as a pushy and fire - breathing radical .
One especially vicious and untrue rumour - one that prompted direct questions to the Obama campaign - suggested she had used the word "" whitey "" at a conference in Chicago .
But that was then and this is now .
Michelle Obama has safely transformed her image from potential radical to America 's homecoming queen and the nation 's darling .
Fashion has played a big role in that . ""
The election of a black president , and his wife 's enormous popularity , are both part of the same cultural shift .
America is changing from a culture of assimilation to a culture of pluralism , "" said BJ Gallagher , a Los Angeles - based sociologist and author .
But Michelle Obama is changing fashion as much as embracing it .
Her portrait that stares out of the March issue of Vogue - which was shot by famed photographer Annie Leibowitz - is a revolution .
She is tall , middle - aged and has a robust physique .
She wears a magenta dress and looks as powerful and confident as a highly - educated lawyer should do .
In short , she looks far more like an ordinary American than any half - starved , botox - injected celebrity or model ever could . ""
Michelle Obama is exactly the sort of woman that the fashion industry has sought to exclude for 100 years , "" said Amy Larocca , a fashion writer for New York magazine .
There is little doubt that is true .
The fashion industry has historically played fast and loose with the sort of colour bar that could not exist in other industries .
Bar a handful of top names , there are few black models on the runways of the fashion world .
Nor , historically , have they been much more than tokens on magazine covers or fashion shoots .
In 2007 top designer Stefano Pilati complained to a Washington Post fashion reporter ( who was black ) that he could not find black models that had the right body proportions and so did not design clothes for a black body shape .
"" You ca n't find [ black models ] that are beautiful and with the right proportions , "" he said .
What was even more shocking was the fact that the comments were buried near the bottom of the resulting piece and they elicited little in the way of outrage . ""
Can you imagine another industry that does that ?
A novelist saying he does not write books for black readers ?
Or a director saying he does not make a film for a black audience ? "" asked Larocca .
The fact is - no matter what the current popularity of Michelle - there are still comparatively few black faces in fashion , especially among models .
Just ask Bethann Hardison , a black former model who has become the leading voice for change in the industry : "" I am sure all these fashion designers voted for Obama but they still have a lily - white roster of models , "" she said .
She welcomed the role that Michelle was playing but felt the proof would be seen on the catwalks .
Only when the models sashaying down the runways were a genuine mix of races would the "" Obama revolution "" really have taken off in fashion . ""
Talk to me in two years .
We 'll see what happens when the dust settles down , "" she said ."

2009-04-23,"After a week of living with Bo , the Obama family 's dog , Michelle Obama has given her verdict .
He 's a little crazy .
While speaking before a group of 100 children for a Take Your Child to Work Day event at the White House , Michelle Obama said she is busy training the Portuguese water dog and told a recent tale : "" It was like 10 o'clock .
Everybody was asleep and we hear all this barking and jumping around .
The president and I came out and we thought somebody was out there .
And it was just Bo .
He was playing with his ball .
And it was like there was another person in the house .

So he likes to play a lot . ""
In addition to making a lot of noise , Bo has another naughty habit . ""
He loves to chew on people 's feet , "" the first lady said ."
2009-04-23,"The voters appear to have made their choice abundantly clear in South Africa 's election .
Now the president - in - waiting , Jacob Zuma , must make a delicate diplomatic choice of his own : which of his wives will be the country 's first lady ?
When Zuma attends events such as the G20 , at which the Wags attracted much attention recently , there is likely to be only one seat allocated to his spouse alongside the likes of Michelle Obama , Sarah Brown and Carla Bruni - Sarkozy .
Zuma once told a television interviewer : "" There are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they 're monogamous .
I prefer to be open .
I love my wives and I 'm proud of my children . ""
When the president of the African National Congress ( ANC ) voted in his rural Zulu homeland yesterday , one of his wives stood to the side watching patiently as he was mobbed by cheering crowds and reporters .
Nompumelelo Ntuli , 34 , Zuma 's youngest wife , was soon attracting her own crowd of admirers .
Women whispered : "" Is n't she beautiful ! "" as Ntuli , decked out in an apricot and blue tie - dye outfit , cast a smile . ""
Jesus is Lord ! ""
was all she said in response to questions .
Reports conflict on how many times Zuma , 67 , a Zulu traditionalist and unabashed polygamist , has married over the years .
His first wife is Sizakele Khumalo , whom he has known for 50 years and married in 1973 .
He we d Ntuli last year , and reportedly was married again in January to Thobeka Mabhija , a Durban socialite with whom he is said to have two children .
Two more wives are no longer with him .
Kate Mantsho Zuma killed herself in 2000 .
He divorced the other , Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , in 1998 , although she remains a trusted aide and , as the country 's foreign affairs minister , is expected to join his cabinet .
He is said to have more than 10 children ; possibly as many as 18 .
South African law recognises such marriages , although fewer young South Africans are entering into them because they are seen as expensive and old - fashioned .
It remains common among several tribes , however , including the Zulus and Swazis .
In the contest to be first lady , Khumalo has the seniority and experience but Ntuli has the glamour and ease in social situations .
Khumalo , who presides over the family homestead near the school where Zuma voted in Kwanxamalala , rarely appears in public .
Ntuli , who uses her maiden name , as is customary in polygamous marriages to differentiate among the wives , has been more active outside the home .
She organised a prayer meeting in south - eastern South Africa earlier this year , calling for political tolerance , and established a community development foundation .
ANC officials decline to comment , insisting that it is a private matter for Zuma ."
2009-04-28,"University of California Merced 's commencement might have been a modest event with plenty of room for mom , dad and everyone else .
But a band of student leaders changed that by persuading first lady Michelle Obama to speak at the 16 May ceremony .
Now , the newest school in the UC system is the envy of its sister campuses , and local city officials are in planning frenzy - bracing for an influx of up to 25,000 people . ""
Amgen on steroids "" one city spokesman quipped about commencement , comparing it to the Tour of California cycling race that blew through Merced in February and attracted about 15,000 spectators .
University officials believe the Obama visit marks the first time a first lady will speak at a UC commencement .
The University of California at Berkeley newspaper reacted to the news with this editorial headline : "" Put to shame by Merced . ""
UC Merced , which opened in fall 2005 with 875 students , graduates its first full class next month .
The pioneering class of 2009 helped set up student government , founded clubs , dreamed up activities and won over Obama with little more than exuberance and less than $ 1,000 ( £ 683 ) in cards and postage stamps .
"" We like to see students create something out of nothing , "" said senior Megan Machado , 21 , of San Francisco , who will graduate with a degree in biological sciences .
"" We 're really good at that . ""
Their latest success has yielded a logistical and financial challenge .
Both the city and university are still putting together budgets and looking for sponsors to help with the cost .
What would have been a relatively small commencement in the campus quad now is a ticketed , hours - long event expected to lure thousands of people to a campus bordered by pastures and fed by a two - lane road .
UC Merced , with about 2,700 students , does n't have enough parking spaces - or even enough seats - to accommodate the expected crowd .
Officials are developing off - site parking plans that rely on shuttle buses ; they 're also securing bids on everything from chairs to mobile bathroom trailers .
Last week , crews installed nearly two acres of sod in "" the bowl "" a low - lying spot on campus where commencement is scheduled .
Authorities still are figuring out how best to use the space to maximise seating .
"" It 's fair to say there 's been a real outpouring of interest "" since Obama accepted the invitation , said Janet Young , associate chancellor and chief of staff at UC Merced .
That includes the pool of graduates .
UC Merced holds only one commencement annually , so students who finished degrees last fall or are on track to finish next fall also can walk in the ceremony .
About 500 are expected to take part . ""
Suddenly , everybody 's ready to graduate , "" said campus spokeswoman Patti Waid Istas .
The UC campus identifies with the town of Merced but is situated north - east of the town .
The city of about 80,000 people has been in the news most recently for its high home foreclosure rate .
Merced mayor Ellie Wooten was happy to field questions on another topic .
Commencement is likely to bring the biggest - ever crowd of people to Merced .
"" Those kids were something else , "" she said of the students who landed the Obama visit .
"" I 'm very proud of them . ""
So , how did they do it ?
By aiming high , student leaders say .
Michelle Obama 's name was thrown out in late January as a few seniors brainstormed about potential speakers just after inauguration day , said senior Yaasha Sabba , 22 , of San Francisco .
He is president of Associated Students , the campus student government .
Out of deference to the president 's schedule - and "" because we wanted him to fix the economy "" - students decided against inviting him , Sabba said .
Soon , student leaders cobbled together a "" Dear Michelle "" campaign that included a YouTube video , Facebook page and personal letters .
They tapped into a Valentine 's Day theme by printing up cards and asking students , staff and others to write personal messages .
Each of the roughly 970 cards was addressed by hand .
"" Why ca n't we use labels ? ""
someone asked . ""
Because that would be too easy for us , "" Sabba answered .
Obama accepted the commencement invitation during the university 's spring break ; White House officials said she was touched by the campaign ."

What she said â€¢
What they said The woman 's woman Tough , ambitious , clever - and very normal Michelle Obama 's Secret Service code name is Renaissance .
This is apt .
The role of First Lady has long seemed old - fashioned , even moribund , and those who tried to fiddle with it did so at their peril .
While a revolution was taking place in the lives of most American women , Jacqueline Kennedy kept her own bra firmly on , devoting herself instead to interior decoration and the replanting of the Rose Garden .
Thereafter , a pattern was set .
Forget Eleanor Roosevelt : it was the job of the First Lady , be she ever so boring ( Barbara Bush ) or ever so brittle ( Nancy Reagan ) , to write menus , to commission pretty new china , and to advance various uncontroversial Good Causes .
She was allowed to care about flowers and trees ( Lady Bird Johnson ) or refugees ( Rosalynn Carter ) , but not too much , and not too politically .
When Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Washington , maiden name still in tow , and promptly abandoned the White House chef to his recipe books while she took on a job attempting to overhaul healthcare , there was widespread outrage .
How dare she ?
It was n't long before poor old Hillary was back indoors , plumping cushions , writing invitations and chewing her fist .
Obama is only three months into her strange new career as First Lady , yet already the job feels refreshed : less dusty , less embarrassing , less tight - assed .
To all intents and purposes , she really has effected some kind of renaissance , not by bagging some high - profile role as , say , Barack 's Middle East envoy - she made it clear right from the start that politics was not part of her own plan - but simply by being herself : a wife and a mother , but also a clever , educated woman .
She is the first First Lady anyone can remember who seems remotely like the rest of us , or other women we know , and not just because she is only 45 ( Hillary Clinton , remember , was 45 when she became First Lady , Laura Bush was 54 ) .
She has a quality that can not be faked : to be prosaic about it , she is normal .
Women can scent normality at 100 paces , not to mention through the pages of a glossy magazine .
We know it when we see it .
And while we can be merciless about other women , passing judgment on them in an instant , we are keen on sisterhood , too .
Obama feels like a sister : feminine , and with hard - felt ideas about domesticity , but in no sense a daffy pinny - wearer ; tough and ambitious , but without having appropriated male behaviour as a way of getting on .
This paradigm shift feels like a minor miracle , and you ca n't help but feel that Hillary Clinton , so often and so horribly reviled , must look at Michelle , in her perky cardigans and her J Crew skirts , and wonder how she has pulled it off .
In the beginning , after all , Obama was regularly characterised in the press as an "" angry black woman "" ( her speech to an audience in Milwaukee in which she said : "" For the first time in my life , I am proud of my country "" went down about as well as some of Hillary 's sarky comments about Tammy Wynette , standing by your man , and baking cookies ) .
What 's more , she and Hillary have plenty in common .
Both grew up in Chicago , in reasonably modest circumstances .
Both were academic ( Princeton and Harvard for Obama , Wellesley and Yale for Clinton ) .
The two also shared an early reputation for being straitlaced and determined ( Obama 's friends called her the Taskmaster ; Clinton 's high - school yearbook made some joke about how she would one day be a nun called Sister Frigidaire ) .
So how come everyone is now mad for Obama ?
It 's so unfair .
But the truth is that there was always something unconvincing about Clinton 's efforts to appear well - rounded ; a part of you always knew that she was more interested in talking about Kosovo and Gulf War syndrome than cookie recipes .
I do n't especially blame her for this - why should n't a woman be like that ?
-
but I can see that it did n't make one warm to her .
Obama , on the other hand , seems not to feel the need constantly to remind others of her intellect .
She is comfortable with girl talk .
Anecdotes about how Barack looked as he drove her home from hospital after the birth of their first child - nervous - fall from her lips easily , if not unthinkingly .
This is a generational thing .
It was Obama 's good fortune to enter the world of work at a different , and more progressive moment than Clinton .
At the same point in her life when Clinton was serving mint juleps in the Governor 's Mansion in Arkansas and worrying that her brain was turning to mush , Obama was in Chicago , working in law and later in hospital administration ; when Barack was elected senator she did n't even feel the need to move to Washington .
But perhaps it 's to do with Obama 's essential personality , too .
Granted , in reality we know little about her .
The information that we have been given has been doled out in coffee spoons .
It has to do with internet shopping - all that "" cute "" stuff you can find there ! - and the irritation she feels when the president 's undergarments fail to find their way to the laundry basket ; with Italian food , which she likes , and with her mother 's fried chicken , made with Ritz crackers in the batter , which she apparently avoids .
Still , the thing that really strikes me is that , for all the trials involved in being First Lady - and they must be legion - Obama looks like she is enjoying herself .
Gone are the long - suffering looks and clenched , lacquered smiles of past First Ladies .
She is not enduring ; she is thriving .
Her wardrobe has been much praised for its use of acid yellow and credit crunch - defying high - street bargains .
Maybe so .
What I like about it is the obvious pleasure she takes in it .
I keep imagining her tying the outsized bow on the white blouse that she wore on her big trip to Europe , and the home film that I see in my mind 's eye - she has a few attempts and then , triumphant at last , does a little twirl in front of her mirror - makes me smile .
She went to Harvard ; I think it 's OK for her to play around with outsized bows and for us to relish that play , so long as we never forget that she is only the third First Lady to have a postgraduate degree , and that one day , when all this is over , when it is her turn , she will resume her career out there in the real world .
Rachel Cooke
The power dresser
The Vogue editor 's view
In the past year Michelle Obama has redefined power dressing .
It 's taken a tall , toned black woman to show women the world over that if you are one of the most influential females in the world
it 's OK to look like you enjoy your clothes , to indulge in the pleasure of fashion and to take risks with your wardrobe .
While the wife of the President of the United States is not actively involved in negotiating world debt or waging war on terror , and is more likely to be seen digging a spadeful of organic compost into the White House garden or hugging a small child , she is nonetheless a powerful fashion role model if she so wishes to be .
And Michelle Obama most obviously does wish to be .
Her wardrobe , which ranges comfortably from the preppy accessibility of J Crew and Gap to expensive designers such as America 's young Thakoon and the well - established Narciso Rodriguez , embraces bright colour , jazzy patterns , difficult bows ( not necessarily a good thing once over 30 ) and crystalline sparkles .
Unlike the last new kid on the political - wife block , Carla Bruni - Sarkozy , she has no desire to show her respectability by wearing a sophisticated version of schoolgirl uniform , and instead uncompromisingly seems to be saying : "" Look at me - it 's such fun to be a woman . ""
Interestingly , her choice of designers has veered almost completely away from the Waspy big names of American fashion previously associated with glamorous dressing such as Ralph Lauren , Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera , and instead she champions the often mixed - race , younger gang .
Until her patronage they were relatively little known outside the fashion network : Thakoon , Jason Wu , Isabel Toledo .
But , equally interestingly , the clothes she wears from them are almost identical in style to those she might have bought from the traditional names and owe more to the Mad Men vision of 50s - style domestic femininity than they do to any edgy , androgynous new - age fashion .
She bares her famous arms in cutaway sheaths , she belts her narrow back and slim waist , wears her hemlines just below the knee to show stockingless shapely calves and ankles .
No drab pantsuits , power shoulders or serviceable tailoring for her - Michelle knows that a pencil skirt and cardi is often a girl 's best friend .
And let 's not forget that she is black and has worked her way up from a poor Chicagoan childhood .
Her obvious pleasure in faintly bling detailing - the Tom Binns crystal necklace for the inauguration , her sequined cardigan for her visit to Downing Street , her rows of bracelets - owe more than a nod to the style of her generation of black Americans .
Much as we love the way she looks , with this country 's complicated attitudes to class and appearance , would we feel the same unquestioning adoration of a privileged white woman in her position who dressed similarly ?
Alexandra Shulman Love , actually Sexual politics in the White House Imagining sex in the White House is a pastime as old as the presidency itself .
After all , if we ca n't fi nd time for it , how on earth can the leader of the free world ?
Yet JFK secretly serviced an infamous stream of lovelies in his private suites .
Conversely , Bill Clinton swears it did n't happen with Ms Lewinsky and , let 's face it , it 's even less likely that it did occur between him and Hillary .
Memories of George Bush 's reign are as faint as the image on the Turin Shroud , and he and Laura always seemed more interested in identifying sinners than having sex .
It leaves expectations of the Obamas at record highs .
My guess is that they can live up to it .
It 's rare to see a couple move so naturally around each other .
Body language is such a giveaway .
They 're never in each other 's space but always lingering comfortably on the periphery of it .
They slide together on platforms and in photos like feet into old slippers .
You never see them physically collide , or perform the kind of nervy sidelong checks that other famous duo s , like Brangelina and Posh and Becks , ca n't seem to avoid .
There 's plenty of eye contact , but it 's of a slightly combative nature
: they look like they are challenging each other to greater heights , infinitely more convincing than dewy - eyed romance .
Much appears exceptional about the new residents of America 's most famous mansion , not least that they set the benchmark pretty high when it comes to relationships .
Is it possible in such cynical times that the new President and his wife truly like each other ?
There are marriages that suggest functioning partnerships and others that survive against the odds .
There are unions that have disaster etched into them from day one and others that seem to be writ in stone .
From the evidence on display I 'd say the Michelle and Barack bond is as solid as Mount Rushmore .
There are few couples less likely to fall prey to the curse of Hello!.
Then again , as I said at the beginning , it 's all imagination â€ ¦
Mariella Frostrup A black role model
An African American woman at the top We do n't get to see women like Michelle Obama very often in American popular culture - a black professional married to the father of her children , and apparently happy and healthy .
As a black woman , for me the beauty of Obama does n't come from her make - up or her cardigans but from the fact that editorial decision - makers and entertainment executives ca n't control her image .
But even now there 's an undercurrent in media coverage suggesting that someone like Obama does n't belong - as if somehow this Harvard - educated attorney and former executive squeaked in under the wire , and that it 's a miracle that she knows which fork to use , and that she is some alien being standing next to the Queen .
While it 's fun to watch her on TV - the clothes , the waves , the trademark Michelle Obama hugs - it feels similar to the coverage of Olympic figure skating , where the commentators ' incessant chatter ignores the athleticism and obsesses over the costume choice .
The worst outcome of the attention focused on Obama would be the suggestion that she is an "" exception "" or "" rare "" .
She 's extraordinary , but I know plenty of women like her .
We 're here .
We can be glamorous .
We can comport ourselves appropriately on the world stage and stand shoulder to shoulder with heads of state .
Michelle is a reminder that black American women are not the sum of the stereotypes and dysfunction on constant display in the media .
She is exactly where she is supposed to be .
And when the world sees her , the world gets to see us .
Gina McCauley
A girl 's best friend What you see is what you get At first
I hardly noticed her .
I was too busy looking at him .
But then that 's another of her strengths : nothing about her says "" Look at me "" , but when you do get around to looking , there 's something startling and graceful there .
Michelle seems careful , intelligent , alert , aware , but somehow also unguarded , unaffected .
She looks like a woman who likes other women , someone who would ask you a question about your work , your world , your family , and listen with real attention to the answer .
You feel it might be possible to have a proper conversation , to explore , to laugh .
There is a warmth to her .
She would be exhilarating to have as a friend .
I like the shape of her .
The way she looks like she 's grown a little sheepishly into her tallness .
The best thing about Michelle 's much talked about clothes is you can imagine her first thing in the morning , alive and naked , putting them on .
She is wonderfully , unremittingly physical .
We know she touched the Queen , but she touches other people , too : a slender wrist , comfortable against her husband 's shoulder , both hands of a child spontaneously grasped on a dance floor .
A high five .
That sudden smile .
I like her apparent humility , her just detectable shyness , her palpable sense of humour , her willingness to look thrilled and happy , her touching lack of cool , her mad new dog and her vegetables and the genuine delight that shines from her daughters ' faces .
Most of all , I like the fact that she looks happy - and she looks as if she makes other people happy , too .
Julie Myerson
The trump card How she wins him more votes Barack Obama could not have done it on his own .
An obvious point to make , perhaps , but consider what the presidential campaign - or the White House - would look like without Michelle Obama .
She is not simply a supporting cast member , as most other First Ladies have been ; she is not a competitor .
She is a human chemical that drastically changes the perception of Barack Obama himself .
If he was considered too statesmanlike , she was accessible ; if his origins were foreign and disparate , she could be traced to a single block in Chicago ; if he was thought not black enough , her background made up for that ; if anyone worried that he was too black , she played up family ties that were universal .
In one of the most morally inflammatory elections of all time , Obama made everything seem natural : she talked about her children , she gently teased her husband , she bought her clothes online .
Most importantly , she makes her husband seem like a superhero and a human being at the same time .
Everybody loves a superhero ; but will everybody vote for one ?
Almost certainly not .
Obama normalises , neutralises : she instructs her staff not to clean up after the children because they must learn to do it themselves ; her mother has moved in upstairs ; when an aide comes to tell her the President is on his way home , she says , "" No kidding "" , because she can already hear the helicopter .
In a recent interview with Oprah Winfrey , she said : "" Barack is a human being with flaws , but those flaws are not fundamental .
They do n't hit upon things that are intolerable to me .
In terms of his core values , he has never disappointed me .
He is a very consistent person - which is why I knew unequivocally that he would be a phenomenal president . ""
That Barack Obama is loved like this at all makes you love him more ; that he is loved in this way by this woman
makes him the most powerful creature on earth - all the more so because you feel she would not let him abuse that power .
The personal has never been so fortuitously political .
Gaby Wood Kids and racism Breaking the colour barrier
It is a moment of awe , where "" little people "" feel they are the "" big "" people , because the "" big "" people appreciate them so much .
Many of the children of Kids Company experienced a profound sense of legitimacy when the Obamas entered the White House , having been rejected for years , insulted through racism and hatred ; they never thought a couple with the same colour as their skin would lead America .
Barack Obama was recognised as the inspiration ; Michelle Obama was a surprise - embracing , attuned : an icon in her own right .
Kids Company founder Camila Batmanghelidjh Special relationships "" I do hugs "" Who hugged who first ?
Did Michelle Obama reach out and put her arm around the Queen ?
Or was it the other way around ?
The Daily Mail was in no doubt .
Hug - gate , the story and image which appeared on front pages around the world and threatened to eclipse the G20 summit , was "" an electrifying moment of palpable majestÃ
© :
a breach of centuries - long protocol "" .
It was not simply that Obama hugged : it was that the Queen hugged back .
A simple , tender thing which had never happened before - although the New York Daily News pointed out that Paul Keating , the Australian prime minister , tried it back in 1992 and was promptly nicknamed the Lizard of Oz .
It was the first hug of Michelle Obama 's first official overseas state visit , and the most spectacular , but not the only one .
The next day she was hugging mother - of - five Trudi Cogdell , who had been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer .
Sarah Brown had taken Michelle to Charing Cross Hospital , where Cogdell was briefed beforehand that the First Lady would stand "" a few metres away .
But as soon as she walked in , she sat down next to me and said : ' Come on , big hugs , ' and cuddled me and my children . ""
The same day , she made an emotional speech at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in Islington , a school where 92 % of the pupils are black or ethnic minority and in the top 2 % most deprived in the country , and compared herself , and her story , to them .
The reaction she received was of the type more usually accorded to a boy band than the wife of a world leader .
At the end , pupils rushed the stage , and one tried to shake her hand , but as Sabrina Chowdhury , 16 , told the press , she rebuffed them : "" She said to us : ' I do hugs ' and just hugged us .
It was amazing . ""
In just two days , Michelle Obama carved out a niche for herself which encompasses not just being First Lady , but practically the most totemic of all female roles : the Good Mother .
Carole Cadwalladr
First Lady , Dinner Lady
She cooks , she cleans , she sows So , Michelle Obama .
Housewife Superstar ?
Can you imagine Hillary even pretending to go along with this ?
Or Cherie , who famously penned a "" Memo to Michelle "" , outlining the pitfalls of being wife to a world leader : that you can have influence but no power ; that your own views are disenfranchised .
"" Whatever it is you 're doing as First Lady , it is not being equal to the President of the United States , "" opined Cherie .
"" Well , duh , "" you can imagine Michelle thinking , or even : "" Lighten up , ladies . ""
It 's one of the many reasons Michelle O is so interesting .
Some of us were worried at first - were they going to muzzle this woman , turn her into a Stepford First Lady ?
However , she has neither struggled with her new role nor allowed it to diminish her .
Here is a woman who , when faced with the cringeworthy presidential candidate wifely "" bake - off "" , responded with an ironic wink and the most laid - back shortbread recipe you ever saw .
A wife who is happy to look after her "" snorey stinky "" man because he looks after her right back .
A mother who allowed her daughters their White House pooch , but you can bet that away from the cameras there was a lecture about pooper scoopers and responsibility .
No Surrendered Wife ( or surrendered anything ) :
When she talks about food , you can believe she cooks - sometimes hurriedly , even badly .
If and when she dons an apron , it will be to keep her clothes clean , with no worthy fretting about the connotations .
This is the essence of Obama - smart , witty , warm , practical , happy .
Complete .
The Harvard - educated former hospital administrator seems to have taken the true feminist line that personal choice is power .
Hillary should n't be damned for wanting the presidency , nor Laura Bush for not wanting it .
However , Michelle represents a new wave of flexi - womanhood , for whom domesticity is n't a cage , a trap , but rather an opportunity .
Downtrodden , diminished , disenfranchised ?
Come off it , we 're talking about Mummy Biceps here .
Looking at Obama , Den Mom
In Excelsis , you get the impression that she is n't going to live her life through her husband and children but simply with them , alongside them .
Barbara Ellen
And she 's tall !
The view from up there Before Michelle Obama , the female celebrity could be broadly divided into two height categories : teeny - tiny actress with elfin features or improbably tall supermodel with no hips .
Michelle - all glorious 5 ft 11 in of her - is the first woman in the public eye to celebrate so defiantly both her height and her curves .
She exudes self - confidence in her stature .
She does not fall into that classic tall - person trap of slouching apologetically towards shorter mortals .
And when she met the Queen , Michelle did not gloss over the yawning height chasm that lay between them but posed for the photographers with her shoulders back and her head held high .
Speaking as a tall woman myself , it is cheering to have Michelle Obama as my new role model .
When I had my growth spurt at 17 , there was no one like her to identify with .
At 5 ft 11 in , I stood out , quite literally , from my friends and spent my teenage years being warned by my grandmother that I would never attract a husband if I pigheadedly insisted on getting bigger .
So what I most admire about Michelle Obama 's height is that she does not seek to disguise it .
Unlike Carla Bruni - Sarkozy , Michelle does not wear flat - soled ballet pumps in case her spouse feels emasculated .
Barack is clearly a man secure enough to be able to revel in his wife 's stature .
Michelle 's height complements his masculinity rather than challenges it .
Like him , most of us would want Michelle on our team .
Especially if it was basketball .
Elizabeth Day Daddy 's girl
Why Barack will always be second best If you had to nominate the one man in Michelle Obama 's life who informs the decisions she makes , it would n't be the 44th President of the United States .
This is a woman who is Ã¼berorganised - over prepared , a stickler for order .
Someone who , as a mother of two small daughters , would set the alarm for 4.30am in order to squeeze in some gym time .
She might sound obsessive , a tad controlling , until you remember that her father , Fraser Robinson III , was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was only one .
As this unpredictable , humbling disease got worse , as his walking sticks were replaced with a motorised chair , as getting dressed grew more difficult , he would rise earlier and earlier in order to reach work on time .
While Barack Obama struggled with his own identity , Michelle LaVaughn Robinson has always known exactly where she comes from .
Her great - great - grandfather was a slave from South Carolina .
Hers was a solid blue - collar family life - she grew up in a small apartment in a middle - class area on Chicago 's South Side . ""
No silver spoons , no magic , "" she says .
Her bedroom was the tiny living room , partitioned and shared with her elder brother Craig .
Fraser worked shifts maintaining the boilers and pumps in the city 's water - filtration plant .
Michelle 's mother , Marian , stayed at home until the children were in high school .
Saturday evenings were spent playing board games , summers were passed at a modest holiday camp .
There were rules uncannily like those she imposes on her own daughters .
With Craig , there was trust - early on in her relationship with Barack
she asked her brother to check him out over a game of basketball - and healthy competition .
"" I 'm smarter than him .
If he can get into Princeton , I can , "" she told herself .
( Their parents paid the fees with the help of an insurance policy and a credit card . )
She says her mother is her best friend .
So much
so she begged her to move into the White House .
During the election campaign her voice broke when she described the fierce stoicism with which Fraser faced life .
You could not watch your father 's body incrementally pack in - for this is what MS eventually does , to your feet and your knees , your arms and your fingers - and not learn compassion , determination .
And also , perhaps , vulnerability , although it 's a side she rarely reveals
( Craig and Marian say she 's never once phoned them in tears ) .
Her father died in 1991 , aged 56 .
Michelle was 27 .
A year later she married the second most important man in her life .
The timing can not have been a coincidence .
Louise France Working wife The Obama with the biggest job Mom - in - chief .
What a ludicrous title that is .
Like cultural brand enhancer , or chief executive officer , the more you consider it , the sillier it seems .
Unless Michelle Obama really does have a crack troop of trained mothers under her command , armed with Wet Wipes and a GPS locator of enemy naughty steps .
It 's that or she beat Angelina in an arm - wrestle for the cup ...
In fact , Obama chose Mom - in - chief as her job description because she wanted her husband to be President . ""
Princeton- and Harvard - qualified lawyer turned community affairs director "" was too scary for the voters to deal with .
They did n't want to know that until she stepped aside for his political ambitions Michelle was earning more than Barack .
Or that when he began his legal career she was his mentor .
That she 's been a determined high achiever from the moment she entered school .
We forget , but before she claimed M - I - C status , Michelle was struggling in her new public role .
She was seen as too emasculating , too political , too clumsy .
And , after she gave her husband a fist bump in celebration at his candidate nomination , too black . ""
Mom - in - chief "" dispels all of that .
For a start , it hides the fact that Michelle will still be working while in the White House .
Not for a wage , but as an extension of her old community outreach work , focusing mostly on women 's issues .
That 's OK , because her new job title implies homeliness , but of a modern kind .
Not baking cookies , but setting standards .
In fact , what Mom - in - chief does , in the way that "" stay - at - home mom "" or "" home - maker "" never can , is convey the status that many mothers have within their families .
Daddy may be off earning millions and/or changing the world , but it 's yer ma that runs the household .
Whether a woman works or not , to the chagrin of all those who call themselves feminists , the tedious fact is that most mothers are the responsible adult in the family .
Responsible for more than their own lives .
At one point , when Barack was too obsessed with his own path , his own needs , she said to him : "" I never thought I 'd have to raise a family alone . ""
So he changed and became more involved at home .
Michelle is indeed the chief of the Obamas : not just her daughters ' mother but the person who makes sure the whole family is functioning .

What she said "" There is a strong possibility that Barack will pursue a political career , although it 's unclear .

Into a Lanvin trainer , to be exact .
Visiting the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington last week to help put together food packs for poor children , she trotted out in £ 362 sneakers .
She could , perhaps , be forgiven for thinking no one would notice .
Lanvin is a discreet French label favoured by fashion insiders .
The pumps have no logos , bells or whistles to announce their provenance .
But , of course , every item she wears is dissected and her secret splurge was exposed , leaving us to ask : can trainers ever be worth £ 362 ?
Lanvin is not alone in charging top whack for sportswear :
Balenciaga , Rick Owens , Ann Demeulemeester and Dior Homme all sell trainers topping the £ 300 mark .
And they sell .
There is even a pair costing an eye - watering £ 755 from New York - based designer Alejandro Inglemo , a "" sport - luxe "" trainer made from python skin .
Why ?
When did luxury pumps sneak under the radar ?
When did plain old canvas cease to be cool ?
If you want "" fashion "" trainers you head for Converse .
All the celebrities know they 're the hipsters ' shortcut to looking cool and carefree
( Liv Tyler , Scarlett Johansson and Agyness Deyn favour All Stars ) .
And they cost just a little over £ 30 .
It 's not that the Lanvins are n't pretty - with ribbon laces in place of plain old cotton and subtle colours contrasted with the pop of metallic on the toe , they are pure shoe porn .
But they 're not worth £ 362 .
If you must succumb to the trend , try designer collaborations with sports brands : Stella McCartney for Adidas , Sergio Rossi for Puma and Christian Lacroix for Gola , which come in around the £ 100 mark ."
2009-05-07,"You might think that watching a million - strong , exultant crowd cheer on your beloved as he is sworn in as the globe 's most powerful man would be sufficient to rank as the highlight of the year so far for most people .
But not Michelle Obama – she 's just met Elmo .
The first lady has pronounced her just - filmed guest appearance on Sesame Street "" probably the best thing I 've done so far "" since she and her husband , Barack , moved into the White House .
Meeting staff at the United Nations in New York
, she explained : I 'm thrilled to be here
but I was just at Sesame Street
I 'm sorry .
And I never thought I 'd be on Sesame Street with Elmo and Big Bird , and I was thrilled .
I 'm still thrilled .
I 'm on a high .
As is the way with the famous TV series , the guest appearance had an officially more noble purpose than simply allowing someone famous to consort with giant animated figures .
In Obama 's case she was there to talk about "" nutrition and healthy eating "" , apparently .
Sesame Street is , of course , the one gig that the rich and powerful feel apparently unable to turn down .
The list of people who have appeared on the show over its 30-year history is extremely long and curiously fascinating , featuring everyone from a middle - aged Johnny Cash to a reliably wooden David Beckham , not to mention Robert De Niro ( method acting with Elmo ) , Natalie Portman ( dressing up as an elephant ) and LL Cool J ( performing a rap about mathematics ) .
But away from showbusiness , the genuinely powerful ( and their consorts ) also feel the lure of the show .
Possibly the most famous of these came in 2001 when the then UN head , Kofi Annan , mediated in a dispute over which character would sing a song .
Sadly , that one does n't seem to exist in video form on the web anymore , with the same being true for Hillary Clinton 's guest spot .
Here , though , is husband , Bill , passing on an understandably earnest message about HIV / Aids .
The former first lady Laura Bush also turned up in 2002 , following in the footsteps of her mother - in - law , Barbara Bush .

2009-05-22,"Cardigans are the comfort food of the fashion world : buttered crumpets in sartorial form .
We love them even when they are not fashionable , of course , but when the fashion spotlight swings back on to them – why , then we can have our cake and eat it .
The new patron saint of cardigans , tireless champion of this wardrobe underdog , is Michelle Obama .
Mrs O knows how to rock a cardigan right now : rather than a neutral knit shrugged timidly over the shoulders , she favours a bold , clashing colour punctuated by a belt .
After years in which cardigans have been either schoolgirlish ( Miuccia Prada and her minimal - chic , uniform - grey ) or grungy ( those extra - long black coveralls that half the fashion desk wore over skinny jeans last winter ) , the grown - up , womanly cardigan is back for the first time since the ribbon - trimmed cashmere fripperies of Voyage caused a mini - stampede to Kings Road back in 1996 .
The cardigan that works best right now is sensibly sized : the buttons should do up at waist height without gaping , but the fit should be snug around your shoulders and back .

Unwelcome visitors Friends - Along with the familiar anti - war protesters who 've been camping outside the White House for years , and the ceaseless stream of sandwich - board - wearing obsessives promoting one cause or another , you might have noticed a new arrival in the last week or two .
He 's an older , jowly guy with a fixed snarl on his face , who tends to stand at the corner of Lafayette Park , mumbling about the risk of an imminent terrorist attack , though he 's also occasionally been spotted delivering keynote lectures to the American Enterprise Institute .
This email is just to underline that the most humane and compassionate way to respond to him is NOT to give him money , or engage him in conversation , or let him strap you to the piece of wood he 's carrying to demonstrate that "" waterboarding is no big deal "" .
We 're working with DC social services to have him escorted to a "" secure location "" as soon as possible .
Oddly , he seems rather enthusiastic about this idea .
Meanwhile , if he harasses you in any way , please inform WH security .

2009-05-31,"There has been plenty of debate in recent weeks about whether Barack Obama has met promises made on the campaign trail over the environment , human rights and foreign policy .
At least this weekend the US president ­indisputably fulfilled one election pledge – by taking his wife to New York for a night out .
"" I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished , "" he said on Saturday night , as he and Michelle Obama set out for the evening .
When presidential couples decide to visit the Big Apple , even one as relaxed as the Obamas , there is no avoiding a kerfuffle .
The trip involved a short helicopter ride on Marine One , followed by a flight to New York and then a second helicopter ride into Manhattan .
That incurred the wrath of Republicans .
The Republican National Committee put out a statement contrasting the Obamas ' trip with the bankruptcy of the General Motors , once the world 's largest car manufacturer .
"" Putting on a show : Obamas wing into the city for an evening out while another iconic American company prepares for bankruptcy , "" read the statement .
The two stops on the Obamas ' New York itinerary were custom - designed for their tastes and interests .
The first was dinner at Blue Hill , a chic but understated restaurant near Washington Square .
The chef - owner grows his own vegetables , which is very much in tune with Michelle 's championing of local food movements .
Then on to Time Square and the Belasco theatre for a performance of Joe Turner 's Come and Gone by August Wilson .
The secret service had cordoned off the entire block hours before their arrival .
Wilson , who died in 2005 , is a chronicler of the black American experience through a cycle of plays set in Pittsburgh .
This play focuses on the migration of the descendants of freed slaves from the south to the north .
The Obamas would have been intrigued not only by the subject matter , but also by the controversy that surrounds this particular revival .
During his life , Wilson insisted that his plays were always directed by black artists as a means of helping to overcome discrimination within the theatre industry .
But this version for the first time has a white director , Bartlett Sher .
His appointment prompted a heated debate , with some African - American critics praising it as a step forward in race relations and others lamenting it as an assault on Wilson 's legacy .
Date over .
Back to work and a big week ahead .
Obama moves on today to deal with the fallout from the bankruptcy of GM before heading to the ­Middle East and perhaps the most important speech of his presidency so far : an address to the Muslim world in Cairo on Thursday ."
2009-06-02,"Last Saturday , the crowd at the Belasco theatre rose for a standing ovation before Joe Turner 's Come and Gone had even started .
Perhaps they were agog with anticipation for August Wilson 's much - admired drama .
More likely , they wanted to welcome two late arrivals to the audience : Barack and Michelle Obama .
( Meryl Streep , also in the orchestra seats , received no such acclaim . )
The first couple spent the evening in Manhattan , enjoying dinner and a show .
The US president released a statement , declaring : "" I am taking my wife to New York City , because I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished .
"" Commenters on the New York Times website seemed evenly divided between congratulating the Obamas on their night out and censuring them for fiddling while the economy burned , injuring the environment by taking a private plane , flying on the public 's dime – for anything , really .
One particularly injured party cried : "" How comforting to know that he has taken a few hours off of torturing and trampling on the Consatitution [ sic ] .
You do n't fool us ! !
"" Of course , no commenter found fault with the Obamas ' choice of entertainment .
How could they ?
It 's a gorgeous selection .
One of the finer works in Wilson 's 10-play century cycle , it takes place in 1911 at a Pittsburgh boarding house peopled by men and women still overwhelmed in the wake of slavery .
There 's poetry in the writing and vitality in Bartlett Sher 's direction .
The choice of a white director did spark a small controversy , but the excellence of Sher 's work quietened the naysayers .
Joe Turner is also a fine choice as it 's produced by a non - profit house , Lincoln Center .
The couple 's visit has already had a beneficial effect on the theatre .
After the Obamas ' visit , the show sold twice as many tickets as on the same day a week previously .
Unlike the Bushes , who were not known to frequent the theatre , the Obamas seem to positively relish it .
During the campaign , the couple attended The Color Purple and Michelle Obama and her daughters enjoyed Wicked and High School Musical .
In Chicago , the then - senator and his wife attended local theatres and even went to see comedy group Second City perform the show Between Barack and a Hard Place .
Perhaps Obama will set a precedent for other world leaders on their next visit stateside .
Vladimir Putin could enjoy The Lion King ( but leave his tranquiliser gun at home ) .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad might revise his understanding of the Holocaust by watching Irena 's Vow .
Kim Jong - il would thumb his nose at critics if he took in a matinee of Wicked .
Angela Merkel could celebrate women in power at Mary Stuart .
Meanwhile , Nicolas Sarkozy could pay tribute to his fellow countrywoman at God of Carnage or take Carla Bruni to Reasons to Be Pretty .
As for Gordon Brown , well the New Labour government is often derided as being filled with "" cultural philistines "" , so which shows should the prime minister choose to assuage his critics ?"
2009-06-05,"Not since the Kennedys ' Paris tour of 1961 has France been so eager to see the US first family out on a sight - seeing weekend .
Barack Obama arrived in Paris today ahead of tomorrow 's commemorations of the 65th anniversary of the D - Day Normandy landings , accompanied by his two daughters on their first foreign visit since the presidential election .
Michelle Obama flew into Paris with Malia , 10 , and Sasha , seven , on the children 's first trip to Europe .
The first lady and her daughters , who are on school holiday , will stay in Paris until Monday , staying at the US embassy not far from the Elysée Palace , where the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and his wife , Carla Bruni , spend their weekends .
And while Sarkozy 's attempts to get the families together for a weekend family photo opportunity – an important tool in the French president 's media strategy – seems to have been thwarted , Parisians were not to be denied a sighting of Michelle Obama and her daughters out on a trip to the Eiffel Tower tonight .
One potential trip that the French media had been speculating on had been dinner at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant at the top of the tower , or a possible tour of Notre Dame .
Bill and Hillary Clinton , during their 1994 visit , made an unannounced stop at Notre Dame , and strolled along the Seine before a private tour of the Louvre , guided by François Mitterrand .
Sarkozy will have a working lunch with Obama in the Normandy town of Caen before the commemorations , which will also be attended by Prince Charles and Gordon Brown .
The Elysée has stressed the positive tone of Washington - Paris relations , playing down differences over Sarkozy 's European election campaign featuring a hardline stance against Turkey joining the EU ."
2009-06-06,"They seem the perfect couple , full of glamour and bringing a dash of romance to the White House .
But the marriage between Barack and Michelle Obama was not always smooth - running in the face of the immense pressures of a political campaign .
A new book by American political journalist Richard Wolffe claims that the Obamas ' marriage went through a rocky period as Barack began his first bid to become a politician on the national stage .
In 2000 , after Obama had failed to win a race to become an Illinois congressman , the relationship was in difficulties due to the intense pressure of campaigning .
"" There was little conversation and even less romance , "" Wolffe writes in the book , Renegade :
The Making of a President , which was published last week .
The tense relations lasted for more than a year .
"" Their marriage was strained by the time their youngest daughter , Sasha , was born , "" Wolffe writes .
The root of the problem seemed to be Michelle 's belief that her husband was devoting all his time and energy to his career , while he felt she was not supportive enough of his ambitions .
"" She was angry at his selfishness and careerism ; he thought she was cold and ungrateful , "" Wolffe says .
But by the time Obama was running for the Senate in 2004 , the year in which he wowed the Democratic national convention , their difficulties had disappeared .
Wolffe quotes Michelle as saying : "" We just have to make sure the girls are fine .
We 're strong enough to take anything on and be OK at the end .
"" Wolffe is a well - known figure in American journalism and a regular pundit on the liberal - leaning news channel MSNBC .
Obama himself suggested that Wolffe write the book and gave him access to the campaign .
The title comes from the code name given to Obama by the Secret Service .
Though Wolffe got an astonishing 21 interviews with Obama over two years , the end result has been criticised by Republicans for being largely uncritical .
But even the image of the Obamas struggling in their marriage is unlikely to dampen America 's enthusiasm for its first couple .
Last weekend they jetted to New York to watch a Broadway show and have dinner - causing a hysterical reaction among much of the media that would make a Hollywood star green with envy ."
2009-06-07,"The wife of the leading opposition candidate in this week 's Iranian presidential election today threatened to sue Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for lying about her .
Zahra Rahnavard , who is married to the moderate frontrunner Mir Hossein Mousavi , also told reporters who pressed her about comparisons with the US first lady : "" I am not Iran 's Michelle Obama .
I am Zahra , the follower of Fatimeh Zahra ( the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad ) .
I respect all women who are active . ""
Rahnavard , a 61-year - old political scientist , sculptor and grandmother , wears a full - length black chador , though her headscarf does have an eye - catching , brightly - coloured floral pattern that conservatives might disapprove of as "" bad hijab "" .
"" I have liberal values on many things , but I can not decide about the hijab because it is based on the Qur'an , "" she said at a packed press conference at her husband 's campaign headquarters in central Tehran . ""
But it should n't limit what women can do .
"" The Michelle Obama parallel has added spice to Iran 's unpredictable presidential race , especially after the hardline Ahmadinejad scornfully questioned Rahnavard 's educational qualifications in the first of a series of debates last week .
Fist fights broke out in Tehran between Ahmadinejad supporters and opponents after another heated election debate on Saturday night , before Friday 's ballot .
"" I felt sorry for the president when he questioned my academic credentials because it was against the law and it was a lie , "" Rahnavard said .
"" It shows his weakness .
He does n't have anything else to tell people .
He has to apologise to the Iranian nation , to me and my husband for violating the privacy of our marriage .
"" Interest in Rahnavard has helped to propel her husband into the limelight , both at home and abroad .
The former university chancellor is often seen walking hand in hand with him .
The fact that she is seen as an asset is causing a mild stir and boosting hopes of change in Friday 's election . ""
Zahra is a bit tough and not very womanly and she does get angry easily , "" said one young woman campaign volunteer . ""
But Mousavi is very calm , so she complements him very well . ""
Rahnavard takes care to express her views with reference to Islamic values .
Asked about her attitude to the religious police patrols that check on couples and order women to cover up , she said : "" We will do anything we can to ensure that the police do n't interfere in people 's private lives .
The Qur'an says that.""Iran has not had a female cabinet minister since the 1979 revolution .
And although the Iranian constitution does not forbid women from becoming president , no female has ever been approved as a candidate ."
2009-06-09,"Michelle Obama took a whistle - stop tour of Westminster yesterday en route to America from Paris , arriving to visit some of the most venerable British institutions after one of the most dramatic and damaging weeks in the country 's recent political history .
Visiting a Westminster sullied by a foiled leadership plot , expenses scandal and the spiralling fortunes of the Labour party must have seemed a long way from the current state of US politics for Obama and her daughters .
During what was referred to widely today as a "" secret "" visit , but perhaps more appropriately catergorised as a private , unofficial tour , Obama was said to have had a meeting with Sarah Brown at Downing Street .
And from the heavy security close to Big Ben yesterday , it was surmised that the first lady took Sasha , eight , and Malia , 10 , to see Big Ben .
Obama had stayed on in Paris for sightseeing and shopping ( apparently at Bonpoint , the glamorous children 's clothing store in Saint Germain ) after the president returned to the US at the end of his trip to Europe , and she is understood to have arrived in the UK with their daughters early yesterday .
They reportedly flew to Stansted airport in Essex in a Boeing 757 US air force jet before being escorted to London by secret service agents .
After the tour of the Houses of Parliament yesterday , the first lady was photographed being driven away holding a souvenir : a tourist 's guide to the Commons , complete with a cover photo of the outgoing Speaker , Michael Martin .
Perhaps not the most appropriate memento , given the circumstances ."
2009-07-02,"It was meant to be a show case for healthy living , with the first lady , Michelle Obama , personally putting hand to pitch fork in a crowd of school children to dig up the first White House vegetable garden in more than 50 years .
Instead , an embarrassed White House admitted today that the plot - whose lettuce , herbs and other produce have been consumed by the first family , visiting dignitaries , local school children and a women 's homeless shelter - had tested positive for elevated levels of lead .
A spokeswoman for the White House said the soil in the garden had lead concentrations of 93 parts per million of lead .
Health experts say it is safe to raise leafy vegetables in soil with concentrations of 10 - 50 parts per million , and urban gardens typically have raised lead levels .
However , it is advised for young children to be tested for exposure to lead if they play in areas where lead concentrations exceed 100 parts per million .
The Environmental Protection Agency puts the threshold for dangerous lead levels at 300 parts per million .
But even though lead levels in the first garden are far below that danger zone , the disclosure is awkward for a White House which has made prominent use of the vegetable garden to define Michelle Obama 's role as First Lady , and to encourage sensible eating habits in children .
Children are especially vulnerable to exposure to lead , which can cause neurological and kidney damage , and stunt their growth .
The vegetable garden was an important symbolic break with the George Bush presidency , and it became a cause for environmentalists and the organic food movement in America who had urged the Obamas to use the White House to set an example of healthy eating .
Michelle Obama invited dozens of 10- and 11-year olds from a state elementary school in a transitional neighbourhood of Washington to the White House last March to help her dig up a 1,100 square foot plot of land near her daughters ' swing set .
Photographers were let in to take pictures of her kneeling in the dirt and wielding garden tools .
The first lady gave interviews joking about how all the members of the first famly would be required to weed on occasion .
As the weeks went on , and the White House garden grew , it became central to Michelle Obama 's efforts to rebrand herself , and banish any residual damage from the rightwing attacks of the election campaign when she was cast as the stereotypical angry black woman .
The White House featured blog posts on the garden 's progress .
The school children were invited back to tend the plot and just two weeks ago to bring in the first harvest : 73 lbs of lettuce , 12 lbs of snap peas and one cucumber .
Obama and the children then trooped into the White House kitchen to wash lettuce and shell and cook the peas for lunch , which they ate outside on red and white checked tablecloths .
Sam Kass , who followed the Obamas from Chicago as their personal chef , gave a short speech praising the gardeners for getting their yeild without resort to fertiliser or herbicides , and for using green compost .
The White House said the garden would go on . ""
The garden recently underwent extensive soil testing that proved it is completely safe , "" Katie McCormick Lelyveld , the first lady 's spokeswoman , said .
A lead level of 92 parts per million is significantly better than the government standard for a garden like this .
The White House kitchen garden team is committed to producing fresh , safe and healthy food as a learning opportunities ( sic ) about health eating , and they 'll continue to do so , "" Lelyveld said .
The White House would not say whether the Obamas or the children who had helped tend the garden would be tested for lead exposure ."
2009-08-05,"When Sally Bee from Stratford - upon - Avon received an order for her self - published cookery book from the White House she initially thought it was a practical joke .
However , she sent off the requested 12 copies to Washington and the results have been astounding .
Bee has now received an invitation from the White House to visit Michelle Obama 's kitchen garden and cook with her , has landed a book deal with a major publishing house , and is outselling Delia , Nigella and Jamie on Amazon .
The story behind the book is as startling as its impact .
Four years ago , when Sally Bee was 36 , she suffered three major heart attacks in just one week , and discovered she had been born with a major heart defect – spontaneous coronary artery dissection .
Initially given hours to live , she survived the ordeal , and went on to devise her own healthy eating and exercise regime , publishing a cookbook of her recipes , The Secret Ingredient , last May.
The book , which also features contributions from celebrities including Jeffrey Archer , Bruce Forsyth , Emma Thompson and Max Clifford , became an unexpected hit , selling 8,000 copies in weeks and hitting the number one spot on Amazon 's cookery book listings , ahead of kitchen luminaries such as Delia Smith , Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson .
Yesterday , it was sitting at the top of Amazon 's "" movers and shakers "" list , which charts the books experiencing the greatest gains in sales over the previous 24 hours .
The book has now been acquired by Collins , which will repackage and republish it next March , following it up with a second title by Bee in spring 2011 ."

A cartoon of Barack and Michelle Obama dressed as gun - toting militants and performing what rightwing commentators called a "" terrorist fist bump "" was supposed to poke fun at the smear campaign being run against the presidential candidate .
But the image in New Yorker magazine pictured the couple in an Oval Office decorated with a portrait of Osama bin Laden .
It drew widespread criticism and forced the editor , David Remnick , on to the defensive .
"" It 's clearly a joke , a parody of these crazy fears and rumours and scare tactics about Obama 's past and ideology , "" he said .
"" If you ca n't tell it 's a joke by the flag burning in the Oval Office , I do n't know what more to say . ""

2009-08-16,"He may have failed to wrest the presidency from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but Mir Hossein Mousavi at least has the satisfaction of knowing his wife has helped wring an unexpected political concession from his main rival .
Zahra Rahnavard 's appearance at her husband 's side throughout his campaign highlighted the issue of women 's rights in Iran and wooed many female voters to Mousavi 's side .
Never before in the Islamic republic 's 30-year history had a woman played such a high - profile political role , prompting some to compare Rahnavard – a sculptor and respected academic – with Michelle Obama .
Now her lasting impact has galvanised Ahmadinejad into a radical move that risks alienating his most religiously devout supporters .
In announcing his intention to appoint three women cabinet members – including Fatemeh Ajorlou as social welfare minister and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi as health minister – Ahmadinejad trumped the campaign pledges of his two other election rivals , Mehdi Karroubi and Mohzen Rezai , who each said they would appoint the country 's first female cabinet minister since the 1979 revolution .
But the social pressures prompting the appointments long pre - dated the election campaign .
"" These appointments are a result of the pressure that women 's demands have imposed on the system , "" said Asiyeh Amini , a leading women 's activist .
Female protesters played a prominent role in the unrest after the disputed election , as illustrated by the case of Neda Agha Soltan , the 26-year - old woman who became the symbol of the demonstrations after her death at the hands of a sniper was caught on film and beamed across the world ."
2009-08-19,"What , no Posh ?
She may be one of the most famous women in the world , at least as far as British editors are concerned , but Victoria Beckham has mysteriously failed to feature on a new list of the world 's ten most powerful women .
So have Madonna , Michelle Obama and Carla Sarkozy - Bruni , although America 's First Lady does make her debut further down ( at number 40 ) the complete list of 100 powerful women published annually by Forbes magazine .
The German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , retains the number one spot for the fourth year in a row , apparently because she 's led Germany out of recession sooner than expected – a feat not really matched , I suppose , by the success of Posh 's first clothes collection .
The real surprise lies in the names that occupy the next nine slots , such as Sheila Bair , chairman [ sic ] of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp in the US and Ho Ching , chief executive of Temasek , Singapore .
They appear at number two and number five respectively in a top ten made up , with the exception of Ms Merkel , entirely of businesswomen .
Half the top ten are based in the US , which could be explained either by the fact that Forbes is an American magazine or by the dominance of American companies in the international marketplace .
They 've been selected , according to the magazine , on three criteria : economic impact , media reach and career accomplishments .
One suspects the ranking is weighted towards the first measure : while I 'm sure that Angela Braly , chief executive of Wellpoint , is well - known in her own field , she hardly has the profile of Hillary Clinton ( number 36 ) or Ireland 's president Mary McAleese ( a lowly 68 ) .
Indeed , what 's striking about the Forbes top ten is its reverence for money .
Ten women holding the title of prime minister , chancellor or president make it into the top 100 , but Merkel is the sole politician in the top ten .
The list has been published only for the last six years , so it 's impossible to know what it would have looked like 25 years ago , but it 's hard to imagine Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi being overlooked in favour of Irene Rosenfeld , chief executive of Kraft Foods .
I 'm sure Rosenfeld is a big player in the business world , but is she really the sixth most powerful woman in the world ?
More influential , better - known and more of a role model than J K Rowling ?
But then Europe has only 18 entries in the top 100 this year , despite its huge economic and political profile .
The UK has four , including the Queen , who arguably has very little real power , and Angela Ahrendts , chief executive of Burberry , who returns to the list at number 70 after dropping off last year .
Burberry is a controversial company in the UK , having closed factories in South Yorkshire and South Wales , and has been widely criticised for cutting British jobs and moving production to China .
At first sight , the Forbes list looks like bad news for women who aspire to other forms of power : cultural , social and political .
But what it really tells us is n't about powerful women but how power itself is perceived in a country where commerce trumps everything else .
Despite the recession , and whether you 're male or female , the US remains a country where money talks louder than anything else ."
2009-08-20,"Just back from holiday , looking refreshed weeks before she is expected to win the September election as Germany tentatively eases itself out of recession , Angela Merkel enjoyed more good news today : she is still the most powerful woman in the world .
The German chancellor has for the fourth year running topped US magazine Forbes ' list of the women with the most clout on the global stage .
The ranking comes as Merkel – who despite often being the only female in world leader line - ups has always avoided being reduced to gender stereotypes – is at the centre of an unfortunate row over cleavage .
In posters , the Christian Democrat candidate Vera Lengsfeld has used a well - known picture of Merkel in a low - cut evening gown at an opera gala last year , alongside one of herself in a generous neck - line above the slogan "" We have more to offer .
"" Some have cried poor taste or sexism , but Merkel has deliberately stayed out of the row .
The Forbes women 's power list has for the past six years seen the US business magazine score a publicity coup by branching out from measuring the still male - dominated world 's top billionaires and chief executives to produce a yardstick of 100 top women in politics , business and philanthropy .
This year , the US has seen a rise in powerful women in public life , with Sonia Sotomayor , the US supreme court justice , in at 54 , and Michele Obama ranked at 40 .
Influence
But the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , trails Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the house of representatives , at number 36 .
Clinton , who days ago put a Congolese student in his place for asking what her husband Bill Clinton thought about a foreign policy issue , might have expected to be placed higher .
In 2005 , then secretary of state Condoleeza Rice was rated the world 's number one most powerful woman .
US commentators have been raising questions over how much influence and power Clinton wields over international issues in the US administration .
Forbes disagreed that Clinton 's ranking was low . ""
She is an extremely important woman in the government , but she 's not the president .
She did run as candidate and did n't win .
If she had , she would have been considered with Merkel for number one , "" said Chana Schoenberger , the Forbes associate editor who co - edited the list .
"" She has been on our list for a long time as very powerful senator before becoming secretary of state .
Yes , she 's the spokesperson of the administration on foreign policy issues and does important things , but here she 's competing with a whole group of women who are running things .
A lot of the women are running their own countries .
""
Michele Obama , who ranks just above Oprah Winfrey at 41 , is part of a tradition of featuring US first ladies .
Schoenberger said of Obama : "" She 's not elected but she is the public face of the country and deals with domestic policy in terms of influencing what the president thinks .
She 's very much in the public eye . ""
Among British women , the queen leapt from 58th to 42nd position this year .
But women in power on the British business scene were scarce with Cynthia Carroll , only the third female chief executive of a FTSE 100 company , Anglo American , ranked number four , and Marjorie Scardino , chief executive of Pearson in the top 20 .
Angela Ahrendts , chief executive of Burberry , also returned to the list .
The Forbes team said it had taken cheer at the rising number of women to choose from , but accepted there was still a fair distance to go .
A total of 27 women on the list headed companies , while 10 either run their countries or are heads of state .
Newcomers include Iceland 's prime minister Johanna Sigúrdardottir and Unicef executive director Ann Veneman , who has boosted the female presence at high levels of UN agencies .
Ranking The rankings , based on each woman 's economic impact , media reach , and career accomplishment , highlighted the growing number of women who are running companies , "" not just women who inherited companies , as often happened in the past "" .
There are more women entrepreneurs and women who have worked their way up through traditional corporate enterprises .
Of the top 10 women , the majority are business leaders .
Only one has a family connection to her business .
Rowena Lewis , acting director of the Fawcett Society , said it was good to have a spotlight on women leaders , but cautioned : "" Despite these lists , there is still under - representation of women in positions of power across the globe .
The representation of women as leaders in the UK in a range of sectors is in decline .
Only 11 % of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women .
In terms of representation in political leadership , the UK is behind countries such as the Scandinavian nations , Spain , Germany , Switzerland and Australia .

With the dust barely settled on last Sunday 's election , Miyuki – whose husband will officially become Japan 's leader on 16 September – is already emerging as a gloriously eccentric foil to her humdrum hubby .
While he reassures the US that his country is committed to the bilateral alliance , she regales the media with tales of interplanetary travel and , er , solar breakfasts .
"" I eat the sun , "" Miyuki says , raising her arms as if to tear pieces off an imaginary sun . ""
Like this : yum , yum , yum .
It gives me enormous energy .
My husband has recently started doing that too . ""
Clearly , this is where Gordon Brown has been going wrong .
When she is n't tucking into the centrepiece of our solar system , the 66-year - old former dancer pens cookbooks with humble titles such as Hatoyama Miyuki 's Hawaiian Spiritual Food .
She makes her own clothes ( including a skirt made from hemp coffee bags ) and , as she demonstrated during the election campaign , can also do a very passable Moonwalk .
But it is her extraterrestrial experiences that have triggered an avalanche of media coverage her husband could never hope to match .
In a book entitled Very Strange Things I 've Encountered , his wife has claimed that she was abducted by aliens as she slept one night 20 years ago , then whisked off to the final frontier . ""
While my body was asleep , I think my soul rode on a triangular - shaped UFO and went to Venus , "" she wrote , adding : "" It was a very beautiful place , and it was very green . ""
By happy coincidence , Miyuki is married to a man whom his parliamentary colleagues once nicknamed "" the Alien "" , a comment on his sometimes otherworldly manner and an unkind reference to his prominent eyes .
His wife 's revelatory book was published last year , but only now have her foibles become staples of daytime television .
Perhaps revealingly , she says that when she recounted her Venusian encounter to her first husband , he suggested it had probably been a dream .
But her second , the 62-year - old Hatoyama , is more accommodating : "" He has a different way of thinking and would surely say , ' Oh , that 's great . '
"" Michelle Obama , too , will surely be delighted to learn that Miyuki sees in her a kindred spirit .
"" I think she is so natural and has a kind of sensibility similar to mine .
If I get the chance to meet her , I 'd look forward to it . ""
Hatoyama appears admirably unruffled by his wife 's idiosyncrasies , saying : "" I feel relieved when I get home .
She is like an energy - refuelling base . ""
Miyuki , too , paints an idyllic picture of life chez Hatoyama , where her husband indulges his love of animal movies and feeds his addiction to prawn crackers .
She honed her theatrical delivery back in the 60s when performing for the Takarazuka Revue , an all - female theatrical troupe that specialises in kitsch adaptations of classics such as Guys and Dolls and The Sound of Music .
After six years on the stage , she moved to the US with her Japanese restaurateur husband .
It was there that she met Hatoyama , then a graduate student of engineering at Stanford University .
They married in 1975 .
The popular notion that Japanese women are demure and subservient is a lazy stereotype , but Miyuki 's behaviour would seem bizarre in any country .
Judged by the standards set by previous Japanese first ladies , it borders on the impertinent .
In a TV interview earlier this year , she claimed she had met Tom Cruise in a previous life , in what must have been an unnerving meeting of Scientology and new age spiritualism .
"" I have a dream that I still believe will come true , which is to make a film in Hollywood , "" she said .
"" The lead actor is Tom Cruise , of course .
Why ?
Because he was Japanese in a previous life . ""
Cruise , whose closest professional brush with Japanese culture was a leading role in the ludicrous 2003 film Last Samurai , "" would recognise me when I see him and say : ' Long time , no see ! '
"" Michelle Obama may not be quite so effusive .

2009-09-08,"Building on her reputation as an advocate for healthy eating , America 's first lady , Michelle Obama , has reportedly submitted a permit application for a weekly farmers ' market just blocks from the White House .
However , the public 's chance to partake in the presidential produce mania may face some opposition from commuters .

2009-09-08,"Building on her reputation as an advocate for healthy eating , America 's first lady , Michelle Obama , has reportedly submitted a permit application for a weekly farmers ' market just blocks from the White House .
However , the public 's chance to partake in the presidential produce mania may face some opposition from commuters .
The market 's location is slated for a heavily - travelled stretch in downtown Washington with hours scheduled from 1 pm until 8 pm on Thursdays , which could create mild havoc during the afternoon rush hour ."
2009-09-09,"The quiet revolution spreading steadily across the US in the way Americans produce and consume food is about to acquire a powerful endorsement in the form of a farmers ' market planned for one of the better - known corners of the capital .
It will be sited a block away on the north side of a large white house and will have the backing of its occupier , one Michelle Obama .
The plan is the latest building block in the movement the first lady has been seeking to build over food and health since she entered the White House in January .
Though her office is refusing to engage with media speculation , the telltale signs are there that she plans to extend her campaign - launched in March with the opening of a food garden in the White House grounds - by backing a farmers ' market just a stone 's throw from her presidential home .
Excitement levels among web - savvy organic food enthusiasts went through the roof today in anticipation .
It was disclosed that an application had been made to the local city authorities in Washington DC to close Vermont Avenue on the north flank of the White House to traffic on Thursday afternoons for six weeks until the end of October .
The application has been made in the name of a local non - profit group Fresh Farm Markets .
Telltale sign number one was that Sam Kass , who has worked as the Obamas ' personal chef in Chicago and now advises Michelle on her White House food garden , turned up at public meetings to back the proposal .
Telltale sign number two was that the city authorities have let it be known that Fresh Farm Markets is in cahoots with Obama .
"" It is our understanding that the group is working with the White House , "" John Lisle of the city 's transportation department said .
Sign three : Barack Obama 's comment last month that his wife was looking at a little market nearby .
"" I 'm not going to have all y' all just tromping around - but right outside the White House , "" he said .
The first lady 's passion for healthy eating began , she has said , in the early stages of the gruelling two - year presidential election campaign that her family endured .
"" We started to see that taking a toll on our health , "" she said .
"" Our children 's paediatrician gave me a little tap on the shoulder and said you might want to make some changes . ""
She eradicated processed foods and concentrated on a simple diet in moderation .
Her concern for her own family led to a wider interest in the obesity epidemic that has a fifth of all American children in its grip .
Having moved into the White House , and with a little prodding from organic advocates such as Alice Waters , the chef of Chez Panisse in Berkeley , California , she decided to turn over a little over 93 sq metres ( 1,000 sq ft ) of the South Lawn to fruit and vegetables .
Six months on and the garden , Michelle Obama has said , is "" beautiful ; it is blooming ; it is bursting "" .
More than 50 varieties of vegetables are grown , including rhubarb , tomatoes , peppers , spinach , okra and aubergines .
Of the 225lbs of food grown so far , some has gone to what Obama calls "" big fancy luncheons "" at the White House , some to her children , and some to homeless people at Miriam 's Kitchen , a local shelter .
Her objective is clearly to take some of that mass obsession with her own health and fitness , and project it on the American population at large .
And it appears to be working . ""
Her action of planting an organic garden on the White House lawn for all to see speaks louder than words , and it 's having an impact , "" said Lisa Bunin of the Centre for Food Safety .
Ronnie Cummins of the Organic Consumers Association said they were looking to Obama to be the "" farmer - in - chief "" .
His group petitioned her with 100,000 signatures to set up the White House food garden , prompting counter - efforts from the pesticide and agribusiness sector which took out advertisements saying Obama 's organic push was ill - advised .
But Michelle Obama is not one to give up easily .
As she told a class of children who came to dig the new plot : "" We did a lot of work moving that dirt .
That was harder than I thought .
That stuff was heavy , was n't it ? ""
A growing trend Michelle Obama 's organic push pays lip - service to the campaign of one of her predecessors : Eleanor Roosevelt .
In 1943 she launched her famous Victory Garden on the White House lawn that turned allotment keeping into part of the war effort .
It took off . ""
By the end of the war 40 % of food produced by the US was grown in individual gardens , "" says Bill Bushong of the White House Historical Association .
Obama 's grandmother got food from a victory garden in her neighbourhood of Chicago .
Growing food has always been a habit of the White House .
John Adams , its first occupant , planted vegetables largely through necessity as he had to pay for all his household expenses .
During the first world war President Woodrow Wilson grazed sheep on the lawn and his wife , Edith , grew vegetables in the "" Liberty Garden "" .
More recent presidents have been less green - fingered .
Under Clinton , herbs and vegetables were grown on the roof , but the lawn was kept in a formal style ."
2009-09-17,"Michelle Obama will be called on to provide the stardust for Chicago 's Olympic bid when it goes head - to - head with Rio de Janeiro , Tokyo and Madrid next month for the right to stage the 2016 Games .
The International Olympic Committee 's president , Jacques Rogge , yesterday revealed that President Obama had explained his potentially damaging absence from the vote by saying he was sending "" the best part of his couple "" to represent Chicago .
With the other bids being supported in person by heads of state , Chicago officials were keen for the president to fly to the 2 October IOC meeting in Copenhagen at the beginning of and help sway members .
Now they will rely on his wife 's box - office appeal .
Rogge said that , in a phone call last week , Obama had explained the ongoing political row around his healthcare reforms would keep him from attending . ""
President Obama expressed his support for Chicago in a very clear way , "" Rogge said .
"" You know how charismatic he is when he wants to express his love for his city .
He was very clear to say he was totally behind the bid . ""
But he explained that the political situation in Washington did not allow him to participate in Copenhagen .
He said with a sense of humour that he would send the best part of his couple and the First Lady would probably be the best stand - in he could have imagined for himself . ""
Rogge said that big hitters did not necessarily win votes , but it is generally accepted that Tony Blair 's presence in Singapore in 2005 helped sway a close vote London 's way , while Vladimir Putin helped tip the scales in Sochi 's favour ahead of the vote for the 2014 Winter Olympics .
"" We are very honoured and happy to host heads of states , dignitaries and heads of government .
[ But ] I do n't consider this is the most vital aspect in a bid , "" Rogge said .
"" This is something that is an honour for the IOC and is also reassurance that public authorities are behind the bid and will be supportive .
However , this is absolutely not a requirement of the IOC .
We have never asked a head of state to come , [ but ] if they elect to do so we consider them as being part of the bid .
If they come , we 're glad .
But we do n't want them to come at all sakes . ""
Rogge said that the personalities behind the bids were a big factor , praising Lord Coe 's Singapore speech as a key element of London 's victory in the race to host the 2012 Games . ""
All being equal in terms of technicalities , it 's the confidence you have in the people making the bid and who will be the organisers in staging the Games , "" he said .
Chicago began the race as a clear favourite but Rio , bidding to become the first South American city to host the games and trading on a message of regeneration and youth appeal , is perceived to have drawn level in recent months .
Other bidders are judged to be not far behind .
The US bidder has natural advantages in terms of the revenue it would attract in sponsorship and TV rights but has also been hit by a drop in public support and wrangling over the level of local government financial guarantees .
Rogge said that was all settled , adding that recent disputes between the US Olympic Association and the IOC over the launch of a new TV network would "" have no negative effect whatsoever "" .
But he did say that public support was "" an important factor "" .
Rogge predicted the vote , to be taken on October 2 after a final round of presentations to the 106 IOC members , would be one of the closest ever .
"" I had a feeling in Singapore that the race was very close .
I thought it would be decided by around half a dozen votes , in the end it was not six votes , it was four votes , "" he said .
"" I think I can make a bet today and say it will be a couple of votes .
I think it 's going to be very close .
Four or five votes is only the change of mind of two persons or three persons . """
2009-09-18,
2009-09-18,"Between 2000 and 2007 , Maya Rudolph appeared on a staggering 137 episodes of Saturday Night Live , doing riotous impressions of characters as diverse as Michelle Obama and Donatella Versace .
According to a 2007 report , only 36 out of 116 cast members on SNL to that point had been women .
And only 20 of those - including 30 Rock 's Tina Fey - survived into their second season .
Which must mean that Rudolph is one funny woman .
She may not deny being funny - after all , she decided she had to be on SNL when she was just six , hanging out in the studio with her late mother , soul singer Minnie Riperton - but Rudolph is n't so sure that comedy is a male sport .
"" People are still saying SNL is a boys ' club .
But unless I was completely blind and totally out of my mind , we all worked our asses off to get pieces on each week .
I never felt that being a woman was an issue .
The group of women I happened to be working with were all incredibly talented and powerful .
Having said all that , the women were always the better students ... ""
Rudolph left SNL to spend more time in Los Angeles with her partner , There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson , and their three - year - old daughter Pearl .
Yet she talks of the show with all the nostalgic passion of a first love and you wonder if leaving was the right decision . ""
Well ...
If I 'm in New York on a Saturday night and there 's a SNL show , I ca n't not be in the building .
When I started on SNL
I felt like I 'd found my people .
It was the first place in my life where I felt I belonged . ""
As children , Maya and her brother Marc spent time in the studio with their parents ; their father Richard Rudolph was a composer - producer who co - wrote Minnie Riperton 's biggest hit , Lovin' You .
If you listen carefully to the end of the song you 'll hear Riperton crooning "" Maya , Maya , Maya "" to her three - year - old daughter , a tender moment made all the more poignant by Riperton 's death from breast cancer just four years later .
Given that she has been immersed in the music industry since birth - her godmother is R&amp;B singer Teena Marie - Rudolph 's childhood decision to pursue any profession that involved being on stage is hardly unexpected .
For a while after graduating with a photography degree from the University of California she was backing singer in the Rentals , but the pressure to be as successful as her parents was overwhelming and she turned to theatre .
Shortly after joining the LA - based improv group The Groundlings she was spotted by SNL and was immediately feted for her extraordinary versatility .
She can play any woman from any ethnicity or demographic and is equally brilliant at Paris Hilton , J.Lo and Lucy Liu .
Rudolph , whose mother was African - American and whose father is Jewish , is pretty sure that she has n't yet been cast in many films because no one knows where to place her : "" If there 's a mixed actor in a film , they have to be there for a reason . ""
So she was ecstatic after reading Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida 's script for Away
We Go , in which the central couple just happen to be a mixed race woman and her white husband .
Directed by Sam Mendes as an indie film antidote to Revolutionary Road ,
Away We Go follows the couple as they travel around America in search of the perfect place to start a family .
It 's a gentle , meandering romcom in which Rudolph 's relationship with her on - screen husband , John Krasinski , convinces from the outset , where we see them getting intimate in bed .
The story goes that Rudolph was wearing several pairs of cycling shorts at the time .
Is that true ?
She laughs : "" I knew John a little through mutual friends but as much as you like another actor , having their head between your legs on the first day of the shoot is very , very awkward .
The shorts simply stopped me from feeling vulnerable and incredibly uncomfortable . ""
Right now , Rudolph is feeling incredibly uncomfortable in real life ; just about to give birth to her second child , she feels "" totally cooked "" .
Asked whether her old school friend Gwyneth Paltrow offers tips on losing baby weight , Rudolph roars with laughter : "" She looks fucking awesome !
But I 'm way lazier than she is .
And horribly undisciplined ...
"" There has been talk of Rudolph and Anderson getting married this autumn , but she will only say that they are "" intellectually married "" .
She then adds : "" I come up with a new term for our relationship every day . ""
The couple have already worked together , on a comedy reading at a friend 's theatre , but she 's not sure if they 'll collaborate again .
Perhaps , the Guide suggests , they could pool their talent and make a musical .
Rudolph is so excited by this rather random idea that she starts shouting : "" I totally want to do that !
I 'd be so psyched !
We could do a remake of Purple Rain ! ""
It 's such a ridiculous idea that 's
it 's actually utterly brilliant .
I urge her to get her intellectual husband on board straight away .
"" I so will ! ""
Then she pauses for a moment as reality hits : "" Just as soon as I 've had this goddam baby . ""
•
Away We Go is out now"
2009-09-29,"I join the ranks irritated with Silvio Berlusconi for referring to Michelle Obama as "" suntanned "" at a rally on Sunday â€ “ but for a different reason .
I 'm irritated because the Italian prime minister 's gaffe will undoubtedly trigger another round of the media 's public vivisection of Michelle Obama .
Its hard to muster outrage at Berlusconi when there is an entire cottage industry of news organisations paying good money to talk about the first lady 's body .
Salon commissioned an article about Michelle Obama 's rear end called "" First lady got back : an appreciation of Michelle Obama 's beauty and booty "" .
Time magazine recently joined the never - ending parade of articles about Obama 's hair with "" Why Michelle Obama 's hair matters "" .
Did we really need 1,200 more words about her hair after hundreds of trees had already sacrificed their lives so that someone else could compare Obama 's hair to Scylla and Charybdis ?
I mean how can you top hair which symbolises monsters from Greek mythology ?
I 'm not saying her hair does n't matter .
But is it all that matters ?
Berlusconi also is n't the first to publicly comment on the first lady 's skin tone â€ “ or the second or the third for that matter .
The Washington Post 's fashion critic Robin Givhan referred to the first lady 's style as "" Camelot with a tan "" .
Not to be left out , the Post 's sister publication TheRoot.com commissioned an article called "" Dark and lovely "" , in which the author , Vanessa Williams , called having dark skin "" revolutionary "" and declared that she would not apologise for objectifying Michelle Obama .
Apparently , Williams felt the objectification was her due after a life - long battle with the beauty industry .
Not to be outdone , Dayo Olopade produced a dissertation on Michelle Obama 's arms .
These articles all read the same : first - hand accounts that focus on the various appearance - obsessed neuroses visited upon black women that all require a public discussion of the first lady 's body parts â€ “ something they would all rise up to condemn if a non - black person deigned to dissect our bodies in the same public manner ( as Berlusconi did ) .
Which raises the question : Are we creating a new Michelle Obama body part sub - genre where black women writers are condemned to dwell for all eternity ?
After all , there 's lots we could write about the first lady .
I 'd be curious to know which of the crops in the White House garden failed to grow this spring , because my own indoor garden , which I planted at the same time as Obama , has died twice during the same period of time .
I 'd like to know what little girls around the world thought about watching Sasha and Malia travel the world with their parents this summer .
I 'd be curious to know how many children who attend school in our nation 's capital have had a chance to be hugged by the first lady .
In her first year in the White House , she 's been on a breakneck pace visiting schools , soup kitchens and aquatic gardens in her new , adopted home town , hugging everyone in her path .
Instead , we 'll get more articles about skin , arms and hair .
Did I mention hair ?
What next â€ “ a discussion of Michelle Obama 's earlobes or perhaps her internal organs ?
Too late .
We already discussed her uterus when we went through the Michelle Obama pregnancy obsession at the beginning of the year .
Clearly that speculation was inaccurate â€ “ otherwise these writers would be obsessing over the impending arrival of another baby Obama .
At least that would be a change of pace ."
2009-10-01,"World leaders including Barack Obama , royalty , global celebrities and sporting legends will tomorrow converge on a nondescript conference centre in Copenhagen for the vote that will decide the destination of the 2016 Olympic games .
The race between Chicago , Rio de Janeiro , Tokyo and Madrid is seen as one of the closest ever and the guest list for the presentations to the 106 IOC members is the glitziest to date .
Today , Michelle Obama , above , spent the day at the Marriott hotel where the IOC members are staying in an attempt to press home Chicago 's message .
Downstairs in the lobby , Oprah Winfrey was seen pressing the flesh , while in another part of town 25 athletes including Michael Johnson and Jackie Joyner - Kersee spoke emotionally of the power of the games .
Just as he swept to election victory on a promise to heal America 's relationship with the rest of the world , so Barack Obama hopes to draw a line under the perceived anti - US slant of some in the IOC , exacerbated by rows over money and TV rights .
Aside from playing on the emotional resonance of bringing the games to his one - time home city , in a letter to IOC members he wrote that the Chicago bid offered an "" extraordinary opportunity for America to renew our bonds of friendship and welcome the world to our shores with open arms "" .
At his own press conference , Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva borrowed Obama 's campaign slogan .
"" We want to say ' yes we can ' …
In Brazil we are accustomed to saying ' no we ca n't ' because we have considered ourselves second - rate citizens . ""
Rio was thought by some to have overtaken the favourite , Chicago , in recent months with its bid to bring the games to South America for the first time .
But Obama 's arrival appears to have given momentum back to Chicago ."
2009-10-02,"Some things are just worth fighting for — like the chance to host an Olympics .
And some apparently are not — like assuring the fate of the entire planet .
Michelle Obama says the president was ready to "" drop everything "" and make a big "" sacrifice "" to be in Copenhagen today for a "" take no prisoners "" campaign for Chicago 's Olympic bid .
Not that any further proof was needed that this was a really important moment , but just in case : Oprah Winfrey , a fellow Chicagoan , also made the trip to Copenhagen with the Obamas .
Now environmentalists are demanding Obama make a return visit to Copenhagen in two months to carry the fight for a global warming deal .
A contingent of activists were outside the White House on Thursday , carrying an Olympic logo with the message : "" Climate change is not a game . ""
Obama got a similar message in Copenhagen today from Greenpeace which turned up at his meeting with the Danish PM with a banner reading : "" Right city , wrong date .
"" It 's a fair point .
Obama was elected as a change candidate after all , and he made energy reform central to that change .
Officially , climate change remains at the top of the White House to - do list
—
but there is increasing frustration at home and abroad about how far Obama will go to fight for it .
The lack of fight is a huge problem — and not just for Obama .
In the calculus of Copenhagen , if Obama does not fight , Congress is unlikely to pass a bill on climate change .
No US bill , no deal at Copenhagen .
Senate Democrats introduced a climate change bill on Wednesday .
But even John Podesta , who led Obama 's transition team and is guiding the administration on energy policy , thinks there is just a 50 - 50 chance of getting legislation passed before Copenhagen .
Meanwhile , India and China are making it very clear they will not move towards a less polluting course of development unless they see concrete action from America — a climate change bill .
Obviously Obama has to pick the right moment to make his stand .
But environmentalists say he let an important one go by last week when he chose NOT to use his speech to the United Nations climate change summit to press the Senate to pass a global warming bill fast .
And it 's not even as if bringing the Olympics to Chicago is a surefire crowd pleaser .
Only half of Chicago really wants the games , according to a Chicago Tribune poll , and only a quarter are happy with the city 's decision to bail out the Olympics if they go over budget .
So it 's a bit hard for environmentalists to take the Obamas ' fervour about a sporting event .
"" We dropped everything — dropped everything — to be a part of this team , "" Michelle Obama told reporters as she got on the plane .
Getting a climate change deal at Copenhagen ?
Obama told reporters in Copenhagen yesterday he is "" keenly interested "" in the global warming summit , and in discussions about moving the talks forward .
But that 's not exactly the same as getting on a plane ."

2009-10-07,"Barack Obama may be frantically fending off accusations from all sides that he is dithering over Afghanistan and stalling on health reform .
At least nobody can accuse him of having lost his sense of humour .
The White House has released a list of 45 art works that the president and his wife Michelle have chosen to decorate the mansion .
Among them is a painting from the living American artist
Ed Ruscha called
I Think I 'll ...
Against a glowing red sky , the painter has superimposed words that epitomise the agony of indecision .
"" I think I 'll ... "" "" Wait a minute ...
I ...
I ... "" , "" On second , thought , maybe "" , "" Maybe ... No ... "" That pretty much sums up the 44th presidency as seen through the eyes of Fox News .
Yet when it comes to works of art the Obamas have shown themselves to be anything but indecisive .
The list of selected pieces has been hailed as being bold , modern and wide - ranging .
All were borrowed from Washington museums , though it was stipulated that none of them should be on display to avoid depriving the public .
The Obamas were advised by their long - term design guru , Michael Smith , and White House curator William Allman .
One notable feature of the list of artists is that it veers heavily towards the modern and contemporary , from the second world war almost to the present day .
Mark Rothko , whose Red Band was chosen , is the most celebrated name among them , followed by Jasper Johns whose sculpture Numerals , 0 through 9 , is included .
The Rothko sets a note that is common to many of the works with its typically rich , vibrant use of colour - something that clearly appeals to the Obamas .
Harry Cooper , curator of modern and contemporary art at the National Gallery of Art which has leant more than half the pieces , said there was an accent on bold shapes and hues .
"" All the works are terrific .
They have a lot of wall power - they are often very colourful . ""
Another striking feature is the number of Native American and black artists .
Several Native American pieces have been put in the president 's working study , the Oval Office .
The black artists include the post - war abstract painter Alma Thomas , and William Johnson who has had four works put up in the Obamas ' private residence including Flower to Teacher , painted in 1944 and depicting two African American women , one holding a flower .
Both Johnson and Thomas are dead .
But the Obamas have also taken the chance to boost the profiles of living artists by hanging their works in their private quarters ( works placed in the public rooms of the White House must be at least 25 years old ) .
One of the living artists is Glenn Ligon , an openly gay African American living in Brooklyn who is a year older than the president .
His Black Like Me
Â£2 that now hangs in the White House residence is a comment on southern segregation : he fills the canvas with words drawn from a 1961 memoir of a white writer who travelled through the south posing as a black man .
All in all , the artistic taste of the Obamas contrasts sharply with their predecessors .
While the Obamas have gone for the experimental and new , George Bush went for the Texan .
He favoured artists form his home state , such as Tom Lea whose Rio Grande , a hyper - realist painting of a cactus in front of dark swirling clouds , was hung in the Oval Office .
The artists favoured by the Obamas will be hoping that the current first couple have the same impact on sales as did the Bushes .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the value of Lea 's paintings tripled after he was given the presidential seal of approval .

2009-10-09,"Michelle Obama had a great - great - great grandfather who was white and may have been the master of a black slave known as Melvinia , living in South Carolina .
The discovery of the first lady 's slave ancestor on her mother 's side rounds off a picture of her family tree that until now has remained elusive in crucial parts .
During last year 's presidential election , the Obamas made something of the slave history in her past , but the full details were never known .
Now an expert in genealogy , Megan Smolenyak , has followed Obama 's family tree back five generations on both her maternal and paternal branches , with some interesting findings .
The most eye - catching is the existence of Melvinia Shields , a slave girl owned by a David Paterson in Spartanburg , South Carolina .
Melvinia , who was Obama 's great - great - great grandmother , was passed on as property to Paterson 's daughter and son - in - law
â€ “ Christianne and Henry Shields
â€ “ when he died in 1852 .
About seven years later , when she was still a teenager , she gave birth to a boy , Dolphus T Shields .
Smolenyak specialises in tracing family connections and last year followed Barack Obama 's roots back to Ireland , revealing he is a distant cousin of the actor Brad Pitt .
She tracked down a reference to Dolphus and his siblings in the 1870 US census .
That census is seen as a crucial document in the history of race in America as it was the first post - civil war count in which former slaves , who previously had gone unnamed as they were classed as property , were listed .
Dolphus was recorded in the census as "" mulatto "" â€ “ denoting one white and one black parent .
The identity of the father is not known , though the fact that his surname was Shields suggests he may have been a member of the family that owned Melvinia . ""
This is a very universal story , "" Smolenyak said .
"" It 's a story of the spread of slavery through the south and the Great Migration of African - Americans to the north .
The fact that there is mixed heritage involved will not be a great surprise to many as it was so common between masters and slaves . ""
Smolenyak spent nine months on the project and , with the help of reporters from the New York Times , traced her roots to 11 different southern states .
Only Arkansas , Florida and Texas show no imprint of Obama 's ancestors .
After South Carolina , Melvinia and her children at first moved further south , to outside Atlanta , Georgia , where Dolphus married Alice Easley , Obama 's great - great - grandmother .
The first lady 's family tree then branched out to Birmingham , Alabama , before joining the Great Migration in a move to Chicago , where Obama was born .
Until Smolenyak 's work , the only connection made between Obama and slavery had been through her paternal side .
It had been known that her paternal great - great grandfather , Jim Robinson , had been enslaved on a rice plantation , also in South Carolina , until the end of the civil war .
The Obama campaign hired genealogists to research her family roots at the start of the White House race last year , though their findings have to this day remained secret .
In his famous speech on race during the presidential race , Barack Obama said he was "" married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners "" .
The White House has given no response to the new disclosures , on the grounds that the first lady 's background is private .
Saidiya Hartman , author of Lose Your Mother :
A Journey on the Atlantic Slave Route , said the news of Obama 's slave and white forebears was a positive step .
"" It illuminates the ways in which we are all deeply connected , which few white Americans have been willing to accept .
And it shows that slavery is not this remote and distant thing , but part of our intimate and personal family histories . """
2009-10-16,"I have been travelling in Turkey this past week .
In this ancient , modern nation , men at bazaars and on the road have taken to chanting after me : "" Mrs Obama , Mrs Obama â€ “ Mrs Obama ! ""
To the casual observer and to some in our company , this seemed like a particularly bold illustration of racism or , at best , aggressive racial profiling .
Do foreigners think all black people are the same ?
Such was the question raised when the world found out last week that the real Michelle Obama 's great - great - great grandmother was a slave , and that her great - great - great grandfather was a white man .
In a nation of immigrants , such a revelation should not be outrageous .
After all , Obama 's husband , though universally accepted as the first African - American US president , still has family ties to white American politicians like James Madison and Dick Cheney .
Michelle is merely the latest famous entrant to the club .
This bit of history , however , uncovered by the New York Times in conjunction with a professional genealogist , has revived the long - running debate about the "" one drop rule "" .
Originally a symptom of early American paranoia about racial miscegenation , the one drop rule specifies that any individual with black blood is deemed black .
Thus Michelle Obama , like her husband , is not supposed to be white .
And yet there he is , bi - racial Dolphus Shields , in residence on Michelle 's chromosomes , providing the black first family with a little more whiteness .
Again , this is nothing new .
Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates , Jr ( who edits the magazine for which I write ) finds that "" fully one third "" of the overwhelmingly black NBA is at least 30 % white .
What 's more , he writes : "" It is one more corroboration that the social categories of ' white ' and ' black ' are and always have been more porous than can be imagined , especially in that nether world called slavery . ""
Indeed , harping on Michelle Obama 's slave ancestry is part of an American obsession with slavery and origins that only scratches the surface of how race and colour play out in domestic and global culture .
The juicier part of the story unfolds today .
The notion of the one - drop rule and the spectrum of blackness it has created has led to a divisive social reality .
In previous decades , women with skin darker than a paper bag were discouraged from joining certain black sororities at American universities .
Chris Rock 's current film , Good Hair , exposes the latent cultural desire for those drops of black blood to stay hidden .
Indeed , colourism is pervasive in countless societies , from Argentina to India .
Like Obama , I was raised a young girl with dark skin on Chicago 's South Side â€ “ but the similarities begin and end there .
The first lady has white ancestry â€ “ the product of slavery and a quintessentially American violence .
I am Nigerian , on both sides , as far back as the microscope can see .
But by dint of our colouring , we are indistinguishable in the eyes of American race politics .
There is a certain solidarity in this blanket of blackness that nearly 20 % of America wears every day .
Though a first - generation American , I share a silhouette with some passersby who are Dominican , black British or "" just black "" ( an in - term used within African - American circles ) .
But it can also be trying .
The president himself has spoken of having trouble catching a cab on the darkened streets of New York .
Before she was part - white , Michelle could have been wholly Nigerian â€ “ a fact that "" one drop "" thinking ignores .
And so we must abolish it â€
“ not because slavery and segregation are n't interesting , but because they 're irrelevant .
In these days of fused and fallen barriers of class , race and nationality , race is more than ever a purely aesthetic signifier .
How we look says both less and more about who we are .
And , whereas our shared skin tone was once a reason to work the fields or scrub floors , Obama 's colouring is rapidly becoming part of a global vernacular that has more to do with political interaction and cultural familiarity than with tracing origins .
Rather than looking back , her ordinary yet complex heritage now speaks to the future , saying â€ “ like her husband 's Nobel peace prize
â€ “ that America is back ."

2009-10-30,"Nice one , Michelle : news that the First Lady is to host an evening of classical music at the White House next week as part of her initiative celebrating arts education in America , with a concert from violinist Joshua Bell and masterclasses for 120 kids from all over the US , all part of her Classical Music Student Workshop Project .
This might be no more than symbolic window - dressing in an economic environment in which arts funding for the big institutions in America is in the same parlous state it has been for the past couple of years , and in which music education is appallingly patchy ( if you thought we had problems here , there 's no comparison with the US system , where many schools have no provision at all for music , and no obligation to teach the subject ) .
But even as a symbol , Michelle 's support for classical music â€ “ and reports that her daughters Sasha and Malia have signed up for piano lessons â€ “ still matters , potentially showing a generation of young people that this music need not have the associations of economic or social elitism it has built up over decades in America .
It 's a common refrain from the classical music sector in Britain that the political class never shows any direct enthusiasm for the art form - the Master of the Queen 's Music , for example , hardly ever fails to mention it in his public pronouncements .
And next to the Obamas ' example , it 's a fair point :
Gordon and Sarah are no lovers of the art form ( mind you , if Gordon did come out and say he was a sucker for symphonic music right now , ticket sales would probably crumble ) , David and Samantha show no signs of making classical music part of their lives should they take on the mantle of the next First Couple , and all we have for stately support is a Prince of Wales who has occasionally used a chamber orchestra for private conducting practice .
Come over and help us out here , Michelle !"
2009-11-01,"It is the most powerful marriage in politics , involving the most famous couple in the world .
But the union of Barack and Michelle Obama has remained firmly behind closed doors , with a veil of closely guarded secrecy drawn across their private lives .
Until now .
A remarkable glimpse into the Obamas ' marriage has been granted to New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor , who was given rare access to the first couple to ask them , not about the policy debates raging in Washington , but about their personal life .
The marital portrait that has emerged , detailed in a 7,000-word magazine article published in America this weekend , reveals a marriage that has had its rough patches but has , amazingly , found its groove in the high - octane world of the White House .
It has certainly blossomed into one of the most glamorous couplings in presidential history , perhaps topped for style and panache only by the Kennedys .
Like their 1960s predecessors , the Obamas are young and stylish .
They photograph well as a handsome pair , are often caught kissing and hugging in seemingly private moments , and have gone on "" date nights "" that have created headlines across America , just like Hollywood stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do .
Kantor describes a marriage that is flourishing during Obama 's first year as America 's first black president , and rebuilding a family life that was strained by years of tough campaigning .
But now , with the family living and working in the same building , the Obamas and their two daughters have been able to spend a lot of time together .
Curiously , winning the Oval Office has given them a normal family life .
"" This is the first time in a long time in our marriage that we 've lived seven days a week in the same household with the same schedule , with the same set of rituals , "" Michelle Obama told Kantor .
Now the Obama daughters can go to local cinemas and take walks around their neighbourhood .
The White House hosts movie nights and the family play Scrabble together .
The Obamas themselves spend time together morning and night , often not beginning their schedules until 9 am or 10 am , and nearly always eating together .
Michelle Obama emerges as someone who keeps her husband grounded , often using humour to remind him that he is mostly just her husband , not the president of the United States .
She frequently laughs at him as she sits behind his desk . ""
She can puncture the balloon , "" Barack Obama said .
In return , he often refers to her as Flotus , an official acronym that stands for First Lady of the United States .
But the Obamas did not always find their private and political lives mixed so easily .
The Obamas have had difficult times in their marriage , as have many couples struggling to balance the intense demands of career , family and relationship .
Their well - documented low point came back in Illinois , where for several years Michelle Obama felt neglected by her ambitious husband as he spent long days away from home playing state politics , and she was left to look after their children .
Speaking to the newspaper , Michelle spoke frankly about the stresses .
"" This was sort of the eye - opener to me , that marriage is hard , "" she said .
Kantor asked Barack Obama if they had come close to divorce and received the blunt reply : "" That 's over - reading it .
But I would n't gloss over the fact that that was a tough time for us . ""
But the tensions between the couple gradually eased and their marriage seems to have merged more happily with their political life during Obama 's historic campaign , first in defeating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination , and then in beating Republican opponent John McCain to capture the White House .
Michelle Obama gradually became more involved in her husband 's appearances and frequently offered him advice .
She emerged as a kind of anti - Hillary figure , allowing him to capture women voters , and then became part of the strong family image that the Obamas projected against McCain .
Michelle Obama has also gradually increased her contribution to the administration .
Aides described to Kantor how she will provide a sounding board for the president on issues like nominations to the supreme court and moves to extend healthcare coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans .
The first couple will sit together on a balcony or around their dinner table mulling over such matters , and it is certain that Barack Obama takes his wife 's advice seriously , although the two are far from the "" co - presidency "" that Bill and Hillary Clinton sometimes seemed .
Indeed , while the Clintons had their own agendas and ambitions , and seemed to take it in turns to have political careers , the Obamas have emerged as more of a unified team .
Barack Obama even quotes his wife in policy meetings with his cabinet if he thinks her advice has been especially pertinent .
Michelle Obama is also gradually developing an agenda of her own , centred on health issues , on which she will speak and start to campaign .
But , despite the apparent improvement in the family life of the Obamas and their marriage , being the first couple of the United States is never easy .
Or normal .
It is still a surreal existence inside an intense security bubble and the sort of modern media scrutiny that no president has ever had to endure .
For Barack Obama that has provided the only feelings of genuine anger during his presidency .
Although he has endured right - wing accusations of being a closet communist , endless death threats and accusations from liberals that he has let them down , what really annoyed Obama was criticism of his "" date nights "" with Michelle .
Because of the security around their visits to a show or a restaurant , the Obamas have been attacked by some as costing taxpayers too much money with their socialising , and disrupting the lives of ordinary people as roads are closed off for their motorcade . ""
The notion that I just could n't take my wife out on a date without it being a political issue was not something I was happy with , "" Barack Obama said .
"" What I value most about my marriage is that it is separate and apart from a lot of the silliness of Washington , and Michelle is not part of that silliness . ""
He added : "" If I were n't president , I would be happy to catch the shuttle with my wife to take her to a Broadway show , as I had promised her during the campaign , and there would be no fuss and no photographers .
That would please me greatly . ""

2009-11-04,"By The People , a new documentary about Barack Obama 's campaign for president now airing on HBO , gets up close .
We see Obama sitting on a curb , alone , moments before taking the podium at an event .
We see Michelle Obama at home in Chicago with her children .
We see the future president riding in a convertible , waving – and we wonder : where is the secret service ?
The cameras are close enough , in fact , to see the single tear of the 2008 campaign course down Obama 's face .
The film , shot over the course of two years by Amy Rice and Alicia Sams , sketches the basic contours of the 2008 campaign , with a particular soft spot for Obama .
Key aides like David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs give candid interviews , and many journalists give their real - time gloss on events .
One confessional in particular stands out for its comedy and its tragedy .
The film 's first interview with Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau seats him , theatrically , near a photo of Ted Sorensen , John Kennedy 's wordsmith , as he waxes on about how speeches should aim to echo Camelot .
But as the campaign wears on , the romance wears thin .
By June – after the Iowa caucuses , Super Tuesday , superdelegates and the 3 am phone call ad – Favreau summarises what is now just one of many election - night speeches he 's written for the candidate : "" We won , thank you other candidates ,
Hillary you 're great , McCain ,
blah blah blah .
Hope , change .
You know . ""
Victory speeches , it seems , like happy families , are all alike .
And campaigns – no matter how many times the words "" juggernaut "" , "" unprecedented "" , or "" historic "" are applied – leave little substance to hold on to once they come to a close .
The documentary faithfully replays the greatest hits of electoral controversy in 2008 .
Cringe along as Obama tells Hillary Clinton : "" You 're likeable enough "" .
Watch former Obama pastor Jeremiah Wright "" damn "" America a tenth or hundredth time .
Listen as Republican ingénue Sarah Palin stokes paranoia about "" terrorists "" .
Yet , reliving the most stressful year of my journalistic life ( What was the chattering class doing at 3 am ?
Refreshing polling websites ) , I felt nothing .
Yes , it was stirring to remember the spontaneous chants of "" race does n't matter "" or revisit the euphoria of Obama 's nomination acceptance speech in Denver .
But it 's also a sour reminder of the days when the president 's comments at a San Francisco fundraiser – an incident known , clunkily , as "" Bittergate "" – swamped the airwaves .
Even Obama had trouble keeping up .
Asked at one point in the film if he was having time to "" reflect on what is happening "" to him , he answered honestly , and curtly : "" No . ""
There 's a lesson here .
After a campaign that spent an inordinate amount of time obsessing about minutiae like whether Michelle Obama had or had not used the word "" whitey "" on a secret audiotape , why is the American political class , fuelled by conservative grassroots anger , still obsessing about the president 's birth certificate , "" death panels "" , which congressperson dissed whom and whether the designation "" tsar "" can be taken literally or not ?
We should remember how a perfect thriller of a campaign can be reduced to nothingness with only the passage of time .
Forget Wright 's booming soundbites .
In fact , it 's the quiet and unexpected moments that rocked campaign 2008 – the failing banks of 15 September , the pledge to fight the "" good war "" in Afghanistan and the pitched battle over whether to include an individual mandate in a healthcare reform bill – that laid the true foundation for our current political debate .
Obama has done a remarkable job since taking office of advancing past the campaign - era fault lines within the Democratic party .
Former rivals like Hillary Clinton and avowed Republicans like US army secretary John McHugh are now firmly on his team .
And the president , as Peter Baker wrote in the New York Times , "" has discovered that the oratory that proved so powerful on the campaign trail does not as easily move votes on Capitol Hill or stir souls in the Kremlin . ""
In other words , he 's learning the limits of symbolism .
But the rest of the country has n't been able to let go of the instinct to leap and pounce on every gaffe , every tic and every wild - eyed conspiracy theory that trickles its way into the political bloodstream .
As a result of the pumped - up , 24-hour spinfest , some Americans undoubtedly missed the major themes in the 2008 campaign that are now central to the much - less - sexy project of governing .
The McCain campaign 's gimmick of distributing tire gauges labelled "" Obama 's energy policy "" , for example , took attention away from the substance of the debate on oil prices and energy security .
Purveyors of these stunts are irresponsible , manipulative and , sadly , ever - present – even among the ranks of our current elected officials .
One year after Obama 's historic ( I said it ) win , we must face reality : History distils even the most exciting elections into bullet points that are entirely unpredictable at the time .
"" I feel your pain "" , Michael Dukakis in the tank , Richard Nixon 's sweaty lip .
These close - ups from the campaign trail tell us nothing about the men who won and lost .
We must let them go and turn from voyeurs to doers , both during election season and when the hard work of governing begins ."
2009-11-10,"Sesame Street â€ “ the TV show responsible for your misguided belief that certain areas of Brooklyn are populated by freakishly tall canaries and their severely depressed elephant friends â€ “
is 40 years old today .
And how is such an important show going to mark such an important anniversary ?
By unveiling a new short - form documentary clip about a canning factory ?
By finally allowing Bert and Ernie to get it on ?
By finding a backstreet doctor who 'll prescribe Elmo the Ritalin he so sorely needs ?
No â€ “ instead Michelle Obama will be stopping by the street to teach some children how to grow a cucumber .
This is because â€ “ aside from the education and the puppets and the funky counting song with the pinball cartoon
â€ “ Sesame Street has always put a heavy emphasis on its celebrity guests .
It 's a win - win for everyone involved ; Sesame Street gets the credibility and publicity that comes with a big - name guest , and the celebrity gets to gently send up their persona while exposing a whole new generation to their hilarious comedy stylings / good - natured social activism / extensive catalogue of shockingly violent movies .
That last one only really applies to Robert De Niro , but still .
So if Michelle Obama really wants her Sesame Street appearance to stand out from the crowd , what lessons can she learn from previous guests ?
Time for a quick history lesson : Lesson one : Do your best Sesame Street may be primarily watched by children , but even they know a half - hearted celebrity appearance when they see one .
When Michelle Obama appears on Sesame Street , she 'll need to bring her A - game .
Just like Robert De Niro here â€ “ by expertly channeling a dog , a cabbage and Elmo , De Niro gives possibly his best performance in a decade .
That means that a large number of children are going to grow up thinking that Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors of his generation .
It also means that a large number of children are going to be profoundly disappointed when they become old enough to watch Analyze That .
As a sidenote , ' do your best ' does n't mean ' shriek everything in such away that you make Elmo look like the laconic picture of cool ' .
That was directed at you , Natalie Portman .
Lesson two : Do n't sing if you ca n't sing Sesame Street has played host to some extraordinary musical guests over the years â€ “ like Stevie Wonder and Cab Calloway and Smokey Robinson â€ “ but just because they can sing , it does n't mean that everyone can .
Take this clip of pre - Daily Show Jon Stewart .
Is he funny ?
Yes .
Is he intelligent ?
Undoubtedly .
Can you get through more than 10 seconds of his awkward caterwaul without either switching it off or deliberately trying to hurt yourself ?
No .
No you ca n't .
And unless Michelle Obama is a classically trained vocalist , she 'll do well do stick to speech .
Lesson three :
Enunciate Honestly , David Beckham , it 's bad enough that Sesame Street has taught millions of British children that the last letter of the alphabet is called "" zee "" instead of "" zed "" , but there 's no need to get your own back by teaching American kids that another word for determined is "" pursistunk "" .
Lesson four
: Remember to mention necrophilia in the outtakes Ricky Gervais did , and he 's hilarious .
Therefore , Michelle Obama should , and we 'll all think she 's hilarious too ."
2009-11-25,"A racist image of Michelle Obama which depicts the first lady with monkey features has sparked controversy .

2009-11-25,"Google has refused to remove an image that depicts Michelle Obama with monkey features , but has purchased online ads apologising and explaining how its search results work .
The image , which appears as the top search result when "" Michelle Obama "" is entered into Google Images , has led to protests that it is offensive and racist and should be removed .
Google has decided not to remove the image but has instead opted to take out an ad , which sits above the offensive picture on the relevant Google Images web page , to explain its decision .
The ad runs with the headline "" An explanation of our search results "" .
The US search engine company said its policy was "" not to remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it "" .
Aware of the potential criticism over the stance , Google explained in its ad that as a search engine it was not responsible for questionable online content ranking highly on its website .

2009-11-25,"Google made its name in search through a simple principle : if lots of other sites point to a particular site that matches a search term , that 's probably the most highly thought - of site for that topic .
It 's rather like asking everyone who 's the most knowledgeable about something : they might not all agree , but you 'll find a consensus .
Before Google , search relied more on who could shout the loudest about themselves â€ “ which brought increasingly useless results , just as it would with people .
But the internet being what it is , a place where pretty much anyone can put anything up , sometimes the site that everyone 's pointing at is n't tasteful , or polite , or even legal in some parts of the world .
That 's the risk one takes with free speech : it includes the freedom to offend .
But equally , other people can find that "" offensive "" content amusing or educational or a bolster to their beliefs : is a satirical page about Sarah Palin offensive to women , Republicans , or just the terminally humourless ?
Knowing that 's how Google 's algorithm works , people have cooked up "" Googlebombs "" to attach particular meanings to people : from 2005 to 2007 a search with the words "" miserable failure "" directed you to the White House home page , where George Bush was in power .
Google subsequently "" defused "" those bombs by tweaking its algorithm to make such attempts fail .
At the time , Matt Cutts , Google 's anti - spam chief , noted that "" people assumed that [ the results ] are Google 's opinion , or that Google has hand - coded the results of these Googlebombed queries .
That 's not true . ""
And now an ugly image of Michelle Obama has hit the topic of the image search , in part because so many people were linking to it

We assure you that the views expressed by such sites are not in any way endorsed by Google . ""
But why not just remove the page from its index ?
Because Google does n't want to be seen to be making choices ; that would put it into the middle of every battle fought by every special interest group everywhere .
Hence : "" We do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it . ""
The company has already tackled the issue once before , over the search results for the word "" Jew "" , which found all sorts of racist sites .

2009-12-01,"It 's come to our attention that Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan is to star in a reality TV show about gardening .
According to Spinner , the "" pickled poet "" and his longtime partner , Victoria Mary Clarke , were filmed attempting to "" grow their own vegetables in an effort to emulate the premise of 1970s sitcom , The Good Life "" .
Apparently , Michelle Obama 's green fingers were also an inspiration .
The show will air on Ireland 's RTE network ( starting 8 December ) – and even they admit that MacGowan stops short of doing any actual gardening work ."
2009-12-16,"When Harvey and Paula Darden , an Obama - supporting couple from Georgia , turned up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue last month , they were expecting a quick nose around the White House as part of a tour organised by their congressman .
But after arriving 24 hours early â€ “ on Veterans Day
â€
“
they found themselves the surprise guests at an invitation - only breakfast with Barack and Michelle Obama .
And the president 's aides again found themselves forced to defend the White House 's admissions policy .
The Dardens ' inadvertent upgrade took place two weeks before the Virginia socialites Tareq and Michaele Salahi crashed the Obamas ' state dinner for the Indian prime minister , Manmohan Singh , embarrassing their hosts and raising serious security concerns .
The White House has downplayed the latest incident , saying that the Dardens were security - checked and then allowed into the breakfast as a courtesy as there were no public tours on the day in question .
Mr Darden , 67 , told Associated Press that neither he nor his wife had been told about the breakfast and they had arrived at the White House only to discover their names were not on the admission list that day .
But after providing photographic identification , they were ushered into the east room , told they would be meeting the president , and invited to help themselves to the buffet . ""
The further we got into the White House , the more surprised we were , "" said Darden .
"" My wife looked at me , and I looked at her , and I said , ' You know , I do n't know if we 're in the right place . ' ""
He said he felt "" kind of funny "" after finding himself in the middle of a formal event with 200 others : "" I was the only man in the room that was n't dressed in a coat and tie , "" he said .
"" I was just a plain tourist . ""
They approached an aide to clarify the situation , but were told : "" Just go with the flow . ""
Darden added : "" I told him , ' I do n't think this is part of the White House tour . '
He said , ' No it 's not .
It 's an invitation event for veterans . '
""
The official then asked whether Darden was a veteran .
When Darden told him he had served in the navy , the aide suggested he and his wife stay .
Baffled but grateful , the Dardens helped themselves to the buffet and took their seats .
A little while later , Barack and Michelle Obama arrived and began talking to the guests at each table and posing for photographs with them .
The US vice - president , Joe Biden , and his wife , Jill , also popped in .
Ed Donovan , a spokesman for the Secret Service , said agents had subjected the Dardens to the same security procedures as the other breakfast guests , verifying their names and running a criminal background check .
The couple had passed their vetting , said a White House spokesman , and were allowed to attend the veterans ' breakfast as "" a nice gesture "" .
He added that it was not unusual for White House staff to take people who had been cleared for tours to events in the rose garden or the east room if there was space .
The spokesman said the White House office of public engagement , which Obama created to engage citizens in White House activities , had cleared the Dardens , as well as the other breakfast guests .
The social office , he added , had handled admittances to the Indian state dinner .
Darden said it had been "" quite a treat "" to meet the Obamas and the Bidens .
But he remains confused as to how they were escorted into a private breakfast , and anxious after the media storm over the Salahi episode .
The only thing he and his wife regretted , he added , was that they had yet to receive a copy of their picture with the Obamas ."
2009-12-22,"The more nervous types among Barack and Michelle Obama 's advisers might fret at the inclusion of their bosses among the icons of a decade now about to end .
After all , are n't the Obamas meant to be all about the future rather than the past ?
Surely their decade will be the one to come – re - election in 2012 permitting – rather than the one passing into history ?
They might protest , but it will be in vain .
No retrospective of the noughties could exclude the name that , in just a few short years , has gone from being utterly unknown to the most powerful brand in world politics : Obama .
The history books will show Barack Obama first swearing the presidential oath in January 2009 , suggesting his impact only came in time for the decade 's last gasp .
But that would miss the grip he exerted on the imagination long before then .
In fact , he became the hot name in American politics back in the summer of 2004 , when he stole what should have been John Kerry 's show by delivering the keynote speech at the Democratic convention .
Watch him on YouTube now and he does indeed look like the "" skinny kid with a funny name "" of his own self - description .
But the rhetoric soared , the message of a new , less divided politics shone – "" There 's not a liberal America and a conservative America , "" he said , "" there 's the United States of America "" – and a phenomenon was born .
When he gave that speech he was a mere state senator from Illinois .
A few months later he was a member of the US senate and by early 2006 he was firmly hyped as the man destined to save the Democratic party .
By 10 February 2007 , the bitterly cold Illinois day on which he announced his candidacy for president , he was trumpeted as the man to rescue the US .
Once the 2008 campaign was in full swing , and he had defeated Hillary Clinton in the never - ending trench warfare that was the Democratic primaries , the expectations had gone global .
When he appeared before hundreds of thousands of adoring , and mainly young , people in Berlin that summer , the cover of Stern magazine asked if Obama was the "" saviour "" .
All of which would earn Obama his place as a noughties icon .
But there is a deeper connection between him and the decade now fading , one that will stand whether he is re - elected or not – and one that partly explains his extraordinarily rapid rise .
Put simply , Obama emerged as a kind of inverse of everything that had gone before .
He was the unBush , a photo negative of the president who had spanned the decade .
While George Bush snubbed allies and revelled in America - rules - the - world unilateralism , Obama was a citizen of the world – raised in Indonesia , with roots in Africa and a middle name from Arabia – who saw diplomacy as equally valid as force .
Bush derided the United Nations as a talking shop for limp - wristed do - gooders and Euroweenies ; Obama treats international institutions with respect .
( That last fact alone was , it seems , enough to win him the last Nobel peace prize of the decade , even before he had really done anything . )
So if Obama ends the decade as a defining face of the noughties , he does so , in part , by being the chemical opposite of – and a proposed antidote to – the man whose presidency dominated it .
Almost all of this was about Obama himself .
He could say of the most vexed foreign policy decision of the age – the invasion of Iraq – that he had opposed it , even when it was popular , calling it a "" dumb war "" .
Where Bush led with his gut and read little , Obama was thoughtful and deliberate , his Nobel prize acceptance speech , according to historian Simon Schama , being on a par with Roosevelt and Churchill and "" summoning the spirit of Cicero "" .
But there is another parallel too , and this has not been the work of Obama alone .
Those crowds in Berlin in 2008 drew instant comparisons with the response that greeted John F Kennedy – and credit for this belongs partly to Michelle Obama .
During inauguration week in 2009 , there was a brisk street trade in kitsch , oversized earrings depicting the Obamas as a glamour couple .
The last presidential duo to have that kind of cachet were John and Jackie .
This is partly because both Barack and Michelle are striking looking .
There are campaign photographs of him , emerging from a motorcade in inscrutable shades , that ooze JFK panache .
She , meanwhile , is tall , confident and with arms so toned that women do n't know whether to react with awe or envy .
But , on the campaign , no one ever accused Michelle Obama of serving as mere arm candy to her husband .
Nor was her role confined to that of the usual political spouse , "" rounding out "" her husband , proving that he was a genuine , card - carrying human being .
( That said , she did play an important role in reassuring African - American voters that a Hawaiian - born son of a Kenyan man and a white woman was , nevertheless , "" one of us "" :
by enfolding him in the Robinson clan of Chicago , she ensured Obama was bound into the African - American , and therefore American , mainstream . )
From the beginning , it was clear that Michelle was not just the devoted wife , looking up , Nancy Reagan - style , to her heroic husband .
In the early stages of the campaign , she mocked him in public for his snoring and morning breath – prompting some aides to worry that she might be a liability – but thereby establishing that she was no mere cheerleader .
As Obama himself would put it , "" I am reminded by every day of my life – if not by events , then by my wife – that I am not a perfect man . ""
Instead , they came across as a thoroughly modern couple : until his memoirs became bestsellers , her job as a Chicago hospital administrator brought in the lion 's share of the household income .
That marked quite a contrast with Laura Bush , the former librarian and ultra - trad wife , but was not wholly unprecedented : Hillary Clinton had already played the role of career woman turned first lady .
The difference this time was that it was simply much less of an issue .
The early 21st - century version somehow seemed to get people less agitated .
Perhaps that 's because Michelle has played it safer than Hillary did , taking no political role , reverting to traditional first lady duties – including planting a White House vegetable garden .
Or perhaps it 's because photographers simply can not get enough of her .
Either way , the Obamas are already icons of the age in a way that goes far beyond the Kennedys ' influence on 60s style .
Simply put , they express a profound breakthrough : the most powerful couple in the world are black , a fact that many Americans , and many others , never thought would come to pass in their lifetime .
Even if they did nothing else , and even if prosaic reality means the Obama presidency fails more often than it succeeds , this has made the Obamas truly iconic for millions of people –
their image acting as a kind of votive touchstone , conveying hope for a better world ."
2010-01-06,"The publicity - savvy US animals rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) has received a rebuke from the White House after using Michelle Obama 's image in an anti - fur advertisement without her permission .
The first lady is pictured , along with the TV presenter Oprah Winfrey , the model Tyra Banks and the country and western singer Carrie Underwood , on a Peta poster at Washington DC underground stations , under the slogan "" Fur - free and fabulous ! ""
The other three have officially endorsed Peta 's anti - fur campaigns .
As the wife of the president , however , Michelle Obama is unable to do the same .
Even though the first lady 's deputy press secretary , Semonti Mustaphi , told a US newspaper in June last year that "" Mrs Obama does not wear fur "" , her office has contacted Peta to warn that the group is using her image without consent .
Peta says it has no plans to remove the posters .
"" We have n't asked the White House to fund or promote the campaign , as they ca n't do such things , but the fact is that Michelle Obama has issued a statement indicating that she does n't wear fur , and the world should know that in Peta 's eyes , that makes her pretty fabulous , "" the organisation 's president , Ingrid Newkirk , said .
Peta is the best - known US animals rights campaign group , in large part because of its tactics of bringing in celebrities to support its campaigns , particularly against the use of fur , and also criticising those it feels have transgressed .
When Barack Obama was filmed last year swatting a fly during a TV interview , the group issued a statement that , while lighthearted , urged "" compassion even for the most curious , smallest and least sympathetic animals "" .
When a US campaigning group released a poster last year showing a child next to the slogan , "" President Obama 's daughters get healthy school lunches .
Why do n't I ? ""
the White House asked for it to be taken down , even though no images of the girls had been used ."

2010-01-27,"America has a new figurehead in its struggle against childhood obesity â€ “ Michelle Obama .
Last week , the First Lady told mayors from around the US how the recent growth in the number of extremely overweight people was so staggering that it now threatens the Â­country 's economy , through obesity - induced joblessness ; children 's education , because their weight issues disrupt studies ; and healthcare , which may become overwhelmed by patients with obesity - related Â­diabetes , asthma and high blood pressure .
Acknowledging the time and money pressures faced by many parents who want their children to eat healthily , Obama admitted : "" It was n't that long ago that I was juggling a full - time job with the round - the - clock role of being a mom .
And there were plenty of times when , after a long day at work , when the fridge was empty and everyone was hungry , I just ordered that pizza , because it was easier .
Or we went to the drive - through for burgers , because it was quick and cheap .
And I was n't always aware of how all the calories and fat in some of the processed foods I was buying were adding up .
It got to the point where our paediatrician kind of tapped me on the shoulder and said , ' You know , you might want to consider making some changes . '
"" The Land of the Free is also the world 's fattest country , but at least it now has someone of influence who has decided to make modern life 's greatest curse her top priority .
Obama 's task is now to raise awareness and set an example .
She will next month launch a major initiative that proposes much - needed Â­measures to make America a less obesigenic society .
We in Britain have been here before , of course .
In October 2007 , the then health secretary , Alan Johnson , described obesity as "" a potential crisis on the scale of climate change "" , and promised unprecedented action .
Every week brings new evidence of the scale of the problems .
Last week , surgeon Peter Sedman claimed that as many as a million of us would qualify for a gastric band procedure if NHS limitations were lifted .
And the Soil Association launched a campaign to highlight the poor quality of food served to many toddlers in nurseries , some of which spend as little as 25p per head on ingredients .
Yet we not only lack an anti - obesity champion , we do not even have an anti - obesity plan worth the name .
The Department of Health insists that "" the UK is leading the world when it comes to facing up to the obesity problem "" , and talks about "" our internationally recognised strategy "" .
A lot of its hopes rest on Change4Life , a social marketing blitz that counts 183 firms as partners , and an array of initiatives such as nutritional school lunches , free swimming , more PE for pupils , and healthy towns .
But while all these are welcome , they do not together constitute a credible response that will actually turn the tide .
Instead of relying on improved food labelling , ministers should be considering how , not if , they will force food producers to remove the excess fat , salt and sugar that are so injurious to health .
There should be an hour a day of fun exercise â€ “ not just sport â€ “ for every pupil , and 30 minutes for every employee ; huge changes to transport , building design and urban planning policies to curb reliance on vehicles ; and a big expansion of school nurses , health visitors and midwives , who would become anti - obesity crusaders .
Some will decry all this as nanny - state nonsense .
The Tories plan to create a Department of Public Health if they win the general election , and they claim to have new ideas , but so far have suggested only a rather well - worn one to tackle obesity â€ “ personal responsibility .
There is scope here for radical , essential , yet popular action to make us thinner .
Just as Britain is now the toughest regime in Europe for cigarette manufacturers , thanks to Labour 's robust approach , being the world 's most obesity - unfriendly nation should also be our aim .
â€¢ Denis Campbell is the Guardian and Observer health correspondent ."
2010-02-09,"The Obama administration today embarked on a programme to eliminate childhood obesity , one of the biggest health problems in the US , "" within a generation "" .
Launching the initiative at the White House , Michelle Obama spoke about an "" epidemic of childhood obesity "" , saying that over the last three decades childhood obesity rates had tripled , with one in three children now overweight or obese .
Describing it as a moment of truth for America , she announced measures that included the food industry and the federal government working on new labelling for the front of packages about the nutritional value of the contents and soft - drink companies labelling bottles and cans within the next two years , listing the amount of calories in each .
Obama said there would also be a push for healthy school meals , given that many children consume about half their daily calories there .
School suppliers promised to reduce sugar , fat and salt in their meals , increase whole grains and double fresh produce .
The first lady personalised the issue , saying that while working in Chicago , struggling to balance meetings and deadlines for her children 's soccer and ballet , there were nights when "" we just went to the drive - thru because it was quick and cheap , or went with one of the less healthy microwave options , because it was easy .
And one day , my paediatrician pulled me aside and told me , ' You might want to think about doing things a little bit differently ' .
"" The White House has recruited Walt Disney , NBC Universal and Viacom to launch a nationwide public awareness campaign to educate parents and children .
Obama 's campaign is called Let 's Move and is to be one of her main causes during her time in the White House .
She follows a tradition set by other first ladies .
Lady Bird Johnson championed a clean - up of DC , Nancy Reagan focused on drug and alcohol abuse , and Laura Bush on bolstering literacy and education .
Obese children and adolescents are more likely than those of lower weight to develop serious problems later in life such as high cholesterol and diabetes .
Obesity - related health problems account for 9.1 % of the total US health budget , up from 6.5 % in 1998.Other obesity - related problems that the Obama administration identified include what it described as "" food deserts "" , areas where there were no supermarkets .
More than 23 million Americans , including 6.5 million children , live in low - income urban and rural neighbourhoods that are more than a mile from a supermarket .
The administration also called for more physical exercise for children , saying they needed 60 minutes of active play a day , but the average American child spent more than 7.5 hours a day watching television and movies , using cell phones and computers , and playing video games .
The White House set up a website â€ “ LetsMove.gov â€
“ to provide information about healthier eating ."
2010-02-22,""" Photo Evidence : Michelle Obama Keeps Socialist Books In The White House Library , "" blared the headline on conservative radio host Rob Port 's blog following a tour of the presidential residence last week , after he spotted books including The American Socialist Movement 1897 - 1912 and The Social Basis of American Communism on the library 's shelves .
Port ignited a storm , quickly drawing almost 300 comments to his post on the popular political blog SayAnythingBlog.com , and a rash of links across the internet .
"" I wonder if the liberals who mock conservatives who refer to Obama as a socialist still find it funny ? "" wrote All American Blogger .
"" By itself , this would n't be that big of a deal .
But [ in ] the context of Obama 's economic policies ?
Well , I 'll let you make your own call , "" wrote Port , a self - styled bibliophile .
Some commenters were just as scandalised by the books ' presence in the White House library as Port .
Others were more cynical . ""
Fortunately , most of us live in a world where we 're allowed to have books besides the Bible and a sticky copy of Going Rogue , "" wrote one .
"" I have a copy of Mein Kampf on my shelf ( next to Winston Churchill , incidentally ) .
Does that make me a Nazi ? "" asked another , while a third sarcastically suggested dealing with the "" filthy socialists "" by starting an organisation . ""
Perhaps call it the National Anti - Socialism Institute , or NASI ( perhaps change the 's ' to a ' z ' to give it a little edge ? ) , and go around removing this unconscionable literature from our country in the interest of protecting and promoting our pure culture . ""
The only problem , the Washington Post reveals , is that the books have been in the library since 1963 , after Jackie Kennedy asked a Yale University librarian to oversee a committee that would select books for the library .
The librarian told the New York Times at the time that there was "" bound to be criticism "" of the choices .
"" There will still be people telling us what should be in this library , but we 'll just have to be adamant , "" he said in 1963 .
"" I guess if they have been in there since the 1960s then they have been there through several presidents , "" Port admitted to the Washington Post . ""
All I said was that our tour guide told us they were chosen by the First Lady .
I thought the books were interesting in the larger context , but now I guess it is what it is . """

2010-04-14,"In March 2007 , I attended an Obama fundraiser in New York .
Michelle Obama , in delivering her cute , I - didn't - expect - to - fall - in - love - with - him speech said , with a purposeful sneer : "" They told me his name was Barack Obama and he was from Hawaii
and I thought , what kind of a black man comes from an island ? ""
The crowd erupted in laughter , warmed to Michelle , and by extension her doesn't - quite - fit - in - our - black - box husband .
I presumed that at least some of the people in this crowd had either read , studied or at least heard of people such as Derek Walcott , George Padmore , Bob Marley , Marcus Garvey , Frantz Fanon and AimÃ
© CÃ

In principle , then , they knew about the "" kind of black men "" who come from islands .
And yet , they all seemed to share in the joke .
Michelle 's joke was a light - hearted nod to the competition for authenticity among minority groups , but it gnawed at me .
I am black , and I am from an island .
I 'm a lot of other things , too , but faced with that minor slight , an instinctive defensiveness arose in me .
My "" islandness "" and my "" blackness "" rose swiftly up the hierarchy of characteristics by which I define myself .
The reaction stunned me and has made me consider that central issue of self - identification : why and how do we choose to be defined , and why does it matter ?
For many African - Americans , claiming the nation of their birth as their own has been critical in establishing strength and confidence in the face of centuries of subjugation .
Thanks to American movements such as the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and the civil rights struggles of the 50s and 60s followed by the "" black is beautiful "" push of the 70s , we can all stand a little taller .
As island identities go , it is interesting that in the UK it is not uncommon to ask someone where they are from and to be told "" Yard "" , a slang for Jamaica â€ “ and that is more than 60 years after the Empire Windrush brought the first West Indian immigrants to Britain .
That is despite the fact that the person and their parents have been born in Britain , and have never seen the island they claim is so central to their sense of self .
But the issue of self - identification is , of course , not just a "" black thing "" nor an "" island thing "" .
In the consultations done by the UK office for national statistics gearing up to the 2011 census , the Welsh assembly government has asked that Welsh be recorded as an ethnic group separate from "" white "" .
Similarly , the Cornish Ethnicity Data Tracking Unit has requested that "" Cornish "" be a specific tick box .
Neither is this a race or ethnicity thing .
Peter Minshall , the renowned "" masman "" , has posited that it is because of great suffering that certain groups of people have become great artists , art being a vehicle for saying to the world "" I exist "" .
If you ask him who he is , he will say "" I am an artist "" .
Give him a few moments and you may hear "" I am a Caribbean "" .
Artist , worker , woman , athlete , homosexual , Catholic â€
“ we choose and we slice
and we dice and do as the cavemen did so many years ago , by continually putting marks on the walls as if to say "" I am "" and to distinguish ourselves from others .
The 1920s and 30s founders of the Negritude movement reclaimed the word black ( negre ) as a term of pride , a potent act of self - identification .
However , Wole Soyinka , the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate , opposed the Negritude movement as self - absorptive and defensive .
He famously said : "" A tiger does not proclaim his tigerness , he pounces . ""
It is interesting that Soyinka uses the tiger as his subject of comparison .
A super - predator , a solitary hunter , the tiger is virtually unchallenged at the top of the jungle foodchain .
Unfortunately , we humans experience countless and continuous threats to our existence , whether real or imagined , from our own kin .
We are beings who struggle to be and who respond to suffering and to victory with a need to say "" I am "" if only to remind ourselves that we are ."
2010-05-20,"An unscripted encounter between Michelle Obama and a seven - year - old schoolgirl during a photo opportunity in Maryland has unwittingly highlighted the political dilemma the Obama administration faces over illegal immigration .
The First Lady was appearing with her Mexican counterpart , Margarita Zavala , at the New Hampshire Estates elementary school in Silver Spring , just outside of Washington DC , for a lesson on healthy eating and exercise , followed by a question - and - answer session with pupils
In front of the television cameras , one of the students then asks Michelle Obama : "" My mom said , I think , that she says that Barack Obama is taking away everybody that does n't have papers . ""
"" Well , that 's something that we have to work on , right ? ""
the First Lady replies .
"" To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers , right ?
That 's exactly right . ""
"" But my mom does n't have any , "" the girl responds . ""
Well , we have to work on that , we have to fix that
and everybody 's got to work together in Congress to make sure that happens .
"" Obama says , and quickly moves on to the next question .
The Department of Homeland Security said it would not be investigating the incident .
A Montgomery County schools official said the district would not identify the student : "" There was a Supreme Court decision that makes it clear that if there 's proof of residency in the county , then we educate the child .
And we 're not going to identify the student or her parents .
We protect the identity of our students . ""
Immigration remains a hot button issue in the US , in particular since Arizona passed state legislation requiring local police officers to request documents from anyone suspected of being an immigrant ."
2010-05-20,"Michelle Obama must be used to causing a stir with her frocks .
But she could not have known when she chose a floorlength gown in a lovely shade of â€ “
well , let 's just pass over that for the moment â€ “ to meet the Indian prime minister last November , the furore that would follow .
The dress was described by its designer Naeem Khan as a "" sterling - silver sequin , abstract floral , nude strapless gown "" .
Associated Press said it was "" flesh - coloured "" , the colour of Obama 's own flesh notwithstanding .
Now AP appears to have revised that description to "" champagne "" , an act that has triggered debate about fashion 's use of the word "" nude "" . ""
Nude ?
For whom ? "" asks Jezebel magazine .
To anyone who reads fashion magazines these terms will be familiar .
"" Nude "" shades are everywhere this season , having dominated the spring / summer 2010 catwalks , from off - white through pale rose to gold ( "" nude "" in fashion terms does not refer to anything more exciting than these rather muted colours , not even with "" nude bras "" ) .
InStyle magazine goes as far as to say that nude is the new black : just about the surest way to exclude black - skinned women from adopting the trend , since it 's apparently not acceptable to wear black as black , nor black as nude .
Over at Elle magazine , where the May issue sees the word "" nude "" repeated nine times on a single page , "" nude is the colour for spring / summer "" .
Editor Lorraine Candy says there is nothing wrong with this .
"" Nude is a defined colour .
It 's white nude , not black nude , but it 's not the colour of my skin either .
I 'm see - through white .
With someone as powerful and amazing as Michelle Obama , I think it 's the wrong thing to get worked up about . ""
The problem is that the language of fashion has form in this regard .
Beading , fringing and animal prints are routinely offered as evidence of a "" tribal "" trend ( though that is a word Candy says she crosses out whenever she sees it ) .
Last October , a month before Obama stepped out in her dress , model Lara Stone appeared blacked up in French Vogue .
Black models , meanwhile , are few and far between on catwalks and covers .
And even when fashion editors find synonyms for "" nude "" they are conventionally honey , rose , blush , ivory , words commonly used to make an English rose complexion seem aspirational .
There is nothing new in all this , of course : remember American Tan tights , and their promise to bring a healthy glow to all those "" American "" ( read pale ) legs ? ""
For me , nude would be if I wore brown , "" says Dodai Stewart , deputy editor of Jezebel .
"" I do think that it really is exclusionary not to realise that this is not nude for everyone . ""
But it is n't just the description of a colour that is potentially offensive here , it 's also the way the look is styled , the conception of the entire trend .
On the cover of May 's InStyle , actor Gemma Arterton appears in a frock so close to her skin tone that it seems to seep into her chest and shoulders , the two adjacent pallors of flesh and dress somehow bleaching each other out , lightening further the overall look .
On the catwalks in Paris , Milan , London and New York , these pale shades were presented almost uniformly on pale skins .
It 's a look that 's all about white skin . ""
Obama looks amazing , "" says Reina Lewis , professor of cultural studies at the London College of Fashion .
"" It 's a fabulous dress .
But on her skin ' nude ' is revealed as a colour rather than neutral . ""
Indeed it seems misplaced to think of these shades as neutral , when the debate makes clear that this trend is anything
but .
Pantone , the world - renowned authority on colour , may have a "" nude "" shade , thereby conferring a certain official acceptability on all those magazines ' usage of the term .
But then another N - word was once commonly used in clothes catalogues to describe a chocolatey shade of brown .
( Yes , THAT N - word . )
Will "" nude "" one day strike us as equally horrifying ?"
2010-07-13,"Michelle Obama today used her first visit to the Gulf coast devastated by the BP oil spill to urge Americans to support the local economy by spending their summer holidays there .
However , after extolling the "" thousands of miles of beautiful beaches "" untouched by the spill and urging people to "" do a few things [ to ] help this community "" , America 's first lady headed back to Washington to prepare for a family holiday to a national park in Maine at the weekend .
Conservative blogs , were quick to attack the Obamas for a "" do as I say , not as I do "" attitude , pointing out that the first family will have taken three holidays since the oil spill began in April , none of them in the Gulf region .
The first saw them visit Asheville , North Carolina , as the Deepwater Horizon rig was sinking into the Gulf of Mexico .
In May , Barack Obama was criticised for taking his family on a private trip to his hometown , Chicago , over the Memorial Day weekend instead of honouring fallen soldiers in a traditional service at Arlington National Cemetery , in Washington .
Michelle Obama urged support for the Gulf coast in a speech at the Panama City Beach welcome centre .
Hoteliers along the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida have seen bookings plummet since the oil spill crisis began ."
2010-07-20,"If Barack Obama was struggling to understand the tonal shift in Britain marked by the departure of the earnest Gordon Brown and the arrival of the breezy David Cameron , he need do no more than contrast the presents given to him by the two prime ministers .
Where Brown ordered a politically correct ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of the Victorian anti - slavery ship HMS Gannet , Samantha Cameron just popped out to her old shopping grounds in Notting Hill .
Her husband handed over a painting by ex - hoodie Ben Eine , some scented candles for Michelle Obama from perfumier Miller Harris , and for the kids some pink and purple Hunter boots .
A devastated Johnnie Boden must be tearing up his catalogue at failing to make the list .
The Camerons ' choice of the ultra - contemporary Eine and his painting 21st century city , a collection of spray- painted , multicoloured letters on east London doorfronts , valued at £ 2,500 , shows Cameron 's continued willingness to hug a hoodie who has gone astray .
In an interview with the Observer , Eine admitted spraying walls , the kind of vandalism of which the Eric Pickles of this world so much disapprove : "" I started out in the world of graffiti when I was about 14 , because I wanted to be part of that hooded tracksuit gang thing .
I did it pretty hardcore for 20 years
‑
I 've been arrested 15 or 20 times , and the last time I had a close escape from prison .
"" The picture will look great in the Roosevelt room , alongside the staid portraits of Lincoln .
Samantha Cameron , exhausted with a fourth child due in September , was not herself present to hand over the present , or to receive presents from the Obamas .
In a complex diplomatic tit for tat , the Obamas returned the gift with a picture of their own : a signed colour lithograph by the Nebraskan artist Ed Ruscha , entitled Column with Speed Lines .
This apparently resembles a single column government building with horizons in red , white and blue , the colours of the US and UK flags .
A spokesman said : "" It represented an important moment in the contemporary US art movement and will be given a prominent position in the UK art gallery . ""
Other presents to the Camerons were a gift basket for Samantha including a baby blanket , a silver necklace adorned with White House charms for his daughter Nancy , and a personalised DC United football kit for Elwen .
Obama apparently forgot the kids and sent an aide out at the last minute to the club 's shop for the strip yesterday morning .
DC are presently dead last in their conference on 12 points , having won 3 of 17 matches .
Still , the exchange is an improvement on Obama 's gift to the previous prime minister ; in what looked like a rushed trip to the supermarket , the Obamas gave the Browns 25 DVDs which turned out to be unsuitable for UK players .
Overall , Cameron has been trying to turn the special relationship into something more natural and less neurotic .
He has in effect lectured the British press not to get so hung up on whether the premier is afforded a full press conference , a spray , drop - by , or whatever else the American lexicon of presidential meets and greets produces .
The argument is that Britain and the US have a natural relationship of mutual interest , but neither party should be accused of adultery if they start forming relationships with other partners , especially the power - players to the east .
Cameron has been a figure of modest interest in Washington .
For all his eastern seaboard political connections , Brown ( after the glamour of Tony Blair , the best exponent of US foreign policy ) hardly registered on the US popular psyche .
Cameron feels at least iPod , if not iPad generation : relaxed appearances on the networks , dinner with Washington Post columnists , and meetings with all the key congressional leaders – though he did find himself engulfed in the BP controversy as soon as he arrived .
American politics has in the past two months been transformed into a form of marine engineering , with politicians on both sides criticising BP .
Cameron has found himself in the awkward position of defending BP and its share price at a time when its corporate reputation in the US rivals that of the worst Wall Street bank .
When he planned this visit to Washington , presenting himself as the fresh face of modern liberal conservatism , he could not have envisaged he would be in the dock for decisions taken years ago by Blair , Brown and Alex Salmond .
But no one ever said politics was either logical , or fair ."
2010-07-23,"It was n't a major cock - up .
He did n't pat Michelle Obama on the bottom , spill tea on the rug in the Oval Office , or offer to take the President 's dog out hunting , but David Cameron 's diplomatic slip was significant enough .
On a tour of New York with Mayor Bloomberg the Prime Minister asked a street vendor for a plain hot dog .
No mustard , no onions , nada .
In one hot minute he lost the respect of every proud , food - loving American .
It 's not the first time Cameron 's conservative tastes have been exposed .
While he and Nick Clegg thrashed out the final details of the coalition , the Prime Minister cooked them a supper of ham , baked potatoes and salad .
It seems our PM is n't much of a gourmet .
I mean , come on Dave , seriously , a hot dog without onions and American mustard – what on earth were you thinking ?
Such chow is nothing without its accompaniments .
Some foods beg for a splodge of phone box red or atomic yellow dressing : hot dogs , ham , scampi and burgers .
A kebab without garlic mayonnaise and chilli sauce is but a spectre , chips without ketchup are desiccating and mealy .
I am always baffled that in France a near - perfect ham and cheese baguette comes without mustard , and polite requests for a dash of Dijon are frequently met with incredulity .
In the UK there are burger joints that bring your food and ask if you 'd like any sauces .
Just how often do people decline ?
Bring the lot , I say .
Byron , a burger gaff that has earned something of a cult status , is famous for its homemade sauce , "" a subtle blend of ketchup , mayo , chopped pickles and capers "" , reveals owner Tom Byng of his suspiciously thousand island - esque dressing .
"" It 's so good applied thinly to the bun or for dunking chips in . ""
Huw Gott , owner of London steakhouse
The Hawksmoor , is also encouragingly fond of condiments .
"" I think burgers need a bit of lube "" , he says .
"" I 've toured some of the best burger joints in New York and most of the patties are pretty bland .
The pleasure in a burger comes from the mix of flavours and textures . ""
But it is n't always this simple .
Certain dishes seem incomplete without ketchup , and yet adding it carries a certain guilty , childish pleasure .
Fish pie , macaroni cheese and cottage pie just are n't the same without a squirt of the red stuff .
Chef Tom Aikens agrees : "" it 's comfort food "" .
But what would you say if someone asked for Tommy K with poached turbot ?
"" I 'd say no "" , replies Aikens .
Nico Ladenis , a chef infamous for his view that "" the customer is not always right "" , allegedly sent an entire sack of salt out to a table after a diner had the barefaced cheek to ask for some seasoning .
Such sensitivity about one 's culinary creations is not restricted to the realms of chefs and prima donnas .
I 'd like to pretend that I 'm the kind of cook who is happy to leave such decisions to the individual , but that would be a lie .
I was livid when my brother shook Tabasco over a roast chicken , and just a little hurt when a friend actually went next door to his flat , took a pot of cream from the fridge , came back , and poured it over a tagine I 'd lovingly made .
When someone has put the time and effort into cooking for you it is somewhat inconsiderate to fart about with their efforts .
Unless a condiment is offered , or unless the dish falls into the hot dog , nothing - without - the - condiment category , then the best policy is to go without , austere as this may seem .
It tends to be obvious when a condiment is called for .
The best – or most appropriate – condiments enhance .
A sausage without mustard is like McCartney without Lennon – perfectly adequate but not nearly as exciting .
Poppadoms without mango chutney or a minty yoghurt are dry , brittle frisbees .
So Dave , just remember for next time , that good politics is sometimes just a question of having the right sauces .
Which condiment could you not live without , and which foods demand it ?"

But the Costa del Sol 's glitziest resort of Marbella is the surprise holiday choice of Michelle Obama and at least one of her daughters , Sasha , who are due to arrive on 4 August .
Locals hope that Barack Obama , who celebrates his 49th birthday on the first day of their stay , might make a last - minute appearance .
Marbella , home of graft , tack and ostentation , is everything the Spanish costas should not be .
Overbuilt and brashly flaunting its wealth , it epitomises the wanton destruction of Spain 's coastline .
So what else can America 's first family expect ?
Hotels
The Obamas will enjoy the luxury of the Villa Padierna on the outskirts of town .
With its Tuscan palace architecture , spa complex , views across the Mediterranean and reputation as one of the world 's best resort hotels , a price of up to â‚¬3,600 ( Â£3,000 ) a night keeps the riff - raff away .
Food
If the Obamas venture out , will it be for fried fish , sangria and paella at a restaurant on the beach ?
Or will they go for the more sophisticated international delights of Olivia Valere 's Babilonia Palace restaurant and discotheque ?
Places to avoid Once a home of smart yachts and fast cars ,
the neighbouring Puerto Banus marina is not what it used to be .
Think lap - dancing clubs and British soccer shirts .
It should only be used for stepping on to large motor cruisers and going out to sea .
Discreet wealth has moved down the coast to the resort of Sotogrande .
People - watching The likes of Princess Diana and Sean Connery once came here .
Now Russian , British , Irish and Italian drug - runners and mafia crooks have made it their base
â€ “ though they should remain invisible to the Obama eye .
Perhaps , however , the first family may spot a well - known Englishman .
Spanish newspapers report that David Cameron and family will be holidaying in Marbella at the same time .
Attractions
If Michelle plays golf or tennis , then she will find plenty to do .
Culturally , however , the town remains a desert .
Sasha , one hopes , will not mind .
Marbella still has sand and sea .
Just bring a bucket and spade ."
2010-08-04,"Michelle Obama and her younger daughter , Sasha , nine , have arrived in Spain for a short holiday as US officials scrambled to defuse embarassing allegations of institutional racism against their host country .
Hours before the first African - American first lady of the US and her daughter were settling into the luxurious Villa Padierna hotel on the outskirts of Marbella , the US state department removed a warning about police racism in Spain from one of its websites .
"" We have received isolated reports that racial prejudice may have contributed to the arrest or detention of some African - Americans travelling in Spain , "" the bureau of consular affairs had warned on its travel advice website . ""
Recently , two African - American US government employees were questioned by police in Barcelona for no apparent reason .
One was detained and suffered physical injuries in the process . ""
The warning disappeared yesterday , but was still accessible in the page 's internet cache .
Sources at the Villa Padierna hotel said that Michelle Obama had told them she had come to Spain to rest and relax .
President Barack Obama , who turns 49 today , is not expected in Spain .
His elder daughter Malia , 12 , is at a summer camp .
Secret service personnel working for the White House have already scouted several spots that the Obama 's might visit , including the Alhambra palace complex at Granada .
Michelle Obama is expected to see King Juan Carlos and other members of Spain 's royal family , who are holidaying in Majorca .

This has been corrected ."
2010-08-09,"When is it OK in these self - indulgent but curiously puritanical times for prominent public people to take a holiday and â€ “ more to the point â€ “ to be seen to be taking one ?
While I 've been quietly enjoying mine ( very nice , thank you )
both Michelle Obama and Asif Ali Zardari have got into spots of bother over their summer travels .
OK , Mrs Obama is n't an elected public official and President Zardari was on official business during his visits to Britain and France , not "" joyriding "" at his French chateau or hanging out in five - star British hotels .
But they took a caning for it anyway .
Is that fair ?
Probably not in Obama 's case .
She 's only the president 's wife , she ca n't stay in a tent
and she 's bound to be photographed around Marbella on her trip with her daughter .
An odd place to visit , full of expensive white trash , so I imagine , but that 's a detail .
Zardari 's case is more complicated because there have been major floods in Pakistan during what sounds like a lively tour
â€ “
we even heard about his spat with David Cameron in sleepy old rural France .
Should he have gone home to show his concern for the relief work , even though he can hardly be expected to get his hands dirtier than they are already as Pakistan 's former "" Mr Ten Per Cent "" ?
Probably , unless there were important diplomatic reasons we do n't know about that detained him here .
Vladimir Putin is supervising firefighting around Moscow this summer , although being a macho type he may regard that as a treat .
It 's a judgment call : sometimes right not to dash home , sometimes right to show concern , as George Bush famously did not do during Hurricane Katrina .
According to the BBC 's report , Zardari 's big weekend speech fell badly flat among British Pakistanis in Birmingham .
That should worry him more than the "" win "" that Saturday 's Guardian reported him as claiming in his "" terror row "" spat with Cameron .
The underlying fact that unites both cases is that both Zardari and Mrs Obama are paying the price of political weakness at home .
If Barack Obama was in better shape with the American electorate and Zardari was not regarded as a weak and dishonest cuckoo in the Bhutto nest they would be allowed to do as they please
: voters would say : "" Things must be OK because the boss is looking so relaxed .
He 's clearly on top of things . ""
That not being the case , their legitimacy as leaders both under threat , their opponents pile on whatever allegations they can lay their hands on :
true or false , the cost of the hotel , the bill for security , the squalid company their leaders are keeping .
When Bill Clinton was advised during the embattled stage of his presidency that he should not be seen engaging in sailing or other elite activities on Martha 's Vineyard â€ “ a popular island holiday resort not far from Boston , not all high - end stuff ; I 've stayed there myself
â€
“
he asked if he could be seen fishing ( "" provided I do n't catch anything "" ) .
Obama and Zardari are both in deep trouble , so they ca n't be photographed catching any fish either .
As noted here before , Obama has done some good things but does n't seem to be able to deliver effective leadership either in terms of rallying voters or knocking heads together .
Zardari is , well , a Pakistani politician doing a near - impossible task badly .
Many of their opponents are even worse .
But there 's a wider issue here .
The Times 's European correspondent , the estimable Roger Boyes ( he is still allowed to cover priestly paedophile cases , despite the byline ) , set out a list of EU leaders ' holiday plans during what he called the "" New Austerity "" â€ “ when all Europe is suffering the effects of retrenchment .
What a glum read it was .
Only Nicolas Sarkozy is insisting on his full three weeks at his wife 's villa on the Riviera â€ “ French side , of course â€ “ and even Silvio Berlusconi is renting a castle instead of going to his Villa High Jinx or his Palazzo Nudo .
Chancellor Merkel is hiking in the South Tyrol and staying in an â‚¬89 ( max ) per person hotel .
Sweden 's PM is in the family cottage near Gothenburg , Spain 's Zapatero is spending a week in his adopted hometown of Leon , the Danish PM joined the national road - race team on a trip from Bremen to Paris .
Such is Belgium 's ongoing political paralysis that King Albert stayed at home .
Oh dear .
As for us , well , David Cameron was reported to be on the Costa del Sol the other day .
But the official line is north Cornwall â€ “ my own part of the world â€
“ where he may have been a Hooray Henry around Rock and Daymer bay in his teen years .
He 's going to stay in charge of the No 10 shop too .
Do n't imagine that will spare him media intrusion or jibes if he 's actually seen enjoying himself in sunny weather on Polzeath Beach .
It 's not as if Gordon Brown looking miserable while pretending to be on holiday did him
â€ “ or anyone else
â€ “ much good .
Ditto the workaholic Margaret Thatcher .
But the media hates the idea of politicians taking time off almost as much as it hates the idea of them not taking time off so they can keep interfering with voters ' lives .
So they 're stuffed either way .
I 'm tempted to say it did n't used to be such a problem before 24/7 TV and intrusive paparazzi , yet I distinctly remember going up a mountain opposite the Ronald Reagan ranch above Santa Barbara in the 80s , there to view the biggest lens I have ever seen taking fuzzy long - distance shots of Ron and Nancy horse - riding .
They had to be "" today "" pictures , you see , to go with whatever the White House spokesman was saying the prez was thinking from his own perch in a beachside hotel .
Silly really , and Tony Blair had the right idea : have a good break with the family , give the press a decent photo op and ask to be left alone .
But , as so often with Blair , he slightly overdid it .
Come to think of it , where is he ?"
2010-08-15,"Barack Obama plunged up to his neck into the debate about the safety of Gulf waters after the BP oil spill yesterday when the White House released a photo of the president taking a dip at a Florida resort town .
The White House had cast the trip to Panama City by the president , Michelle Obama and daughter Sasha as a solidarity mission that would help restore public confidence in the resort towns , which have suffered heavy cancellations during the peak school holiday season .
Obama has faced a growing chorus of criticism for not heeding his own advice that Americans vacation in the Gulf .
The president and his family were pictured playing mini golf and taking a boat trip around St Andrews Bay looking for dolphins .
The White House also released a single image of Obama swimming with his daughter by the official photographer Pete Souza .
Other photographers were kept away from the beach .
The resort towns of the Florida panhandle are on the eastern edge of the oil spill but the beaches were still hit by tar balls and an oily sheen .
A study by Oxford Economics for the US Travel Association estimated the spill could cost coastal towns in the four Gulf states nearly $ 23 billion dollars in lost tourism arrivals over the next three years .
On Friday , Alabama became the first state to sue BP for damage from the oil spill .
Louisiana sustained the most damage to its coastline following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig three months ago .
The state 's attorney general said it was suing BP , Transocean and Halliburton for "" catastrophic harm "" caused by the spill .
On Saturday , Obama sought to shore up businesses along the entire Gulf coast .
"" As a result of the clean - up effort beaches all along the Gulf Coast are clean , they are safe and they are open for business , "" Obama told reporters .
"" That 's one of the reasons Michelle , Sasha and I are here . ""
He promised that his administration would continue to monitor the oil as it hit the shore and to make sure the clean up was completed .
But the first family 's own holiday in the Gulf was over within just 27 hours with the Obamas returning to Washington by lunchtime today .
They leave on their real holiday – a 10-day stay in Martha 's Vineyard midweek .
No new oil has entered the Gulf since July 15 when a BP crew fitted a new cap over the well .
The administration 's lead official on the crisis , Coast Guard commander Thad Allen , on Saturday directed BP to conduct a new set of pressure tests on the well before launching the operation to kill it for good with a relief well .
It could be later tomorrow or early on Tuesday before officials know the results of those tests ."
2010-09-16,"Do n't be surprised if "" Freedom fries "" are back on the menu at the White House , with Franco - American relations suffering a frisson after a hotly - disputed claim in a new biography of France 's first lady , Carla Bruni - Sarkozy .
The authors of the new biography , Carla and the Ambitious , say that during a visit to the White House in March , Bruni - Sarkozy asked Michelle Obama what life was like as America 's first lady .
Bruni - Sarkozy recalled Obama telling her : "" Do n't ask .
It 's hell .
I ca n't stand it . ""
A fine scoop , somewhat undermined by the quote being flatly denied by all the parties involved .
""
The First Lady never said that , "" Katie McCormick Lelyveld , Michelle Obama 's press secretary , said in a statement .
The French embassy in Washington DC also said the claim was false . ""
The words attributed to the First Lady of the United States were never said , "" said the embassy 's spokesman Emmanuel Lenain .
""
Mrs Bruni - Sarkozy distances herself completely from the content of the book Carla and the Ambitious , which was not authorised and the authors alone are responsible for its contents , "" Lenain told Politico .
It seems an unlikely tale , since the March visit of the Bruni - Sarkozys was not the first time the two first ladies have met ( the other meetings being Pittsburgh in September 2009 , France in June 2009 and Germany in April 2009 ) , and it seems an unlikely question to ask at the fourth time of meeting .

Stickyskin is a new range designed to match the skin colours of people who are n't white .
As shown by the recent row over the colour "" nude "" – highlighted when Michelle Obama stepped out in a dress in this fashionable peachy - pink shade – the traditional idea of what constitutes a flesh tone does n't apply to everyone .
And while the shade of my plaster has never really occupied my thoughts – I 'm usually too busy moaning about why I have to wear one in the first place – as a woman of colour

2010-10-07,"The newly released 2010 Forbes list of the world 's most powerful women has ranked Michelle Obama at number 1 , usurping the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and even beating omnipresent singer Lady Gaga into 7th place .
The annual list saw a number of media personalities breach the top 10 , including two talk show hosts , Oprah Winfrey and Ellen Degeneres .
Obama , described by Forbes as "" a forceful advocate of school nutrition standards "" , leads a new - look list from the magazine , whose 2009 list of powerful women was mostly dominated by politicians and chief executives of international companies .
"" We 've come up with a new ranking of the female power elite that reflects the New Order of now , "" Forbes explained in an article accompanying the list .
Obama takes the number 1 spot , having been ranked 40th last year , while Winfrey is 3rd ( last year 41st ) , Lady Gaga is 7th ( unplaced ) , Beyonce Knowles is considered the 9th most powerful woman on the planet ( unplaced ) and Degeneres 10th ( unplaced ) .
Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives â€ “ and second in line for the US presidency after the vice - president , Joe Biden â€ “ is 11th on the list .
Earlier this year , Pelosi was heralded as the most powerful woman in US history and the most powerful Speaker in a century .
But apparently this was not enough to make the Forbes top 10 . ""
When we set out to identify this year 's list , we decided it was time to look up and out into the broader culture , "" Forbes said .
"" Our assessment is based less on traditional titles and roles and more on creative influence and entrepreneurship . ""
In the "" money "" column alongside the "" power women "" Forbes mostly lists earnings that an individual or her company has made over the past year , however it does not calculate Obama 's wealth , instead stating simply "" National Budget $ 3,520bn "" .
Merkel is 4th on the list , while last year 's runner up , Sheila Bair â€ “ chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government body that guarantees bank deposits in the US â€ “ falls to 15th .
Other political and business figures to make the top 10 include Irene Rosenfeld , the chief executive of Kraft Foods , who is 2nd , while the US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , is 5th and Indra Nooyi , chief executive of PepsiCo , is 6th .
Forbes came up with the rankings by dividing their candidates into four groups : politics , business , media and lifestyle , before ranking the women in each group , then comparing the groups against one another .
Potential 2012 presidential candidate and sometime wordsmith Sarah Palin , described by Forbes as a "" political maverick and commentator "" , is ranked 16th in the 2010 list ,
while Queen Elizabeth II places 41st â€ “ the only British woman to make the 100 ."

2010-11-07,"As cushions and bedsheets bearing the image of Michelle Obama sold out on the street markets of Mumbai yesterday , the lady herself made an appearance at the city 's university , indulging in a spot of Bollywood dancing .
With the easy charm and infectious good humour that is fast becoming her trademark on the international stage , Mrs Obama spent the first day of the US presidential trip to India with her flat shoes kicked off , dancing , playing hopscotch and banging the tambourine with street children and volunteers on the campus of Mumbai University .
While the US president talked economics with ministers , his wife , India 's newest heroine , was visiting a programme for young runaways and orphans run by the NGO Make a Difference , where she tried to coax her timid audience out of its shell by dancing to the theme song from the 2006 Bollywood movie Rang De Basanti .
"" I did n't grow up with a lot of money , "" she told the children .
"" I never even imagined being the first lady of the United States .
But because I had an education , when the time came to do this , I was ready . ""
Before leaving , she gave each child a bag of stationery and White House M&amp;M sweets .
Jithin Nedumala , 23 , who gave up his own postgraduate education to help found Make a Difference in 2006 , said he hoped the visit would inspire the children he works with .
"" We are here to tell the children to dream big , "" he said .
"" They 're in orphanages and street shelters where they do n't have their parents to push them .

2011-01-20,"Michelle Obama is backing plans by Walmart , the world 's biggest retailer , to provide its customers with healthier and more affordable food options as part of a drive to cut American obesity levels .
The first lady has made promoting healthy eating her key initiative in the White House and joined Walmart representatives at a press conference in Washington to launch the initiative .
Walmart is planning to cut prices on thousands of its packaged foods , reduce fat and salt content , and cut the prices of fresh fruit and vegetables .
The retailer also plans to address the problem of "" food deserts "" â€ “ poor urban areas that do not have supermarkets .
By 2015 , the company hopes to have lowered sodium content by 25 % and sugar by 10 % in its processed goods , and to have phased out any remaining trans - fats .
The announcement has "" the potential to transform the marketplace and help Americans put healthier foods on their tables every single day , "" said Obama .
"" We are really gaining some momentum on this issue , we 're beginning to see things move , "" she said .
"" No family should have to choose between food that is healthier for them and food they can afford , "" said Bill Simon , president and chief executive of Walmart .
The five - year plan came about after discussions with the first lady , who has championed healthy eating since her husband was elected president .
She has also backed a controversial $ 400m - a - year government - funded plan to tackle food deserts .
Studies have linked low - income neighbourhoods to higher rates of obesity .
In one study by New York University 's department of nutrition , food studies and public health , the price and availability of healthy food were identified as key factors in the increased obesity rate .
The plan , and Obama 's backing , may help the retailer expand in the urban areas of Chicago and New York , where locals have been campaigning hard to keep the company out .
Walmart sells more groceries than any other company in the US and the changes are likely to have a major impact on food suppliers .
In 2008 , Walmart stopped buying milk from herds that had been treated with artificial growth hormone , in effect almost banning the practice in the US .
The first lady 's endorsement stands in marked contrast to the Obamas ' previous relations with the retailer .
Before her husband 's election , Michelle Obama resigned from the board of a Walmart supplier after her husband blasted its anti - union policies ."
2011-02-07,"Barack Obama is famous for healthy eating , once revealing a liking for arugula â€ “ or rocket â€ “ salad .
And Michelle Obama has it made her main mission as first lady to encourage health eating , leading by example in tending her own White House vegetable plot .
But all that went on the back burner for the Super Bowl .
On the menu for the 100 friends , members of Congress and celebrities invited to watch the game with the Obamas were lots of salt - laden , cholesterol - filled goodies , the kind of snacks the bulk of Americans would be tucking into in front of their televisions too .
The menu , released yesterday afternoon by the White House , hours before the party , read : bratwurst , kielbasa , cheeseburgers , deep dish pizza , buffalo wings , German potato salad , Snyder 's crisps and pretzels , twice - baked potatoes and ice - cream .
The single concession to Michelle 's healthy - eating campaign : salad .
Beers on offer were from the home state of the Green Bay Packers â€ “ Wisconsin 's Hinterland Pale Ale and Amber lager â€ “ and the Pittsburgh Steelers
â€ “ Yuengling Traditional and Light Lager .
Before joining the party , Obama sat down for a 15-minute live interview with Fox News 's Bill O'Reilly , as part of the build - up to the Super Bowl .
Given the estimated 100 million who watched the Super Bowl last year , O'Reilly claimed it would be "" the most watched interview of all time "" .
Although O'Reilly is near - hysterical in his hostility towards Obama on his nightly show , he was relatively restrained and polite in his questioning , which ranged from Egypt to the state of the economy .
Both men only seemed to come to life towards the end when they began to talk about the Super Bowl .
O'Reilly seemed to suggest that Obama , a basketball fanatic , did not know much about football .
Obama was insistent that he did and , unlike Tony Blair 's unconvincing claim to be a Newcastle fan , demonstrated in detail that he knew all about ' black and gold ' and ' cheeseheads ' .
O'Reilly asked if the president would be able to devote his full attention to the game , given he had invited 100 people â€ “ including the likes of Jennifer Lopez â€ “ to the White House .
Obama said he would mingle with them until the game started and then that would be it : the focus , he said , would be on watching the game ."

As the month - long carousel of catwalk shows gets into full swing in New York , the recent row in the US over Michelle Obama 's decision to wear a British rather than an American designer dress to a state event , coupled with the debut of Samantha Cameron as ambassador for the British Fashion Council , has made patriotism in fashion a political hot potato that is threatening to overshadow catwalk trends .
This week Obama again tried to draw a line under "" Frockgate "" â€ “ sparked by her wearing a striking red Alexander McQueen gown to the Chinese state dinner , and a dress and coat by smaller British label Roksanda Illincic during the same week â€ “ during a press call at the White House .
"" I do n't buy a designer ; I buy a dress , "" she said .
New York fashion week will , of course , be dominated by US designers , save for a few cameo appearances by their British counterparts â€ “ most notably Victoria Beckham .
One of the designers who criticised the first lady â€ “
Diane Von Furstenberg â€ “ is showing her collections .
Next Friday , attention switches across the Atlantic to another leader 's partner as , for the first time , Cameron takes a lead role in London fashion week .
Appointed a British Fashion Council ambassador last September , she did not attend the shows then as she had recently given birth to her daughter , Florence , the Camerons ' fourth child .
This season , however , will be her official ambassadorial debut .
Not wearing a British designer is no longer an option .
"" I take huge personal pleasure and pride in wearing our young designers , "" Cameron said .
Over the past few months she has been careful to wear only British designer labels , but the decision has not been met with universal approval .
She recently wore a full - length gown by the British designer Osman Yousefzada to the British Fashion Awards ceremony , and was praised for showcasing a label that is established , although not widely known .
But the Â£750 Paul Smith dress she wore to the Conservative party conference in September â€ “ at the same time that huge cuts in public spending were being announced â€ “ was heavily criticised in the media .
Since then the fashion industry has come out in support of Cameron 's wardrobe choices .
In this month 's issue of Vogue , editor Alexandra Shulman argued that the negative reaction "" demonstrated a small - minded lack of understanding of women and designer fashion that infuses our culture "" .
On Thursday , Elle magazine 's editor Lorraine Candy blasted the criticism as "" a peculiar kind of male chauvinistic outrage "" .
In addition to making the event 's opening speech alongside the fashion council 's chairman , Harold Tillman , Cameron will host a drinks reception at Downing Street for the fashion industry .
The event is unofficially being described as a siren call to international buyers , for whom the No 10 address will add an extra pull .
It is unlikely , though , that the style patriotism debate will continue once the fashion circus rolls into Milan and Paris by the end of the month .
The Milanese have so far been unconcerned by the issue , while the French are used to seeing Carla Bruni - Sarkozy in expensive designer French labels .
According to Candy : "" It 's never queried when [ Mrs Sarkozy ] wears Dior , because the French are more used to seeing fashion as a business , and they are happy to represent it . ""

2011-02-15,"Race and the catwalk New York magazine zooms in on the big issue of race and fashion in its latest issue .
The article by Robin Givhan , who won a Pulitzer Prize for her fashion writing , looks at why black models remain far and few between on the runway ; why ' black facing ' [ using dark makeup to cover a white model to make them appear black ] is still happening ; and whether or not the hoopla around who will dress Michelle Obama is actually making more designers sit up and pay attention to black female consumers interested in fashion .
Givhan 's piece is brilliantly written and provocative .
As a black journalist myself , I particularly liked the section where she describes what it is like to be the only black editor , publicist or fashion designer in the room .
Jessica Simpson : from Daisy Duke denim shorts to fashion mogul "" Do n't underestimate reality TV stars "" - this seems to be the theme of fashion week , what with Kim Kardashian on the front row , J - Woww from the Jersey Shore on the catwalk , and now New York magazine reporting that Jessica Simpson ( famous for her reality show Newlyweds and "" acting "" in The Dukes of Hazzard in tiny shorts and cowboy boots ) owns a billion dollar fashion empire .
As the cover star for the magazine 's latest issue , Simpson waxes lyrical about her Jessica Simpson Collection , which "" clocked sales around $ 750 million last year "" .
The magazine notes that her other skills include being able to "" burp the alphabet "" .
New store for the fashion boy wonder This week , when media outlets were n't fawning over Alexander Wang 's clothes , they were speculating when his newly revamped NYC Soho store would open .
Racked.com has the answer ( 17 February , since you asked nicely ) and some exclusive sketches of the store , courtesy of WWD .
The Olsen twins to design ( flat ) shoes Mary - Kate and Ashley have teamed up with Toms footwear for a collaboration with their fashion house The Row , reports WWD .
The shoes will range in price from $ 98 to $ 150 - definitely not cheap ( some might say downright expensive ) but the Toms philosophy is a charitable one : money from each shoe sold goes towards a pair for a child in need .
Betsey Johnson puts real women on the runway Zut alors !
Real people on the runway , what 's going on ?
At Betsey Johnson on Monday , the catwalk was alive with her colourful collection called He Loves Me ...
He Loves Me
Not , but the surprise came once the models went backstage . '
Real ' people then hit the runway in Betsey 's clothing , wearing "" Betsey Johnson - lookalike wigs "" and strutting their stuff to show how wearable and versatile her clothing is .
The designer herself ended the show , dancing down the runway with Sex and the City stylist Patricia Field .
Vampires need well - cut jeans too WWD announces that Twilight star ( no , not Robert Pattinson , the other one )
Kellan Lutz is the new spokesman for "" Los Angeles - based premium denim label Dylan George . ""
Lutz will front the new men 's line launching in the autumn .
That 's a funny name for a jeans brand , you may well say .
It turns out the label is named after a street intersection in Venice , California - so now you know .
And so do sports stars ...
Coolest sports and fashion pairing of NYFW goes to Sean Avery , a famous ice hockey player for the New York Rangers ( and former Vogue intern ) .
Avery hosted the men 's night of fashion , music and sports over at the Skybox in Lincoln Centre on Monday night and I grabbed him for a few minutes .
I had to admit that I had never heard of him , what with my total ignorance of hockey , but the chance to speak to a major league sports star , who at some point visited the fashion closet at American Vogue ( and possibly did a coffee run for Anna Wintour ) was too good to pass up .
During our chat he revealed being teased by team - mates for posing naked in the recent Marc Jacobs Protect
The Skin
You 're In campaign , which featured celebrities including Heidi Klum , Dita Von Teese and Victoria Beckham .
It turns out that Avery not only knows his Burberry from his Chanel , but he 's also well - connected in the fashion world .
At the end of our three minutes I casually mentioned that since watching The September Issue I 'm totally intrigued by the Vogue offices .

2011-02-17,"They may not ( yet ) have been invited to the royal wedding in April , but the US president and first lady will make their first state visit to the UK in May after accepting an official invitation from the Queen .
Barack and Michelle Obama will spend three days as guests of the royal household arriving on Tuesday 24 May before leaving on Thursday 26 May and travelling on to this year 's G8 summit in Deauville on the northern coast of France .
Though the pair have visited the UK before , when Obama was a Democratic presidential candidate in July 2008 and next with a high - profile visit in April 2009 for the G20 summit , this time they will get the full regal works â€ “ a ceremonial welcome , guest rooms at Buckingham Palace and a banquet held in their honour .
There will be work too , with Obama likely to bring a delegation and hold meetings with David Cameron .
Their sit downs are likely to be less fractious than they once might have been .
Obama believes in a strong unified European Union and is said to have been relieved that Cameron 's period as prime minister has so far seen him go easy on the Euroscepticism .
They will be expected to discuss timetables for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and also the progress of their deficit reduction programmes .
Once Obama did not share Cameron 's analysis that public spending cuts were necessary while both economies were ailing , but he has now begun a deficit reduction .
Obama is the least sentimental of all recent American presidents about the "" special relationship "" but after the involvement of BP in last year 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico â€ “ during which Obama emphasised the company was called British Petroleum â€ “ Obama issued clarifying remarks , saying the Anglo - American relationship was "" truly special "" .
The PM 's official spokesman said : "" The prime minister is very pleased this visit is taking place .
It is a sign of the strong and enduring relationship between our two countries .
"" There are only usually one or two state visits a year to the UK â€ “ the last was in October by the Emir of Qatar .
Since the Queen 's coronation in 1952 there have been 12 US presidents and she has met all of them barring Lyndon B Johnson .
It is the first state visit of the US president since George W Bush was invited over by the Queen in 2003 .
Bush visited again in 2008 when he stayed at Windsor Castle but that was not a full state visit .
In 2003 between 110,000 and 200,000 people protested about Bush 's visit and Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic toppled a five metre - effigy of the president .
There will be also concerns over costs this time .
Policing the recent state visit of the pope cost as much as Â£7 m .
But protests are less likely with Obama , who is likely to get a much warmer reception with both public and the palace .
The first American couple visited Buckingham Palace in 2009 when Michelle Obama was seen placing her hand on the back of the Queen â€ “
a breach of protocol meant to suggest the pair had got on very well .
When Michelle Obama brought her daughters to the UK on a private holiday , they were given a tour of Buckingham Palace and met the Queen .
It may still be that the Obamas visit in the month before for the royal wedding on 29 April .
The guest list for that event is still unpublished , but so far the Obamas have not received their invitation .
Michelle Obama last week told the American chat show Live with Regis and Kelly : "" No , I 'm not going â€ ¦
I was n't invited "" , but appeared happy to attend if asked .
The first lady said : "" You know what ?
Marriage is a personal , private thing .
They should invite who they want to invite .
And if I get invited , I 'll go .
Sure , why not ? ""
Though Nancy Reagan attended the royal wedding of Diana and Charles in 1981 and the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986 , she attended alone without Ronald Reagan .
When Bill Clinton was president neither he nor Hillary attended Prince Edward 's wedding to Sophie Rhys - Jones in 1999 ."
2011-02-18,"About a decade ago , sitting around thinking about Hillary Clinton and some of the more fantastical attacks on her , I had a screenplay idea .
It would concern a first lady of the US .
Her campaign ( first ladies always have anodyne campaigns - literacy , historic preservation ) would be healthful eating .
It would start out all well and good .
She 'd get more green vegetables into school lunches .
She 'd set an example of her own by snacking on unbleached nuts and so forth , which would send the unbleached nut lobby over the moon and would otherwise offend no one so much , because it 's not as if the mighty potato chip ( crisp ) has much to fear from drab almonds .
Everyone applauds her efforts .
End of Act I. Matters were to darken considerably in Act II , when my FLOTUS ( that 's the Secret Service name for any first lady ) is no longer satisfied with school lunches and extends her malevolent , busy - bodyish glare into the private sector .
She starts bugging the major US family restaurant chains - Cracker Barrel , Applebee 's , Outback Steakhouse , etc .
- to put more vegetables on the menu .
It 's a hard fought battle but she succeeds !
Next up , the fast - food chains .
McDonald 's offering broccoli as an alternative to French fries ?
Now she 's verging on something un - American .
By Act III , she 's getting a bit more messianic , and she 's encouraging media exposes into the meat industry , and that 's where she crosses a fateful line .
The beef lobby takes out a contract on her .
It would have been a fantastic dark comedy .
Well , reality has caught up with me , in a way .
These conservative attacks on Michelle Obama for the crime of trying to encourage healthier eating are probably beyond my ability to have parodied .
These people are really parked in some tree that the rest of us never climb .
Honestly .
It 's nanny - statism for the IRS to offer tax deductibility for breast pumps ?
Breast pumps are expensive : $ 250 or more .
Some women do n't need them .
But some absolutely do .
And at that price , poor women ca n't afford them .
Good for the IRS !
TNR 's Jon Cohn wrote a great post about all of this in which he quotes the first lady as saying not too long ago : Nearly two - thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese .
More than 60 percent of Americans do not get enough physical activity .
â€ ¦ The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that overweight and obesity alone cost American families , businesses , and government approximately $ 117 billion every year .
â€
¦
The good news , though , is that there are things that each of us can do -- as individuals , as family members , as caregivers , as heads of business , and leaders of government -- to take better care of ourselves , and the people around us .
The federal government is doing its part by educating Americans about preventive measures that can save their own lives .
Wuh - woh .
That was n't Michelle Obama .
That was Laura Bush .
I predict here and now that , should either Mike Huckabee or Chris Christie be the GOP presidential nominee in 2012 , all this will become a fairly high - ranking campaign issue and Barack Obama 's thinness will be advertised on Fox et alia as a literal physical manifestation of his weakness .
One can hear the arguments , right -- that Obama 's slightness indicates a kind of fussiness one expects from liberals , a dainty and soft quality , something not quite manly about it ; whereas Christie and Huckabee , why , these are red - blooded men , men of appetites , enjoyers of a good steak who like the rest of us do n't mind once in a while defying their doctor 's orders and slathering the sour cream on the baked potato ... writes itself , as all their copy does ."
2011-02-18,"Michelle Obama 's campaign to encourage breastfeeding among American mothers has become the unlikely focus of an attack by two prominent rightwing politicians .
Tea Party favourites Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann have used Obama 's breastfeeding drive as a stick with which to beat her .
Bachmann began the onslaught by ridiculing the first lady 's support for this week 's decision to award tax breaks to mothers for the cost of breast pumps .
"" I 've given birth to five babies and I breastfed every single one of these babies , "" she told the conservative Laura Ingraham 's radio talkshow . ""
To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies .
You wanna talk about the nanny state ?
I think we just got the new definition of nanny . ""
Palin waded in during an event with business leaders in Long Island .
"" It 's no wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody you better breastfeed your baby , "" she quipped . ""
Yeah , you better â€ “ because the price of milk is so high right now ! ""
The White House hit back with a comment from the first lady 's office : "" Breastfeeding is a very personal choice for every woman , and we are trying to make it easier for those who choose to do it . ""
Obama 's interest in breastfeeding is an extension of her effort to reduce obesity levels among children .
The campaign has helped foster initiatives from her husband 's administration to remove barriers to breastfeeding , including legislation that obliges some employers to provide time and dedicated spaces for women workers to nurse their children in private .
Breastfeeding is said to give protection against allergies , asthma and other ailments and is considered beneficial in America 's fight against soaring youth obesity .
Obesity is especially prevalent in African American families , who also have lower rates of breastfeeding : 40 % of African American babies never receive any breast milk , even in the first days of life .
In the past 30 years , obesity levels among US children have tripled and now almost one in three are overweight or obese .
The trend has led to a diabetes epidemic .
A recent study from Harvard Medical School estimated that if the rate of breastfeeding in US families could be raised to 90 % for six months after birth , 900 infant deaths per year would be prevented and $ 13bn ( Â£8bn ) saved in medical fees and other economic impacts .
At current levels , about 75 % of American mothers begin breastfeeding , but the figure drops to 43 % by the time the baby is six months old .
Palin 's jibe at Obama is particularly puzzling given her own record in politics .
MediaMatters , a misinformation monitoring website , pointed out that when she was governor of Alaska
she introduced a breastfeeding awareness month ."
2011-03-03,"Last week , I spent some time away from the east coast corridor of the US and escaped the "" Washington bubble "" .
Never mind that Michelle Obama and Senator Mark Udall were skiing at the same Colorado ski resort , the experience off the coast reminded me of what I often forget about the "" real "" America and the national traits that lured me to this country from Britain in the first place .
In the state of Colorado – both the physical crossroads of the United States and an icon of the political centre ( some call it the "" perfect purple state "" )
–
I have been reminded of one fundamental , simple but powerful reality : Americans are the most polite , warmhearted people on earth .
They are civil .
And I would argue that civility actually does extend to politics .
A subjective view ?
Certainly .
But I gladly take on that argument .
Sure , the "" have a nice day "" stereotype has been done to death .
And yes , perhaps some foreigners see American chirpiness as disingenuous .
But when it comes to interpersonal interaction I find it downright comforting to be surrounded by a people that seem to be so genuinely interested in my experience : where I 'm from , what I do , whether I 'm enjoying myself .
And if you 're looking for politeness , go no further than the ski lift lines in Vail , one of the most popular resorts in the country .
Here , "" après vous "" is n't a rarity , it 's sacrosanct , as it is across the country : on roads , in lifts , in the street and elsewhere .
You go , then I go .
No wonder Jon Stewart , speaking to hundreds of thousands during his rally on Washington 's Mall in October , used a similar analogy to demonstrate the fundamental civility of the American people .
During his keynote address that day , Stewart stood in front of a picture of the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel in New York , where over 20 lines of cars end up as two lanes .
Each time lanes merge , most drivers politely alternate .
You go , then I go .
That spirit very difficult to remember when you live at the heart of Washington .
After all , it 's a common known fact that civility in the political discourse is at an all - time low .
Or is it ?
Is that just true in Washington ?
Is it true at all ?
I would argue it 's simply not accurate .
Even in Washington .
The political landscape is littered with senators and members of Congress who have reached across the aisles to make lasting friendships and working relationships .
Even George W Bush and Senator Edward Kennedy put aside their differences to pass education reform , after all .
Yet , why does n't this private civility translate into the public political dialogue ?
I put it down to the "" on camera "" effect .
Spurred by a media that shuns nuance , relegates news about compromise and bipartisanship and hypes political dissonance , politicians and leaders of political movements are driven to negative , sometimes hateful , language and behaviour , whether it be a combative Republican State of the Union response ( even after a measured speech by the president ) or at a Tea Party rally .
What do these events have in common ?
The cameras are watching .
Even quite obviously bipartisan achievements are not portrayed as such by the media .
Consider the closing days of the last Congress when tax cuts were passed , the repeal of "" Do n't ask , do n't tell "" was achieved and the Start treaty was ratified .
True , these were victories for the president , as endlessly portrayed in the media .
But they were also bipartisan achievements : the fruits of genuinely civil debate behind closed doors .
But do n't expect political commentators to see it that way .
So , it 's no wonder this almost fake fighting spirit is repudiated by a fundamentally civil American electorate , which is desperate for politicians to set aside their differences and work together the people do in everyday life .
It 's because Americans are a fundamentally good , civil people that they have turned away from Washington , which they believe is simply out of step with the way they behave .
Of course , exceptions exist .
The Tea Party movement can hardly be characterised as polite .
But those are the vocal minority who exercise disproportionate influence with a desperate press .
Politicians would do well to remember – genuinely – where they came from , and start practising what they preach : civility , on and off the camera , to regain the trust of a disillusioned electorate .
In other words , you go , then I go ."
2011-03-17,"Michelle Obama is hoping to join her husband on the bestseller lists with a book devoted to her experience of creating a vegetable plot on the White House lawn .
The book , due in April next year , will detail the US first lady 's pet project , set up as part of a campaign against obesity , and will be padded out with the Obamas ' favourite healthy recipes .
Given the success of books by previous first ladies , it is almost certain to become a bestseller .
Barack Obama made a small fortune from his autobiography , Dreams
From My Father , and a political treatise , Audacity of Hope , but the proceeds of his wife 's book will to go to charity .
Michelle Obama dug her first vegetable garden on the White House lawn in March 2008 , two months after Barack Obama became president , and has grown about 55 varieties , most of whichare used by the White House chefs .
As well as vegetables , such as lettuce , peppers and spinach , Obama and her team of helpers also grow herbs and berries .
She was out on the lawn again on Wednesday for photographers to mark the garden 's third season .
In an interview with AP , she said she wanted to share the story of the garden with the rest of the nation and perhaps the rest of the world because she "" received so many questions about it :
How did we do it ?
Why did we do it ?
How do I do this in my own home or community ? ""
Eleanor Roosevelt had a "" victory "" garden at the White House during the second world war and the Clintons made a modest effort , with a few vegetable pots on the White House roof .
Michelle Obama did not have a vegetable plot in her home city , Chicago , but was persuaded by advocates of healthy eating to take it up as project when she moved to Washington .
She has said she was partly influenced by a paediatrician who expressed concern about the diet of the Obama children , Malia and Sasha , brought up in Chicago on processed , fast - foods such as pizza , and how they might put on weight .
Obama said her book , which will be written with the help of a ghost - writer , will have the president 's input in some capacity .
"" I will definitely have him be involved and look at it , "" the first lady told AP ."
2011-04-26,"Take off your coat , take off your boot , Take off your woolly hat , your boiler suit ...
These lyrics from the song ' Bag Lady ' by comedian Rich Hall sum up how I dress for working in the garden .
While other women seem to look effortlessly chic while tending their plots ( I am thinking of Michelle Obama , Carol Klein , Rachel de Thame , to name a few ) , I start the day by stumbling out the back door in ill - fitting cords and a shapeless sweater , and end it looking as if I have been dragged through a hedge backwards : not so much shabby chic as just plain shabby .
* I realised quite how far from fashionable I 'd become when I started mulling boiler suit options on the web as a viable alternative outfit for those sessions turning the compost heap .
I console myself with the fact that no one barring my family sees me pottering about in the veg patch with wild hair and mismatching gloves , but what about when I 'm working in my front garden , or even up on my new green roof ?
Not a big problem , the neighbours probablyl already think I am bonkers .
But now I 've agreed to let photographer Paul Debois take my photograph for a series he 's doing on women garden writers .
Panic .
So I need help , people .
What do you wear in the garden
that 's comfortable , practical and effortlessly cool ?
Or should I continue to channel the ' Bag Lady ' look and have done with it ?
Let me know what you 're mowing the lawn in these days : even better if you can supply a picture to our Flickr feed .
* I should say that I did try to find a picture of myself dressed for gardening to add to this post , but of the only two I could find , one was so blurry as to be unusable and the other only showed my muddy boots .
Clearly I have an inbuilt desire to avoid being captured on film looking like a tramp ."
2011-05-11,"It should have been a controversy - free event , a night of poetry at the White House .
But instead a literary celebration turned into a mini - row over the lyrics of a rapper invited to perform .
Michelle Obama invited a selection of poets and other writers , part of a series highlighting American music and literature .
Rightwingers are upset that the list of performers on Wednesday night included the rapper Common , whose lyrics they claim glorify violence , in particular A Son for Assta .
It is sympathetic to a former Black Panther convicted of killing a policeman almost 40 years ago .
Although Common , real name Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr , has been widely praised for his positive messages , rightwingers have homed in on the song about Assata Shakur , who was found guilty of the New Jersey shooting in 1973 .
She escaped from jail in 1979 and has since been in exile in Cuba .
Common wrote : "" Your power and pride is beautiful .
May God bless your soul . ""
Among those complaining are Sarah Palin , a possible Republican presidential candidate , and Karl Rove , a former adviser to George Bush .
Rove described Common as a thug while Palin wrote sarcastically "" Oh lovely , White House "" .
New Jersey police members also added their voice . ""
The young people who read this stuff , hear this stuff , are getting a very dangerous and deadly message , "" David Jones , president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association union , told NBC .
The White House spokesman , Jay Carney , was forced to defend the invitation to Common , saying the media was presenting a distorted picture of him and that his work should be looked at as a whole . ""
While the president does n't support the kind of lyrics raised here , we do think some of the reports distort what Mr Lynn stands for more broadly in order to stoke controversy , "" Carney said .
He described Common as "" within the genre of hip hop and rap , in what 's known as a conscious rapper "" .
He added that it was possible to oppose some of what Common has done while appreciating the rest . ""
One of the things the president appreciates is the work Mr Lynn has done with children , especially trying to get them to focus on poetry as opposed to some of the negative influences of life on the streets , "" Carney said ."
2011-05-24,"Those keen to pinpoint exactly how an essential relationship differs from a special one will be tracking Michelle Obama 's wardrobe choices closely .
The president 's wife has a talent for projecting a style which underscores and illustrates her husband 's political message , while showcasing her own personality .
From the glamour she brought to the campaign trail to the casual style she brings to appearances at her vegetable garden or with her daughters , she has been adept at matching the look to the message .
The keynote of the outfit worn for the palace visit was cheerful informality .
The unspoken palace dress code , as worn by the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall , usually revolves around a matching suit , whether dress and coat , as worn by the Queen , or jacket and skirt , as seen on the Duchess .
Michelle Obama wore a pale - blue silk dress , by the American designer Barbara Tfank , which with a matching coat would have been almost suitable for the Queen herself .
But by wearing it with a pink bolero she set herself apart ; a visual demonstration of a difference in mindset .
Both pieces , by themselves , could have come from a royal wardrobe .
It is as if she rifled through the Queen and Duchess 's clothes rails and put an outfit together by taking apart two formal suits .
Michelle Obama uses the unexpected â€ “ a vibrant colour combination , a punchy belt , flat shoes where you would expect a formal court pair â€ “ to add personality which helps to humanise very formal situations .
Without her colourful outfit , the photocall from the gun salute at the palace would have blended unnoticed into any gallery of similar state occasions .
She used a similar trick at the inauguration of her husband , when instead of choosing any of the obvious , symbolic colours â€ “ power red , or Democrat blue â€ “
she chose a colour which had reporters scrambling to describe . ""
Lemongrass "" came out on top ; so , too , did Michelle 's impressive ability to introduce a new word into the conversation .
Kate Betts , an American fashion editor who has written a book about Michelle Obama 's look , wrote in the New York Times earlier this year that "" her message of optimism and appearance is often transmitted through her appearance .
She is sometimes an ambassador for American designers , but more important , she is an ambassador for the self - possession that defines American style . ""
After channelling Jackie Kennedy on the campaign trail and in her early appearances , she has in the past year moved toward a more casual look .
Shift dresses and pearls have been dropped in favour of prom - style skirts , simple knitwear , bright stripes .
Her outfit for the palace visit will perhaps play better at home than it will in Britain : the full - skirted shape and curved collar referenced a gracious , homemade lemonade vision of American womanhood which is perhaps what the US public want her to represent at Buckingham Palace .
But to modern British eyes â€ “ post Alexander McQueen wedding dress , post - Pippa madness â€
“
it looked somewhat stiff and upholstered .
The contrast with the new Duchess of Cambridge was marked and surprising .
The first lady was in girlish , almost princessly sheeny florals ; the new princess , by contrast , looked a vision of modern , transatlantic glamour .
The dress , the blow - dry , the deep tan : this could be Victoria Beckham at a Los Angeles luncheon .
What 's more , Kate 's dress is currently available on the British high street , for Â£175 , from Reiss .
If the look for the earlier part of the day was intended to radiate an upbeat informality , the outfit that Michelle Obama chose to wear for her meeting at No 10 was rather more stately .
She chose to wear a claret dress by the British designer Roksanda Ilincic underneath a cobalt blue coat by US designer Narciso Rodriguez .
She has worn Ilincic previously , during the week of the state visit to the US from the Chinese president .
Then her preference for British designers was criticised as being unpatriotic â€ “ her decision to wear a red Alexander McQueen evening gown being the most contentious and sparking outcry amongst certain US designers .
Tuesday'snod of approval to Illincic for the much - anticipated meeting with Samanatha Cameron was more safe than subversive .
Instead it fell to the PM 's wife , pictured , to play the fashion - forward trump card .
In a skilled display of fashion fluency , she chose to wear a printed dress by the British - based design duo Peter Pilotto .
It has become something of a Michelle Obama trademark to champion a little - known designer by wearing a fashion - crowd pleasing yet uncomplicated dress , and this is precisely what Samantha Cameron did .
It is unlikely that the abstract printed dress worn with grey platforms was demonstrative of an undercurrent of sartorial competition .
Instead , by echoing the usual style of her guest , the host was displaying a form of style synthesis which can only be read as entirely welcoming ."
2011-05-24,"The confident , casual and infectiously amiable aura that captivated Ireland and much of London was deposited at the west door of Westminster Abbey at 3.07pm .
As they waited at its threshold , Barack and Michelle Obama risked a final smile before stepping into the most solemn moment of their visit .
"" It 's a pleasure to be back again , "" said the first lady .
"" She gets to come to all the fun places , "" joked the president .
The abbey 's most famous â€ “ and most anonymous â€ “ resident lies beneath a blanket of black marble a few yards from the entrance , and it was him that the Obamas had come to see .
"" We honour the Unknown Warrior , "" said the Very Rev Dr John Hall , dean of Westminster .
"" His presence recalls to mind the world wars and conflicts of the past century in which the forces of the crown have been engaged together with those of our nation 's allies .
Here we pray for all those who have give their lives in the cause of peace â€ ¦ for those who strive on our behalf for justice .
"" The couple stood , eyes closed and hands clasped , as a US marine and an air force general marched over to lay a red , white and blue wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior .
Above a ribbon stamped with "" The president of the United States of America "" , was pinned a handwritten note : "" In remembrance . ""
The presidential visit to the tomb came a day after the Ministry of Defence announced the death of the 366th British service person in Afghanistan .
It was a visit heavy with historical parallels .
Not far from where the Obamas stood as the abbey choir sang Justorum animae (
The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God ) , a stone plaque commemorating another US president hangs .
Beneath an eagle with outstretched wings is inscribed the message : "" To the honoured memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , 1882 - 1945 .
A faithful friend of freedom and of Britain .
"" Even the sunlight that filtered into the abbey had to pass through stained glass windows paying tribute to the Army Medical Corps "" of all ranks who gave their lives in the service of their country "" .
The president explained his presence in the abbey in the 13 words he stooped to write in the distinguished visitors ' book : "" It is a great privilege to commemorate our common heritages , and common sacrifices . ""
Duty done , the Obamas went back to doing what they do best : charming all those in their orbit .
They made a point of meeting each member of the choir , and making jokes that sent laughter into the vaulted ceiling . ""
He was just very , very nice with them , "" said Hall . ""
He insisted on speaking to each one of them . ""
The dean also revealed what had provoked the choristers ' mirth . ""
He told them he thought he could sing , but Michelle Obama told them he can dance but not sing . ""
As a parting gift , the president left the choristers with a promise â€ “ and a scoop .
Given that the visit had been "" just too short "" , he said , he was planning to return "" in my second term "" .
And with that , the Obamas left the warrior to his eternal sleep and stepped out into the afternoon sunshine and the roaring of another crowd ."
2011-05-24,"Barack Obama is to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace , as the US president 's state visit to Britain formally begins to cement what the countries ' elected leaders describe as "" an essential relationship "" .
The palace said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , who have returned from their honeymoon in recent days , will also meet the president and the first lady , Michelle Obama .
Barack Obama arrived in the UK from Ireland on Air Force One late on Monday , earlier than planned , to avoid the volcanic ash cloud moving south - east from Iceland .
He stayed at the US ambassador 's residence in central London ahead of a day of royal protocol with most of the hard talking on global politics with David Cameron expected on Wednesday .
The prime minister is hopeful the two leaders can assert that they are aligned on tackling financial deficits as well as addressing Libya , the Arab spring and Afghanistan .
The palace said the Obamas would meet the new royal couple in the 1844 room for around 10 minutes before the formal welcome begins in the garden , where they will be greeted by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall .
There will be a ceremonial welcome from the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh , and the Obamas will then view the royal picture gallery .
After the palace , the Obamas are due to go to Westminster Abbey to lay a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior before meeting David and Samantha Cameron at Downing Street .
They are also expected to meet the opposition leader , Ed Miliband , at Buckingham Palace where they will stay after a formal dinner .
Royal watchers will be hoping for a repeat of the famous embrace between the Queen and America 's first lady , when the Obamas last visited in 2009 .
Any implicit endorsement of the government 's deficit reduction plan by the Democrat president would be a big political prize for the Conservatives , helping to immunise the prime minister from some Labour attacks that the cuts are going too fast and too deep .
In a joint article , Obama and Cameron said that despite being two leaders from two different political traditions , they saw "" eye to eye "" .
"" When the United States and Britain stand together , our people and people around the world can become more secure and more prosperous . ""
And that is the key to our relationship .
Yes , it is founded on a deep emotional connection , by sentiment and ties of people and culture .
But the reason it thrives , the reason why this is such a natural partnership , is because it advances our common interests and shared values .
"" It is a perfect alignment of what we both need and what we both believe .
And the reason it remains strong is because it delivers time and again .
Ours is not just a special relationship , it is an essential relationship â€ “ for us and for the world .
"" They also promised not to abandon the protesters fighting for democracy in the Arab spring .
"" We will not stand by as their aspirations get crushed in a hail of bombs , bullets and mortar fire , "" said the two leaders , in an article in the Times .
"" We are reluctant to use force , but when our interests and values come together , we know we have a responsibility to act â€
¦ We will stand with those who want to bring light into dark , support those who seek freedom in place of repression , aid those laying the building blocks of democracy .
"" The article also refers to the need to tackle deficits .
Privately , Conservative sources are increasingly confident that the Treasury and its US counterpart are now seeing eye to eye on deficit reduction after being at odds for some months .
They believe the US treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , has formed a close relationship with the chancellor , George Osborne .
In April , Obama laid out plans to cut the deficit by $ 4tn ( Â£2.5tn ) over the next 10 years , a pace of reduction that the Conservatives claim is similar to their UK goals .
The British plan aims to cut the deficit from 11.1 % of gross domestic product in 2009 - 10 to 1.5 % of GDP in 2015 - 16 .
Under the president 's plan , public - sector borrowing will fall from 10.9 % of GDP this year to 3.3 % in 2016 .
The US plan starts later , but aims to achieve the same pace of reduction , using the same proportionate mix of tax rises and spending cuts ."
2011-05-25,"In fashion terms the barbecue outfit is a niche sub - genre which can be very tricky to get right .
The look needs to be upbeat and summery but at the same time involve an outfit able to absorb the odd splodge of tomato ketchup .
It 's a difficult ask of a dress , especially when you factor in the glare of the world 's media looking to dissect the meaning of every last pleat and seam .
Yesterday at the No 10 barbecue Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron took different approaches to the sartorial conundrum .
Mrs O chose a crystal embellished black chiffon dress by the American designer Tracy Reese .
The fabric and beading were arguably an odd choice which left many commentators noting that the dress would have been more suitable for sundown rather than in the harsh midday light .
But Obama demonstrated that much of her current status as an international style leader comes not what she actually wears but from the way she wears it .
Despite its cocktail - ready appearance Obama managed to look at ease in the dress â€ “ not an easy feat when you are simultaneously wielding salad tongs and wearing silk chiffon in front of TV cameras .
Cameron 's lighter choice provided a stark contrast to the monochrome of Obama .
Her outfit was by the Scottish designer Jonathan Saunders .
The white and pale blue cotton dress with its sharp emerald belt was perfectly pitched for the almost cartoon - like choreographed event .
The crescent dress has a meaty price tag at Â£895 but Cameron 's choice yesterday was not profligate .
It demonstrated her commitment to showing off the best of British design on the world 's stage .
Saunders was not an unexpected choice .
The designer is having a storming season .
His most recent collection at London Fashion Week in February was judged by many to have been the strongest show of the week both at home and internationally .
In showcasing such a hot brand , Cameron was not seeking insider fashion approval â€ “ although she doubtless got it
â€ “
rather she was underscoring her commitment to supporting the British fashion industry after Tuesday 's choice of a dress by the lesser known label Peter Pilotto .
Unsurprisingly neither woman opted to wear an apron over their clothes .
For a recent barbecue President Obama managed to pull off wearing an apron with the US presidential seal sewn on it , but given the close scrutiny of both women 's wardrobes and the negative associations an apron can bring it was perhaps wise to steer clear of this option â€ “ no matter how practical .
Later in the day British fashion received a further boost .
Before the visit it was almost a certainty that one of the first ladies would wear â€ “ or at least consider wearing â€ “ Alexander McQueen .
It fell to Obama during her address to the students from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School at Oxford University to break out what is now arguably the most well known of British fashion labels .
Since the Duchess of Cambridge chose to wear McQueen twice on her wedding day the label has become the symbolic flag flyer for all that is good in British fashion .
Obamas decision to wear the label in Oxford will be read as a friendly nod of respect to brand Britain as well as to the fashion brand itself .
The white cotton tunic shirt and large Western style belt were from the summer collection and were at the opposite end of the style spectrum to the royal wedding dress .
More everyday than extraordinary , the shirt and slim black trousers radiated an easy warmth amid the intimidating atmosphere of the historic and grand surroundings .
It was an approachable look which was in keeping with her signature style and which also chimed well with her self - professed role as "" Mom - in - chief "" , something which she referred to during her inspirational speech ."
2011-05-25,"Considering they were surrounded by scores of press photographers and TV cameras , a clutch of shaven - headed secret service officers and the imposing portraits of "" great white men "" from the last five centuries and more , it was really quite an intimate gathering .
A gossipy , girlish huddle where they talked about books , boys , worries and what they wanted to be when they grew up .
"" I remember back when I was your age , "" confided the tall woman at their centre , "" trying to decide which schools I would apply to .
I worried that I would n't be as well prepared as students from more privileged families .
I worried that I would n't fit in . ""
After a few months , though , she had realised that she was "" just as capable "" as her peers .
And now she is the US first lady .
Two years ago , in what she reminded her audience was her first solo international engagement , Michelle Obama visited the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Language College , in Islington , London , where 54 % of students receive free school meals , more than nine in 10 are non - white , and more than a fifth are from refugee families .
Political niceties aside , the schoolgirls she met clearly had some personal significance for her .
"" I felt a strong sense of connection with all of you , "" she said .
"" In your stories I saw so much of my own story .
I knew that the next time I came to the UK I wanted to visit with all of you again .
In a place like this .
"" That place was Oxford University , more specifically the dining hall at Christ Church , one of the grandest spaces in the grandest of universities , and now doomed , for a generation at least , to be associated with Harry Potter , scenes of which are filmed there . ""
Look around you , "" Obama told the 37 schoolgirls , some as young as 13 , who had spent the morning visiting the university before being ushered into the hall to meet her . ""
Just look at this !
A renowned university that has trained so many of the world 's brightest minds and greatest leaders .
All of us believe that you belong here .
That this is a place for you as well .
We passionately believe that you have the talent , the drive , the experience to succeed here in Oxford and in universities just like it across the country and across the world . ""
The idea for the visit had come from the White House and the school , Oxford said â€ “ that it was n't bad PR for a university that remains buffeted by controversy over the equity of its admissions , particularly on ethnicity , was a welcome bonus .
Oxford may have challenged David Cameron 's claim that the university accepted only one black student in 2009 â€ “ the director of undergraduate admissions , Mike Nicholson declined to disclose the real figure on Wednesday â€ “ but the prime minister 's description of his alma mater 's record as "" disgraceful "" was less easy to dispute .
The university says 150 of its undergraduates are black British of African - Caribbean origin ; the total undergraduate student body is about 10,000 students .
Earlier , some of those already studying at the university had confessed to being a little puzzled why an American president 's wife should be encouraging children from London to apply to Oxford .
"" I do n't think the whole Michelle Obama thing is really necessary , "" said Sam Wareham , studying economics and management at Christ Church and a little miffed at being barred from his own college by the secret service .
"" They get groups around the university all the time . ""
"" I think this is more about show for her and for the university , "" said his friend Alex Chajecki .
"" And it makes the government look like it 's opening access . ""
Admission to Oxford , they agreed , "" has to be on merit alone . ""
Chajecki said : "" Tutors are only looking for academic ability .
The whole idea that Oxford might be racist is a bit absurd . ""
Lucy Ford , a second - year student at University College studying Russian and Spanish , noted that many were happier at other universities , including her twin sister who had been relieved , in the end , to have been accepted at Warwick rather than Cambridge .
"" It 's much better to be accepted on a course where you are learning what you want to be learning .
The pressure at Oxbridge is not for everyone . ""
The first challenge for the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson girls , however , was to imagine Oxford as a possibility , said the first lady , urging them to "" paint [ the ] picture for yourself "" in which they belonged there too .
There were no short cuts either .
"" You just have to work hard , that 's it .
You have to push yourself .
That 's the only thing .
This does n't come easy . ""
In a particularly personal comment , Obama ( Princeton , class of 1985 ) urged "" every last one of you "" to "" reach back and help others get here too .
That 's one of the reasons I 'm here .
Reaching back , even as first lady of the United States , and making sure that other young girls have the opportunities I had "" .
Then it was time for questions .
Had she ever suffered from low self - esteem ?
Of course , she said .
"" I have doubts today .
You learn how to deal with them . ""
When would we see the first woman president ?
Any day now , she said , with a burst of praise for the "" formidable "" and "" phenomenal "" Hillary Clinton .
How was raising children in the White House different ? ""
A lot more cameras .
But how I feel about being a mother does n't change with the house you live in . ""
Yes , yes .
What about when she first met Barack Obama , 13-year - old Seren Esnanoglu asked .
Did she think that he would go on to achieve so much ?
There were giggles . ""
Honestly , when I met him I knew he was special .
I 'm sharing secrets here .
I knew he was a special person and it had nothing to do with his education , nothing to do with his potential .
It was how he felt about his mother , the love he felt for his mother , his relationship to women , his work ethic .
He did his work .
He was good and smart .
He was low key .
He was n't impressed by himself .
He loved his little sister .
He was a community organiser . ""
And if her attention flickered to the cameras behind them and the American electorate whose vote her "" cute , funny "" husband will seek again in 2012 , it was imperceptible and perhaps forgivable .
In any case , she said : "" The lesson is : reach for partners that make you better .
Do not bring people into your life who weigh you down . ""
What of her own daily life , asked one student .
On Tuesday night she had slept at Buckingham Palace , she said .
"" On Friday I 'll go home to go to soccer and go over homework . ""
The best bit , she said , was meeting people like them . ""
The dresses , the cars , the horses and carriages â€
“
I can watch that on TV .
But moving you guys , pushing you to do , see more for yourselves , is all that matters . ""
And with a nod from her press co - ordinator , the gathering was briskly wound up and the girls ushered out for a photocall .
First , though , each one had a hug and a personal word from the first lady .
They were , hardly surprisingly , bowled over . ""
It was amazing , "" said 15-year - old Gabriele Watts .
"" She can relate to us because she 's got children around the same age as us and she comes from a similar background to us . ""
"" Now this is where I want to come , "" said an almost breathless Josefa Chocieszynska , 15 . ""
She said to us you can aspire to be here , there 's no reason you ca n't . """
2011-05-25,"The following is an edited excerpt of remarks made by First Lady Michelle Obama during an event in Oxford with students from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School * of Islington , north London on 25 May 2011 .
The full text of her remarks , including the question and answer session that followed , is available at the White House site .
[ â€ ¦ ]
Most of all , I want to recognise these brilliant young women from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School .
My visit to your school two years ago [ â€ ¦ ]
, that was my first solo international event as First Lady .
Truly , that was the first time I went off all by myself as First Lady .
And from the minute that I walked into the door of your school , I knew I had come to a very special place .
It was clear to me that you all were so very special .
I was blown away by your talent .
You all put on a performance for me at the drop of a hat , and I understand you did n't even really know I was coming .
But you put on such a performance .
And I was also impressed with your achievements .
I was inspired by your passion and your energy .
And I felt this strong sense of connection with all of you because in your stories I saw so much of my own story .
So I knew that the next time I came to the United Kingdom , I wanted to visit with all of the students again .
And I knew that I wanted to visit with all of you in a place like this .
Look around .
I mean , just look at this , a renowned university that has trained so many of the world 's brightest minds and greatest leaders .
And I 'm not the only one who 's excited to see you all here today .
Students and faculty at this university were eager to visit with you all , as well .
And there 's a reason for that .
It 's because all of us â€ “
and it 's important for you to know that â€ “
all of us believe that you belong here ; that this is a place for you , as well .
We passionately believe that you have the talent within you , you have the drive , you have the experience to succeed here at Oxford and at universities just like it across the country and across the world , because you attend a school that has been labelled "" outstanding "" , a school that 's preparing you for whatever course of study that you might choose .
I know that you spend each day with girls from many different countries , who speak 59 different languages in your school .
So you 're already learning how to fit into a university like Oxford , which has students from more than 140 different countries .
And finally , by overcoming challenges in your lives â€ “ by adjusting to a new culture , and learning a new language , many of you enduring hardships in your own families
â€ “ through those experiences , you have gained strength , courage and maturity that is far beyond your years .
And those qualities will help you succeed in school and in life .
So in other words , all of us who brought you here today do n't just think that universities have a lot to offer you .
We believe that you all have a lot to offer these universities â€ “ your talent , your passion , your unique life experiences .
And we very much want you to believe that 's true , as well .
And I know that from my own experience , that can be hard sometimes .
And I remember back when I was your age , trying to decide which schools that I would apply to .
And I remember how well meaning but misguided people sometimes questioned whether someone with my background could succeed at an elite university .
And when I was accepted at one of those universities , I had all kinds of worries and fears and doubts before I entered .
I worried that I would n't be as well prepared as students who had come from more privileged families .
I worried that I would n't fit in somewhere so different from where I 'd grown up , or with people whose backgrounds were so different from mine .
But after a few months in college , away from home on my own , I realised that I was just as capable
and I had just as much to offer any of my classmates .
I realized that if I worked hard enough , I could do just as well as anyone else .
I realised that success is not about the background you 're from .
It 's about the confidence that you have and the effort you 're willing to invest .
[ â€ ¦ ]
And I want you to know that you have everything you need to succeed at a place like this .
You just have to work hard .
That 's it .
You have to push yourselves .
That 's the only thing .
This does not come easy for anyone .
Everyone here , regardless of their background , got here because they worked hard .
And you stay here because you work hard .
But more importantly , you have to believe in yourself .
You have to mentally believe that you can be here .
You have to paint that picture for yourself .
And most of all , when you eventually get to a place like Oxford , I want every last one of you to reach back and to help others get here , too .
That 's one of the reasons why I 'm here , reaching back , even as First Lady of the United States , making sure that other young girls get the same opportunities that I have .
Maybe that means mentoring or tutoring young people in your community .
Or maybe it means keeping in touch with students at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and helping them with their university applications , because many kids do n't have the experience to even apply .
And the one thing is that you do n't have to wait until you 've made it yourself .
You do n't have to wait until you 're big time .
You can start the minute that you get back to school , because for every one of you here , there 's someone else from your school who could be here , who wo n't have this opportunity .
So I want you to tell your classmates about the people that you met here today , about the classes you attended here .
And I want you to get them all inspired and excited about what you 've seen here today .
You all have so much to offer .
You have to believe that .
And I look forward to seeing all of you fulfill whatever dreams you have , and I know they 're big .
So I want to see you all in the future , visiting me somewhere around the world , doing great things .

2011-05-26,"Michelle Obama 's second speech to the girls of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school , this time from the halls of Oxford University , reiterated her thoughts on the key to success . ""
Success , "" she told the girls , "" is not about the background you 're from , it 's about the confidence you have and the effort you 're willing to invest . ""
Although deemed inspiring by the girls she spoke to , the US first lady 's definition of being successful has attracted criticism from certain commentators who say that defining success as a high - flying career is not necessarily the right message to send to inner - city children .
Should we celebrate other models of attainment ?
Is raising a family and maintaining a healthy home life too often overlooked ?
Should we applaud those who work hard all their lives in "" everyday "" jobs more often ?
Or is this just pussyfooting around the reality that an influential , celebrated career is the true mark of life achievement ?
What 's your definition of success ?"
2011-05-26,"The US president bade farewell to the UK yesterday with a brief wave before stepping on to Air Force One .
Following what is being widely seen as a successful state visit , Barack Obama stood on the runway at a blustery Stansted airport and gave his wife a peck on the cheek before leaving for the G8 summit in Deauville , France .
Michelle Obama is returning to the US .
Last night , the Obamas hosted a dinner in the Queen 's honour as a thank - you for Tuesday 's state banquet at Buckingham Palace .
More than 50 guests were invited to the dinner at Winfield House in Regent 's Park , the official residence of the US ambassador to Britain , Louis Susman â€ “ including the prime minister , David Cameron , and his wife , Samantha , footballer David Beckham , actors Colin Firth and Tom Hanks , and Harry Potter author JK Rowling .
During his two - day visit to the UK , Obama recast the ties between Britain and America as not just special but "" essential "" .
Obama and Cameron held talks at Downing Street , where they also hosted a barbecue for military personnel and their families .
Michelle Obama visited Christ Church at Oxford University , where she met pupils from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school in north London .
She first met the students in 2009 on a surprise visit to the school , where 54 % of students receive free school meals , more than 90 % are non - white and more than a fifth are from refugee families .
In a moving talk , she told the girls they could succeed .
"" We passionately believe that you have the talent , the drive , the experience to succeed here in Oxford and in universities just like it across the country and across the world , "" she said ."
2011-05-28,"Two years ago , I walked into the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school in Islington and found the staff and pupils wearing dazed expressions .
It was a London school in a state of shock .
The day before , in a surprise visit , Michelle Obama had walked through the same doors and made her first speech on foreign soil as first lady .
It was n't any old speech .
"" I want you to know that we have very much in common , "" she told the girls , at times coming close to tears .
"" There was nothing in my story that would land me here .
I was n't raised with wealth or resources of any social standing to speak of .
"" She was in a different country , a foreign culture , miles from home , among people more than three decades her junior .
Yet she saw herself in the girls , at a school that Ofsted has classed as "" outstanding "" despite being one of the 2 % most deprived in the country ; where 55 languages are spoken , 92 % of pupils are black or from ethnic minorities , and 20 % are the children of refugees or asylum seekers .
"" Her staff have always told me that the girls had a profound effect on her , "" said Jo Dibb , the headteacher .
"" I do believe that she was really moved .
And that she does feel an affinity with the girls . ""
Last week , the first lady was back .
Despite a hectic state - visit schedule , she travelled to Oxford to meet 37 pupils from the all - girls school .
In the hall of Christ Church , one of Oxford 's grandest colleges , she made another moving speech : "" From the minute I walked through the door , "" she told them , of the visit two years ago , "" I knew that I had come to a very special place .
I was blown away by your talent and felt this strong sense of connection .
In your stories , I saw so much of my story . ""
At 12 , Sufia Yahiya was one of the youngest of the group , and was chosen to walk with Michelle Obama when she left the building .
At the time , she was too shocked to speak : "" I just could n't !
I was just so overwhelmed , "" she said She shakes her head and shows me a picture of herself from a newspaper : small , headscarfed and bespectacled , walking hand in hand with the wife of the world 's most powerful man towering above her .
Sufia said that , during Michelle Obama 's speech , "" some people said that we looked bored â€ “ but that was because we were concentrating so hard .
We were just trying to absorb every word .
We just wanted to get every little thing we could out of it . ""
Listening to the girls two days later is almost more moving than watching the event .
Michelle Obama 's mission was to prove to them to that they were good enough ; that they should aim higher .
"" It 's important that you know this .
All of us believe that you belong here , "" she said , gesturing at the medieval stonework .
"" We passionately believe that you have the talent , the drive , the experience to succeed here .
"" They were just words .
But they worked .
Stacia - Ellis Cummings - Mbachy , 13 , was in no doubt : "" Every person that came to speak to me , I said the same thing .
Me and my friend , Sophia , we were like , ' No .
We 're coming here . '
There 's no doubt in my mind .
I do n't care what anyone says .
I 'm going to go to Oxford University . ""
But was she prepared for the hard work to get in ?
"" I 'm going to work really hard .
Believe me .
I am going to work so hard , "" she said .
As a lesson in how to empower and inspire girls and young women , the visit was a masterclass .
Yet , it also felt personal , and emotionally charged .
"" What she saidâ€ ¦
she was n't saying it just because she could , "" said Stacia - Ellis .
"" She was saying it because she meant it .
And when she hugged us â€ “ she gave us all , every one , a hug at the end
â€
“ you could feel it was n't one of them fake hugs .
It was a proper feeling hug .
It was like being hugged by your mum . ""
Obama said that people had queried her own decision to aim for the top : "" I remember how well - meaning but misguided people sometimes questioned whether someone from my background should go to an elite university , "" she said .
"" I worried that I would n't be as well prepared .
That I would n't fit in . ""
But she overcame her background , and achieved it through education â€ “ a lesson that all 37 girls have taken to heart .
Ashleigh Jones , 15 , explained : "" What she said literally relates to everyone in this school . ""
She did n't come from the best of backgrounds .
She got put down .
But she showed that your background does n't determine your future .
Hard work determines your future .
I think that 's what everyone needs to know .
Just because you live on a council estate and have one parent , that 's not going to determine your future . ""
Ashleigh is bright , articulate and determined , and does live on a council estate in a single - parent family .
"" My dad passed away , and now it 's just me and my mum , "" she said .
In an age of public spending cuts and austerity , she 's a beacon of shining hope , but the spectre of tuition fees is already an issue for them .
From next year , Oxford will be charging Â£9,000 a year , and that 's before living expenses .
To go there , Ashleigh would need to borrow an amount close to her mother 's annual income as a teaching assistant .
Sophie Edge , 13 , said : "" It 's something that you do think about .
It 's making some people less confident .
They 're thinking : if I ca n't afford it , how am I going to do it . ""
Sophia Thompson , also 13 , said : "" Everyone says you can claim sort of benefits , but I would n't want to do that .
That 's how people from our kind of background are always stereotyped .
"" It 's a stereotype that Dibb is well aware of .
The school is a brilliant example of what an inner city institution can achiever .
Former pupils have gained success at the highest levels , including Oxford .
Michelle Obama met one of them , Clarissa Pabi , a published poet studying at the university .
But Dibb is continually frustrated that "" people living a stone 's throw from "" her school , such as in the million - pound - plus houses of Barnsbury a few streets away , send their children elsewhere .
"" It 's such a diverse borough , and we want to represent the whole community , but we do n't . ""
She said that it was a source of puzzlement and frustration , as well as enormous pride , that Michelle Obama had "" bought into the ethos of this school "" , where difference is embraced and celebrated , and yet the middle classes of Islington so far , had not .
And for all the talk at Oxford on Wednesday , and the visible efforts the university makes to woo those , such as the EGA girls , the institution still manifestly fails to increase student diversity .
Despite years of access schemes , state school applicants still make up less than 55 % of its students .
And while Clarissa Pabi 's experience inspired many EGA girls , she remains an exception , not least because she is black .
You would be forgiven for not expecting the girls to be aware of a speech that David Cameron made last month , in which he said : "" I saw figures the other day that showed that one black person went to Oxford last year .
I think that 's disgraceful . ""
( The university fought back saying this was "" inaccurate and highly misleading "" .
It was one black Caribbean candidate out of a total of 27 black students accepted . )
But Sophia was aware of it , and had a clear view : "" He got his facts wrong , but just a little bit .
Obviously , [ the figures are ] very poor .
But at the end of the day , it 's your attitude to learning .
A lot of people will say ' Oh I ca n't go here . '
But it 's not going to worry me until someone comes up to me and says you 're not allowed because of the colour of your skin . ""
These girls , inspired by Michelle Obama , and their teachers ( "" The skin colour thing is like our school , "" says Sophie .
"" Like all our buildings are broken and falling down
but it 's what 's inside that matters "" )
believe that anything is possible .
They 've made the great imaginative leap forward : they can see a future where hard work is rewarded , and worth is measured according to merit .
It 's the rest of the education system that 's lagging behind .
In every way it is possible to measure , social mobility in Britain is in reverse .
And education â€ “ and the way that society values it
â€ “ is the cornerstone of this .
Jo Dibb said that she was one of the "" lucky generation "" .
She did n't have to pay for her university education "" unlike everyone who came before me , and everyone after me "" .
And , in spite of everything , she , like Michelle Obama , like her students , still believes in the dream .
"" Every day , every single member of staff chooses to work here because we think we can make a difference , "" she said .
Or as Ashleigh put it : "" If you 've got the brains and the confidence you can do whatever you want .
"" Obama proved it to them .
Now Oxford , Cambridge , and the rest of the Russell Group universities needs to do the same . ""
She made it , "" said Sophie . ""
And so can we .
That 's not just something we 've heard now .
We really actually felt it . """
2011-06-20,"Listening to Michelle Obama tell a group of inner - city London schoolgirls last month that they have as much of a right to aspire to Oxbridge as anyone , it all came flooding back : the many times when I felt â€ “ or was told â€ “ that the hallowed halls of Britain 's top universities were not "" for the likes of me "" .
There was the time a bloke trying to chat me up in a pub in Belfast almost choked on his pint when told I went from a comprehensive in a deprived part of the city to Cambridge . ""
People from St Louise 's do n't go to Cambridge , "" he spluttered .
"" They do now , "" I said .
Or when my teachers first suggested I apply , and I felt mortified at the prospect of going somewhere
I believed would be stuffed with privileged kids who would look down on me .
And then how I was so out of my depth at the interviews I was left feeling stupid and inadequate .
I may have been a bright , hardworking student , but unlike my equivalents at private or selective schools , I was n't "" groomed "" to get into Oxbridge , and it showed .
I recalled the time a student from a wealthy background asked me after my arrival at Cambridge why I was there if my father had n't been there .
And the time I was dining in "" formal hall "" and a revered academic told the assembled crowd how important tradition was and that colleges should do what they could to make sure "" our "" children attend in later years .
That was 20 years ago .
Just last week a report from the OECD showed that the UK today performs poorly in an international league table showing how many disadvantaged pupils succeed "" against the odds "" at school .
I was one of the lucky few .
As it turns out , regardless of coming from a low - income background ( my father , a bricklayer , lost his job in the early years of Thatcher and never worked again ) , and despite being the first from my school to get to Oxbridge and the only person from my family to attend university , I loved my time at Cambridge .
There may have been episodes of abject snobbery and the galling sight of over - privileged hoorays sauntering around with their whiff of entitlement â€ “ the very thing that almost put me off applying in the first place â€ “ but there was also a first - rate education , a stimulating environment and the opportunity to mix and make friends with people from right across the social spectrum .
I 'd earned my place and knew that I , and others like me , had every right to be there .
The problem is that having a right to go â€ “ these are public universities after all â€ “ is not the same as having an equal opportunity to go .
Or , it turns out , an equal opportunity to reach the upper echelons of a profession upon leaving .
Perhaps Michelle Obama 's speech resonated because it was 20 years ago this month that I graduated .
But it 's more likely due to the toxic debates around Oxbridge access and social mobility dominating the news in recent months , and the glaring absence of the voices of those of us who made it to the "" elite "" universities despite the heavy odds stacked against us .
So what is it like now to be one of those ( still ) very few students from a disadvantaged background who make it to Oxbridge ?
And , importantly , what , if any , difference does it make to social mobility when the numbers getting in are so small ?
According to the latest statistics from Oxford , just under 10 % of undergraduates come from families with an annual income of less than Â£16,290 , the level for free school meals .
Research shows that the professions â€ “ particularly the upper echelons â€ “ are dominated by Oxbridge , but especially by the privately educated .
What signal does that send from the outset ?
For the last few weeks , I 've been interviewing current Oxbridge students and graduates from low - income backgrounds .
First , I canvassed their views on access .
Second , I wanted their views on how an Oxbridge education affects social mobility .
Is it a one - way ticket to the top ?
On access , the universities both do extensive work in this area , but our interviewees were almost in total agreement : Oxbridge needs to do even more to reach out to children and schools in deprived areas .
Everyone I spoke to was worried about the end of Aimhigher , the national scheme aimed at raising university aspirations , which officially winds up next month .
New access agreements for all universities are due to be published on 11 July .
Rebecca Creamer , a student at St Edmund Hall , Oxford , describes her background as "" modest "" .
She went to school in Failsworth , Manchester .
She says the interview process intimidated her more than she expected and that when she met other candidates it "" opened my eyes "" to how privileged some other applicants were .
It took her "" ages to adjust "" and she felt that the culture shock was "" huge "" .
She also felt for a long time that she did n't fit in , and that there was an extremely visible cohort of public school people .
"" Everyone else seemed to have this public school confidence "" .
Creamer believes some of the outreach work that is done is misdirected and more should be targeted at schools where applications to top universities are not necessarily considered .
"" It needs to be better concentrated on people who would n't necessarily think of applying . ""
Creamer says it does n't help that the universities defend themselves on access with a false dichotomy between "" private "" versus "" state "" school ratios ( both universities point out that more than 50 % of intake is now from state schools ) rather than addressing the discrepancies between inner - city or underrepresented schools and selective state and public schools .
Aimee Cliff , currently at Keble College , Oxford , agrees , saying that while outreach "" is always important "" it is "" fundamental "" that those who most need it are reached .
Andy McGowan , a young carer of two disabled parents from the age of six , who got a place at Trinity Hall , Cambridge , in 2007 and who is now an access officer at Cambridge University Students ' Union , says the image of Oxbridge as elitist still puts young people off whatever outreach is being done .
"" I think a big thing is not thinking it is for ' people like me ' , which is what I hear time and time again .
It is n't helped by some politicians going for the easy target and attacking Oxbridge . ""
Fahim Alam , who studied law at Oxford from 2004 to 2007 , goes further .
He says the activity around promoting applications from poorer children including outreach and visits to colleges are mere "" peripheral interventions "" and "" too little too late "" .
Too much focus being put on what the universities do , Alam argues , means that systemic problems with the wider education and social system are left unaddressed .
Like others , he is adamant that the wider education system needs to improve dramatically if more youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are to get in to university , let alone Oxbridge , both in terms of generating competitive grades and in preparing children adequately . ""
Interventions [ such as outreach ] are n't enough to correct a system of education which privileges some over others , "" he says .
"" Furthermore , access is predicated on having social and cultural capital in order to navigate a way through a system that is completely alien to people from a non - traditional background .
"" It is this lack of cultural and social capital â€ “ the family contacts , exposure to professional networks and carefully honed social skills
â€ “ that many students and graduates believe ( and researchers conclude ) is the crucial missing link in the social mobility chain .
Alongside issues of access , many argue it is this that directly affects the longer - term prospects and social mobility of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds , including the few who have an elite education under their belts .
Rob Berkeley , who matriculated at Oxford in 1993 and is now head of The Runnymede Trust , encapsulated what many of those interviewed said .
"" I felt socially inadequate and that my life experience was far from normal , "" he says , speaking of the well - connected , hyper - confident public school contingent he encountered who were consummate networkers .
"" There is a great deal of conspicuous wealth on show .
One morning , the hunt left from outside college .
These are not normal experiences . ""
Berkeley enjoyed his time at Oxford , thanks to the quality of education and the variety of people he met , but his experience nevertheless caused him to question the wider system . ""
The problem is when these networks become the people running the country and it is clear that they have had very little contact with people who have experience of marginalisation . ""
Cliff says she worries that broader inequalities in society play such an influential role in overall outcomes for students .
"" I do think the system is unfair sometimes .
That [ where you end up ] is determined by where you were born . ""
Creamer adds that while graduates from less - well - off backgrounds probably are helped by having an Oxbridge degree , she is "" unconvinced "" that it is a genuine springboard to the top of the professions .
Alam , now a freelance researcher , says that the wider social problems around race , identity and poverty and how these play out in the education system and beyond deserve greater attention .
The lack of "" brown faces "" at Oxford was a shock for Alam , but he stresses that this was only one aspect of the difficulties some young people face before , during and , crucially , after university . ""
Every child needs to be nurtured from a young age .
Children who come from poorer or racial / ethnic minority backgrounds have so many traumas behind them and so many obstacles in front of them . ""
The evidence seems to suggest that the same things which deter youngsters from less well - off backgrounds ( and indeed many from families on modest incomes ) from applying to Oxbridge are the same hurdles blocking their path to the top after graduation .
David Johnston , chief executive of The Social Mobility Foundation , a charity that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to aim for Russell Group universities and the professions , says the impact of feeling that Oxbridge "" is not for the likes of us "" ca n't be emphasised enough .
Research among the youngsters the foundation helps found that just 14 % cited financial reasons as an obstacle to Oxbridge application , but 48 % said "" not being for them "" influenced decisions .
On top of this , Johnston argues , the lack of connections or exposure to people in the professions serves to reinforce the educational and social divide .
And , he says , it is frequently the lack of long established connections as well as networking and carefully honed "" social skills "" that hinder young people from poorer backgrounds in entering the professions . ""
Children who go to public schools have connections .
They tend to be groomed for Oxbridge .
The top professions â€ “ law , the media , banking and finance â€ “ are the hardest to get into without connections .
We are working with firms to try to change this .
"" Studies by The Sutton Trust , which among other things runs summer schools for disadvantaged youngsters , reinforces Johnston 's conclusions .
"" Many non - privileged children still exhibit an ' Oxbridge is not for the likes of us ' attitude "" , says Lee Elliot Major , its director of policy and research .
"" We should n't underestimate the often stereotyped perceptions of Oxbridge that persist . ""
The trust will publish a new study soon that shows family background is a major influence on attainment at age 15 . ""
This underlies the fact that attainment at school drives much of the admission trends at Oxbridge . ""
Elliot Major says that if young people from less - well - off backgrounds are to make their mark in professions later in life , the issue of attainment well before university has to be a priority .
"" Half of state school teachers said they would n't advise their brightest pupils to consider Oxbridge .
Advice and guidance in state schools , meanwhile , is in urgent need of reform . ""
Twenty years on from my graduation , it is upsetting that many of the barriers my generation faced are so prevalent for poorer youngsters today ; that they are still so underrepresented in our top universities , and that those from privileged backgrounds retain their stranglehold on the professions .
Just 7 % of children are privately educated , yet they account for more than half of top doctors , judges and barristers .
Would I advise young people from my background to apply to Oxbridge ?
Absolutely .
If left unchallenged , elitism will continue .
But with the best will in the world , placing the responsibility for change on individuals pushing for the top despite an education system that favours the privileged wo n't cut it .
While well - meaning and inspiring , Michelle Obama was wrong to say that hard work is enough .
Our society is rife with inequalities .
As long as these endure , too many young people will continue to see both the top universities and the top jobs as "" not for the likes of me "" .

2011-06-22,"Michelle Obama was following in the footsteps of thousands of tourists to South Africa by taking her family to the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg to learn about apartheid when she had an offer of the best history lesson of all â€ “ to meet the man who shaped the modern nation .
Though now largely retired from public life , Mandela sent word he wanted to see the US first lady and her two daughters , Malia and Sasha , while they were in town as part of a tour of southern Africa .
Mandela 's legacy as the hero of the fight against white minority rule is one of the themes of the Obamas ' visit .
Mandela , who turns 93 next month , met President Obama when he made a visit to Africa as a senator in 2006 , but it was the first time he had a chance to meet the First Lady .
The Obamas spent about 20 minutes with Mandela , who wore one of his trademark colourful shirts and looked well in his first public appearance since he was released from hospital in January after suffering from an acute respiratory infection .
The first lady began her first full day in South Africa by visiting Nompumelelo Ntuli - Zuma , one of three wives of President Jacob Zuma , at his official residence in Pretoria .
She later met Mandela 's wife at his foundation 's offices .
After meeting Mandela , the Obamas went to a daycare centre in Zandspruit , a Johannesburg shantytown .
A group of three- to six - year - olds welcomed their visitors with a song .
The first lady and her daughters then took turns reading one of the girls ' favourite stories , the Dr Seuss book The Cat in the Hat .
President Obama 's only trip to Africa since taking office was an overnight stop in Ghana in July 2009 , where he was mobbed by cheering crowds and made a major speech to the West African country 's parliament ."
2011-06-22,"Yesterday , Barack Obama wooed the crowds â€ “ and shocked his wife â€ “ as he demonstrated an uncanny ability to soothe a baby girl during a campaign event in the run - up to next year 's presidential election .
The moment Michelle Obama handed the baby over to her husband , the little girl calmed down , to the president 's obvious delight .

2011-07-13,"A health - conscious Michelle Obama scarfing down a "" burger , fries , a chocolate shake and a Diet Coke , "" at a greasy hamburger joint ?
The irony was as thick as mayo .
And for critics , it should have been faster to heat up than Easy Mac .
The item , however â€ “ reported by the Washington Post and later Good Morning America â€ “ was barely picked at .
The website Mediaite chided the "" mainstream media "" for pushing the story and offered a backhanded compliment to the relatively quite conservative blogosphere for its "" growth and maturity [ or ] recognition that even their own pundits find this line of attack idiotic "" .
As far "" scandals "" go , this incident does n't quite pass mustard .
But there 's nothing idiotic about it and Obama critics should have been right there with the "" mainstream media "" as it tallied up the First Dieter 's extra pounds .
Like a glistening holiday ham , childhood obesity â€ “ and the general expansion of America 's manifest density â€
“ has been a mouthwatering centrepiece for Michelle Obama , who launched her
Let 's Move !
campaign in 2010 .
On its face , the initiative is hard to argue against : the US is raising a generation of fatties who could use a little exercise , even if it means participating in such un - American activities as soccer and rugby .
It 's where the rhetoric of healthy eating begins to morph into actual policy that critics should be concerned .
That is , critics should already be concerned .
While the Michelle - promoted "" Healthy , Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 "" sounded like a great idea , the legislation has some gristle .
The act â€ “ apart from giving more school children access to healthy food options !
â€ “ gave the USDA "" authority to set nutritional standard for all foods regularly sold in schools during the day .
"" That was a bit of a bone in the throat for parents who think their children should be governed by the smallest bureaucracy possible .
After all , if you know the chef , it 's easier to fire the chef .
Perhaps this is why Americans ( probably fat Americans ) overwhelming disapproved of the act when it was being touted last September .
It 's one thing to encourage people to treat their bodies like a sacred temple .
It 's quite another to force people to do things for their own good , particularly when the results have no real effects , or worse .
In January , for instance , Wal - Mart announced its own healthy food campaign offering cheaper , more easily available options , for which Mrs Obama took credit , saying it was a "" sign that her signature ... campaign is gaining traction among businesses , families and governments . ""
Unfortunately , a new study has found that proximity to healthy food does n't mean better eating and that people have a "" complicated relationship "" with their diets .
Apart from private efforts , Mrs Obama said curbing obesity is "" going to require us working together â€ “ not just the administration but Congress , governors , mayors , parents , teachers . ""
Apparently , though "" working together "" has meant forcing compliance .
In an act of social engineering , and segregation , Los Angeles has banned the building of fast food restaurants in poor , urban areas , presumably because the authorities think its blacks and minority are too stupid to make their own food choices ( or , like students , they just do n't give a shit when it comes to required food labels ) .
San Francisco has banned Happy Meals and New York City may be on its way .
One could call the measures extreme , or just progressive solutions at the forefront of America 's War on Obesity .
At best it 's a healthy appetizer to future initiatives .
At worst : a strict vegan meal .
Michelle Obama is like a soccer mom who pressures others into "" doing right "" after "" discovering "" an amazing cure - all diet .
As a result , us kids on the team have to suffer the indignity of eating baked tofu until our parents find another fad .
Except we 're not kids .
And the fad , zealous government regulation of what we eat , is hard to bat down once it 's arrived .
Sure , the argument â€ “ that Big Brother may have to pry that deep - fried , bacon - wrapped Twinkie from your cold dead hands ( it was diabetes , RIP ) â€ “ is a bit hard to chew , but it does n't mean it wo n't ripen .
Just look at what happened to one of the best post - meal activities , smoking .
It 's like when your parents said carrots will help you see in the dark ; or when the First Lady called the country 's obesity "" epidemic "" not only a heath and economic problem , but a "" national security threat . ""
( Imagine the reaction if Laura Bush had said : "" Eat your broccoli or the terrorists have won . "" )
Push back against this nutritional overreach can take two forms .
One is already under way by state legislators trying to curb the the tide of meddlesome health - nut enthusiasts .
The second is a good , ole - fashioned , food fight .
Attacking Michelle Obama 's choice of a burger and a shake as "" hypocrisy "" is n't exactly the way to go , though .
This is especially true for rabid conservatives by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin , who 's partisan rhetoric are as about as appealing as an all - you - can - eat okra buffet .
It 's also like the lard calling the margarine "" fat . ""
Instead , the First Lady 's diet deserves to be highlighted just as the Washington Post has done .
It 's the same kind of personal nitpickery promoted by Mrs Obama , a taste of her own amuse - bouche , if you will .
If proponents of Let 's Move ! fire back that Michelle has every right to carry the weight of a quarter - pounder in those well - toned arms of hers because it 's a personal choice , then the reply is easy :
How do you like them apples ?
Unless the retort is anything short of "" well , apples are part of a recommended â€ “ but not required â€ “ daily diet , "" tell the health - crazed social engineer to "" eat it . """
2011-10-13,"Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will have a retinue of at least 15 for their eight - day tour of South Africa and Tanzania next month , including an official artist , Clarence House has disclosed .
The 16,000-mile round trip , which for the prince includes brief stops in Kuwait and Qatar , will be undertaken in a royal - chartered Airbus .
The royal couple will meet neither the South African president , Jacob Zuma , nor Nelson Mandela â€ “ who at 93 is described as too frail to meet visitors , although he made an exception for Michelle Obama recently .
The prince is paying for his wife to travel by scheduled flight to Johannesburg to meet him when he arrives on 2 November .
He will also pay the travel costs of the unnamed artist .
Clarence House refused to identify the young artist "" for his own protection from the media , because he is very nervous "" , although his identity will presumably become obvious as the visit gets under way .
Previous artists on earlier trips have included Neale Worley and James Hart Dyke .
Their works were described by a Clarence House spokesman as the prince 's legacy contribution to the Royal Collection , alongside the Rembrandts , Vermeers , Van Dycks and Winterhalters . ""
He has decided his contribution will be paintings by up - and - coming British artists .
The latest has already been chosen by the prince 's art adviser , "" the spokesman said .
The artist has yet to receive his pre - tour briefing on such matters as how to address the prince .
Hart Dyke , one of whose pictures was entitled Gorr Mildred

2011-11-21,"So , according to ABC News , First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden were booed at a Nascar rally on Sunday in Miami - Dade , Florida .
Well , of course .
Nascar is a good , old southern sport dreamed up by in Florida in the 1930s .
It 's a sport whose viewing audience is almost entirely made up of white Southerners and the soundtrack is country music and hard rock .
Nascar is all red - state â€ “ and urban , ivy league - educated , arugula - loving Michelle Obama is all blue - state .
So , to some observers , for the African American wife of the first black president to be booed evokes memories of Jim Crow racism and hatred of "" uppity negroes "" .
But it may be that another dynamic was at play .
The Nascar folk who booed were a discourteous reminder of a more pervasive national ambivalence about strong women and the role they play in politics .
A Nascar rally would be classic Sarah Palin territory : had she strutted on stage in her Levis , toting her hunting rifle , she would have been emphatically cheered as a strong , plain - speaking , all - American woman .
But even during the height of her popularity , while Palin 's general approval ratings were sky - high , opinion shifted when her fans were asked about her suitability to be president : the majority of Republicans said she was unqualified for the office .
There we have it again , that split attitude .
The public 's flip from approval to disapproval may be less about the political affiliation of a woman in high office than about the role she plays within it .
In the March 2011 issue of Presidential News Quarterly , researchers reported that the most popular political spouses in the past two decades have been those who had , for most of their lives , performed the most traditional role .
Barbara Bush and Laura Bush generated the highest ratings .
Laura Bush , a nice , gentle librarian , who , if she had any thoughts , was n't going to share them with us , heroically managed to hold on to her high rating even as her husband George W 's plummeted â€ “ thanks to two unpopular wars , his mishandling of Hurricane Katrina and a crashing economy .
The original first lady , Martha Washington , was known as Lady Washington , and was treated much like a queen .
And for a century and a half , until the 1930s , the first lady 's duties were similar to a queen 's .
She was expected to dress nicely ( in clothes by an American designer ) , lay an impressive table at state functions , and lend a little White House glamour to various functions .
But modern times have created a conundrum for the poor first lady and her husband : most presidential candidates desire and need a shrewd , well - educated spouse ; but the office of first lady has not evolved apace .
Granted the first lady is not elected by the public , but then again , many important roles in the president 's administration : secretary of state and secretary of the treasury , for example , are also "" appointments "" , and not an appointment the public gets a good look at before they vote for a presidential candidate .
Eleanor Roosevelt caused the first blip when her husband took office in 1933 .
She publicly admitted that she had thoughts independent of her husband 's and that she was n't simply there to be the soft , womanly embodiment of him at official functions .
Mrs Roosevelt wrote a newspaper column and hosted a radio show .
For this , she was vilified by her opponents , and it 's no surprise that Gallup first decided to poll the American public on their opinions of the first lady during Eleanor Roosevelt 's tenure .
She proved to have been largely an anomaly : after Eleanor , most subsequent first ladies stuck to their hostess duties .
Until Hillary Clinton .
Even as an avowed feminist and an independent career woman , Clinton had to change her name , her hairstyle and her whole presentation to please the public as the wife of a presidential candidate .
And she still endured huge hostility , especially when she tried to pilot through major healthcare reform during her husband 's first term .
Now , as secretary of state , she regularly tops lists of the country 's most - admired women .
But Michelle Obama is also a top choice for most - admired : she finished fourth after Clinton ,
Sarah Palin and Oprah Winfrey , according to Gallup 's 2010 poll .
I doubt that Michelle Obama was surprised or dismayed by the boos at the Nascar rally : it 's not surprising that the national doubtfulness about first ladies and the strong , accomplished women who are coming to hold the role would emerge in boos from some of the Obama administration 's fiercest opponents .
Michelle Obama holds a law degree from Harvard , a BA from Princeton and was her family 's chief wage - earner for many years , first as a lawyer and then as a hospital administrator .
After all , the boos were not unambiguously for Michelle Obama alone : Jill Biden , the wife of the vice president , accompanied Mrs Obama to the rally and shared the stage .
A college professor , Mrs Biden is probably the first wife of a vice president to work while in office , teaching at a local community college in the Washington , DC area .
They have learned from Hillary Clinton 's bruising first - term first lady experience , both choosing safely "" non - political "" issues to champion while their husbands are in office : Michelle Obama has made childhood obesity her cause , while Jill Biden promotes breast cancer awareness and community colleges .
There may be boos now for Michelle Obama , but if she 's a student of history , then she , like former First Lady and current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , is baking cookies â€ “ or pretending to â€ “ and biding her time ."
2012-01-07,"The first lady Michelle Obama spent her first two years in the White House jockeying with the chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , for her husband 's affections and feuding over the course of the Obama presidency , according to an explosive new book .
The Obamas , by the New York times writer Jodi Kantor , uses substantial access to White House insiders to paint a portrait of the administration that is more chaotic and troubled with in - fighting than has previously been understood .
The first two years of the administration , Kantor suggests , were marked by a tug of war between the first lady and Emanuel .
In an early peek of the new book , the Huffington Post reveals that Michelle Obama had "" doubts "" about Emanuel being given the top administrative job in the White House even before they moved in in January 2009 .
Once in situ , her apprehensions appeared to be justified , at least from her perspective .
Emanuel barred Obama , Kantor says , from sitting in on the early morning staff meetings that kick - started the day .
She was cut - off from the inner circle and isolated in her first lady 's premises .
According to the Huffington Post , Kantor writes that aides referred to the East Wing as "" Guam â€ “ pleasant but powerless . ""
"" Michelle and Rahm Emanuel had almost no bond ; their relationship was distant and awkward from the beginning , "" the HuffPost quotes from the book .
"" She had been skeptical of him when he was selected , and now he returned the favor . ""
Kantor 's analysis is that for Emanuel , first ladies were always problematic â€ “ stemming back to his fractious relationship with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s .
The Obamas author can claim credibility for her book from the 33 interviews she conducted with White House staffers ( though the Obamas themselves did not participate ) .
Though she portrays Michelle as a slightly lost individual clammering for a role , Kantor also records a number of successes she notched up against Emanuel in their vying for the president 's attention .
In 2010 Emanuel offered to resign as chief of staff , Kantor claims , after a series of newspaper articles were published suggesting he was the only person left in the White House holding the Obama presidency together .
The resignation offer , which Obama refused to accept , came at the culmination of heated disputes over healthcare reform in which the chief of staff came head - to - head with the first lady .
According to the book , Michelle was unhappy about the horse trading that Emanuel was leading to push the reform bill through Congress .
Kantor writes : "" The chief of staff was trying to convince the president to scale back his health care efforts , but the first lady wanted him to push forward .
Emanuel wanted to win by the standard measures of presidential success : legislative victories , poll numbers .
Michelle Obama had more persona criteria :
Was her husband fulfilling their mission ?
"" When the chips were down , the president sided with his wife . ""
Barack Obama had made a choice in the contest of the worldviews that surrounded him , between his chief of staff 's point of view and his wife 's .
His decision to pursue the healthcare overhaul later seemed to mark the beginning of the end of Emanuel 's tenure in the White House . ""
Kantor also suggests that Michelle won a similar battle with Emanuel over immigration reform .
Again in 2010 , she wanted her husband to stay true to his own political story and champion comprehensive immigration reform .
Emanuel , ever the pragmatist , thought a push on immigration would be pointless as there was no way in the run - up to the midterm elections that any legislation would pass Congress .
In the outcome , the first lady persuaded Obama to deliver a speech on the issue , which then came to nothing . ""
The first lady fumed , "" Kantor writes .
"" She took it as more proof that her husband 's advisers were poorly serving him .
The speech incident confirmed her worst fears , and by that point , several aides said , Michelle was bluntly telling her husband that he needed a new team . ""
Emanuel quit the White House in October 2010 to run for the post that he now holds as mayor of Chicago ."
2012-01-13,"When asked if she found it limiting to be described as a black woman writer , Nobel laureate Toni Morrison replied : â€œIâ€ ™ m already discredited .
Iâ€ ™ m already politicised , before I get out of the gate .
I can accept the labels because being a black woman writer is not a shallow place but a rich place to write from .
It doesnâ€
™ t limit my imagination ; it expands it.â€ �
Generally invisible to the broader culture and polity unless they are being vilified as â€œwelfare queensâ€ � , objectified as sexually incontinent or chastised for being domineering , it is only in the rejection of almost every societal expectation thrust upon them that black women stand any chance of doing anything more than survive .
Attempts to discredit and politicise Michelle Obama before she got out of the gate were legion .
There was the utterly fallacious allegation that she was caught on video shouting out â€œwhiteyâ€ � .
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd suggested she was â€œemasculatingâ€ � her husband .
Then came the cover story of National Review , a conservative magazine , branding her â€œMrs Grievanceâ€ � , which read : â€œShe was among the first generation to benefit from â€˜affirmative actionâ€ ™ , which was supposed to ameliorate the lingering grievances of racism but seems , in Mrs Obamaâ€ ™ s case , merely to have transformed them into post - modern pseudo - grievance.â€ �
Her patriotism was questioned when , with her husband leading a month into the primaries , she said : â€œfor the first time in my adult life
I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.â€
�
In the last few months , sheâ€ ™ s been booed at a Nascar rally , while a Republican congressman was overheard lampooning the size of her behind .
So , when she complained earlier this week that she was tired of being labelled as â€œsome kind of angry black womanâ€ � , she had a point .
As she explained , â€œThatâ€ ™ s been an image people have tried to paint of me since the day Barack announced.â€
�
This time , her ( justified ) ire was targeted at allegations in a new book , by the New York Timesâ€ ™ s Jodi Kantor , that claims she was an â€œunrecognised forceâ€ � within the White House , initially â€œbristledâ€ � at the restrictions of her new role and was often the source of tension within the presidentâ€ ™ s inner circle .
But while she had a point , Iâ€ ™ m not convinced it was the point .
The specific anecdotes in the book are impossible to verify one way or another .
The Obama machine is less porous and candid than the last George Bushâ€ ™ s when it comes to the media , so there is almost no way of covering them at that level , beyond hearsay .
Iâ€ ™ ve heard say , from reliable sources , that playing the role of first lady has left her deeply unhappy .
â€œGet me out of this prisonâ€ � was the secondhand quote I was told .
Thereâ€ ™ s no way to verify that , either .
But itâ€ ™ s logical for a few reasons , both personal and political .
The first lady is a 19th - century construct : subservient , deferential , decorative and uncontentious â€ “
the job description demands that you be your husbandâ€ ™ s adjunct .
Many have struggled with it , but few â€ “ with the exception of Eleanor Roosevelt â€
“ have been successful .
Take Hillary .
â€œMeet the new political wife , â€ � said Ted Koppel introducing her in 1992 .
â€œShe has a career , she has opinions.â€ �
When Bill Clinton started his political life , her name was Hillary Rodham .
After she was slighted for pursuing her own career , she was further lambasted when she said : â€œI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas â€œ By the time she left the White House , her name was Hillary Clinton and sheâ€ ™
d won a Family Circle bake - off with her recipe for chocolate chip .
Michelle Obama is an Ivy League graduate from a working - class background , who met her husband when he was assigned as her mentee in a top legal firm .
She was his superior in almost every way .
As he freely acknowledges in his book Audacity of Hope , his political career would not have been possible without Michelle subsidising his self - promotion by dedicating more of herself to raising their daughters .
There is precious little in the position of the first lady , as it is understood , that would satisfy a woman this accomplished .
It would also not be unusual , in modern relationships , for spouses to talk to each other about their jobs and make suggestions .
Particularly so when it comes to his job , since she wouldnâ€ ™ t have to ask , â€œHow did your day go , dear?â€
�
She could just turn on the TV or pick up a paper .
Having uprooted her family , abandoned her own priorities and stuck a target on her back , she gave up a great deal for his ambition and has a considerable investment in him making a success of it .
True , no one elected her .
But as the previous examples show , they certainly vetted her and they didnâ€ ™ t elect any of the appointees she was criticising either .
Moreover , while she indulged Barackâ€ ™ s political aspirations , she never fully embraced them .
â€œIâ€ ™ m very wary of politics , â€ �
she said shortly before he ran for his first political office , as quoted in David Remnickâ€ ™ s
The Bridge .
â€œI think heâ€ ™ s too much of a good guy for the kind of brutality , the skepticism .
When you are involved in politics , your life is an open book , and people can come in who donâ€ ™ t necessarily have good intent .
Iâ€ ™ m pretty private and like to surround myself with people that I trust and love .
In politics , youâ€ ™ ve got to open yourself to a lot of different people.â€ �
Of the various ways in which one might make a difference , Michelle saw electoral politics as one of the least effective .
After he was thrashed in his congressional challenge against Bobby Rush â€ “ a race she discouraged him from running â€
“
she said : â€œMy hope was that , OK , enough of this â€ ¦ now letâ€ ™ s explore these other avenues for having impact and making a little money , so that we could start saving for our future and building up the college fund for our girls.â€ � None of this makes her stereotypically angry .
But it is not a stretch to think that the trajectory of her husbandâ€ ™ s presidency might have left her frustrated and disappointed .
As one person Kantor quoted said : â€œShe feels as if our rudder isnâ€ ™ t set right.â€ �
That hardly makes her Lady Macbeth in blackface .
Indeed , it leaves her in the same place as most of those who voted for her husband .

2012-01-15,"One of the things we learn from your book , The Obamas :
A Mission , A Marriage , is not only how the first couple make their marriage work but that Michelle Obama owns a pair of $ 515 designer trainersâ€
¦ I know !
It 's kind of astonishing .
The lifeblood of any piece of reportage is in this kind of telling detail ; how difficult was it for you to get that kind of access to the White House ?
Well , I spent a lot of time in the White House in the public areas where reporters are allowed to go , but I spoke to people about the private quarters as well .
Some of the things I learned were small , novelistic details .
For example , the fact that there were still pet stains on the carpets from the Bush cats when the Obamas moved in .
I feel the White House is almost a character in this book .
What does it mean to live in this place ?
It 's a home , but it 's also an office and a military compound and â€
“ by the way â€ “
it 's also a terrorist target .
It interested me that it has no private exit or entrance for the family .
I was in the White House a few months ago , standing in the Diplomatic Room and Sasha [ the Obamas ' youngest daughter ] appeared with her grandmother .
She was coming in from school and the staff just nodded and smiled , but I was a bit embarrassed that she had to run past a reporter to get home .
It must have felt a little uncomfortable .
You are scrupulous in the book about not proffering a personal opinion of the Obamas .
But who would you rather be stuck in a lift with â€ “ Barack or Michelle ?
I find the Obamas incredibly compelling because I 've been covering them for five years .
It 's less about liking or not liking them than about following the drama of the story .
Is President Obama as charismatic as everyone says he is ?
In Washington , he 's considered quite an introvert .
A few days after he became president , he hosted a Superbowl party .
He greeted everyone politely but , in essence , he wanted to watch the game as normal .
He said to me later it was a point of pride for him that he was n't a politician who stood there and shook hands .
That has not gone across well in Washington because most presidents are schmoozers and he is not .
Many people believe that Michelle Obama has the charisma .
One of the most interesting chapters in your book deals with the discomfort faced by the Obamas when they realised most of the staff in the White House are of African - American descent .
Has their tenure improved race relations in the US ?
It 's way too early to tell .
When I wrote the book , I felt that that question was still beyond our grasp .
The question I focused on was : what is the day - to - day experience of being the first African - American president and first lady ?
For example , when the invitation came for Michelle Obama to appear on the cover of Vogue , her advisers were split by race .
The African - American advisers really wanted her to do the cover because not that many African - American role models had done so .
On the other hand , the white advisers were far more cautious because the country was in terrible economic straits and Vogue is a pure luxury magazine â€ “ the newsstand price alone is something like $ 5 .
In fact , she chose to do the cover and there was very little criticism .
To me , that is one tiny look into the real mosaic of what 's going on .
Have the Obamas read the book ?
I do n't know .
I have n't heard back .
You say in your acknowledgements that you became a political reporter for the New York Times at the same time as you became a mother
, did you ever find it hard to balance the two ?
At one point during the 2008 campaign I got called up and screamed at by an Obama aide .
It was 7 pm
and I 'd just got home .
My daughter was about two and she was sitting on my lap and she took control of the cell phone and began singing the Barney song down the phone
: "" I love you , you love me .
We 're as happy as can be .
"" It was just surreal and kind of amazing on her part .
In a way , it was the best thing to say to an over - agitated campaign aide .
Your book makes it clear the Obamas have distinct personalities
â€ “
you say he 's more cerebral , finds it difficult to connect with the public , whereas she 's warmer and more feisty .
Do you think it 's the differences rather than the similarities that make their marriage work ?
Absolutely .
I do n't think he would be president without Michelle Obama because she 's the one who connects him with other people .
Can a marriage ever truly be one of equals when one partner is the leader of the free world ?
The answer to that is in the book .
On the one hand , Michelle Obama comes to the White House and really has to play second fiddle in a job that is not well - defined .
But I watched her find ways to assert her power .
This is a story of a woman who , at the start , was put in a very retro role .
Her challenge is to find ways to be powerful .
In the White House , she goes from not having that much power to having so much internal leverage because she 's so much more popular than he is .
Did you see parallels in your own marriage with the Obamas ' partnership ?
I guess there were things about the Obamas I discovered that I do think are universal to marriage .
I found it very interesting in my reporting that their most difficult periods in the White House almost never seemed to coincide .
When one was down , the other one was holding it together .
In my experience , that 's true of marriage generally .
There 's some emotional delegation of power .
Do you think , as some are saying , that Obama will be a one - term president ?
I 've learned that the best political reporters never make predictions !
I guess the question I have is whether he has the capacity to rebootâ€ ¦ to reformulate the idea of why he wants to be president because the 2008 formula no longer works .
He needs to spell out a new , compelling and realistic vision for the country .
Have you met Bo , the White House dog ?
Yes .
Getting an "" interview "" with Bo is far easier than with the Obamas .
He becomes a kind of substitute because he runs around the White House all the time in the corridors .
He 's the perfect ambassador for them because you can rub your hands all over Bo
and he 's perfectly happy , whereas the Obamas like to protect themselves .
Read Justin Webb 's review"
2012-01-16,"I am not alone in thinking that "" angry "" women like Michelle Obama â€ “ and her predecessor , Eleanor Roosevelt â€ “ are needed in the White House ( Comment , 13 January ) .
Being the first lady of the nation and the first black woman to put her mark on the "" historically white "" White House is a hard but rewarding job .
She makes us proud , say African - Americans , the well - educated , trendsetting , multi - tasking mother who is not afraid to stand up for what she feels is right .
The US has not seen a first lady like her since Eleanor Roosevelt , from 1933 to 1945 .
She advocated anti - lynching laws , civil rights and jobs for black people when being a white liberal was a dangerous idea and practice .
Moreover , when the vast majority of women were unpaid homemakers , she campaigned for women 's liberty , education and right to work .
If being a politically conscious , inspiring fighter for justice and freedom makes you an "" angry "" woman like Michelle and Eleanor , then let 's have more of it .

2012-02-01,"Michelle Obama can teach you how to Dougie .
Which is not to say that she would â€ “ her schedule seems pretty full these days , including last night 's appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno â€ “ but she could .
The First Lady popped up unannounced at a middle school last spring to promote her childhood obesity initiative and wound up doing the Dougie , the hot - in-2010 , lean - and - rock dance craze popularised by Cali Swag District .
Footage of Obama getting her groove on populated YouTube and invaded the day 's news cycle , burnishing her well - earned reputation for being the nation 's first "" cool "" first lady .
It 's no wonder that Michelle 's favourability ratings , which are essentially still the same as when the Obamas moved into the White House , have consistently outpaced her husband 's .
While President Obama 's favourability numbers have faltered as Americans take polarised positions on his governance , Michelle has stayed steady .
Judging from her appearance on The Tonight Show , her first since her husband took office , the Obama campaign is well aware of Michelle 's halo effect and plans to deploy her early and often .
The ostensible goal ?
To sell the idea that you can love ( and vote for ) the Obamas â€ “ that awesome , gorgeous couple that plays basketball and does the Dougie â€ “ even if you do n't necessarily love Barack 's policies .
On the same night Florida voted to allot its delegates to Mitt Romney , the president 's better half paraded on to Jay Leno 's stage looking as resplendent and fashion - forward as ever .
In a shimmery gold blouse and checkered green skirt , Michelle chatted about life in the White House .
From the red velvet cake her mother baked for her birthday , to the challenges of raising normal children in such a singular environment , Michelle charmed her way through two segments of the show .
When Leno brought up the Republican debates , she sidestepped matter - of - factly : "" We do n't really watch that stuff , "" she said .
Then : "" We wake up every day and think about what this country needs , "" she said , before speaking at length about her work with military families .
That the first lady used the word "" we "" so frequently was interesting , and telling .
Rather than positioning herself as the supportive but hands - off spouse , Michelle spoke as an active participant , a sounding board and pillow - talk strategist .
The message was clear : this is a package deal â€ “ if you like me , you should like my husband too .
This came minutes after she provided one of the romantic asides that make Barack and Michelle worshippers swoon . ""
He sings to me all the time , "" she said of Barack , who had a Dougie moment of his own when he sang Al Green 's Let 's Stay Together at a fundraiser in Harlem .
It was a perfectly calibrated appearance , a just - right blend of politics and panache , and as usual , Michelle emerged looking both regal and approachable .
Predictably , there was no mention of The Obamas , New York Times correspondent Jodi Kantor 's recently released book , an account of the couple 's bumpy transition into the world 's most powerful position .
When segments of Kantor 's book painted Michelle as a strident interloper , she fought back in interview segments , asserting that she never had friction with Obama 's former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , as Kantor reported .
The White House response to the book was swift and dismissive , and indicative of how important the Obama campaign regards Michelle as a tool to get their man re - elected .
Her Tonight Show appearance will probably be the first of many designed to get the country to fall back in love with the Obamas , even amid fierce debate over whether or not the president deserves a second term .
If Michelle is as potent a political weapon as the Obama campaign seems to think she is , there will be plenty of time to Dougie on election night ."

2012-02-03,"Who would ever have thought it ?
Out and proud lesbian Ellen DeGeneres and Michelle Obama â€ “ who , despite her own achievements is still seen as the woman behind the president â€ “ have had a rather fetching press - up competition on national TV .
With a little flirting , and slightly more competitiveness we hear Ellen asking Michelle how many repetitions of the exercise she could do , before challenging the first lady with the line : "" I was just wondering if you could do more push - ups than I could do "" .
Jackets were flung off while Michelle made a snide joke about Ellen having a dodgy back , and the next thing we saw the two women on the floor doing a smart imitation of gym bunnies .
( If you are interested in who won , Michelle managed more press - ups than Ellen . )
It may have been slightly odd â€ “ but how wonderfully refreshing to see women flexing their muscles instead of simpering and trying to look as feminine as possible .
I used to challenge any man who put me down to an arm wrestle â€ “ and often I won .
But I stopped when I started to get asked if lesbians are born with bigger biceps .
Lesbians often go out of their way to appear feminine in order to avoid being labelled "" butch "" , but it 's easier for straight women to show a bit of machismo on occasion .
But who could fail to be impressed by women like Demi Moore 's character in GI Jane :
"" The more anybody fights with me , the more I wanna gut it out . ""
Feminists loved that film as did many watching Sigourney Weaver in Alien , running around in her singlet , making the men gawp in awe .
The Sarah Connor character in Terminator 2 morphs from a damsel in distress in the original film to a fighting machine .
Seen wielding massive weapons , she later breaks her psychiatrist 's arm because he is stopping her from saving the world .
"" You broke my arm ! ""
"" There 's 215 bones in the human body .
That 's one . ""
Then there is Martina Navratilova , a hero of mine for being brave enough to come out as a lesbian when it was almost a hanging offence , who does not "" throw like a girl "" .
For years her main rival was that paragon of femininity , Chris Evert who managed to make Martina look like a particularly macho Ken next to her Barbie .
What a joy it was watching Martina pulverise the ball , all grunty and sweaty , and not care about her headband or dangly earrings , unlike so many other female players .
Working women who demonstrate "" stereotypical male behaviour "" are likely to face discrimination because they do n't fit the female stereotype , according to research published early last year .
It showed that women in managerial positions who demonstrate self - confidence , assertiveness and dominance are â€ “ surprise , surprise â€ “ perceived negatively by some for not behaving in a traditionally feminine way .
Despite the fact that those particular traits , are viewed as necessary for men to get on in the workplace , women with these characteristics can be seen as good at their jobs , but "" less socially skilled , less likeable and less likely to be promoted . ""
Then there is the negative view of women who choose strength over curves , held by both men and women .
The Mail in 2009 ran a headline alongside a photograph of Madonna with bulging biceps proclaiming , "" If ever she tires of showbiz , a new career clearly awaits Madonna .
She could pose for medical students keen to learn about the muscular system . ""
Her muscles and protruding veins have even been compared to the preserved bodies exhibited by the German anatomist Gunther von Hagens .
The gossip website TMZ ran a feature on Madonna with a picture caption reading : "" After dinner with her 22-year - old toy boy , Madonna flashed her grotesquely sexy 50-year - old appendages .
Nothing says ageing gracefully like an overly worked - out pair of monstrously sculpted and bloodcurdling veiny corpse arms . ""
Can you imagine anyone saying this about Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
Straight men who transcend gender conventions are not as pilloried .
Think David Beckham with his sarong , headband , nail varnish and thong , or Russell Brand and Eddie Izzard who play with femininity .
So let 's have more fight and less femininity in the future please , at least until we gain equality .
We women hide our strength and competitiveness all the time , lest we upset men .
Instead , let 's beat them at their own game .

2012-03-14,"Catwalk season might be over , but Washington has gallantly rushed in to fill the vacuum .
This week , DC is playing host to a fascinating geopolitical fashion show featuring an all - star cast and headlined by Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron .
So far , the sartorial themes of Camerobama fashion week are polite nationalism and the delicate art of wardrobe mirroring .
Cameron has proved herself skilled at both .
On the South Lawn on Wednesday she wore a neatly tailored , tricoloured dress by the relatively established British designer Roksanda Ilincic , which chimed perfectly with Obama 's pale , neatly tailored suit by US designer Zac Posen .
This championing of homegrown talent while mirroring her host 's well documented style was also in evidence on day one during a mini - Olympic event .
In a triumph of colour - blocking , Cameron chose a bright pink top , again by Ilincic , and a belt by another of her favoured British designers , Emilia Wickstead .
She has worn the top on home turf already , testing it out at an event which closed London fashion week , so she knows it works in photo ops with stylish women .
With that , she wore ankle - length trousers by Joseph , a wardrobe staple among fashion cognoscenti , with shoes by the very British and very Middleton - endorsed LK Bennett .
It was flattering , appropriate ( despite inevitable "" oo - er , heels at a sports event "" comments in the media ) and , crucially , the look was not overpowered by Obama 's mustard cashmere cardigan
â€ “ although she was as ebullient and as natural as we have come to expect .
Her embellished knitwear was by the US designer and wife of Mick Jagger , L'Wren Scott , which she wore with wide Gatsby - esque trousers that suited her tennis moment perfectly .
There had already been further evidence of SamCam 's able wardrobe mirroring â€ “ this time with her husband â€ “ on their arrival at Andrews air force base .
Next to the besuited PM , the hot pink would doubtless have been captioned "" Samantha dazzles next to dull Dave "" but the cropped Burberry trench saved that analysis .
Evidence of Cameron 's deft fashion foreign policy came on day two when it was revealed that the Camerons had given a Jonathan Saunders scarf to Michelle Obama .
Saunders is the toast of London fashion week , known for his use of colour and print .
Cameron has worn the brand already , and between women with an interest in fashion the gift counts as first - class diplomacy .
But the real question from the visit is not the tiresome "" who looked best ? ""
but rather "" do they plan ?
"" Was the colour - blocking choreographed or a happy accident ?
It 's likely that the latter was true on day
one â€ “ or rather , Obama went true - to - form spontaneous while Cameron performed a smart wardrobe second - guess .
It 's less plausible that the synchronicity on the lawn was accidental , more likely that the cooler tailoring had been mentioned before the event .
But the state dinner on Wednesday night was another matter .
With such an event planned to the minute , it 's possible to imagine some discreet BlackBerrying between Cameron 's right - hand woman , Isabel Spearman , aka Bells , and whoever Obama 's 12 or so Bells are , to ensure the result was a complement , not a clash ."
2012-03-16,"The geopolitical fashion show
It 's not officially on the international fashion calendar just yet , but the Camerobama fashion show was in full swing in Washington DC .
It featured Samcam showing off the best of British fashion â€ “ including Roksanda Illincic , Victoria Beckham and cult label Alessandra Rich , whist Michelle Obama did the States proud in Marchesa , L - Wren Scott and Zac Posen .
The high point being the state dinner which featured a cameo from Anna Wintour .

But the trend is n't convincing everyone .
The inimitable Hadley Freeman is amongst the sceptics .
She says , "" this ' pyjamas ' malarkey is basically this season 's tribal trend , in the sense that it involves highly patterned clothes that magazine editors love because they liven up a page and most sentient humans would n't let within a 20 m radius of their person . ""
Meanwhile Simon Chilvers was more prepared to keep an open mind .
But even he could not bring himself to make his Topman PJs work for the office .
Well not yet at least .

2012-03-16,"American soldiers â€ “ one black , one white â€ “ stand to attention by a British flag as Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron enter the White House in complementary blue dresses in one of many fine photo opportunities a visit to Washington offered the prime ministerial couple this week .
Mrs Cameron wears a slender gown with a bold flowery pattern by London - based designer Alessandra Rich while the first lady , exposing a lot more back , is clad in US based , British - led label Marchesa .
And there , some might say , the content ends , for the Camerons ' trip to the US was judged by political commentators to be a spurious and indulgent distraction from the prime minister 's job , and nothing , we are led to believe , is more trivial than dressing for dinner .
We pay a lot of attention to clothes , as a society , but find it hard to acknowledge how meaningful and significant they are .
In the late 1960s traditional codes of dress were destroyed in the name of youthful informality , only to be resurrected in various shades of irony and nostalgia in every decade since .
But something that all men and women once knew was forgotten â€ “ the power of garments to communicate .
This power was once so universally acknowledged that sumptuary laws forbade different classes to dress the same .
Traditional dress conventions embodied the insight that fashion is a code , whose emblematic meanings can be curiously insistent .
This picture juxtaposes two kinds of uniform â€ “ military and social .
The sentries are in formal dress of the highest order , white gloves , white belts and straps setting off blue - grey uniforms .
The union flag , national identity fabricated in colours , hangs between them and Michelle Obama , whose dress is of a soft , dignified blue .
It is undoubtedly Samantha Cameron 's frock that sets off the picture â€ “ such a fizzy , complex juxtaposition of shades and shapes .
It will be remembered more than anything said or agreed at this week 's ostentatious visit .
I do n't mean this cynically .
It is genuinely memorable , something about the way colours register in the human brain .
But is it meaningless ?
I do n't think so .
To point out something obvious , blue is the colour of the Conservative party .
The Camerons excelled at what they do best in Washington this week : reinventing the Tory brand , freeing the image of their party from traditional associations .
They appeared to be genuinely close friends with the "" leftwing "" Obamas â€ “ one implication of this picture is that the first ladies agreed in advance to wear blue .
I say first ladies because the impression this picture gives is that American and British leaders mirror one another and that we too have a presidential couple .
Well , that 's centuries of feudalism felled by a camera flash .
Samantha Cameron is not just flying the flag for British fashion in this photograph , she is flying it for President Cameron and the myth of liberal conservatism .
Even as the NHS was being dismantled back home , the Camerons glided over reality in Washington with the ease of Tony Blair on a pre - Iraq good day .
It is completely wrong to think that Cameron took his eye off the ball to go to America .
Being prime minister of a coalition is not in anyone 's heart
â€

2012-04-03,"One Direction are too busy for the White House .
As the boyband attempt to break America , they have been forced to decline an invitation to join Barack Obama 's family at a forthcoming Easter egg hunt .
Last weekend , the chart - topping mop - tops met Michelle Obama at the Nickelodeon Kid 's Choice awards .
Impressed with the quintet â€ “ or swayed , perhaps , by the opinions of her young daughters
â€ “
the first lady invited One Direction to join them at the White House 's annual Easter Monday egg hunt .
Unfortunately , the BBC reports , Malia and Sasha Obama will have to hunt for chocolate without the distraction of British - Irish schoolboys : One Direction are heading off for a tour of Australia .
Asked about the Obamas , One Direction 's singers chose their words carefully . ""
[ Michelle ] is a very classy woman , very elegant , "" said Liam Payne .
He reportedly rated her "" an 11 out of 10 "" .
Harry Styles , meanwhile , said he had "" too much respect for Barack "" to remark on the first lady 's appearance .
One Direction have proven a surprise success in America , where their debut album was released on 13 March .
Selling 176,000 copies in its first week ,
Up All Night became the first British debut to instantly top the US charts .
That 's an even better result than the former X Factor contestants had closer to home : both in Ireland and the UK , Up All Night peaked at No 2 ."
2012-05-15,"Barack and Michelle Obama have assets worth up between $ 2.6 m and $ 8.3 m , according to financial disclosure forms for 2011 made public by the White House .
Under the disclosure rules , the Obamas do not have to specify how much they are worth , just the broad range .
Although Obama 's assets show he is far from being an average American , the family still falls well short of the wealth of his Republican opponent Mitt Romney , estimated at over $ 200 m .
Much of the president 's money has come from his memoir , Dreams
From My Father , and a children 's version of the book .
Royalties from the book , in the range of $ 100,000 to $ 1 m , are down from last year 's $ 1 m to $ 5 m .
One interesting detail , given JP Morgan Chase 's prominence in the news since Friday , is that Obama banks with them .
It holds between $ 500,000 and $ 1 m of his money .
As president , he earns about $ 400,000 a year .
The Obamas have a 30-year mortgage on their Chicago home , worth between $ 500,000 and $ 1 m , with an interest rate of 5.6 % .
Their assets include a saving plan for the college education of their daughters , Sasha and Malia .
Vice - president Joe Biden 's assets were also released , revealing his more modest finances , although the form reveals he negotiated a better mortgage interest rate than the president at 4.6 % .
The Obamas ' assets in 2010 were between $ 1.8 m and about $ 12 m .
The Obamas are required to disclose their assets under the 1978 ethics in government act , which also applies to senior officials ."
2012-05-29,"Too late for spring planting , but nicely timed for the campaign season comes Michelle Obama 's new book : American Grown :
The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America .
The book is embargoed until Tuesday , but the local bookstore happily sold me a copy last week â€ “ though the sting of the $ 30 cover price ( plus tax ) slightly took the edge off the thrill of getting the tome early .
What did I get for my money ?
A highly - glossed , over - packaged book about planting good old American values , positioning the first lady as nourisher and nurturer as she heads off round the country in support of her husband .
Flotus now is first gardener â€ “ albeit a meticulously well - groomed and polished one .
I spent a considerable amount of time going through the book peering at shiny pictures of Michelle Obama 's manicured fingernails trying to find some dirt under them .
Try as I might , I could n't spot a speck .
This book is gardening as photo - op ; as such , it 's a little stomach - churning .
Says the blurb : "" Mrs Obama tells the story of the White House kitchen garden , celebrates the bounty of our nation , and reminds us all of what we can grow together . ""
In that sense , it 's an old - fashioned project with a tried and tested formula .
It was in 1943 , after all , that Eleanor Roosevelt planted her second world war victory garden at the White House in a move seen as a civil morale booster .
Roosevelt 's garden inspired 20 m gardens to be planted around the country , eventually providing almost 40 % of the nation 's fresh vegetables .
But Obama 's garden was created to address not hunger , but obesity .
In February 2010 , she launched Let 's Move ! , a nationwide initiative to address the epidemic of childhood obesity .
Her aim â€ “ like Jamie Oliver and Alice Waters â€
“ was to bring healthier food into schools and communities .
She wants us , as she puts it , "" to build a healthier future for our next generation "" .
So this is a gardening book that looks "" forward "" , in keeping with the Obama 2012 campaign slogan .
It gives the first lady a solid platform from which to address the nation .
Yet , she places a shaky foot on that platform .
Her record as ambassador for veggies is spotty , and however much she dresses her first lady ambivalence in a brightly - coloured cardigan and cinches it tightly round her waist , it shows .
For example , it might be an idea next time she appears on The View as an advocate for healthy breakfast , not to say "" my protein is bacon "" , or to describe her family as "" bacon people "" .
Along the same lines , she might tell her husband to skip the bit in their love story that goes : "" I took her to Baskin Robbins for ice cream , and that sealed the deal . ""
It 's easy to be cynical about this whole gardening / publishing / first lady campaign enterprise .
What makes it harder to swallow , however , is Obama 's obvious iffiness about it all .
It 's so transparent that it was parodied in last week 's episode of Veep when Julia - Louis Dreyfus , as the female vice - president , is told about her next assignment .
It prompts the following exchange : "" No , no , no , no , no , no , no .
You do not do this to me .
Do not say that it is obesity .
Do NOT say that to me . ""
"" It is obesity .
I 'm sorry ma'am , but you have drawn the fat straw . ""
"" You want to know the secret to keeping weight off ?
Shut your fucking pie hole , how about that ?
It 's not rocket science .
"" If the book lacks soul , it 's because the first lady 's heart is n't in it : she does n't adore being first spouse and that 's sad .
She 's no cook , she has said .
She "" grows "" food for chefs to cook for her to eat at the White House table , but what she really enjoys is a night out with the girls .
You can sense her restlessness and see it in the book 's pages , where the most animated pictures of her show her dancing , hula - hooping and running .
Maybe , this first lady has a future that 's more "" forward "" than her role in this book .
I hope so .
It 's easy to forget her substantial background in community health affairs as you look at her posing rigidly in the backyard with her dog .
There 's little resemblance to the woman who spent years as the major breadwinner of her family , running the community programme at the University of Chicago hospitals .
It 's a shame .
With all that experience , we might have hoped for something a little grittier on the subject of health from a 21st - century first lady than this slick package .

2012-05-30,"So , Michelle Obama has found her first lady thing .
You know , the thing the little lady ( in this case Princeton and Harvard - educated lawyer ) gets to occupy herself with while her husband runs the country .
For her , it 's vegetables .
She is currently doing the publicity rounds in the US to promote her first book , about growing them in the White House garden as part of an effort to combat America 's addiction to fast food and its consequent obesity epidemic .
First ladies have learned wisely from the famous faux pas by Hillary Clinton ( Wellesley , Yale ) .
When she said , "" I suppose I could have stayed at home and baked cookies and had teas but what I decided to do was fulfil my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life "" , she got the metaphorical crap kicked out of her in the press .
And Bill was derided for picking such an undomesticated harridan as a life partner .
Hillary was then forced to spew out a load of cockamamie rubbish , including her special recipe for chocolate chip cookies and a book about child - rearing ,
It Takes a Village , to try to re - establish their credentials as a traditional â€ “ and therefore electable â€ “ couple .
Now leaders ' wives try not to step out of the domestic sphere .
Sam Cam is most often photographed in the kitchen â€ “ of the flat at No 10 , and before that in her Notting Hill home .
And , of course , when the Obamas came to visit the Camerons and they hosted a barbecue at Downing Street for men and women in the military , the boys took centre stage , doing manly things with meat and flame while the women wielded salad tongs in the wings .
Still , things could be worse .
Jackie Kennedy was relegated to pillbox hat - wearing and ignoring the amount of time JFK spent locked in the Oval Office with Marilyn Monroe .
Mesdames Chirac and Mitterrand 's main role was remaining dignified in front of their husbands ' publicly acknowledged mistresses .
Audrey Callaghan found an outlet in the writing of poetry , which is a fate no one should be forced to suffer .
And Norma Major penned books about Dame Joan Sutherland .
So , keep buffing those broad beans , Mrs Obama , instead of frightening the electorate with your marriage of equals !
You know it makes sense ."
2012-06-05,"The sight of kids scoffing sugary , salt - laden snacks as they watch TV , which in turn showers them with advertisements for the same junk - food products , may be consigned to the past .
In the presence of Michelle Obama , who has made the fight against childhood obesity the imprimatur of her role as first lady , the Walt Disney Company announced that all food and drinks advertised on its broadcast channels would have to meet federally approved nutrition standards .
With tight limits placed on calories , fats , sugar and sodium , many commercials for fizzy drinks , frosted cereals , sweets and sticky cakes would be eradicated from Disney networks .
Obama hailed Disney 's move as a game - changer .
"" It 's huge .
Just a few years ago if you had told me or any other mom or dad in America that our kids would n't see a single ad for junk food while they watched their favorite cartoons on a major TV network , we would n't have believed you , "" she said .
Though voluntary , Disney 's initiative has potential to shake up the way food is marketed to children in the US .
The company has such scale â€ “ reaching almost 100 m households through the Disney Channel , Disney XD , Disney Junior and Radio Disney â€ “ that when it sneezes , other media businesses are likely to catch a cold .
"" We 're taking the next important step forward by setting new food advertising standards for kids , "" said Disney 's chairman and CEO , Robert Iger .
The move comes as food- and drink - producing giants are under mounting pressure from public authorities seeking to stem the obesity epidemic , particularly among children .
Last week New York mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans to limit the size of sodas dispensed in the city .
Formally announcing the proposals on Tuesday at the Montefiore medical centre , Bloomberg answered critics who have suggested he is attacking New Yorkers ' freedom of action .
"" Nobody is suggesting that we take away your right to drink as much sugary drink as you like , all that we are doing is making sure that you are presented with it in a form that you can understand . "" One in three adult New Yorkers are now believed to be suffering with obesity - related diabetes or pre - diabetes .
The city estimates the health costs of the epidemic amount to $ 4bn every year .
Across the country , a third of children and adolescents are classified overweight or obese .
Meanwhile , they are exposed to $ 1.6bn a year worth of food and drink advertising .
Disney 's initiative , branded the Magic of Healthy Living , will not come into effect until 2015 as a result of long TV advertising contracts .
As part of the move , the company has introduced a new set of nutrition guidelines to which all adverts from that date will have to adhere , modelled on federal health standards .
The standards dictate that advertised complete meals must have a limit of 600 calories , 2.5 g of added sugar per 100 calories and a 740 mg of sodium .
There are similar requirements for breakfast cereals , nuggets , hot dogs and pre - cooked foods ."

Recent research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) has found that although we face tough challenges â€ “ a weak economy , low household incomes and an increase in equality gaps â€ “ people are generally in a much more comfortable position .
Paul Johnson , director of the IFS , said : "" Average incomes are twice as high now .

In a new report , the Institute for Public Policy Research argued that the criminal justice system needs to make better use of crime data to inform communities .
A blog by the Cabinet Office open data team reflects on how open data projects , such as Police.uk , empower local areas by promoting transparency and accountability .
Nick Herbert , the minister for policing and criminal justice , said : "" The public do n't just want to know what crime is being committed in their local area ; they want to know what is being done about it .
Did the person who smashed a shop window get arrested ?
Has the person stealing from the local newsagents been caught ?
This transparency meets the twin goals of accountability and informed choice
â€ “ helping to drive up performance and providing the sort of information that could influence how people vote in the upcoming elections for police and crime commissioners .
"" It also reflects the fact that the criminal justice system is a continuum â€ “ from crime to outcome â€ “ and that the data will be more meaningful to people when they can see this progression for themselves . ""

2012-06-26,"He took her for lunch by a fountain , then for a walk and a Spike Lee movie .
He was , she insists , "" showing me all facets of his character "" : hip , cultural , sensitive , patient .
The sort of guy , in short , who two decades later can get you to recount the intimate story of your date for just a few hundred million close friends on YouTube to boost his chances of being re - elected president .
Michelle and Barack Obama 's new campaign film is sugary enough to have Brits reaching for the insulin , but it would be a mistake to think ourselves immune to the new romcom politics .
After all , our own leaders are increasingly desperate to show us their "" facets "" too .
David Cameron has claimed to recall his wedding and honeymoon night "" pretty much minute by minute "" , in what was clearly meant to be a more romantic and less graphic statement than it sounds : the couple , we 're told , still regularly share "" date nights "" over a boxset .
Not to be outdone , Nick Clegg 's wife Miriam has just revealed that she knew he was the one when he joined her Sevillan dancing classes .
And , as ever , it 's the Blairs who originally set the pace , telling a tabloid in 2005 that the prime minister could do it "" at least "" five times a night .
As humiliating attempts to woo Sun readers go , it almost makes you long for the old - fashioned days of letting Rupert Murdoch take over TV stations .
This compulsive oversharing seems designed to make politicians sound more human .
But , in fact , it does the opposite , painting our leaders not as ordinary but extraordinary : capable of running the world , yet still finding time to play dewy - eyed newlyweds .
Normal couples can barely remember what happened on their first date , unless it went so disastrously that it has since become a dinner - party anecdote .
Normal couples with four children and two exhausting jobs have sex more like five times a year than five times a night : and even the happiest of normal couples rarely invite the nation to join them on a "" date "" ( the Obama video is plugging a fundraising dinner with them ) .
Which may be why normal women sneakily yearn for the return of the Michelle Obama who once affectionately described her husband as "" snore - y and stinky "" in the mornings .
It seems they 're in for a long wait ."

Michelle Obama is wearing some jacket or other , teamed with some or other trousers , as she arrives at the US Ambassador 's residence in Regent 's Park .
The Florida University marching band serenade her as she passes .
She seems to be moving pretty fast . ""
Is that ... ?
"" the press corps is confused .
"" Is she jogging ? ""
The First Lady is freaking jogging .
"" That must have come from her , "" someone remarks , aghast .
"" Nobody can have told her to jog . ""
She takes the stage .
She says hello .
"" I 'm so excited to be here today to share my love of sports , "" she remarks , winningly .
I 've been swept away by the Olympic spirit , but she seems to me to be the very embodiment of the healthy , five - a - day life .
The purpose of the event is to introduce kids to sports , lesser - spotted sports and alarming mascots .
Some are budding athletes , like the girls from Halifax Harriers , who know obscure things like the fastest time of Usain Bolt 's training partner .
Some are kids from American military families stationed here , "" so please be respectful of that , "" the press officer says ( I 'm not sure what this means .
Should we bow ? ) .
Some are regular kids , who want to be footballers but not really for the football .
"" I 'm definitely going to be a footballer , "" 9-year - old Yuvraj Singhlard , from Bow , tells me , craning his neck to see where one of the stewards is going with a man dressed up as a Power Ranger .
"" Where 's she taking him ?
Do you think she 's going to beat him up ? ""
All are here because someone made them , obviously
( they 're kids ) , but they are such a brilliant audience , so biddable , so enthusiastic , so alive to the possibility that they 're just about to see something exciting , it makes you wonder why people even bother performing to adults .
They yell on command , they leap about .
They will play with pretty well any combination of objects you give them ( a ball , a plunger , a rope , some raisins ) .
When David Beckham arrives , they all sprint towards him so joyfully .
But the excitement is untethered , and goes beyond any particular one of its sources , even the undeniable star power of Michelle O.
"" I ca n't wait to see her , "" said Maddie MchAffee , who 's 10 .
"" I do n't really know what she looks like . ""
From the US ambassador himself , Louis B Sussman , we learnt that being active is n't just about being healthier and fitter ; it also enhances respect and leadership .
Everyone should exercise more and get involved , "" and I intend to do the same myself , "" he added , in a voice like Walter Kronkite , looking like he fancies a martini , dialing up his irony setting for cultural effect .
From Katy B and Mark Ronson , we learnt the Coca - Cola Olympic Anthem , Anywhere in the World .
"" It could be anywhere "" it goes . ""
Anywhere in the world .
"" I like it .
It has a kind of national fatalism , a cheerful , "" do n't blame us , this could have happened to anyone . ""
David Beckham never says very much , does he , but he has n't lost his saint - like presence .
From the cheerleaders , we learnt that smiling really is their main skill .
Do n't believe what you see in Hollywood , when they throw those batons up in real life , every time it 's touch and go who , if anybody , is going to catch them .
From Michelle herself , a masterclass in the pep talk , somewhere between a huddle and a cuddle .
"" Nobody here was born an Olympian , "" she says .
"" All of them started out just like many of you .
Just playing .
When they fell or fell short , they did n't give up .
You got that ?
They did n't give up .
"" It 's a little bit unhelpful that she 's standing next to the basketball giant Dikembe Mutombo , who may not have been born an Olympian , but did n't , by effort alone , get to be 7 foot 2 .
However , I think we 've established that now is not the time to make puzzled remarks about all this enthusiasm .
Now is the time for punching the air , and nobody does it as consummately as this woman whose primacy on the global stage was an accident , and it baffles belief that she 's so good at it .
She was born to say "" Yay "" and mean it .
Let the yaying begin ."
2012-08-02,""" You go girl "" â€ “ it 's not a phrase I 've ever wanted to use before
and I 'm sort of hoping I can think of an alternative quite soon , but that exhortation has come to mind quite frequently over the past 24 hours .
A campaign launched by the Women 's Sport and Fitness Foundation , which seemed to channel the visiting Michelle Obama more than our own nation of embarrassed couch potatoes , keeps popping into my head .
It was n't just that Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the UK 's first gold with awe - inspiring teamwork and commitment on the river .
Nor that the footballers beat Brazil ( Brazil ! ) , much to the surprise and genuine admiration of my 10-year - old son â€ “ the same son who once told his former football captain mother that "" football is n't for girls "" .
Ha !
With more women ( 262 in a 541-strong team ) competing than ever before we were hoping for a few wins .
But as we say to the children whether we mean it or not , it 's not the winning but the taking part that matters .
In fact , it 's the attitude of some of these women that is really inspirational .
Some â€ “ well Lizzie Armitstead â€
“ may have spoken out about the sexist attitudes in an industry that constantly awards men vast riches in comparison to women .
But winning gold for attitude so far is that weeny weightlifter Zoe Smith .
After a documentary recording the female weightlifters ' efforts , she chose to take issue with the internet trolls who laughed at her "" unfeminine "" shape .
I could paraphrase it
but it 's worth reading in full here .
Internet trolling is a problem for men as well as women and it must be just as hard for Tom Daley to ignore the idiots saying mean things about him .
But Smith has decided to speak up for herself and for other girls who do n't want to conform to the body images constantly displayed on catwalks and in magazines .
Confronting those with "" Victorian attitudes "" about body shape she says : "" Most of the people that do think like this seem to be chauvinistic , pigheaded blokes who feel emasculated by the fact that we , three small , fairly feminine girls , are stronger than them .
Simple as that .
I confronted one guy that said we 're ' probably all lesbians and look like blokes ' , purely to explain the fact that his opinion is invalid cause he 's a moron .
And wrong .
He came up with the original comeback that I should get back in the kitchen .
I laughed .
"" This may be shocking to you , but we actually would rather be attractive to people who are n't closed - minded and ignorant .
Crazy , eh ? !
We , as any women with an ounce of self - confidence would , prefer our men to be confident enough in themselves to not feel emasculated by the fact that we are n't weak and feeble . ""
She also took issue with the young women who criticised her shape : "" You 'd think that young women around the same age as us would commend us for doing something different with our lives , and putting 100 % effort into it in order to make something of ourselves .
"" What can I add to this
but , you go girl ?
With nine out of 10 teenage girls not doing enough sport to maintain their health ( let alone , you know , get really fit ) this 18-year - old 's words should be cut out and plastered over school doorways .
She was just six years old when female weightlifters were allowed to compete in the Sydney Olympics for the first time and has struggled with both homesickness and selection woes .
Now , after a lot of hard work and effort she says : "" My self - esteem is currently at an all - time high . ""
We do n't hear that every day in our supposedly body - conscious age , do we ?"
2012-09-04,"First lady Michelle Obama will have the starring role on the opening day of the Democratic convention , tasked with winning back disaffected voters and defending some of the president 's more unpopular decisions such as healthcare reform .
Campaign aides told reporters before the first lady 's primetime keynote address in Charlotte , North Carolina on Tuesday night that she was in the best position to offer a personal insight into the president 's almost four years in office , a period that has seen the euphoria that greeted his election give away to disillusionment .
Stephanie Cutter , Obama 's deputy campaign manager , said that unlike Ann Romney at the Republican convention last week , Michelle Obama did not need to introduce herself or her husband to the American people .
"" Everybody knows the first lady , everybody knows the president .
But what the first lady can do better than anybody else is give a lens into the values that drive the president . ""
Michelle Obama , who is consistently more popular than her husband in opinion polls , is aiming to cement the support of women , Latinos and the gay community â€
“ the president has a significant lead among all three â€ “ and re - energise liberals
disappointed that the president has not done enough .
In her speech , she will spell out some of Obama 's personal motivations behind key decisions .
The prevailing mood among delegates in Charlotte is anxiety over Obama 's re - election prospects as economic recover remains sluggish â€ “ a stark contrast to the optimism and confidence of the 2008 convention .
The economy will dominate the event , which kicked off amid a row over whether voters were better off now than four years ago .
A poll for the Hill magazine on Monday found that 52 % of voters surveyed felt worse off now than when Obama took office , and that 54 % that he did not deserve re - election based solely on his job performance .
Obama will attempt to overturn those concerns on Thursday night at a rally in a 73,000-seater football stadium where he will deliver his speech accepting the Democratic nomination .
It will focus almost entirely on the economy , and will lay out a "" road map for what the next four years should look like "" , White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told a Politico panel session on Tuesday morning .
Michelle , who initially advised her husband against going into politics and who was reluctantly co - opted into campaigning in 2008 , has been much more active in this campaign , particularly with fundraising .
She has given 24 speeches since March in 10 states .
Speaking at an ABC News and Yahoo News event in Charlotte , Cutter indicated that the first lady would be talking about some of the personal experiences in the president 's life that has led him to make some of the difficult and "" unpopular "" choices he has made in his first term .
She gave the example of his health reform , dubbed "" Obamacare "" by his opponents .
The health reform was motivated in part , Cutter suggested , by the fact that Barack Obama 's mother , Ann Dunham , struggled to find health insurance as she was dying from cancer . ""
Very politically unpopular , a tough thing to get done , we 've been trying for 70 years to get it done .
But his mother had a healthcare story in her final days , and it was that memory that drove him to get healthcare done . ""
Cutter also pointed to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , the first bill signed into law by the president that increased the power of women suffering from discrimination to seek legal redress .
She said that the president 's grandmother had been passed over for promotion at the local bank where she worked by male workers doing the same job she did . ""
These choices come from a place of personal experience , and Michelle can speak very personally about that motivation and values and all of the things that drive him to do the things he does .
She is a first - person testament to what the president has done over the last four years to show some pretty strong leadership in trying times , "" Cutter said .
Ledbetter is among those invited to speak to the convention .
Obama and vice - president Joe Biden are to be formally nominated as the party 's White House candidates on Wednesday .
In his speech on Thursday , Obama will set out his plans for a second term , including completion of healthcare and education reforms .
A theme that appears to be developing from the Obama campaign is that should voters give him the chance of a second term , he would use it to create "" an economy built to last "" .
Ben LaBolt , Obama 's campaign press secretary , said the focus of the convention would be "" on the pillars of an economy built to last : energy , manufacturing , education , restoring economic security for the middle class with investments in these areas instead of cutting back . ""
The party would hear , he said , "" where we are going to go from here .
That 's what we did n't hear [ from the Republicans ] in Tampa last week .
But other campaign staff hinted that there would be little new in the way of policy detail in Obama 's speech .
Aides suggested that the president would also show an element of humility over his record .
Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett , an old ally of the Obamas from Chicago and now one of the most powerful people in the administration , admitted the president had made a mistake in his first year in office by failing to get out around the country to sell his reforms .
Speaking at a convention event organised by Bloomberg , she said the president "" did not appreciate how important it was to tell that story "" .
Wednesday 's keynote speech by Bill Clinton , who was critical of Obama during the 2008 , is the only convention speech not yet vetted by the Obama campaign team .
Jen Psaki , a campaign spokeswoman travelling with the president , claimed to be relaxed about the lack of an advance copy : "" We have absolute confidence about what he 's going to say . """

2012-09-05,"â€¢ Michelle Obama 's accomplished convention speech not only energised delegates , but brought a halt , for now , to journalists ' complaints about the 2012 campaign being lacklustre .
Even CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , although medically incapable of expressing enthusiasm , called it a "" grand slam "" .
And the speech was an interesting litmus test for right - leaning commentators : could they bring themselves to acknowledge the First Lady 's performance ?
Yes , actually : Fox News was full of praise ( "" extremely impressive woman "" ) ; former Reagan speechwriter John Podhoretz deemed it a "" total knockout "" ; the National Review called it "" excellent "" and "" passionate "" .
Only the implacably conservative radio host Laura Ingraham disagreed .
"" The DNC is VERY low energy , not the vibrant , youth allure of 2008 , "" she tweeted .
"" I feel the whiff of death and decay . ""
Still , here 's to Ingraham for having the courage of her convictions , defying the temptation to bend her opinions in the service of populism !
There 's presumably some IT - related explanation for the fact that the message mysteriously vanished from Twitter later that night .
â€¢ Republicans , staging their own counter - convention in Charlotte , are rallying behind the slogan "" Obama Is n't Working "" , a blatant borrowing from Margaret Thatcher 's 1979 campaign .
On Tuesday night , meanwhile , Maryland 's Democratic governor , Martin O'Malley , tried to lead the convention audience in a pro - Obama chant of "" Forward , Not Back "" , evoking Tony Blair 's grammar - violating horror of 2005 .
What next ?
Will the president 's remarks include the phrase ""
I 've not got a reverse gear "" ?
( Are you 're thinking what we 're thinking â€ “ namely , that that would be awful ? )
Oh well : at least we can rely on Joe Biden , who 'll be introducing Obama tonight , not to steal lines wholesale from British election campaigns , ca n't we ?
Ca n't we ?
â€¢
The convention 's official "" speakers ' platform "" , designated to allow protesters a voice , seems to be succeeding in what cynics might suggest was its real job : making sure nobody hears them .
It 's a small , raised platform on a muddy field , far from the main action , populated by recycling bins .
Audiences must "" sit on gravel and weeds "" , reports the Charlotte Observer 's Lawrence Toppman â€ “ if there were an audience .
Tuesday 's crowd "" consisted entirely of me "" , notes Toppman , who arrived too late to hear the day 's first speaker give a talk entitled "" Sodomy , Abortion , Fornication "" . ""
He left a DVD behind , "" the reporter adds , "" but I forgot to take it . ""
That 's probably for the best .
â€¢ Daringly , or foolishly , the Obama campaign 's merchandise includes badges featuring a portrait of the president , the slogan "" Made in the USA "" , and a snapshot of the president 's birth certificate , poking fun at "" birther "" conspiracists .
But much to the amusement of Rush Limbaugh , it turns out that , to buy the trinkets , you have to be a US citizen ( or permanent resident ) yourself !
"" I kid you not , folks ! ""
Limbaugh chuckled on air , triggering widespread amusement at the Democrats ' latest gaffe . ""
Sometimes irony can be pretty ironic , "" added the birther website WorldNetDaily .
Now , admittedly , it 's true that all sales of campaign merchandise count as political contributions , which foreigners ca n't make â€ “ hence the small print about being a citizen .
Even so , it 's rather ironic that â€ ¦ Hang on .
What 's the irony again ?
Is it that birthers do n't understand what "" irony "" means ?"
2012-09-06,""" We were so young , so in love , and so in debt , "" Michelle Obama told delegates in Charlotte on Tuesday night , reminiscing about at time when she and the future president had combined student loan bills that were larger than their mortgage . ""
That 's why Barack has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down â€ “ because he wants every young person to fulfil their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt . ""
Bill Clinton made student debt a component of his epic speech to the convention on Wednesday night too .
Obama 's student loan plan , he said , meant "" no - one will ever have to drop out of college again for fear they ca n't repay their debt . ""
Both speakers received huge applause for their comments .
But how did it play with real students on the convention perimeter ?
Neither the first lady nor the former president mentioned that here in North Carolina , many students have faced extra costs this year as a result of Obama 's Affordable Care Act .
The University of North Carolina warned in April that students at the university , and at other schools across the state , would have to pay more for university healthcare . ""
Based on more than three semesters of actual claims experience , as well as the new provisions of the Affordable Care Act , we are facing large increases in premiums for our students , "" the university 's president , Tom Ross , wrote .
Students in North Carolina are required to have health insurance to attend .
If they are not on their parents ' plan , and do not have a personal plan , they must join a university policy .
"" I do have to get health insurance , and it did go up , "" said Xeminia Edwards , from Statesville , North Carolina .
Edwards is an anthropology major at UNC Charlotte , who was taking a break between classes on Wednesday afternoon .
She had been struck by the hike .
"" I think it was around $ 300 - 400 last year , and this year it 's $ 700 .
It kind of sucks because I pay $ 700 for health insurance
but I have a $ 350 deductible .
"" Obama narrowly won North Carolina , traditionally a Republican stronghold , in 2008 , but faces an uphill battle to retain the state in November , with the latest polls putting him about four points behind Mitt Romney .
"" I do n't feel like he has performed well for students .
Interest rates keep going up on our loans and it does n't look like they 're ever going to go down , "" said Nick , a 22-year - old studying computer science .
He voted for Obama in 2008 , but said he would commit to Mitt Romney this time around .
"" I do n't personally believe in [ Romney 's ] social reforms , but on the fiscal side at least he has an idea of what we should do .
Obama 's had his chance and he 's kind of been slipping . ""
In a May paper , A Chance for Every Child , Romney argued that "" flooding colleges with federal dollars only serves to drive tuition higher "" and said he would simplify the financial aid system and regulations to encourage competition and reduce costs .
Romney has said he will not boost Pell grants or help students pay off loans .
Since elected Obama has increased the maximum for Pell grants available to college students , and his 2009 economic stimulus introduced tax credits enabling some young people to save $ 2,500 a year .
If re - elected , Obama has promised to make those tax credits permanent , while he has proposed linking federal aid to schools with their ability to keep tuition fees low .
While some students in North Carolina will pay more for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act , nationwide many will pay a lot less .
Stephen , who at 25 is studying mechanical engineering in Charlotte , found himself eligible for healthcare on his parents ' policy under Obama 's health provisions â€ “ which increased the age students could stay on their parents ' plans to 26 . ""
For a while I had to have my own plan and it was quite a bit more expensive for me , rather than being on a family plan for another couple of years .
Saved some money , "" he said .
Young people were a crucial part of Obama 's victory in 2008 , the president claiming 66 % of the under-30 vote .
http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1031/young-voters-in-the-2008-election
But with the average student debt at $ 23,300 in 2011 , more than $ 1tn currently outstanding in student loans , and an unemployment rate among young workers of 17.1 % .
Gallup 's long - range average polling still shows Obama with a significant lead , 60 % of under-30s compared to Romney 's 33 % , but enthusiasm looks to have waned , with only 60 % of registered voters under 30 saying they will definitely vote .
Michelle Obama 's speech touched on more than student debt , however , hinting at the negative impact on women 's rights under Romney and stressing Obama 's ability to empathise as a man with a history of "" turning down high paying jobs and instead working in struggling neighborhoods "" .
There were signs from the students the Guardian spoke to on Wednesday that enthusiasm for the president was still high .
Despite Edwards being hit by the healthcare rise , she said Romney and the Republicans ' stance on social issues was more important .
"" If I had to vote today I would still vote for Obama .
A lot of it is because of the whole women 's rights thing that 's come out with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan .
I 'm a woman gender studies minor , so that 's really big for me . ""
Kamoru Jimoh , who moved from Louisiana to North Carolina aged six , and now at 25 is studying philosophy and economics , said he was looking for someone "" who can see things from my perspective "" .
"" I know that Obama went to school
and I know that he got in debt .
He had to pay his tuition back .
So if nothing else , he knows what it 's like to be in my shoes and he knows that it I uncomfortable to be in my shoes right now . ""
Mitt Romney ?
Even if he did go to college , even if he did go to school , he 's had plenty of money to not have to worry about ever being in debt .
So how are you going to start telling me how you 're going to help me handle my problems , when you 've never really been involved in that problem ? """
2012-09-06,"A US television tradition known for risque outfits and alcohol - induced fights airs on Thursday , but in addition to the final night of the Democratic national convention , it 's also the MTV video music awards .
The 29th annual awards show will run from 8 pm to 10 pm ET , teeing up Barack Obama 's big night in Charlotte , which starts at 10 .
Here are five ways the two events are similar : Twitter power A band of nerdy old people was responsible for nearly crashing Twitter during Michelle Obama 's Tuesday night speech , and by midday on Wednesday , the DNC had been mentioned on Twitter as many as times as the RNC had in the entirety of its convention .
Here 's what a 2010 VMA nominee had to say about the first lady 's speech on Twitter : VMA nominees are not exactly short on Twitter power either .
You ca n't go more than a day without stumbling upon one of the following hashtags : # directioners , # zaynmalik , # harrystyles , # 1d , # logies , # swaggy , # AllDirectionersTogether , # belieber , # jeliebers , # mrsbieber
This is the type of things their powerful hordes tweet
: Style The top Google News story Wednesday morning after Michelle Obama 's speech was not about the substance of her remarks , but her pink Tracy Reese dress .
As the New York Times points out , people think her outfit choice beat Ann Romney 's â€ “ which apparently matters .
The VMA 's , like any good entertainment spectacle , will also be pitting the outfits of the stars against each other on the red carpet .
Their outfit choices will certainly be more shocking than the outfits at the DNC , but will likely be construed to have just as heavy political statements .
Lady Gaga 's famed meat dress of 2010 provoked a very strong reaction from Peta , and in 2011 she appeared as her male alter ego Jo Calderone .
Sex The Democratic party is much more friendly to your promiscuous ways than the Republican party , with a platform that supports a women 's right to choose .
And the most successful music videos are usually entirely , completely about sex .
This is clear in "" Romney supporting "" Nicki Minaj 's VMA nominated video : God Mentions of God were reinserted into the Democratic platform Wednesday just as the highly controversial decision to call Jerusalem Israel 's capital took shape .
As is award show custom , you can expect many of the artists to thank God for letting them to talented enough to receive a shiny spaceman statue in front of millions of people .
Kanye West
Not even the president can ignore the cultural power of MTV 's video music awards .
At the 2009 show Kanye West stole 19-year - old Taylor Swift 's mic , saying Beyonce deserved the best female video award more .
Thursday night 's keynote speaker offered this insightful opinion on one of the award 's shows most memorable events in return : "" What 's he doing up there ?
He 's a jackass . """

2012-10-13,"Curtis Sittenfeld , 37 , is an American writer .
Her third novel , American Wife , is about a fictional first lady
The feminist hand - wringing over Michelle Obama â€ “ and I am a long - time feminist hand - wringer â€ “ started before Barack Obama took office .
The criticism went like this : despite the fact that Mrs Obama was a highly educated and successful professional who for much of her marriage had out - earned her husband , she chose to obscure these bona fides and instead define herself in the most traditional terms : "" mom - in - chief "" .
To which many liberal white women who essentially admire Mrs Obama said , "" Oh , come on ! ""
Yet though I am myself a liberal white woman , I have a different reaction : give the first lady a break .
I interviewed the charming and funny Mrs Obama in 2008 for Time magazine
â€ “
I was standing close by when she delivered her convention speech
â€ “
and I did n't think the mom - in - chief label was a self - abnegating pretence .
Rather , it was a canny decision by a wise woman with her eye on the big picture .
The reality is , like all other working mothers , Michelle Obama does have a job â€ “ Pat Nixon famously referred to being first lady as "" the hardest unpaid job in the world "" â€ “ and Mrs Obama 's responsibilities include frequent speeches , travel , and event - hosting .
But more than that , every day , every time she 's in public or in the news , she 's acting as a role model .
Yes , she 's a role model to those of us who adore her
but she 's also , by default , a kind of ambassador to racist Americans and perhaps to racist people everywhere .
There are two completely different views of Michelle Obama : she 's smart and charming , glamorous yet down - to - earth .
My friends and I want arms as toned as hers , a wardrobe as stylish , and children as delightful .
If only we knew her , we believe , we 'd surely be friends .
And she happens to be black .
In the second view , she 's the embodiment of every negative stereotype , no matter how incendiary or ludicrous : she 's a black - power militant ; she 's a sassy ball - buster ; she 's a slave ; she 's monkey - like .
At my most pessimistic , I wonder whether anyone who holds the latter view can be persuaded of the former .
If it 's possible , however , then no one is more qualified for the challenge than Michelle Obama .
And therefore much of her task as first lady is avoiding any comment , behaviour or cause that would reinforce these negative views no matter how unfair and irrational they are .
( Similarly while Barack Obama is derided for his emotional coolness , he ca n't really display anger in public because then he 'd be an Angry Black Man . )
Hillary Clinton , who was charting no new racial ground as first lady , still generated endless controversy for her policy involvement .
If Mrs Obama tackled policy issues anywhere near as publicly , I suspect she 'd squander the capital she can currently deploy for a problem even more basic than , say , affordable healthcare : racial inequality and prejudice .
In the same way that endearing gay television characters can persuade homophobes that being gay is n't so appalling after all , I 'd argue that just by leading her life
â€ “ tending to her vegetable garden , walking her dog , wearing cool outfits
â€ “
Michelle Obama shows that being a bright , stable , family - oriented black woman is a very normal thing .
If it 's ridiculous that in 2012 it 's still necessary to "" prove "" such a fact , it 's also a racial reality .
So I do n't see Michelle Obama as passive ; I do n't begrudge the way she touts her marital and maternal credentials ; I do n't think the fact that she focuses on "" issues "" that are unlikely to make waves , such as fitness and support for military families , is a cop - out .
Right under our noses , she 's changing the world ."
2012-10-26,"The voice was strong and passionate .
The "" fired up "" catchphrase was familiar .
The two - thousand strong Florida crowd of Democrats was adoring as they were urged to get to the polls .
But the Obama on the stage was not Barack .
It was Michelle .
In a fiery piece of oratory given in a sports hall at Broward College in Davie , Florida , the first lady was a natural campaigner getting the full rock star treatment every bit as much as her spouse does . ""
Yeahhhh !
"" she said as she took to the podium . ""
This is what I call a rally ! ""
She looked out at the roaring crowd .
"" I can tell you all seem pretty fired up and ready to go .
And that 's a good thing because I am really fired up and ready to go myself , "" she said .
But Michelle Obama does not have the field to herself when it comes to the fierce and increasingly tight election battle of 2012 .
Ann Romney , wife of Republican challenger Mitt , has also emerged as a powerful advocate for her husband .
She , too , is criss - crossing the battleground states , enthusiastically rallying Republican foot soldiers for her spouse 's cause .
Both candidates ' wives have the same role : energise the base and humanise their husbands with warm tales of character and family life .
But now , as the neck - and - neck election draws to a close , each is also seen as a vital advocate for what is emerging as the most important demographic in the contest : women voters .
A new poll , published on Thursday , showed that Obama 's long - held lead among women voters had all but vanished as Romney 's campaign has enjoyed a remarkable national surge and brought the overall race to a virtual dead heat .
After months of leading by double digits among female voters , the AP - GfK survey showed the candidates now tied at 47 % among women .
Just a month ago Obama 's lead had been a huge 16 points . ""
Often the Democrats have taken the female vote for granted .
But this is four years into an economic crisis and the Republicans have hoped to siphon off some of that female support on economic issues , "" said Katherine Jellison , an expert on women 's history at Ohio University .
Michelle Obama and Ann Romney are now a key part of each campaign 's fight for women voters .
But they are making their pitches to wildly different audiences and in significantly different ways .
They are also very different people .
One is a black ex - lawyer who once earned far more than her husband .
The other is a blonde housewife , devout Mormon and mother of five boys .
Mirroring their husbands ' polarised campaigns , the efforts of Ann Romney and Michelle Obama are also studies of opposites even as they share the goal of winning the White House .
At Broward , Michelle Obama hammered away at a mixed - race crowd gathered at a community college in a lower - middle class neighbourhood of small homes and strip malls lined with fast food joints .
She gave an impassioned speech for about 45 minutes , heavy on her husband 's policy achievements from the past four years .
She came across as a natural speaker , mixing in anecdotes of family life with a stern lecture on the importance of volunteering for the campaign .
"" I do n't care what 's going on , sign up to do something before election day , "" she insisted .
Meanwhile , near Orlando , Florida , Ann Romney made her own pitch this week .
She spoke outdoors in a bucolic city park in Winter Park , one of the wealthiest communities in Florida .
Just off a street lined with expensive restaurants and fashionable boutiques she spoke to an overwhelmingly white crowd of locals .
She emerged on stage clutching the hands of two young boys .
"" I have brought some special friends with me , "" she gushed .
"" These are two of my 18 grandchildren . ""
Her speech , with a heavy emphasis on Romney family stories , was largely policy free and lasted just 15 minutes .
But her image was flawless : that of a proud churchgoing mother and wife concerned for the future of America .
At one stage she talked in folksy tones of her spouse 's decision to run for president .
She said she had asked her husband if it was "" too late "" to save America . ""
Mitt said : "" It 's growing late .
It 's getting very late .
But it 's not too late yet .
"" I said : "" That 's all I need to know .
Go save America ! "" , "" she explained .
Despite â€ “ or in fact because of â€ “ their hugely different styles , both candidates ' wives are popular with their party 's grassroots .
"" I feel like I won a million dollars .
She 's very boisterous .
She is active .
When she speaks it 's more heartfelt , "" said Shanovia Brown , 33 , a corrections officer at Michelle Obama 's Broward rally .
But in Winter Park , Ann Romney was hitting the spot , too .
"" She is very elegant , very classy .
She will be a beautiful representative of America , "" said Beth Young , a 54-year - old flight attendant .
Indeed , both Michelle Obama and Ann Romney are more popular than their husbands .
In one recent poll , Michelle Obama 's favourability rate was 69 % , with Ann Romney at 52 % - a jump of 12 points since April as her public profile has grown .
So far Michelle Obama has been the more active spouse .
She has been a fundraising powerhouse , bringing in more than $ 17 m since the start of the year .
At one event having a photo taken with the first lady cost $ 5,000 .
Michelle Obama has also been on edgy late - night talk shows , like Jimmy Kimmel , and appeared at Hollywood fundraisers with stars like Will Smith . ""
With Michelle , Barack Obama can double the territory and double the number of donors reached , "" said Robert Watson , a professor of American studies at Lynn University .
Meanwhile , Ann Romney has been a little more reticent .
She frequently appears alongside her husband on television , but less so by herself .
Some experts believe that is a mistake .
"" She is not as naturally comfortable as Michelle .
She has been under utilised , "" Watson said .
But being a first lady , or a would - be first lady , is an entry into a strange and tradition - bound corner of American politics .
It is essentially a subordinate role whose main aim is to tell a husband 's story .
Michelle Obama , once a distinguished lawyer , calls herself a "" mom - in - chief "" and does not shy away from schmaltz .
It is seen as "" humanising "" Obama , who is often viewed as aloof . ""
Although my husband is handsome and charming and incredibly smart â€ “ yes
indeed â€ “ that is not why I married him .
Listen closely .
What truly made me fall in love with Barack Obama is something you all see every day
â€
“
it 's his character .
It 's his decency and his honesty , "" she said in Broward .
Ann Romney , too , lays it on thick .
In Winter Park she spoke of how her husband tended to a dying boy in hospital , visiting him regularly , telling him about heaven and helping him with his final wishes .
She spoke of pride of her husband 's performance in the television debates .
"" To have Mitt Romney defining who he is and what kind of a person he is , I loved it , "" she said .
Telling these homely stories is seen as vital by campaign strategists , not for the spouse 's own image , but for their husbands ' .
"" We do n't elect first ladies .
Instead we think : this is the kind of spouse that he has chosen to marry and so her world view must line up with his , "" said Jellison . ""
Religious conservatives will hear Ann Romney 's message and feel comfortable that she is a traditionally - minded woman and that her husband will champion that mindset . ""
Yet in the end their campaigning reduces both Michelle Obama and Ann Rommey to playing a subservient , traditionally "" female "" role in the election .
Both tout their domestic credentials and experiences of motherhood .
They talk about favoured recipes , their fashion choices are endlessly analysed and they do a whole parade of "" softball "" magazine and newspaper interviews .
They chat to Elle , Home Journal , Parade and appear on Oprah Winfrey 's show .
"" It is a guaranteed win - win .
You get soft ball questions and they tend to be more popular than their husbands .
You would be a fool not to send them out there , "" said Watson .
The crowds flocking to see them were not complaining .
Mary Faro , a local academic , had waited for three hours to the see the First Lady come to Broward . ""
And I 'd do it again .
Happily , "" she explained .
Supporters at the Ann Romney rally felt the same .
"" When she speaks , she speaks from the heart .
You can sense a phoney , and Ann Romney is very genuine , "" said Hib Theriault , a retired army colonel .
All of which explains why the candidates ' wives have been so active as the election enters it final and fiercest phase .
They are both succeeding at the part of politics that is more a high school contest popularity contest than a policy debate .
""
Not all voters like policy .
It 's like the prom king and queen , and no one tells a person 's story as well as their spouse , "" said Watson ."
2012-11-06,"Like her husband , Michelle Obama must wait until the results are in to find out whether she has another four years in Washington or gets to leave the White House and reclaim her life .
It 's hard to say which option she 'd prefer because if the last four years have been tough for Barack Obama , they have n't exactly been a cakewalk for the first lady .
But whatever the outcome of today 's election the next four years will be easier for her .
In either case they could be very different .
Michelle Obama has never hidden her ambivalence about moving from Chicago to Washington .
Even in this year 's speech to the DNC she brought it up .
"" Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys , "" she said .
"" Saturdays at soccer games , Sundays at grandma 's house , and a date night for Barack and me with either dinner or a movie because as an exhausted mom , I could n't stay awake for both .
â€
¦
And the truth is , I loved the life we had built for our girls . ""
The daughters of the self - described mom - in - chief are older now
â€ “
one of them is in high school .
They are more independent .
They need her less .
She has more time to do what she wants .
And because this would be her husband 's last term in the White House , she could push the boundaries of the role of first lady if she so chose .
Win or lose
she has more options .
Here are some for her to consider .
If Barack Obama wins She could change her issues .
In her husband 's first term , her first focus was on military families , but combat forces are already home from Iraq and are due to be out of Afghanistan within the next two years .
While she can remain involved in the lives of military families and the problems they face post combat , this does n't need to be a priority .
Nor does obesity , which was a safe option for a first lady who did n't want to make waves .
She can remain concerned with it , but as her heart never seemed to be in it , she should put it on the back burner ( no pun intended ) .
She should be more vocal on behalf of women .
As a lawyer , and a woman of eloquence she would be an antidote to the grey - haired men of the Republican party .
She could become first lady in more than just name .
If she speaks out on subjects like pay equity , childcare , even contraception people will listen .
She has the power and the spotlight to make a real difference for women in and out of the workforce .
An added bonus is , that if she did , it would add considerably to her husband 's legacy .
She should position herself for a career after the White House .
She will have four years to consider and prepare for whatever it is she wants to do next .
By the time the Obamas leave Washington Malia will be headed to college and Sasha will be in high school .
Michelle Obama could follow the Clinton model and head into politics herself , but she does n't seem drawn to the political arena unless it 's in a role like ambassador to the UN .
But she 'd have the time to try out a few ideas and make some relationships for the future .
She should write a book .
No more gardening .
But maybe she could put together a parenting book based on her unique perspective .
After all she is the mom - in - chief , and there is the precedent of It Takes a Village .
She 'd get an enormous advance and the book tour would give her a platform to promote her ideas of child - rearing and family values .
If Barack Obama loses She should immediately reclaim her own professional achievements and get a job .
If the family moves back to Chicago she could explore local community - based professional options .
That seems to be where she was happiest before .
She could even take those options national .
There 's no reason why she ca n't pick up where she left off but with more of a megaphone .
She should NOT host a talk show .
The talk in Hollywood is that the former first lady could be the secret to daytime TV gold .
They say she is so telegenic ( and she is )
she could be the next Oprah .
But taking that path is selling herself short .
She should confine herself to being a guest not a host .
She should re - embrace her alma mater .
Obama admits that her Princeton years were not her happiest , but it 's time she got over it .
University officials have made at least six direct overtures to her to return to Princeton or speak at Princeton - affiliated events .
( She even declined to attend her 25th reunion in May 2010 . )
In all but one case , she has rebuffed their advances , often citing a busy schedule , according the The Princetonian .
Her Ivy League ( do n't forget Harvard law school ) education is something she should be proud of and she should realize what an inspiration it could be to other women from less than privileged backgrounds .
She should continue writing op - eds .
She wrote her first one last month , ( "" Do children who go to an understaffed , crumbling school truly have a fair shot at success ?
If a family has a son or daughter born with a genetic disease , should they have to fight day and night with insurance companies just to get the insurance coverage they need ? "" )
It was good .
She has a voice and anyone will publish her .
It 's an easy way to keep her profile high and use her influence .
In either case She should take more risks .
She has enormous influence , and nothing to lose .
She should be more outspoken and more passionate about the causes she believes in .
She should ditch the mom - in - chief title and revert to what she was before her husband ran for the White House â€ “ a bright well - educated , articulate , accomplished woman , inspirational in her own right ."
2012-12-03,"With the US government facing its worst budget crisis in a generation and the whole nation in a tizzy over how to reduce the $ 16tr ( Â£10tr ) national debt , the Obamas have decided to lead from the front this holiday season â€ “ by ordering a mere 54 Christmas trees .
"" We have 54 trees in the White House , "" Michelle Obama blurted out to visitors .
""
Fifty four : that 's a lot of trees .
"" It sure is .
As the Investors Business Daily pointed out , that 's about 50 % more trees than the Obamas enjoyed in their temporary home last year .
Why Michelle Obama felt obliged to splurge on quite so many trees remains a mystery .
The first lady may have made her name over the past four years fighting the scourge of obesity in America 's schools , but she has turned out to be a glutton for conifers .
The White House has suggested there is a rationale for the apparent excess , however : there are four large trees in the grand foyer of the White House ; the remaining 50 pay homage to a tradition started by that most trendsetting first lady of all , Jackie Kennedy .
She began the habit of first ladies choosing a theme each year for the holiday season decorations , so each of the 50 trees will be hung with ornaments representing the holiday legacies adopted , all the way back to Kennedy .
Michelle Obama 's chosen theme this year is "" joy to all "" .
She said she wanted to celebrate the many joys of the holiday season , including "" the joy of giving and service to others "" and the "" joy of sharing our blessings with one another "" .
She might have added the "" joy of wishful thinking "" .
There is precious little spirit of sharing in Washington at present as the White House and Congress prepare , like lemmings , to jump off the fiscal cliff ."
2013-01-01,"High - profile leadership , perhaps by a member of the royal family who could take on a similar role to that played by Michelle Obama in the US , is needed to solve the obesity crisis in the UK , according to one of the authors of a report published on Tuesday .
The report from the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) finds that too little is being done for adults who are severely overweight .
NHS services are "" extremely patchy "" , it says , even though a quarter of all adults are obese and it is estimated that by 2050 most of the population will be .
Professor John Wass , chair of the working party that produced the report , says there is a real need for leadership .
The report calls for a senior figure in government who will take charge of obesity issues across all departments â€ “ from education to health , to agriculture and work and pensions .
Wass says we could learn from the US , where Michael Bloomberg , mayor of New York , and Michelle Obama in the White House have been leading a successful fight against obesity .
He said : "" I think we could have a senior figure in London , rather like the mayor of New York , who has led on having smaller measures of Coca - Cola in cups and other things .
Michelle Obama has had a huge effect on obesity and getting things labelled . ""
Let us say â€ “ real pie in the sky
â€ “ we had a member of the royal family leading with a crossbench peer who had experience across departments of government .
We 'd be one of the countries that could solve the problem first on the planet .
We could get a lot achieved by enthusiasm and efficiency .
In the medical profession there is a burning desire to get the services in place . ""
The report , called Action on Obesity ; Comprehensive Care for All , points out that the UK has the highest levels of obesity in the world after the US , where the situation is improving slowly .
Yet a third of NHS hospitals do not have obesity clinics run by multidisciplinary teams who can deal with the complexity of people 's physical , social and mental problems
â€ “ many patients have eating problems , depression and anxiety .
Weight loss surgery is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for people who are over a BMI ( body mass index , which relates weight to height ) of 35 and have related medical problems .
But there is a 93-fold variation in the proportion of patients who are allowed surgery such as gastric bands .
"" In some parts PCTs [ primary care trusts ] wo n't accept it before they have a BMI of 60 .
These people are very much more ill by the time they get to bariatric surgery , "" said Wass .
Stomach stapling and other forms of weight loss surgery have been rationed as part of the NHS 's money - saving measures .
Yet , said Wass , "" the counter - argument is very strong .
Within 26 months of bariatric surgery you save the cost of performing it . ""
Tam Fry , chair of the Child Growth Foundation , called for more attention to the needs of children , who are not usually eligible for surgery or weight loss drugs .
"" The provision for these children is woeful , "" he said .
The RCP report , he said , "" will shame and embarrass governments which have done virtually nothing in the setting up of obesity clinics "" .
The report comes on the third anniversary of the government 's Change4Life strategy , which had "" singularly failed "" , he said .
"" We are rudderless in any fight to beat obesity . ""
Professor Lindsey Davies , president of the Faculty of Public Health , welcomed the call for a single cross - departmental lead on obesity , "" but every government department must play its part , "" she said .
"" The only way we will ever tackle the problems caused by obesity is by everyone working together . ""
Obesity is not only caused by how much we each eat or drink : if tackling it were as simple as telling people to eat less and move more , we would have solved it by now .
Our chances of being obese are also affected by factors like whether we have easy access to affordable fruit , veg and other healthy foods , and if it is safe to let our kids play outside .
That 's why if governments focus on personal choice alone it is , at best , a red herring and , at worst , a dereliction of duty for everyone 's health . ""
A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was committed to tackling obesity .
"" The Responsibility Deal is helping people reduce the amount of fat and sugar in their diet and from next year local areas will be given a ringfenced budget to help tackle obesity in their communities , "" said a statement .
"" The NHS has a range of programmes in place to encourage weight loss .
Surgery should only be considered as a last resort and decisions must be clinically led . """
2013-01-18,"Marking her 49th birthday this week , Michelle Obama â€ “ ever the giver â€ “ celebrated by gifting the world two things : another Twitter account ( now four days old , it already has over 60,000 followers ) and a new hairstyle .
Snapped meeting David Hall , a citizen co - chair on the Presidential Inaugural Committee
, he was rather overshadowed by her red Zac Posen frock and a new 70s - style full fringe .
With fashion insiders already speculating what she might wear for Monday 's inauguration
â€
“ WWD even asked designers including Tommy Hilfiger and Vera Wang for potential designs
â€ “
this is the first lady throwing us a style bone .
If Kate Middleton caused a press storm when she debuted her new Farah Fawcett - ish flicked hairstyle â€ “ five days before the news of her pregnancy was announced , it had almost as much coverage
â€ “ arguably Obama has even more sway over style .
There 's little doubt her haircut
â€ “
a kind of longer , artfully messy version of Joanna Lumley 's Purdey â€ “ will instantly be dubbed The Michelle and asked for by name in hairdressers across the land .
But , while Obama is without a doubt one of the most watched women on the planet , her new hairstyle is also part of a trend .
The fringe â€ “ once tainted with memories of bowl cuts and that tortuous growing - out process â€ “ has been making a bit of a comeback .
BeyoncÃ © now sports a thick , neat fringe down to her eyebrows , and Kim Kardashian debuted a side - swept style last week .
The New York Times even went so far as to call The Karlie â€ “ a pixie bob with fringe , named after model Karlie Kloss 's hairstyle â€ “ the haircut of 2013 .
Obama 's version , then , is the ultimate endorsement for the fringe .
As for any clues it provides for what she will be wearing come Monday 's inaugeration , the jury is still out .
A 60s - style shift with go - go boots , maybe ?
A catsuit a la Lumley ?
Perhaps not â€ “ our money is on something safe and stylish like J Crew .
For this ultimate photo op , though , one thing is for sure : she should take note of Middleton 's experiences and get the hairspray out .
As the Duchess of Cambridge found out on a blustery trip to Cambridge post - chop , fringes do n't take kindly to wind ."
2013-01-21,"Can clothes express feelings ?
To paraphrase Barack Obama himself : yes , they can .
Inauguration day , like a wedding day or graduation ceremony , is an occasion when the intense emotion of the protagonists and the crowd is constrained by the formality of the occasion .
Official portraits often end up a little stiff .
The clothes Michelle Obama and her daughters are wearing ensure that joy , warmth and modernity , as well as solemnity and history , radiate from every photograph .
Michelle Obama 's coat - dress is by Thom Browne .
In the fashion world , Browne 's name is most closely associated with the trend for men to wear their trousers cropped or rolled slightly short , with an exposed ankle , a look he pioneered in the middle of last decade and which quickly became ubiquitous among the hipster populations of New York , London and Berlin .
Since expanding into womenswear , Browne has retained his maverick approach : a New York fashion week show last year began with suited models climbing out of pinstripe - lined coffins .
In other words : Browne is n't a safe , easy choice for a first lady .
Oscar de la Renta , he is not .
Few observers will know or care about Browne 's edgy credentials , but the use of a man 's necktie motif on the fabric sends a clear , snappy message about a no - nonsense and businesslike attitude .
For this second - term inauguration , the first lady is dressed less as a newly - crowned homecoming queen and more as a woman who has her feet firmly under the White House desk .
There have been reports that she wants to pull focus away from her wardrobe in the second term .
Wearing a dress that references the tie â€ “ a totem not of fashion but of mens ' business attire â€ “ is a neat way to silence any snippiness about the first lady playing the fashion plate .
Malia and Sasha prove once again their impeccable grasp of colour coordination .
Delphinium blue and violet are complimentary shades without being matchy - matchy .
These are a pleasing combination of colours , with visual links with their mother and grandma â€ “ Michelle 's gloves match Malia 's scarf , while Michelle 's mother Marian wears an apricot scarf tucked into her camel coat , echoing Sasha 's outfit .
The overall effect is to create an image of harmony and togetherness without stifling the individuality of any member of the White House family ."

It ca n't be easy living in Michelle Obama 's shadow , but Dr Biden is no style slouch ( no slouch , period .
Check those upper arms ) .
Her Vera Wang gown is the perfect shade of blue for her hair , and nails the sophisticated elegance we have come to expect from the Obama White House .
The silhouette reminds me a little of the late Carolyn Bessette Kennedy 's classically beautiful Narciso Rodriguez wedding gown .
Alicia Keys was on message : she chose Michael Kors , a favourite designer of Michelle Obama 's ( Flotus wore a black sequinned boat - neck Kors dress for part of Sunday 's celebrations ) .
The full , sparkly skirt looks fabulous swooshing around that piano stool , the long length lends gravitas ( sorry ) , while the open back adds a youthful wink so that Keys does n't look too staid .
Look on the bright side , Brad : Barack must really like your music , because he did n't invite you for your fashion sense .
Country singer Paisley looks â€ “ how to put this ?
â€ “ a little out of his depth at this occasion , style - wise .
Red tie , white hat , blue guitar : see what he did there !
This is patriotic dressing by numbers .
Michelle chose Jason Wu , the same designer she wore in 2009 .
But this time the dress was red instead of white , and the shape more Grecian goddess than blushing bride .
The vibe is more mature , bolder , stronger .
Barack looks awesome in a white bow tie .
Also , is it just me , or is he looking younger again ?
( Grey hair excluded . )
Jennifer Hudson 's dress is so slinky , it is made for slow dancing .
And her shoes , if I 'm not very much mistaken , are flying the flag for London style : those are the Dolly , by Charlotte Olympia , the label designed by half - English

2013-02-05,"Her story is an incredible tale of triumph over tragedy : a tormented childhood during China 's Cultural Revolution , detention and forced exile after exposing female infanticide â€ “ then glittering success as the head of a major US technology firm .
"" It sounds too unbelievable for fiction , but this is the true story of a life in two worlds , "" enthuses the website for Ping Fu 's autobiography , Bend Not Break .
In one interview to promote the book , the entrepreneur related how Michelle Obama had invited her back to the White House for a nightcap after the 2010 State of the Union address .
But after Chinese readers flagged up a series of inconsistencies and improbabilities in interviews she has given , Fu has been forced to defend her book from accusations that some of it is exaggerated or untrue .
"" I am shocked and saddened by the things that have been said , "" Fu told the Guardian .
"" It is very , very hurtful because it brings me right back to what happened to me when I was eight years old . ""
Fu is chief executive and cofounder of the 3D software company Geomagic , whose laser scanning technology has been used by Hollywood film studios , car designers and historians making a precise replica of the Statue of Liberty .
She arrived in the US aged 25 , passing through college and spells as a babysitter , cleaner and waitress before rising to her current position as a prominent business executive and board member of the White House advisory panel , the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship .
Many of the questions swirling around Bend Not Break relate to the 54-year - old 's horrifying account of being wrenched from her parents when the Cultural Revolution started in 1966 , and sent to a re - education camp where she was gang - raped at the age of 10 .
An estimated 36 million people were persecuted during the turmoil of that time and numerous families were torn apart .
But sceptics , including Fang Zhouzi , an influential blogger who scrutinises Chinese academia , say much of Fu 's story does not ring true .
Fu has now acknowledged that her 2010 account to NPR radio of being forced to watch Red Guards executing a teacher by using four horses to tear the victim apart was an "" emotional memory "" and probably wrong .
"" When I was young , these are the stories being told to us and in my nightmares they come back again and again .
That time was so traumatic .
I was taken away from my parents , "" she said .
But she now accepts that her imagination may have played tricks . ""
Somehow in my mind I always thought I saw it , but now I 'm not sure my memory served me right .
I probably saw it in a movie or something , and I acknowledge that 's a problem .
"" There are also queries about the circumstances surrounding her departure from China .
The opening line of the book reads : "" When I was 25 years old , the Chinese government quietly deported me . ""
Sceptics point out that usually only prominent dissidents go into exile by arrangement .
Fu said she had n't used "" deported "" in the draft of her memoir .
The word was suggested as an amendment by her co - author and editors as a way to "" attract readers "" .
But she added that by the dictionary definition it was accurate to say she had been deported .
"" If you are asked to leave your country and it is not voluntary , that is a form of deportation . ""
According to Fu 's book , she was forced to leave because of her university thesis on female infanticide prompted by the one - child policy .
A Shanghai newspaper learned of her groundbreaking research and "" called for an end to the madness "" in an editorial comment subsequently republished by the People 's Daily â€ “ in what would have been an astonishing move for the staid official Communist party newspaper .
That sparked an international outcry and her detention , she wrote .
After Fang said he found no trace of the commentary , Fu responded in a column in the Huffington Post : "" I remember reading an editorial in a newspaper in 1982 that called for gender equality .
It was not a news article and not written by me , and I did n't know it had anything to do with my research .
When writing the book , I did not name the paper , since I was n't certain .
However , I think that is where I read the editorial because it was the most popular and official newspaper . ""
Adrian Zackheim , publisher of Portfolio books , Penguin 's business imprint , said he stood by Bend Not Break , adding that he had "" absolute confidence "" in Fu and her memoir .
"" I have no doubts that the book is substantially correct and that attempts to pick apart elements of it are political attacks .
"" Zackheim said Portfolio had no plans to look into the veracity of the book . ""
This is a memoir of a woman 's life , it 's not a work of journalism .
Are there errors in the book ?
I ca n't say , but if there are they are errors of memory . """

2013-02-23,"In terms of elegance , it was some way off the inaugural dance that saw Michelle Obama ushered in as First Lady in 2009 .
But in terms of variety , it had it all .
The Dougie , the Hip Bump , the Sprinkler and even the "" Just the Hands Part of Single Ladies "" all got a look - in as Obama cut a rug alongside a dragged - up Jimmy Fallon on Friday night .
The resulting trot through the "" Evolution of Mom Dancing "" saw the first lady go from awkward moving to sassy shaker in the space of a two - minute dance off that quickly went viral .
The clip was a highlight of Obama 's latest foray into the world of late night US chat shows , which was to promote Let 's Move , her anti - childhood obesity campaign .
Let 's Move marked its third anniversary this month .
Fallon attempted to tempt Obama into considering a Michelle - Hillary ticket for the presidency in 2016 .
Although an all - female White House push alongside the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton would no doubt be popular among Democrats , it seems unlikely .
"" You know , I have my eye actually on another job .
And I hear that when Jay Leno retires that The Tonight Show position is going to open and I 'm thinking about putting my hat in the ring , "" she said .
"" I got my hat in the ring , "" Fallon replied ."
2013-02-23,"Bobbi Brown had a fairly typical week in her frenetic globetrotting life : she was flown from her New Jersey home to create the "" visage "" at L'Wren Scott 's debut show for London fashion week .
The following day , the founder of the eponymous cosmetics business headed back to Washington for lunch with Michelle Obama , a friend and client .
Afterwards , it was back to her global HQ in SoHo , New York , for a couple of days , then on to meet her architect husband and one of their three sons in the Rockies for some weekend skiing .
Just before she flew back to the US , Brown , 55 , showed me a photograph of her posing with friend L'Wren Scott , a 6 ft 3 in model turned designer , and her boyfriend , Mick Jagger .
She was delighted that the picture had been tweeted by the Rolling Stones star to his 330,000 followers and had appeared on numerous websites .
But , like so many women , she sought reassurance on her appearance .
The diminutive
( she just nudges
5 ft ) entrepreneur adjusted her bookish specs as she looked at the image on her iPhone and quietly asked me and her trusted PR director if she looked fat .
Fat ? !
This is a healthy , successful , attractive , inspirational role model with curves in all the right places and skin that glows with the translucent flush of an eight year - old skipping in the fresh air .
However , it was reassuring that even the proponent of a movement called Pretty Powerful , created to celebrate the diverse and unique beauty in all women , is n't always aware of the radiance she emanates . ""
All women have insecurities , "" she says matter of factly , sipping ginger tea . ""
Supermodels and Hollywood actresses confide they do n't like parts of their face or their body : they tell me they felt gawky or did n't like being different to other women .
I 'm lucky , I know how to use makeup
and I 've had the benefit of working with some incredible designers and stylists over the years , who 've given me valuable advice on dressing to suit my body and my lifestyle .
"" It has become a mission of Brown 's to share that experience and knowledge with women around the world , empowering them through their appearance .
For the last 13 years , she and her employees have worked closely with the American charity Dress for Success , which helps unemployed women get back into the workplace through mentoring and transformative makeovers .
Brown serves on the worldwide board and her business supplies an army of makeup artists to teach the women who come to the charity for help .
The company donates makeup kits to them and gives $ 25,000 each time Brown hosts a slot on the QVC shopping channel .
To date that amounts to more than $ 2 m .
Next week , a formal corporate partnership with Dress for Success London will be launched in Britain .
Based in Islington , north London , the small - scale venture â€ “ where Samantha Cameron volunteered in 2010 â€ “ helped 1,250 women last year .
That 's a fraction of the 1.09 million women unemployed in the UK , but Brown hopes that , by raising awareness of the scheme and supporting it with practical resources and funds , it might grow to be as prolific as the US operation .
"" It 's so incredible to see these women , who have often been out of work for years , be given a chance again , "" says Brown .
"" Often they 've had to deal with challenging circumstances such as divorce , redundancy or drug addiction , and they 're trying to get their lives back on track , but they do n't have the wherewithal to make it happen .
Their self - esteem is at rock bottom , and even if they have relevant qualifications and rÃ © sumÃ
© s they just do n't have the confidence to sell themselves as the right person for the position .
If you do n't feel good about yourself , how can you expect others to invest in you ? ""
When these women go to Dress for Success , they have a session with a trained stylist who helps put together an outfit , with accessories , that makes them feel good ( they get to keep it ) .
"" Then we teach them how to do their makeup so they look polished and professional , "" says Brown .
"" With that , they feel they can accomplish anything .
It changes their life . ""
When Brown was growing up in the 60s , she was surrounded by images of cookie - cutter blonde , blue - eyed , tanned Californian beauties .
The complete antithesis of this , Brown did n't feel beautiful until the day she watched Ali MacGraw in Love Story , when she was 14 , and experienced an epiphany .
"" I suddenly realised that beauty comes in so many shapes , sizes , colours and ages .
I started to see the positives in my own appearance and my confidence grew as I learned that I could make the best of the hand Mother Nature had dealt me .
When I began working as a makeup artist , I loved the way that I could really help to transform other women , boosting their self - esteem by doing so . ""
Today Brown 's disciples use their skills to help women experience that same epiphany .
"" I see that moment all the time in my work , "" says Georgina Pelosi , one of Brown 's top makeup artists based in the UK .
"" It 's not about me telling women how I think they should look , but about helping them learn techniques to make the most of the features they like .
It 's incredibly rewarding being able to bring about that transformation . ""
"" I can look people in the eye for the first time in years , "" wept a woman of 29 I spoke to last week , after she had experienced a Dress for Success makeover .
"" When you look in the mirror , all you see is your imperfections , but George helped me focus on the positives , "" said Julia , a 25-year - old law graduate .
"" When you 've done 50 applications and you 've been rejected 50 times , this is the thing that can make the difference .
I know I 've got skills , but I could n't sell them because my confidence had been destroyed .
Now I 'm going out fighting . ""
Johanna K , 32 , says : "" I have a degree in business finance and was working for London Underground when I went on maternity leave five years ago .
I gave birth , then split with her father after a long - term abusive relationship .
He had told me I was ugly , fat , pointlessâ€
¦
I just felt I had nothing to contribute to society .
"" I had been looking for work , but was n't getting anywhere when , about a year ago , I was referred to Dress for Success .
Having a stylist and a makeup artist take the time and trouble to help me find myself again was a huge turning point .
I would n't be in the job I 'm in today , working in a university , without that help , because it gave me the confidence to face the world . ""
In these enlightened times of workplace equality , it can be hard to reconcile the idea of appearance being relevant in a woman 's bid to get a job .
Yet Ffion Griffith , global human resources director at international law firm Olswang LLP , says it is crucial women are confident about their appearance at interviews , though not for the obvious reasons .
"" You need to know that you look your best , that your makeup is so well applied and subtle it is n't even noticed .
The more you focus on getting it right , the less attention your interviewer will give your appearance because you will be comfortable and confident about the way you look
and you 'll focus on your skills and experience .
Your appearance should become almost invisible , just leaving an overall impression of polished professionalism . ""
Delyth Evans , executive director at Dress for Success London , says : "" Our role is to empower women to look in the mirror and feel confident they are smart and capable of doing the job .
When they come to us they are usually suffering very low self - esteem , and have lost â€ “ or never had â€ “ the ability to believe they can succeed .
They come with no expectations because they have been trying to find work and failed .
They 're desperate : you can see that from the way they carry themselves , the way they behave and the way they talk about themselves . ""
Many women we see have very negative body image , and find the experience of shopping depressing .
We treat them with real empathy and respect when we do the wardrobe and makeup sessions .
They start to smile and we see different body language and the first signs of confidence coming through .
It 's naÃ¯ve to think appearance does n't matter , so we help them get it right .
And that can have incredible consequences . """
2013-02-25,"Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency Photoshopped pictures of Michelle Obama at the Oscars to conform to Iranian restrictions on images of the female body in the media .
Fars , which is affiliated to the Islamic republic 's elite Revolutionary Guards , redesigned the US first lady 's dress so that it covered her chest and shoulders in a picture showing her announcing that Argo had won best picture , via a video link from the White House .
Rules dictate that Iranian women shown on Iran 's state television should have a hijab that covers their hair , arms and legs .
The length of the censor 's ruler varies for foreigners .
A foreign woman travelling inside the Islamic republic should comply with the same restriction on Iranian women , but those shown on TV , such as dignitaries or actors , are tolerated without the hijab , up to a point .
Men enjoy relatively more freedom , but only sportsmen are allowed to be shown with bare legs on TV .
When Iranian media are obliged to use a picture that contravenes these rules , it is not unusual for Photoshop to come to their rescue .
Many foreign dignitaries and celebrities have fallen victim to the Islamic republic 's censorship regime , including the EU 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton .
When showing foreign films , state TV censors can go as far as editing the film frame by frame in order to cover up actors or delete them from a scene .
Fars was also infuriated by the Academy 's decision to honour Argo , which it described as an "" anti - Iranian "" film produced by the "" Zionist "" company Warner Bros â€ “ an objection echoed by many other state agencies .
A large number of Iranians â€ “ even those not necessarily sympathetic to Ahmadinejad 's regime â€ “ have taken to social networking websites to show discontent with Argo 's win , which they believe stereotypes Iranians in a negative way without drawing a distinction between ordinary citizens and the revolutionaries behind the US hostage crisis .
In January , officials in Tehran said they were intending to retaliate to Argo by making their own film about the hostage crisis , to be called The General Staff , which is promised to be an "" appropriate response "" to Ben Affleck 's "" ahistorical "" thriller .
Last year , Asghar Farhadi 's film A Separation became the first Iranian film to win an Oscar â€ “ for best foreign language film
â€ “ prompting national celebrations ."
2013-03-03,"Those of us who have been monitoring the transition of Michelle Obama from first to second term Flotus briefly lowered our binoculars on Sunday morning to glance across at the One Who Might Have Been .
In a navy satin jacket , with excellent blonde highlights ( no bangs ) on Fox News Sunday , Ann Romney sat beside her husband in San Diego as the pair answered searching questions from Chris Wallace on what life 's been like since their November loss .
( "" Mrs Romney , as we sit here right now ,
have you got over the defeat or is that going to take more time ? "" )
Advance word on the interview had already let us know that the shock of defeat had been greater for Anne than Mitt , and she got to the point that it had been a "" CRUSHING disappointment "" straight away with drama .
"" My heart and my whole soul was : ' we 're going to win . '
I was there . ""
Mrs. Romney confirmed that she did indeed cry as previous reports had described .
The tears were not for her , she took pains to point out , but for the country .
"" The dream was to make a difference .
The dream was to serve , "" she said .
It 's not unusual for those who run for president to use the word "" serve "" to describe their colossal ambition .
Maybe they really do see being in charge of the most powerful country in the world as service .
Maybe it 's really possible for the enormously wealthy who employ plenty of help to see themselves as humble servants .
Ann Romney has always wanted us to believe this is so . ""
In our church we are used to serving , "" she said during the interview . ""
And you can be in a very high position â€ ¦
and then all of a sudden you 're released
and you 're nobody .
"" She was speaking as a Mormon of course , but it was an analogy that resonates more widely when the first pope in 600 years has just retired .
The "" nobody "" part of her self - description hinted at how hard she has found the past few months .
To listen to her speaking of "" mourning "" the fact that Mitt was n't president , was to wonder whether someone had actually died .
"" I 'm mostly over it , "" she said bravely . ""
But not completely .
You know you have moments where you look back and still feel the sorrow of the loss .
But we 're not mostly dead yet .
"" If we know one thing about political elections , it 's that losers inevitably blame the media .
"" I 'm happy to blame the media , "" she laughed , suddenly brightening .
Then she got steely .
Obama had run an unfair campaign , she affirmed in a tone and with a look that gave a glimpse of what it must be like when you do n't do exactly what the boss wants .
Then , as she remembered she was on camera , she softened again , and clutched onto her husband who had sat affably at her side throughout the interview .
If anyone gave the appearance of being over it , Mitt Romney did .
What is their life like now ?
Ann Romney confirmed she had been approached by Dancing With the Stars and had indeed seriously considered the offer , as she LOVES the show .
She turned it down on age ( she 's turning 64 ) and flexibility grounds .
She categorically denied that she 'll be a candidate for John Kerry 's Massachusetts Senate seat .
Her part of the joint interview ended with some warm and cuddly grandkid chat , accompanied by playground video .
"" They 're our life ! "" said Mitt .
No comment from Ann ."
2013-03-04,"Michelle Obama 's attempts to solve the problem of childhood obesity continued on Monday with a Google+ hangout hosted by Kelly Ripa .
Flotus has been having a fun time of it recently , dancing with Jimmy Fallon and handing out the best picture Academy Award to Argo .
If you were to poll the two Obamas , I 'd bet you 'd find Michelle is far more into their second term than Barack .
But as the "" Let 's Move "" campaign celebrates its third anniversary and the country adjusts to the early days of sequestration , Michelle Obama 's campaign is somewhere between a rock and a hard place .
Hunger is a major cause of obesity , and while the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP â€ “ formerly known as Food Stamps ) has been exempt from sequestration budget cuts , other national food programs have been hard hit .
The Special Supplemental Program for Women Infants and Children ( WIC ) , for example , will have to drop 600,000 families by the end of this year , according to the White House .
Michelle Obama is not stopping , however , she is just shifting her focus onto the "" move "" part of Let 's Move .
The program is expanding into the self - explanatory '
Let 's Move !

"" We have to get creative , "" she said via online video , "" regardless of resources .

She advocated dancing indoors , when it 's not safe to play outside .
She told a group of third graders who video chatted in from Maine ( all interactions took place by video chat ) that they should play outside in the snow on snowy days . ""
Go outside , roll in the snow , roll down some hills , have a snowball fight "" , she said .
"" My family â€ “ we like to ski , "" she added as an afterthought .
When the conversation turned to food , and she was asked what her favorite snack was post - workout
she played it safe .
"" We have apples all over the White House , "" she said .
"" We 're just like anybody else . ""
Hunger became an issue about half way through the conversation .
"" I would ask students at every meal to take a bite or two of your fruits or your vegetables , "" she said , assuming that students get offered fruits and vegetables at every meal . ""
Do n't throw out food â€ “ because there are many kids all over this country and the world who do n't have a lunch .
"" Who does this campaign address ?
Kids with food or kids without ?
Both ?
Even though the First Lady wants to stay out of politics and emphasizes that her nutritional role is one of an information provider , her message is n't clear .
What should impoverished obese families who ca n't afford the ingredients she recommends do ?
She never addresses that question .
A mother from "" out west "" told Obama that her kids went to a Title One , or lower - income school , and that lunch there was often nachos with chili sauce or corn dogs .
Obama explained that the nutritional guidelines for schools she successfully worked to implement have only just gone into effect .
"" If any school out there is having challenges they should contact the USDA , "" she said .
Good idea .
Only problem is , the Department of Agriculture has just had its budget cut by 10 % ."
2013-03-13,"Mitt Romney and Tiger Woods have become the latest victims of suspected Russian hackers who allegedly stole and posted online sensitive financial information about political figures and celebrities .
A website using the suffix of the former Soviet Union , .su , has reportedly paralysed the management agencies of about a dozen Hollywood stars since posting the information on Monday .
Fans and the curious have swamped published phone numbers hoping to speak to celebrities only to jam the lines of their lawyers , accountants and business managers , TMZ reported .
The FBI , the Los Angeles police department and credit agencies are investigating the security breach which has leaked social security numbers , credit reports , addresses and personal banking details .
Michelle Obama , Joe Biden , senior law enforcers and stars such as Jay - Z , BeyoncÃ
© , Britney Spears , Kim Kardashian , Mel Gibson , Ashton Kutcher , Paris Hilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been targeted .
Romney , the Republican former presidential candidate , joined the list on Wednesday when the site posted what purported to be his credit cards and a card for Barneys , the New York fashion citadel for men and women favoured by Sarah Jessica Parker .
The page was illustrated with a photo of President Barack Obama , who vanquished Romney last year , and a caption : "" Hey Mitt , you mad bro ? ""
Credit reports for Woods , accompanied with a picture in which the golfer looked upset , were dated to Tuesday , suggesting the hackers were obtaining up to the minute information .
Such a mass dump of sensitive information is known as being "" doxxed "" .
Those targeted have not responded to media requests seeking confirmation the information was real , leaving open the possibility the site was a hoax , or partial hoax .
Titled "" the secret files "" , the site features a girl with heavy black eye makeup and a warning : "" If you believe that God makes miracles , you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve . ""
FBI director Robert Mueller and LAPD chief Charlie Beck were among those targeted .
"" We 'll take steps to find out who did this , and if they 're within the boundaries of the United States , we 'll prosecute them , "" said Beck .
Al Gore and Stacia Hylton , director of the US Marshal 's Service , were among those added to the site on Wednesday .
Other victims included Hulk Hogan and Donald Trump .
Victims ' representatives did not immediately respond to media requests seeking confirmation the information was real , leaving open the possibility the site was a hoax , or partial hoax .
The celebrity news site TMZ , which broke the story on Monday , cited law enforcement officers saying that in addition to posting the information the hackers had been "" using "" it , suggesting theft or fraud .
The FBI has urged victims to apply additional safeguards on their bank accounts .
The site posted the first lady 's purported credit report , social security number , phone number , banking details and store cards . ""
Blame your husband .
We still love you , Michelle , "" it taunted .
Some of Biden 's information was also hacked , but when ABC phoned a telephone number for him , it turned out to be a business in Delaware .
Other political figures who were targeted included Sarah Palin , the former governor of Alaska , Eric Holder , the attorney general and Hillary Clinton , the former secretary of state .
Beck speculated he was included because of his force 's involvement in last month 's hunt for Christopher Dorner , a rogue , former LAPD officer who murdered four people before being killed in a dramatic shootout . ""
You ca n't corner the Dorner , "" said the site .
Last month the hacker group Anonymous had threatened cyber retaliation for Dorner 's death .
The site linked to a Twitter account that since Monday has posted two tweets in Russian . ""
Hello world , we are revealed .
Our aim is to show you all that this is just one of a few tricks up our sleeves , "" said one ."

2013-03-18,"Suspected Russian hackers last week posted private information apparently belonging to public figures such as Michelle Obama , Joe Biden , Kim Kardashian and LAPD chief Charlie Beck .
Much of the media coverage concentrated on the details of the information published , but perhaps the more intriguing detail is that hackers chose to build their site with the domain suffix .su
â€ “ the suffix for the former Soviet Union .
The .su suffix â€ “ or country
code Top - Level Domain ( ccTLD ) â€ “ has been around since 1990 , when it was assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) , the governing body which allocated global IP addresses and domain names to "" countries , sovereign states or dependent territories "" .
Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union a mere 14 months after its ccTLD was allocated , .su has lived on and is administered by the Russian Institute for Public Networks ( RIPN ) , the Russian organization that controls domain name registration with the .ru and .su suffixes .
Russia was granted its own .ru domain in 1994 .
But "" owners of ' .su ' sites stubbornly resisted switching , on commercial , political and patriotic grounds "" , according to this USA Today story from 2008 .
The fledgling RIPN was forced to compromise and agreed to stop issuing new .su
sites , while existing ones were allowed to continue .
In early 2012 , abuse.ch , a Swiss cybersecurity blog , noted that increasing numbers of ' domain hacks ' â€ “
ie unusual uses of a ccTLD â€
“ were popping up with the .su suffix , namely by hackers .
This was to get around a 2011 crackdown by RIPN which began systematically shutting down suspected hacking sites .
But .su is not the only curious nation - state domain name : .ly
Libya 's suffix proved to be popular before the Arab uprising that ousted Gaddaffi , because it was comparatively cheap .
URL shortener Bitly started the .ly domain hack trend by registering bit.ly ; inspiring others like brief.ly , adf.ly and ow.ly to follow suit .
However , the Libyan domain name governing body ( nic.ly ) has very strict regulations , namely : "" Domain names must not contain obscene , scandalous , indecent , or contrary to Libyan law or islamic morality words , phrases nor abbreviations .
"" This policy has resulted in websites being shut down , such as Vb.ly a "" sex - positive URL shortener , "" seized by the Libyan government in 2010 . .aq
Though Antartica has no permanent human residents , it does have a ccTLD .
This is available to government organizations who are signatories of the Antarctic Treaty or others who have a physical presence south of latitude 60ÂºS.
The Vatican also has its own ccTLD , .va , to serve its 832 residents .
.am , .fm
and .tv .am is the official ccTLD for Armenia , but AM radio stations have encroached on this domain .
According to Armenia 's Network Information Chapter , the local regulating body for .am domains , an .am suffix can be acquired for a mere $ 29.01 a year .
Creative domain hacks have also been used by companies such as Instagram , which owns own instagr.am .
.fm
is the Federated States of Micronesia 's official suffix .
But the domain is popular and clearly valuable to FM radio stations .
Anyone can purchase an .fm suffix , for an annual fee â€ “ proceeds of which apparently go to the government and people of micronesia â€ “ though calls to Micronesia 's IANA representative went unanswered .
The Polynesian island of Tuvalu , home to fewer than 11,000 people , was granted .tv .
But given the suffix 's popularity with television companies , it is in far wider use than the size of its population might suggest .
The suffix .
.tv was bought by American company Verisign in 2000 , with Tuvalu retaining a 20 % stake .
Tuvalu signed a 12-year leasing contract for .tv for a $ 50 m payout . .eh
This ccTLD has been the subject of a power struggle between Morocco and Western Sahara , a disputed territory .
Both have laid claims to the domain , but the IANA has ruled to keep the domain inactive until "" the two contesting applicants work together to find a mutual solution that will serve the needs of the local Internet community in the best possible fashion "" .
An unlikely scenario , given the two parties have been fighting since Spain released Western Sahara as a colony in 1975 . .yu
The suffixes of countries that disappear from the map usually just expire .
Yugoslavia 's .yu was in use until 2010 , but was ultimately retired when both Serbia and Montenegro were granted new domains .
Similarly , Czechoslovakia 's .cs , expired in 1993 , leaving Slovakia to adopt .sk and the Czech Republic .cs .
Zaire 's .zr morphed into .cd for the Democratic Republic of Congo
â€ “ not to be confused with .cg , for Congo - Brazzaville .
The same goes for Netherlands Antilles , a Caribbean island and former constituent country of the Netherlands .
Despite the country 's recent dissolution , the .an suffix has been retained .
East Germany put forth .dd , but reunification got in the way before that ever came to be in use . .Ñ€Ñ
„
Two domain suffixes apparently are n't enough for Russia .
In 2009 , they were granted their own Cyrillic script ccTLD .
Only 21 other countries have alternative ccTLDs using letters in their country 's native script . .la , .lv , and .to Laos , Latvia and the Tonga are repeatedly domain hacked by North American cities , eager to stake a claim on the internet .
Los Angeles businesses are attempting to reappropriate Laos 's .la ;
Las Vegas courts Latvia 's .lv
and Tonga 's .to finds itself affiliated with Toronto , Turin and Tokyo . .cx
Christmas Island , home to approximately 2,072 residents , has its own .cx domain suffix .
This gained brief notoriety during the high - profile murder trial of Joji Obara , a Japanese man jailed for the rape and murder of British woman Lucie Blackman .
During the trial , a mysterious website appeared with a .cx suffix , seemingly in support of Obara .
The website detailed Obara 's version of events , extracts from Blackman 's diary , a selection from court transcripts as well as court documents signed by several key members of the case .
Though it was forbidden to publish documents such as these without the court 's permission while the case was active , those responsible for the site understood that hosting the site through Christmas Island guaranteed a lengthy legal process if prosecutors wanted to shut it down .
Incidentally , no criminal case was ever mounted , according to Richard Loyd Parry in his book on the case , People Who Eat Darkness ."

2013-05-10,"Tom Hanks is the most trusted person in the US , according to a poll published by Reader 's Digest .
The Cast Away actor topped the 100-strong list ahead of fellow household names including Bill Gates ( no 7 ) , Jeopardy host Alex Trebek ( no 8) and Michelle Obama ( no 19 ) .
The magazine said it conducted the poll of more than 1,000 US citizens in conjunction with research firm the Wagner Group to "" discover which individuals and the ideals they represent have earned our confidence "" .
As the personification of all - American values in a string of films ranging from Saving Private Ryan and Apollo 13 to Toy Story , Hanks ' status is perhaps understandable .
More oddly , however , Miss Congeniality actor Sandra Bullock took second place , while Denzel Washington , whose most recent role was an airline pilot with substance abuse issues in Flight , came third .
Moreover , six of the 10 most trusted Americans identified by the poll are movie - industry titans :
Meryl Streep came fourth , Steven Spielberg sixth , and Julia Roberts claimed 10th place .
The highest non - Hollywood entry on the list is author and academic Maya Angelou , at no 5 , while the most highly rated active former or current political officeholder ( discounting the first lady ) is Madeleine Albright , secretary of state from 1991 to 2001 , at no 23 .
Activist academic Noam Chomsky came in ahead of Albright , at no 20 ."
2013-06-06,""" One of the things I do n't do well is this , "" glowered Michelle Obama as she was challenged by a heckler this week .
Delivering a speech at a Democratic Party fundraiser , Obama called it like she saw it : "" Listen to me or you can take the mic , but I 'm leaving .
You all decide .
You have one choice . ""
Not everyone has the luxury toleave the stage , of course , though plenty of great comedians wish they probably could .
As for any future heckling scenarios , she might want to practise her putdowns with these tips .
Have a line ready There is , of course , already a great storehouse of heckler putdowns , apt for any occasion .
They do n't need to be subtle â€ “ just funny .
"" I was actually told you would be here tonight
â€ “ by your mum while I was fucking her , "" Jimmy Carr told one man . ""
At least , I think she was talking to me .
I was n't the only one there . ""
Or there 's : "" You 're so drunk .
I hope you drive home , "" from Steve Hofstetter .
Personally , I like Dylan Moran 's take best : "" I appreciate everything you 've done .
I loved your early work .
I think it 's only getting better . ""
Get them up on stage Hecklers clearly crave attention , so it 's nice to give them more of it than they expected .
Zach Galifianakis has used this approach with great success , giving over a short section of his show to a humiliating interview with one girl who he felt was n't paying enough attention .
Use the crowd
This works best if you 're a big star , as the room will be full of eager fans .
Which , in essence , was Michelle Obama 's strategy : threaten to stop the show , and rely on the rest of the audience to apply some pressure .
At a Democratic Party fundraiser , that 's a fairly safe bet .
At other times ?
Unmitigated disaster .
Perhaps the worst performance in the history of Have
I Got News for You
came in 1996 when Piers Morgan , having traded insults with Ian Hislop throughout the show , appealed to the crowd with : "" Do you actually like him ? ""
A big roar of affirmation confirmed that yes , again , everyone hates Piers Morgan .
Be positive Adam Hills does this all the time , and it 's surprisingly effective .
Rather than engage the heckler in the battle they 're so keen to start , he laughs at their joke , tells them how funny they are , and then gets on with things .
The trouble is that Hills is such a sunny character , it almost seems sincere :
witness his show at the Reading festival , where he was so pleased to re - encounter a former heckler , he surfed towards them across the crowd to say hello .
Threaten them
This can work .
In his early days , Omid Djalili used to issue an ultimatum to rowdy audiences : either they stopped heckling him , or he 'd start singing Cliff Richard songs at them .
However , a heckler can always ruin a show if they 're determined enough , so there will be times when security has to be called .
Ideally , as Jim Jeffries discovered after being punched by one audience member , before the fighting starts .
This article was amended on 11 June 2013 to correct the following : Jim Jeffries was punched by his heckler and did not , as the article stated , punch his heckler first ."
2013-06-06,"Michelle Obama confronted a protester at a fundraiser on Tuesday , stepping away from the lectern where she was speaking to denounce the protester 's behavior .
Obama was midway through a speech at a Democratic party fundraiser at a private Washington home when lesbian activist Ellen Sturtz , 56 , interrupted Obama 's speech to demand that Barack Obama sign an anti - discrimination executive order . ""
One of the things that I do n't do well is this , "" said Obama , to a room full of applause .
"" Do you understand ? ""
A pool report said that Obama moved towards the protester and said : "" Listen to me or you can take the mic , but I 'm leaving .
You all decide .
You have one choice . ""
The White House official transcript did not include this remark .
"" She came right down in my face , "" Sturtz told the Washington Post .
"" I was taken aback . ""
Pool reports said that one woman told Sturtz to leave before the activist was escorted out of the event .
Obama then continued with her speech and said : "" Understand this â€ “ this is what I want you all to understand .
This is not about us .
No one back here .
It 's not about you , or your issue , or your thing .
This is about our children . ""
The LGBT rights group Get Equal confirmed that Sturtz was the heckler and said that the organization had pre - planned the act .
The group has interrupted the president 's speeches in the past in an effort to encourage action on LGBT issues .
Get Equal said the act was a call to action for the Obama administration to sign a "" long - promised "" executive order to prevent companies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity from contracting with the federal government .
"" I had planned to speak tonight with DNC officials but , as the first lady was talking about our children 's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives , I simply could n't stay silent any longer , "" Sturtz said in a statement .
"" I 'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full , honest , and open lives with the stroke of the president 's pen , and I was hoping that the first lady would share my concern for all of our young people .
"" Sturtz told the Washington Post she paid $ 500 to attend the fundraiser , which had three other Get Equal activists in attendance .
The organization said one of the other activists , Autumn Leaf , interacted with DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz ."
2013-06-08,"Michelle Obama had a tough gig last week .
She was heckled at a fundraiser by a campaigner called Ellen Sturtz , who explained that : "" As the first lady was talking about our children 's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives , I simply could n't stay silent any longer .
"" I know what she means â€ “ that does sound dreary .
It 's a familiar feeling : you 're listening to a long speech but , for some reason , ca n't drop off to sleep , so you get fidgety instead .
I listened to the minute or so of Michelle Obama 's remarks before Sturtz 's interjection and was quite spellbound by how boring it was .
She was talking emphatically , and remarkably slowly , about how children matter .
Not a controversial notion but , if I 'd paid $ 500 to hear her gradually express it , I might have been irritated enough to take a contrary view .
Apparently she 'd seen some children in Chicago having a rough time and perhaps thought that , if she made a few minutes of some Democratic donors ' lives comparably shit , it might somehow help .
She continued : "" And there are so many kids in this country just like them
â€ “ kids with so much promise , but so few opportunities ; good kids who are doing everything they can to break the cycle and to beat the odds .
"" I hate seeing children vandalise bicycles and play online roulette as much as anyone , but there was something in the first lady 's leaden delivery that made me refuse to care .
Perhaps sensing something forced in the nods and smiles of the crowd , she went on : ""
Sorry , I 'm boring myself now .
Why do n't I sit down and we can get stuck into the catering ?
"" She did n't say that .
Instead , she got more animated on the subject of children and their widely accepted non - irrelevance : "" Those kids , they are the reason we 're here .
And today , we need to be better for them .
Not for us â€ “ for them !
We need to be better for all of our children do you under- ,
our kids "" â€ “ and elicited some weary whoops from the crowd .
Maybe I 'm being unfair â€ “
maybe all fundraiser speeches are like this .
Maybe Michelle Obama is the Cicero of the genre .
But I ca n't imagine standing in that crowd , listening to the obvious being stated more slowly than rust develops , without musing that this must be how political assassins get their motivation .
That 's when Ellen Sturtz intervened .
But she was n't calling on Mrs Obama to stop droning on â€
“
she wanted to join in the debate .
She was incensed that President Obama has yet to honour his 2008 commitment to sign an executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation .
Sturtz , who described herself as an "" old , grey - haired lesbian "" , said afterwards : "" I 'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full , honest , and open lives with the stroke of the president 's pen . ""
So she was n't bored , she was engaged ; she was angry , but she was gripped .
Maybe you had to be there .
Unfortunately Mrs Obama did n't welcome this surprising sign of will - to - live retention by an audience member . ""
Wait , wait , "" she said .
"" One of the things that I do n't doâ€ ¦ "" and then she paused , "" well , "" she continued , "" is this . ""
The pause is interesting â€ “ a first for the speech .
I reckon she 'd considered responding with an "" I do n't do this . ""
The first lady does n't do hecklers , just like Mariah Carey does n't do stairs .
Or is that Daleks ?
Or does she insist on Daleks ?
Or is that kittens ?
Anyway , my hunch is that , at the last minute , Mrs O decided to commute an "" I 'm not standing for this "" to a more passive - aggressive "" I 'm not very good at this . ""
It certainly became clear that she meant the former .
She left the podium and confronted Sturtz , saying : "" Listen to me , or you can take the mic
but I 'm leaving . ""
Ellen 's response is not recorded but the crowd was for Michelle pressing on , which she did . ""
So let me make the point that I was making before , "" she resumed unhurriedly .
"" We are here for our kids .
So we must recapture that passion , the same urgency and energyâ€ ¦
"" Ellen Sturtz , meanwhile , was being escorted out , which puts her ahead of the game in my book .
How well did Mrs Obama deal with the encounter ?
White House press secretary Jay Carney was unequivocal : "" It 's my personal opinion that she handled it brilliantly . ""
And that 's his personal opinion .
He 's not just saying that because he thinks it would be politic .
My personal opinion is that she coped with it badly .
Audiences are nervous creatures .
They 're apt to worry about the performers they 're watching .
If a performer wants them to listen , laugh , be moved , agree or clap , his priority must be minimising their fretting by radiating confidence and comfort .
Betraying genuine anger , distress or alarm is the worst thing you can do .
It wo n't necessarily make the audience dislike you â€ “
but it will make them fear for you , which is worse .
So , when heckled , it 's important to seem calm .
If you can think of a zinger put - down , great â€ “
but you do n't need one .
Your greater visibility and audibility will easily carry the day as long as you do n't let the crowd think you 've been rattled .
But saying you 're not good at dealing with heckles , vacating the performing space and then offering to cede the microphone to the heckler if the audience does n't beg you to stay is a terrible response .
It 's like when someone starts telling a story and then stops crossly because they think no one 's listening .
Social convention forces the group to beg them to continue , but the anecdote can then only be received with feigned relish .
Of course the Democrat donors , excited to meet the first lady , called on her to continue , but the atmosphere will have been awkward thereafter .
The fact that , as the president 's wife , anything Michelle Obama says must be free from all but the most uncontroversial sentiments would be enough to make Nicholas Parsons fall out of love with the sound of his own voice .
Still , she does n't strike me as a natural performer .
She 's been thrust unwillingly into the limelight , given a platform she did n't want so that , when someone tries to hijack it , her reaction is : "" Fine , take it â€
“
I 'm not here for my health .
"" The flaws in her performance technique are glaring but , for a public figure , her attitude is more unusual and refreshing than anything she 'll ever be allowed to say .

2013-07-02,"Their husbands could hardly be described as political soulmates , but when Michelle Obama and Laura Bush shared a platform in Tanzania on Tuesday , they proved quite a double act .
Speaking at an African first ladies summit , the pair reflected on how the media sometimes prefer to focus on style rather than substance .
"" People are sort of sorting through our shoes and our hair , whether we cut it or not ... "" Obama started .
"" Whether we have bangs , "" Bush interjected to laughter , alluding to coverage of the cuurent first lady 's change of hairstyle . ""
But , "" Obama resumed , "" we take our bangs and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see .
And eventually people stop looking at the bangs and they start looking at what we 're standing in front of . ""
"" We hope , "" Bush joked .
The event , organised in Tanzania by the George W Bush Institute , coincided with the last day of Barack and Michelle Obama 's three - country tour of Africa .
The participants included first ladies from across the continent as well as Cherie Blair .
Laura Bush said : "" We all know what it is like to have your husband be president ...
we first ladies have a lot of things we can talk about together , that no one else really will understand .
"" Ways to protect our children , how to make life easier when your husband is being criticised , or whatever , you know what the issues of today are . ""
Bush emphasised the importance of education for girls and women , enabling them to protect themselves and their families and to participate in environmental leadership .
George Bush was also in the country .
Initially there had been no plans for him to meet his successor but this was hastily amended , prompting Michelle Obama to joke to Laura Bush : "" They 're learning from us .
"" It is believed to be the first time two US presidents have been in an African country at the same time .
Ben Rhodes , Obama 's deputy national security adviser , said this sent "" a very positive message that both political parties in the United States share a commitment to this continent "" .
Barack Obama praised George Bush for helping save millions of lives by funding Aids treatment .
Obama has since cut funding but insisted the decrease has not damaged the programme because costs have been saved that make it "" more efficient "" .
Obama promoted what he called a "" new model "" for Africa based not just on aid and assistance but trade . ""
Ultimately , the goal here is for Africa to build Africa for Africans , "" he said .
"" And our job is to be a partner in that process . ""
Around Dar es Salaam , business , restaurants and pubs closed while people crammed high buildings to get a glimpse of America 's first black president .
The two presidents observed a moment of silence together at a monument to victims of the 1998 US embassy bombing masterminded by Osama bin Laden .
Obama and Bush bowed their heads as a marine placed a wreath of red , white and blue flowers in front of the large stone memorial in the grounds of the new embassy .
They shook hands with survivors of the attack and relatives of those killed ."
2013-08-08,"Unless you have been living under a rock â€ “ or at least away from Twitter â€ “ for the past 24 hours , you will already know that BeyoncÃ © Knowles has cut her hair .
Debuting the short , gamine cut with a series of backstage shots on Instagram yesterday afternoon , the star 's barnet is now trending on Twitter â€ “ with everyone from Wiz Khalifa to Choupette ( that 's Karl Lagerfeld 's cat ) weighing in on the debate .
Not since Michelle Obama and Kate Middleton experimented with bangs earlier this year has there been such tonsorial furore .
BeyoncÃ © 's cut is drastic â€ “ going from long blonde waves to a pixie cut â€ “
but it looks chic and grownup .
The reaction ?
Largely positive .
The message ?
BeyoncÃ © is still queen .
Rihanna debuted her new shorter cut last week
but it felt like just another style the singer is experimenting with .
BeyoncÃ © 's long hair , on the other hand , has been a pretty consistent part of her image .
Changing it is major news â€ “ as the Twitter response demonstrates ."
2013-08-13,"It 's impossible to get the dastardly youth of today to listen to us grown - ups , what with the constant distractions of texting , Candy Crush , Miley Cyrus videos , Twitter , Snoopify apps and a general hatred for authority and discipline .
So to tackle this lack of connection , Michelle Obama has announced that she will release a 19-song rap album in September to help motivate kids into healthy eating .
As part of her anti - obesity program Let 's Move ! , the First Lady has followed in Beyonce 's footsteps and is using music to promote a positive message .
She has enlisted the likes of Jordin Sparks , Ashanti and Run DMC and an array of hip - hop and R&amp;B artists who will sing and rap about eating properly .
While Michelle will be in the videos , she unfortunately wo n't sing on any of the tracks ( let 's leave that to her husband ) .
Everybody , which can be seen below , features Jordin Sparks and Dr Oz as well as a speech from Mrs Obama , kids eating apples , buff guys doing press - ups and the elated chorus : "" Everybody tell somebody , it 's your body .
Come on ! ""
Politico reported that there will be 10 music videos to accompany the album , which will be distributed to New York schools before hitting other major cities .
The 19-track album â€ “ which includes song titles such as U R
What You Eat and Veggie Luv
â€ “ is being released by the Partnership for a Healthier America , an independent group in conjunction with Let 's Move!. Will this rap album spread the message of healthy living ?
And more importantly , what rappers would you like to see preaching about a positive diet ?
Snoop does soup ?
Lil '
Kim loves pumpkin ?
Kanye Cress ?
Jay - Pea ?

2013-08-19,"Now that Michelle Obama is a rapper , will her famous wardrobe have to change ?
Mary Beth , by email
My God , last week was a veritable bumper crop of exciting cultural stories .
Number one , of course , was the news that Cecilia Gimenez â€ “ who once helpfully painted over a fresco of Jesus and turned him into a hedgehog
â€ “ is now holding an exhibition in Spain "" of her work "" .
It 's only on until 24 August , so I 'm afraid this column will be even more slapdash than usual because I have a plane to Spain to catch .
Nothing can come between me and my culture , you know .
But second , certainly , was news that Michelle Obama is releasing a hip - hop album about healthy eating called Songs for a Healthier America , which is funny because that was Public Enemy 's second choice for their album , It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back .
Personally , I 'm amazed that music journalists were even wasting a minute thinking about tedious Lady Gaga and dullsville Katy Perry last week , when clearly the music news of the year was breaking all around them .
But that 's the thing about music journalists , you know .
They spend all their time shoegazing and fretting about which record label is coolest so they do n't notice when actual works of genius are laid at their doorstep .
I 've seen Amadeus .
I know how musical brilliance is always ignored in its own time .
Now , I adore Michelle Obama and I am utterly besotted with her style , which is , contrary to what certain downmarket tabloids in this country have claimed , just a million times more fun than anything

e Middleton has ever worn in her life .
Unlike any president 's wife in the history of presidents , Michelle looks as if she dresses not to look "" appropriate "" , not to look "" political "" , not to look "" mature "" , but for her own damn self , and if that means wearing jewel - bright colours and pretty dresses and coats , then all the better . ""
Dressing for pleasure "" and "" fun fashion "" get a bad rap , especially for women in their middle age , as it is generally assumed that this is a euphemism for women dressing like clowns and not realising that , at their age ( huff , huff ) , they should be wearing beige cashmere .
Well , first of all , beige cashmere is dull â€ “ leave that to the ladies who lunch and shop at Michael Kors in uptown Manhattan .
Second , there is no age limit to having fun in fashion and a woman should n't retire her pink clothes once she passes her 35th birthday .
Of all the great things Michelle has done in her life , and there have been many
, her greatest contribution to fashion has been to show that a nearly 50-year - old woman can have as much fun with fashion as she likes , and she will look damn fabulous to boot .
Having said all that , it is true that 50s - style dresses are not the usual wardrobe choice for a hip - hop mogul .
But then , few would have once thought giant Elizabethan ballgowns and hot - pink hair were what a female hip - hop artist should wear , yet I have seen Nicki Minaj doing precisely that , so fashion codes are a flexible affair in the crazy hazy world of hip - hop .
But perhaps you noticed that I referred to Michelle as a hip - hop mogul , as opposed to an artist herself .
This is because Michelle , tragically , does n't actually rap on this album but instead chose â€ “ or , to use the modern word , "" curated "" â€ “ artists she would like to be on her album , such as Ashanti and â€
“ thrillingly
â€ “ Run - DMC .
Some snarky internet types have , inevitably , thrown a little shade Michelle 's way about this venture .
"" Michelle 's Rap Album is Kind of Embarrassing , "" snarled the Daily Beast .
What , more embarrassing than being edited by a woman who claimed that the Duchess of Cambridge did the "" perfect "" thing by giving birth to a boy
and it proved she can "" do no wrong "" ?
More embarrassing than that , Daily Beast ?
In any event , these snarkers are missing the point .
As Michelle has repeatedly proven , she can take the most seemingly naff things and render them totally awesome .
Evidence number one : mom dancing .
Evidence number two : dancing on The Ellen Show .
Evidence number three
: um , that 's it ( everything else Michelle does is awesome ) .
Furthermore , some people seem to think that hip - hop is supposed to be a serious thing and treating it humorously is sacrilege .
Well , maybe it 's because my first rap album was the Fresh Prince and
Jazzy Jeff 's
He 's the DJ , I 'm the Rapper , but I 've never had any prejudice against comedy hip - hop .
If people are really honest with themselves , The Lonely Island albums are a million times better than anything Jay Z 's done in years , and everyone knows that the best song on Jay Z and Kanye West 's Watch the Throne is Niggas in Paris , mainly because it mixes in quotes from Blades of Glory .
So in short , what I 'm saying is : comedy hip - hop is great , Michelle Obama , who should n't alter a thing , is total awesomeness , and if she is going to be the Suge Knight for the 2010s , then the world will only be richer for it .
Michelle ?

2013-09-27,"To the list of ambitious names hoping to make an impact at the Conservative party conference , add a few more : those of LK Bennett , Reiss and Jigsaw .
The past five years have seen a startling surge of interest in the clothes worn by female politicians and the wives of male politicians , driven in part by the stardust around the stylish and daring wardrobe of Michelle Obama .
The phenomenon is at its height during party conference season , when speeches and staged family photocalls are now seen as fair game for fashion critique .
For a certain type of fashion label
â€ “ smart but not showy ; age - appropriate for the working fortysomething woman ; carefully shaped for enough vim to work on camera but never too short , tight or revealing â€ “ party conference season has become a catwalk .
Stores that have little hope of dressing Cara Delevingne for a night at The Box have found more modestly lucrative mannequins in Samantha Cameron and her fellow women in the political class , as they smile for their windswept annual autumn photocalls .
LK Bennett , long best known as a destination for pretty - but - practical shoes , is the name to watch this conference season .
Justine Miliband chose a Â£245 LK Bennett dress to watch the leader 's speech at the Labour conference on Tuesday .
She acknowledged in advance her choice would be scrutinised , telling a Young Labour meeting that "" If I do n't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you 'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I wear for Ed 's speech "" .
A spokesman for LK Bennett confirmed on Thursday that the brand has been chosen by a number of both politicians and politicians ' wives including Samantha Cameron , Sarah Brown , Theresa May and Justine Miliband .
The Miliband dress , which had been available in all sizes at the beginning of the week , is now either sold out or close to sold out in most sizes , according to the company website .
The exposure could hardly come at a more useful moment for LK Bennett , whose owners are looking for a buyer willing to pay about Â£100 million for the business .
The company began as a single shoe store in Wimbledon , opened by Linda Kristin Bennett .
Since Bennett sold 70 % of the brand to private equity groups in 2007 , it has raised its sights .
Innovations have included a more upscale Black Ribbon range , and alignments with fashionable women such as actress Rosamund Pike , who has designed handbags and starred in an advertising campaign , and fashion industry face Caroline Issa , who designed a range of shoes .
But doubtless the most significant factor in the rise of LK Bennett , which saw a spike in profits to Â£9.3 million in the year to July 2012 , has been the patronage of the Duchess of Cambridge , who is frequently photographed in the brand 's beige Sledge platform courts and wore a teal dress and matching jacket by the label for the first day of the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee celebrations .
Her endorsements make it a safe choice for women in the political arena , who are aiming not to set trends but to win approval ratings .
Samantha Cameron has learned from experience that her outfits at party conference will be appraised by a public who care more about the price tag of an outfit than they do about its patriotic intent .
Since being criticised for wearing a Â£749 Paul Smith dress for her first conference as the prime minister 's wife in 2010 , Cameron has been careful to choose high street or mid - market labels for subsequent conference appearances .
Reiss and Jigsaw , whose clothes are neither offputtingly expensive nor so cheap as to raise questions about the factories in which they were made , have become Cameron favourites .
During the 2011 conference she was photographed in a Â£75 top from Whistles with a skirt from a suit she had worn several times before worn with shoes from LK Bennett , and on several occasions in a pair of Â£39.99 trousers from Zara .
Last autumn , she wore a Â£345 blue dress from Joseph â€ “ and , once again , grey LK Bennett shoes .
However , the price tag can tell only half the story .
At the 2009 Conservative conference she was widely applauded for an M&amp;S dress that cost only Â£65 .
It was later revealed , it had sold out and had been made bespoke ."
2013-10-08,"It may be a giant American retailer favoured by Michelle Obama , but J Crew , will be sliding discreetly into Britain this week with a small menswear shop in Bloomsbury , central London .
The shop , selling suits and shirts , will be nestled among the hip men 's fashion and home furnishings stores , mostly independently owned , on Lambs Conduit Street .
"" We just loved the street , it 's like a stage set , "" said Mickey Drexler , J Crew 's chairman .
"" We are trying not to do the big US company coming to London .
We want to be low - key . ""
The menswear shop precedes the opening of a flagship store on Regent Street due to open in early November , while a boutique womenswear outlet will open in Brompton Cross , west London .
He said the stores were intended to build awareness for the brand 's existing UK online store and no further outlets had been signed to date .
"" We are seeing how it goes .
There is a lot of demand there from what we feel and see in online business , "" Drexler said .
He admitted he was looking forward to opening the small "" fun "" stores after a difficult year for fashion retailers . ""
No one says it 's tough , but it 's tough , "" he said ."

2013-11-01,"There was a hopefully forgotten moment in the Bosch - like churn of the 2012 presidential campaign when rumors were circulating that Donald Trump had documents showing Michelle Obama and Barack Obama had filed for divorce .
That was ripe baloney .
But it turns out that the president had considered dumping his other No 2 .
The Obama re - election team convened focus groups and conducted polls to figure out whether they should replace vice - president Joe Biden with then - secretary of state Hillary Clinton , according to a new book by a pair of insider Washington journalists , Mark Halperin and John Heilemann .
The numbers did n't add up , however , and Biden stayed on .
â€œWhen the research came back near the end of the year , it suggested that adding Clinton to the ticket wouldnâ€ ™ t materially improve Obamaâ€ ™ s odds , â€ � the authors write in Double Down , their follow up to Game Change , the smash - hit history of the Sarah Palin days .
An excerpt of the new book was first obtained by the New York Times .
Former White House chief of staff Bill Daley admitted Friday that he had supported efforts to figure out whether it wouldnâ€ ™ t be better to jettison Joe .
"" Lots of issues in 2011 were looked at , "" Daley told CBS News . ""
And it was looked at .
But it was never seriously looked at in the sense that there was a belief that it ought to be done or needed to be done , and the truth is that any research that was done confirmed the fact that it was not an issue voters cared about or thought should be done . ""
Senior adviser David Plouffe tweeted Thursday evening that whatever the campaign was up to , the vice - president never enjoyed anything less than the president 's full confidence . ""
Never any â€ “ any â€ “ consideration of VP / HRC switch , "" Plouffe wrote .
"" Not even entertained by the only person who mattered .
Or most of us .
Back to Halloween .
"" Biden has not commented on the revelation .
His tenure has been defined by a close working relationship with the president , occasional slips of tongue and lapses of co - ordination notwithstanding .
Reports that the vice - president might be replaced circulated in the media as late as May 2012 , but the move was seen by sharp minds as unlikely .
Double Down contains other salient tidbits for close watchers of Washington .
For example the source behind Senate leader Harry Reid 's assertion that Republican candidate Mitt Romney had not paid 10 years of taxes turns out to have been Jon Huntsman Sr , whose namesake son ran a short - lived presidential campaign .
The tax charge was potent because Romney refused â€ “ through election day â€ “ to reveal how much he 'd paid and how much heâ€ ™ d hid .
The elder Huntsman denied at the time that he was Reid 's source .
( The Romneys and Huntsmans are towers of the Mormon church .
Reid is a Mormon convert . )
The bonbons of campaign secrets are being shared out as part of a pre - publication PR blitz for the title , which is put out by Penguin ."
2013-11-26,"I am not even sure where to start to respond to Michelle Cottle 's recent Politico article in which she calls first lady Michelle Obama a "" feminist 's nightmare "" .
Cottle suggests that Obama is underplaying her position of power and letting "" feminists "" down .
Do I begin with the implicit narrow definition of feminism , touted by the writer and those she quotes ?
Or do I begin with the equally simplistic understanding of activism and political action inherent in the criticisms .
What these so called feminists fail to see is that Michelle Obama is a social and political activist working passionately in arenas commonly ignored by white politicians and white feminists : the needs of the children and youth raised in low - income communities , including equal access and availability to health and nutritional education .
Focusing on obesity and exercise for young people is not only a needed form of social activism to help predominately minority youth break cyclic issues of health , education and low self - esteem , but it also shows foresight and wisdom towards creating and sustaining healthier communities overall .
These same young people who "" feminists "" criticize the first lady for spending so much time and energy on will grow up to be the next generation of adults making an impact in the ongoing development of this country .
Michelle Obama is using her role as a woman of power in the highest office in the country to educate , inform , raise and expand the imagination of children and youth .
How is that not social activism and political strategy of the most essential order ?
Beyond disagreeing with Cottle about the significance of the first lady 's work , I also do not adhere to Linda Hirshman 's and the article 's other quoted feminists ' needlepoint perspectives of what feminism is or what feminists can or can not do .
Why does Michelle Obama 's choosing ( especially as an African American woman ) to invest in the future of children â€ “ hers and others '
â€ “ have to equate to a blow to feminist projects ?
It is both shameful and contradictory to the very nature of feminism itself that Cottle 's article reads like the scene from a schoolyard bullying attempt , trying to get the alarmingly confident and focused new kid to conform to the arbitrary rules that determine who is "" in "" and who is "" out "" .
A true feminist , like any individual who asserts justice and equality for all without discrimination , not only recognizes her innate rights to equal access and treatment , but also seeks to use those rights to ensure a more just future for all who are marginalized Michelle Obama , is using her power and place to reach some of the nations most vulnerable .
In her Democratic National Convention speech ( to which Cottle refers negatively ) , Michelle Obama says of her husband : And he reminds me that we are playing a long game here
â€
¦
and that change is hard , and change is slow , and it never happens all at once .
The first lady 's passion for childhood and youth health and education seems to be representative of that wise counsel .
Do these "" feminist "" critics have any idea how important the first lady 's work is for underprivileged communities , most of whom are African American ?
Since becoming first lady , Michelle Obama has pursued a diverse range of activities and initiatives to bring about the vital work of getting children and youth to believe in and work towards a better future for themselves , and effectively , for their communities .
Everything from her anti - childhood obesity initiative to her recent focus on ensuring more low income youth go to college is proof that Michelle Obama is leaning in and leveraging her power .
But apparently the first lady 's just not leaning enough towards the agenda of upper middle class , predominately white , so - called "" feminists "" .
Despite being a strong , independent , accomplished and ambitious woman in power , Michelle Obama is leaning in for the benefit of those who her critics would likely just ignore ."

2013-12-13,"Over the years , BeyoncÃ © has been soundly criticized for not being feminist enough .
There are a number of pieces decrying her attire and her concert tour titles .
There are even open letters "" from "" Blue Ivy and Michelle Obama making it clear that good parents do n't let their kids adore BeyoncÃ © .
Yet , BeyoncÃ © seemingly has it all .
A career , family , and a lifestyle that many envy , and many more hope to emulate .
She employs more women than any other artist in the industry , and she owns her sexuality in ways that many sex - positive feminists celebrate in other women .
So , what exactly is she doing that is n't feminist ?
Is it the fact that she sings largely about relationships ?
Is it her willingness to embrace her sexuality and use it as part of her career ?
Or is it the fact that she revels in the happiness she has found in marriage and motherhood ?
What , exactly , is BeyoncÃ © supposed to do that will appease everyone , yet still allow free will ?
Her new album might as well be titled "" Having it all , the Beyonce way "" .
In Flawless ( a track that leaked as Bow Down over the summer ) , BeyoncÃ © quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 's TedX talk "" We should all be feminists "" , adroitly addressing the idea that she is somehow anti - feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her .
It 's clear that like a lot of black American women , the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar are n't necessarily compatible with BeyoncÃ © 's view of herself .
This album makes it clear that her feminism is n't academic ; is n't about waves , or labels .
It simply is a part of her as much as anything else in her life .
She 's pro - woman without being anti - man , and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions , friendships or fun .
Is it a message that will appeal to everyone ?
No .
But then , no one expects any other feminist message to be unilaterally accepted , do they ?
There 's a reason the narrative that appeals to BeyoncÃ
© and so many others is one that draws attention to the reality that being a feminist is more than toeing some imaginary line to please others .
It is working inside and outside your community to achieve your goals , and still being able to connect with the people you love in ways that are good for all of you .
BeyoncÃ © is a hardworking career woman , a happily married spouse to a powerful partner , and a loving mother in a climate that tells her that she can be one of those things , maybe two , but certainly not all three .
Yet , she is doing all of those things , and so her focus is on navigating the mundane aspects of life as a complete complex person .
In a movement that touts the idea of choice , you do n't have to agree with someone 's choices to respect them or their right to make them .
Feminism has never been one size fits all , yet much of the criticism that revolves around entertainers like BeyoncÃ © ( or corporate leaders like Sheryl Sandberg ) presumes that there is a unilateral guide on how to be the "" right "" kind of feminist .
As we talk about rebranding feminism , about solidarity in feminist circles , even about what issues are feminist , we must remember that the movement seeks to represent people .
And it must recognize that individuals will have different needs , wants , and routes to achieving their goals .
BeyoncÃ © 's critique of mainstream feminism may be musical , but it is still incisive , valid , and incredibly cogent right now .
It 's a lyrical explanation of what 's wrong with assuming that being feminist requires one to follow a script , and not your own heart .
It appeals deeply to the kind of people that express discomfort with the label of feminist while leading lives that are exactly what feminism proclaims women should be able to enjoy .
If a CEO 's guide to career success can be feminist , then so can an album , a tour , or the daily life of someone who 's achievements will only matter to their family .
If Miley 's owning her sexuality via appropriation of black women 's bodies is feminist , then what is BeyoncÃ © 's ownership of her own image ?
When we decide that a woman 's personal life ( however public ) is subject to censure because her choices are not our choices , how feminist are we ?
When we decide that race , class , or life experiences should n't matter as much as outside opinions , what message are we sending ?
Feminism is meant to be inclusive .
That means not just paying lip service to intersectional analysis , but also embracing the reality that feminist choices vary based on those factors that we do n't all share ."

2014-01-17,"It 's clear where America 's First Lady falls on the aging spectrum : she 's decided to embrace it , declaring herself "" 50 and fabulous "" , which means that yoga 's now a regular part of her whole "" Let 's Move "" thing ( the better to keep those joints lubricated ) , and she is n't going to rule out Botox , because after clocking in five decades , she 's learned one should "" never say never "" .
Presumably un - Botoxed for now , Michelle Obama turns 50 today , and she 'll be suitably feted with a blow - out bash , while the media ties itself into knots dissecting the meaning of it all .
( Present company included . )
We 're living in the age of the cougar , and crossing the half - century mark is allegedly perfectly acceptable these days , as long as you look really , really good while doing it â€ “
and you 're not looking for a job .
Personally , I 've always hated the a - word . ""
Aging "" sounds so judge - y , like some scandalous something you got caught doing with your pants down .
Google "" celebrities and aging "" , and you 'll find that when it comes to getting older , you 're either winning !
( "" 10 Age - Defying Celebrities "" ) or failing miserably
( "" Celebrities
Who Have Aged The Worst "" ) .
But when did this get to be a competition ?
We 're all aging , every last one of us .
Even babies do it , from the minute they pop out the womb .
I blame the whole obsession with defying the ravages of time on Baby Boomers .
I 'm pretty sure ( judging from when she went into practice )
the doctor who pioneered the use of Botox to erase wrinkles is a Boomer .
As I see it , Boomers are more in denial about aging .
It 's as if these denizens of the most powerful youth culture ever were caught off guard when time finally caught up with them .
They spent so much time fighting the powers that be that they 're taking the duel to mortality , too .
It 's projected that Boomers will be responsible for pushing spending on anti - aging products past the $ 114bn mark by 2015 .
( Still , as a good friend , pointed out , we all reap the benefits of the Boomer 's fighting attitude , though .
Anti - aging serum would not exist without them . )
Of course , no amount of pushups or Pilates or copious consumption of kale is going to stave off the inevitable .
Sag happens .
Black might not crack , but it sure does droop .
And sprout stretch marks .
I was born the same week as the president , sandwiched somewhere in between the real Boomers and Gen Xers .
Those of us born in the ' 60s are a generation within a generation , integration babies who grew up having sleep overs with kids of all colors .
In high school and college , we passed bongs around an integrated circle while jamming to Prince , the Police , Parliament Funkadelic and nascent rap .
The real Boomers â€ “ those born in the ' 40s and ' 50s
â€ “ were always the ones doing the world - changing things .
They got to go to Woodstock , to fight in the Vietnam War or to fight against it , to greet the Beatles at Yankee Stadium with piercing shrieks , to grow massive ' fros and raise clenched fists , shouting , "" Black Power ! ""
We got Jherri Curls and Ronald Reagan .
The New York Times calls us "" Boomer Reboots "" ; others call us "" Generation Great Jones "" .
( Whatever that means . )
Whatever you want to call us , we were the ones who watched everything from a distance , on TV .
In our jammies .
We were always dealing with the aftermath of the Boomers scorched - earth approach .
We 're a lot more wary , a lot less breathless in our battles .
I warrant that we approach our own incipient decrepitude the same way .
Early on , I lost a number of close friends to plane crashes and car accidents and suicide and AIDS , attending a litany of funerals and memorial services before I hit 30 .
So I 'm intensely aware that aging is something that happens only to the fortunate .
I figure you might as well have fun with it .
Like the First Lady , I wo n't pretend that I 'll never contemplate Botox ( although : ew , gross ) .
But I 'm aiming for vital living , rather than a frozen face .
So I plan to be a backbending nonagenarian .
If I have any say in the matter , I 'll still be showing up every am at the crack of dawn for Mysore - Style ashtanga yoga class , long after I 've lost the battle with gravity .
Maybe Mrs O will join me in class one day ."
2014-01-21,"The fortunes of Michelle Obama and ValÃ © rie Trierweiler , arguably the world 's most high - profile first ladies , contrasted sharply last weekend .
While the grandly abbreviated Flotus ( first lady of the United States ) celebrated her 50th birthday with a White House party , France 's de facto premiÃ¨re dame checked out of hospital .
She had spent eight nights under medical supervision after learning that her partner , President FranÃ§ois Hollande , was having an affair with an actor .
The relative attractiveness of any job is best measured when times are bad , and right now times are very bad indeed for Trierweiler .
As Michelle Obama enjoys fluffy tributes from the great and good of American society for her support of Barack Obama , her French counterpart is effectively pleading to stay with Hollande .
Aides to the Socialist president have indicated that he wants to make his lover Julie Gayet the new first lady .
Hollande said he will "" clarify "" his position before a trip to Washington DC to stay with the Obamas in February .
He spent just half an hour with Trierweiler during her entire stay at the PitiÃ © -SalpÃªtriÃ¨re hospital in Paris , and is said to be "" managing "" her unhappiness as a political , rather than emotional , problem .
Beyond Hollande 's capacity for cruelty , the crisis in the French presidency says everything about the abject feebleness of the first lady concept .
At a time when a glowing media image has never been more important for world leaders , many of their unelected consorts still knock about the corridors of power , and indeed the international stage , with an alarming lack of direction .
Even Michelle Obama , who trained as a lawyer , had no hope of practising on taking up the role .
Now her main job is as "" hostess of the White House "" , allowing her to invite stars such as BeyoncÃ © to her bashes , as she did last Saturday .
Yes , Flotus has an office and a press secretary , but she has no salary and the majority of her tasks are decidedly shallow .
As throughout history , first ladies around the world are largely required to be presentable escorts when called upon , and to make their husbands look good .
Michelle Obama has tried to make a difference , mainly through campaigns about obesity and other social ills .
But it is as a winner of "" best dressed "" and "" most inspiring "" awards that she remains well - known .
In this sense , popular perceptions of what a modern first lady does are sexist and trite .
Michelle dances , she sings , she cries in appropriate situations and she is a close confidante of Oprah Winfrey .
Thus highly educated , talented women such as her are effectively told to suspend their careers to become state - sponsored ladies who lunch .
David Cameron 's wife , Samantha , is not an official first lady
â€
“ British heads of state are royals â€ “ but when her husband became prime minister , she left her job as a creative designer to adopt part - time roles , mainly for charities and fashion organisations .
As far as Mrs Cameron 's potential influence as a dynamic prime ministerial partner is concerned , forget it .
It is getting to the stage where people do not even know what her voice sounds like .
The once much - vaunted "" Sam Cam "" brand has never taken off , leaving Mrs Cameron as a bizarrely hollow public figure .
In this respect , she has become a female version of German chancellor Angela Merkel 's husband , the scientist Joachim Sauer , who is known as the "" phantom "" because of his ghostly lack of presence ( on the subject of pervading sexism , it is noticeable that Sauer is never referred to as the "" first man "" ) .
He stayed at home to watch Merkel 's inauguration on TV .
Because of his gender , he is not expected to entertain or smile sweetly .
Germany 's actual first lady , presidential partner Daniela Schadt , is by no means a household name either .
Schadt is , like Trierweiler , unmarried .
While many social conservatives point to this single status as being a huge disadvantage in itself , in France it merely highlights the pervading misogyny of the political establishment .
Gallic leaders since Napoleon have traditionally kept lovers hovering in antechambers , to the extent that they are interchangeable with spouses .
FranÃ§ois Mitterrand , France 's most famously monarchical socialist president , kept a family hidden at the taxpayers ' expense .
Even now , Hollande is using disingenuous references to "" privacy "" to cover up what looks like a callous treatment of his girlfriends .
These have included not just Trierwiler but also SÃ © golÃ¨ne Royal , the mother of his four children who was dumped while running to become head of state herself in 2007 .
Gayet will certainly not come out of the quasi - feudal presidential courting system unscathed either .
Trierweiler always claimed that she would not become a presidential "" wallflower "" .
If , as expected , she is kicked out of the Ã‰lysÃ © e in the coming days , she will get no compensation .
The role of premiÃ¨re dame comes with five clerical staff costing around Â£17,000 a month , but everything else is down to the bon vouloir of the president .
Pointedly , Hollande stressed last week that the role was an "" unofficial one "" with "" more to do with tradition "" than anything else .
Senior colleagues even called for it to be scrapped .
First ladies have no financial security , nor guaranteed tenure .
Their ill - defined , awkward job may be temporarily perk - rich , but it ultimately leaves the incumbent in a fragile position .
Trierweiler 's slow exit from presidential life has been brutally humiliating .
The sole consolation for a female journalist who has held on to her job at Paris Match might be a tell - all autobiography .
It will be grim , but it will at least make clear that the job of ex - first lady is invariably more fulfilling and lucrative than the real thing ."
2014-02-28,"Their grumbling was sotto voce and neither lobbyist wanted to go on the record , but four years after Michelle Obama began her fight against America 's obesity epidemic , her increasingly activist campaign is clearly beginning to get under the skin of the US food industry .
The two corporate executives were sitting in the East Room of the White House watching the first lady unveil the most radical overhaul of nutritional labels in 20 years and could be overheard comparing two versions : one which emphasised even more than the other just how unhealthy processed food can be .
"" What do you think ? ""
asked the first exec , glumly .
"" We like one better than the other , that 's for sure , "" replied the second , complaining that her company had received little advance warning of the proposed changes .
"" I am getting my head of regulation to run through it all now . ""
The decision for Obama to front the new rules marks a rare venture into policy - making , but the first lady made clear she was not going to let the niceties of consultation periods and stakeholder dialogue stand in her way .
"" I know there will be many opinions on what this label should look like , but I think that we all can agree that families deserve more and better information about the food they eat , "" she told the East Room audience .
"" It 's important to note that no matter what the final version looks like , the new label will allow you to immediately spot the calorie count because it will be in large font , and not buried in the fine print . ""
The increasingly strident tone has not gone unnoticed among conservative opponents , where even her early efforts to focus on positive alternatives such as exercise and healthy eating drew scorn .
"" Why would you want to raise your own kids when Michelle Obama will do it for you ? ""
columnist Tucker Carlson asked on Fox News when she first launched the Let 's Move campaign .
Rush Limbaugh called her "" the nutritionist at large "" , busy "" demanding that everybody basically eat cardboard and tofu "" .
There is no doubt that Let 's Move has a messianic side .
During an event later that day to promote exercise at a daycare centre in Maryland , Obama was greeted by a fitness instructor who had just accidentally punched a hole in the ceiling in his enthusiasm to rally a class of four- and five - year - olds .
Trying to get a bewildered class to eat celery sticks and hummus for the cameras stretched the persuasive powers of even a charismatic mother of teenage daughters .
But while the passion seems at risk of draining from her husband 's second term , Michelle Obama seems to be revelling in an enlarged policy role that showcases both the fiery side of her character and an enviable ability to bust dance moves .
Flanked by actors dressed as "" vegetable superheroes "" Brian Broccoli , Erica Eggplant and Colby Carrot , the first lady took part in 20 minutes of energetic exercise routines in front of a small group of photographers on Thursday .
Not even the wit of a media - savvy toddler could dent the infectious energy of the room .
""
Do you know why I am here ?
"" asked Obama . ""
To take some pictures , "" shot back one of the girls .
Her blizzard of TV appearances is also threatening to upstage her husband this month , including one interview carried out by president George W Bush 's daughter Jenna for the Today show .
During its fourth anniversary week , the first lady 's Let 's Move campaign is drawing particular energy from recent public health data showing a 43 % fall in obesity levels among two- to five - year - olds compared with a decade ago .
Although experts are uncertain of the exact causes , the progress follows a period after the 1970s when childhood obesity trebled in the US .
The campaign hopes to help prevent adult obesity levels hitting 50 % by 2020 if other trends continue .
The administration 's health and human services secretary , Kathleen Sebelius , says the data is a "" sign that our efforts are beginning to work "" , but Obama is more cautious .
"" We are starting to see some changes
but we are nowhere near the end of this road , "" she says .
Instead , Obama makes it clear that her target is not just persuading consumers but rolling back the power of large food corporations .
"" Our kids see thousands of food ads for products loaded with sugar , fat and salt and see on average just one ad a week for healthy products like water , fruit and vegetables , "" she points out .
"" This is n't a particularly radical idea ; in fact , it seems pretty obvious .
But the truth is that too often , it 's nearly impossible to get the most basic facts about the food we buy for our families . ""
A personal fight of this magnitude and energy looks like it could continue even beyond her second term in the White House .
In a week when her husband has outlined plans to campaign for educational opportunities for young African - Americans when he leaves office and vice - president Joe Biden has hinted at running against Hillary Clinton for a presidential nomination in 2016 , the current first lady is beginning to display future campaigning potential of her own ."
2014-03-18,"They share plenty of common ground , even beyond the stylish outfits and the proximity to power .
Both grew up in modest circumstances , and both have daughters .
They 're nearly the same age .
Yet when Michelle Obama , 50 , arrives in China on Thursday to meet her 51-year - old Chinese counterpart Peng Liyuan , the two will also make a fascinating study in contrasts .
If Obama 's narrative is one of resilience , Peng 's is one of restraint .
While Obama 's celebrity is a time - honoured tradition , Peng 's is an uncomfortable experiment , a near - unprecedented PR move by a notoriously stern - faced regime .
Obama will arrive in Beijing with her daughters Sasha and Malia , and her mother Marian Robinson , for a week of sightseeing and speeches about people - to - people exchange .
Peng will accompany her during a visit to a Beijing school , a dinner and a performance .
Obama will address American and Chinese students at the prestigious Peking University and then head south for a whirlwind tour through the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu .
When Obama 's predecessors Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited China during their husbands ' tenures , they grilled its leadership on difficult political topics such as human rights .
Obama plans to focus on education and cultural exchange , Ben Rhodes , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , told reporters on Monday .
Yet Obama 's personal narrative â€ “ one of "" someone [ from ] a disadvantaged economic background from a minority group "" making it to the top â€ “ would send a powerful message on its own , Rhodes said .
""
That alone I think speaks to things like respect for human rights that are interwoven into the DNA of the US . ""
Peng scaled the heights of fame long before her husband , President Xi Jinping .
She spent two decades as a nationally renowned folksinger , known for belting out patriotic tunes on elaborate television specials .
She began to dodge the limelight in 2007 , to give precedence to Xi 's political career .
Last March , Peng sent shockwaves through Chinese social media when she appeared with Xi in Moscow wearing a sharp trench coat and handbag .
One fan â€ “ a 34-year - old woman named Li who started a popular Peng Liyuan fan group online â€ “
described her hero as humble , friendly , and glamorous . ""
Her influence means far more now than it could if she was just a singer , "" she said .
"" She gives our people face â€ “ and she not only has traditional beauty , but also international charm . ""
Yet the Chinese authorities have kept a firm grip on the conversation .
Censors restricted discussion of Peng 's fashion choices , apparently to avoid the emergence of a personality cult , or to prevent her from overshadowing her husband .
Last year , a photograph of a young , uniform - wearing Peng singing to troops in Tiananmen Square in the wake of the 1989 massacre began to crop up on social media sites .
Censors immediately scrubbed them clean .
While Sasha and Malia Obama frequently appear in the US press , Peng 's 21-year - old daughter Xi Mingze , who pseudonymously enrolled at Harvard University in 2010 , is shrouded in a cloak of official secrecy .
Even the notoriously prying Mail on Sunday was unable to discover much about her in a 2012 profile â€ “
"" she 's a bookworm , very quiet and studious "" , an acquaintance told the paper .
She 's under constant protection by bodyguards , and she rarely parties .
After the article ran , an innocuous picture of Xi Mingze â€ “ white sweater , shoulder - length hair
â€ “ began to circulate online .
That , too , was quickly deleted .
Peng was born in Yuncheng , a rural county in coastal Shandong Province , in 1962 .
Her mother was a singer , and her father was a cultural bureaucrat , former neighbours told the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao .
She joined the People 's Liberation Army at 18 as a civilian .
By 1986 , when she met her future husband Xi Jinping on a blind date , she was already a renowned soprano ; he was a mid - level provincial official .
While the tradition of a "" first lady "" is n't new to China , it 's been long dormant .
Sun Yatsen ( a revolutionary who toppled the Qing Dynasty in 1911 ) , Chiang Kai - Shek ( China 's top leader throughout much of the 1940s ) , and Liu Shaoqi ( a head of state under Mao )
, all had glamorous wives who accompanied them on international trips .
Yet Chinese history books paint Mao Zedong 's wife Jiang Qing as a cold - blooded killer â€ “ in the early 1980s , she was convicted for engineering atrocities during the Cultural Revolution and committed suicide in jail .
The wives of following top leaders â€ “ Deng Xiaoping , Jiang Zemin , and Hu Jintao â€
“ stayed largely in the shadows .
"" In the US , women enjoy equal rights as men in politics , "" said Shen Dingli , a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai .
"" But in Chinese traditional culture , we have a saying : ' a woman without talent is virtuous ' . ""
While female Chinese business leaders are common , he said , women barely appear at the highest levels of the country 's political elite â€ “
only two rank among its 25 top officials .
Yet Li , the fan club founder , has more pressing concerns â€ “ namely , whether Peng will sing for Obama .
"" We hope that some time , Mama Peng will come out to sing for the public , "" she said .
"" We 'd like to meet [ her ] someday . ""

2014-03-20,"The Ellen Degeneres Show was Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s latest stop on his frenzied push to get people to sign up for for health insurance ahead of the 31 March open enrollment deadline .
The pair talked House of Cards , the Affordable Care Act and selfies during the Thursday afternoon appearance .
Degeneres said she was checking in on the president for her friend , his wife Michelle Obama , who is in China with their daughters Sasha and Malia .
â€œThe house is abandoned .
Iâ€ ™ m stuck with two dogs and Iâ€ ™ m expected to walk them and do what you do when you walk dogs , â€ � Obama said .
â€œBut I think theyâ€ ™ re going to have a wonderful time.â€
�
Obama said it is â€œa little
scaryâ€
� that Malia is turning 16 soon and that he is sad because his daughters are bored of their father .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ re doing great in school and theyâ€ ™ re smart and theyâ€ ™ re funny and theyâ€ ™ re kind and theyâ€ ™ re athletic , and so I really have no complaints except for the fact that increasingly they donâ€ ™ t have that much time for me , â€ � Obama said .
â€œI am not that interesting .
Theyâ€ ™ re nice about it though , because they love me , so theyâ€ ™ ll come in and theyâ€ ™ ll pat me on the head and theyâ€ ™ ll kiss me and theyâ€ ™ ll say ,
â€˜Oh Daddy , we love you so much , â€ ™ and theyâ€ ™ ll talk to me for about five minutes , and then theyâ€ ™ ll say , â€˜Weâ€ ™ re going to be gone all weekend.â€ ™
So thatâ€ ™ s making me a little sad.â€ �
Since Obamaâ€ ™ s last appearance on the show , Degeneres has beaten Obamaâ€ ™ s record for most retweeted tweet , with a selfie taken at the Academy Awards , featuring :
Lupita Nyongâ€ ™ o , Meryl Streep and Kevin Spacey .
â€œI thought it was a pretty cheap stunt myself , getting a bunch of celebrities in the background , â€ � said Obama , who is no stranger to selfies .
Degeneres asked whether the president watched House of Cards ( he does ) and Scandal ( his wife does ) .
â€œI have to tell you , life in Washington is a little more boring than displayed on the screen , â€ � Obama said .
â€œThe truth of the matter is , if you followed me , most of my day is sitting in a room listening to a bunch of folks in gray suits talking about a whole bunch of stuff that wouldnâ€ ™ t make very good

Last week , Obamaâ€ ™ s appearance on the intentionally awkward Zach Galifianakis series Between Two Ferns precipitated a 40 % surge in visits to healthcare.gov ."
2014-03-22,"Michelle Obama has declared that access to the internet should be a universal right , in a rare and controversial foray into the world of international politics during a cultural visit to China .
The US first lady , who is on a week - long trip to the communist state with her daughters and mother , risked upsetting her hosts in Beijing by declaring access to information as a birthright .
During a speech at Peking University 's Stanford Centre , she called for greater freedoms while refraining from a direct attack on the controls over information in China .
The so - called "" great firewall of China "" blocks access to internet sites
deemed sensitive , while a vast censorship machine swiftly deletes content considered objectionable .
Twitter and Facebook are both blocked .
Obama told a crowd of about 200 students , most of whom were from the US : "" It is so important for information and ideas to flow freely over the internet and through the media .
My husband and I are on the receiving end of plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens , and it 's not always easy .
But I would n't trade it for anything in the world . ""
She added : "" When it comes to expressing yourself freely , and worshipping as you choose , and having open access to information â€ “ we believe those are universal rights that are the birthright of every person on this planet . ""
Chinese students in the audience reportedly thronged around the first lady after her speech , taking pictures with their cellphones .
Nevertheless , American newspapers reported that several students declined to discuss the rights section of Obama 's speech .
When asked about universal rights , Mary Yan , 23 , an English student at Peking University , was reported as saying : "" It was quite enlightening to hear about her experience and her struggle .
But it 's not convenient for me to talk about such issues . ""
However , Obama 's comments will also be seen as a criticism of the Turkish prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who announced restrictions on Twitter last week .
The Turkish state tried to block the micro - blogging site after some users in recent weeks posted voice recordings and documents purportedly showing evidence of corruption among Erdogan 's inner circle .
Turkey said that action had been taken against Twitter as a "" protection measure "" .
The US frequently criticises China 's human rights record , including its lack of protection for freedom of speech , but before her trip the White House had stressed that America 's first lady would avoid sensitive subjects .
Obama , a Harvard - educated lawyer , is focusing on promoting education and cultural ties , and will visit the Great Wall , the historic city of Xi'an , and the southern city of Chengdu along with her family .
Her three - city tour marks only the third time that Obama has made an overseas trip without her husband since the family moved into the White House .
Former US first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton have both criticised other countries ' human rights records on trips abroad while their husbands were in office .
The American ambassador to China , Max Baucus , also touched on internet freedom in remarks to the students before Obama 's speech . ""
Between texting , Twitter , Facebook , and Snapchat we 're all interconnected , "" he said , describing how technology enables better communication between cultures .
Obama also met Chinese president Xi Jinping on the first day of her tour .
The formal meeting occurred in a state guesthouse and included Xi 's wife , Peng Liyuan , who has an unusually high profile in China where the spouses of leaders generally stay hidden ."

2014-03-28,"During her recent visit to China , US First Lady Michelle Obama dangled a slice of apple in front of one of the cuddly inmates at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding .
By some curious coincidence , researchers published a paper â€ “ on the very same day â€ “ revealing how pandas perceive foods that taste sweet to humans .
â€œPandas love sugar , â€ � says Danielle Reed , a chemist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania and one of the authors of the PLOS ONE paper .
At an anecdotal level , this much has been obvious for decades .
In the 1960s , for instance , the keepers at London Zoo became aware that their lone panda â€ “ a very famous individual called Chi - Chi â€ “ had a secret addiction .
â€œChi
- Chi ate much chocolate throughout her life , â€ � admitted the Zoological Society of Londonâ€ ™ s curator of mammals after her death in 1972 .
But the new research takes a more systematic look at the giant pandaâ€ ™ s appetite for sweetness .
Reed and her colleagues conducted some Pepsi Challenge - like taste tests on captive pandas at the Shaanxi Wild Animal Rescue and Research Center at Louguantai in Shaanxi Province , China .
Animals were given two bowls of water , one plain and the other spiked with a sweetener .
The set - up allowed researchers to quantify the pandaâ€ ™ s hunger for a variety of compounds and in different concentrations .
Their favourite was fructose .
â€œIn all testing sessions , they finished the entire 1 liter of fructose solution and drank very little water , â€ � the authors note .
The pandas also had a taste for other natural sugars , including glucose , sucrose and galactose .
At one level this is not particularly surprising .
Animals that consume plants usually boast functional sweet taste receptors , helping them to pick out the most succulent , sugar - rich greenery on which to feed .
But the pandaâ€ ™ s diet is made up almost exclusively from bamboo , a grass that contains very little sugar .
Why , if they can taste sweet and like it , do they not deviate more often from the sensory boredom of bamboo ?
The authors suggest several explanations .
Bamboo might contain some as - yet - unidentified compound that happens to activate the pandaâ€ ™ s sweet receptors .
Alternatively , the sweet receptors could help the panda to â€œtasteâ€ � sugars elsewhere in the body , ( the monosaccharaides that have been freed up in the gut by the pandaâ€ ™ s â€œfriendlyâ€ � bacteria , for instance ) .
Another possibility , and something of a cop - out , is that pandas still have functional sweet receptors because they have n't yet lost them .
So far so sensible .
Less so is
the researchersâ€ ™ decision to carry out a second set of experiments on the captive pandas , testing their taste for artificial sweeteners .
The explanation for choosing these fake sugars ?
â€œBecause they also have been tested in other Carnivora species , as well as many other mammalian species and they are chemically and structurally diverse.â€
�
I read this sentence , then I read it again , and I still canâ€ ™ t see the rationale .
Unless of course , the authors were interested to know whether pandas would prefer Pepsi over Pepsi Max .
Based on their findings , itâ€ ™ s likely that they would .
Pandas â€ “ like most humans
â€ “ donâ€
™ t particularly go for aspartame .

2014-04-23,"Barack Obama has paid tribute to the late his fellow Chicagoan Frankie Knuckles , calling the DJ and producer a "" trainblazer "" who "" captured our attention and ignited our imaginations "" .
In a letter dated 17 April , the US president and his wife , Michelle Obama , offered their "" heartfelt sympathies "" to "" the friends and family of Frankie Knuckles "" .
"" We were deeply saddened to learn of Frankie 's passing , "" they wrote .
"" Frankie 's work helped open minds and bring people together â€ ¦ and his legacy lives on in the city of Chicago and on dance floors across the globe . ""
The Obamas ' letter was published on the Facebook page of Knuckles ' friend , the DJ David Morales , following Knuckles ' memorial service on Monday night .
Hundreds of Chicagoans filled the pews of the city 's Progressive Baptist Church , listening to tributes by Morales , Illinois governor Pat Quinn , club owner Joe Shanahan , as well as the singers Inaya Day and Terisa Griffin . ""
House music was a particular type of spiritual music , "" pronounced Reverend Roderick Norton , according to the Chicago Reader .
Barack Obama previously paid tribute to Knuckles to mark Chicago 's official Frankie Knuckles Day , which took place on 25 August 2004 .
Part of the city 's Jefferson Street , outside the former site of the Warehouse club , was also renamed Frankie Knuckles Way .
Last week , Elton John announced the founding of a Frankie Knuckles Fund , created in conjunction with his international Aids foundation .
The Knuckles Fund will work with men at high risk of HIV in Africa as well as linked communities in the US and Britain . ""
Frankie was such a lovely man and a great talent , and his legacy provides a powerful voice to reach out to people , particularly men of color , about their essential role in helping to create an AIDS - free future , "" Sir Elton said in a statement .
Knuckles , known as the godfather of house music , died on 31 March from complications with Type II diabetes .
He was 59 ."
2014-04-24,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge finish their tour of New Zealand and Australia on Friday , a successful off - West End run for reinventing monarchy , the show .
David and Samantha Cameron have done the obligatory holiday snaps on their Easter break in Lanzarote , exposing their choice of destination and footwear to a judgemental nation .
Last month , Ed Miliband and Justine Thornton did the couple thing in Israel .
But on Wednesday , Miriam GonzÃ¡lez DurÃ¡ntez marked herself out as different , again , when she took over a press conference to challenge her husband , Nick Clegg , to stand up for men who take time out for parenting .
GonzÃ¡lez DurÃ¡ntez , a partner in the European law firm Dechert LLP , is also champion of the Inspiring Women campaign which she launched last October to encourage school girls to aim high .
These are unusual women .
Very few people choose a life partner knowing where it will land them , but each of these women married in the knowledge that they were committing themselves
â€ “ if their partners ' plans came off â€ “ to a life as part of a public couple .
So the way they do their job is not some ad hoc response to an unexpected event .
They are not rabbits caught in the headlights .
Unavoidably , the way they live is a kind of parable of how to be a 21st - century wife , which for some of them turns out to be the same as being a 20th - century wife , with better household aids .
Take Kate .
She is , it is well recognised , the symbol of a monarchy that is ready to modernise .
She is aspirational .
She shops on the high street .
She is unusually comfortable with herself , and this more than anything fits her well to do another important part of her job , which is not being Diana , Princess of Wales .
This past fortnight tracing the doomed footsteps of William 's parents ' antipodean tour 30 years ago is a way of substituting young royals 2.0 for the memory of that old , tarnished model .
In its way , it was as slick an operation as if the late Apple founder Steve Jobs himself had designed it .
But if she is a symbol of the monarchy , the living part of the constitution , then the message the monarchy is sending out about the way women live sits oddly with a business whose boss is female .
The duchess , as Hilary Mantel has brilliantly argued , looks as if she has been formulated from some secret substance for this particular brand of public life , perfect wife and perfect mother .
Leave out the fashion and she would not seem out of place in 1954 .
Even the way she challenges William â€ “ by being better than him at sport â€
“ is unthreatening .
In the company of Kate and George , Prince William can fulfil a role everyone can recognise and many identify with : he is husband and father , as well as future king .
And that is what Kate is for .
It is her job , the one she first tried out for all those years ago at St Andrew 's , to lend a patina of normalcy to what might otherwise come to seem absurd .
The former Tory MP Louise Mensch , who fled the Commons to be with her family in the US , got it all wrong when she tweeted on Thursday : ""
Kate Middleton 's top 500 outfits Kate Middleton 's top 10 speeches : 1 .
"" I do . ""
2 - 10 ....
er ..... "" .
The duchess is not there to speak .
Political wives have to do something similar .
Only consider the dilemma of Sally Bercow , married to the Speaker , John Bercow , a woman whose wilder judgement calls ( the wrapped - in - a - sheet photocall ) have sent middle England into shock .
If she did not exist , she would have to be invented , as a kind of tester of the boundaries between the personal and the public that an official wife should observe .
Small surprise that Samantha Cameron , the businesswoman and mother who once looked as if she might be an upmarket role model for everyone trying to combine career and children , has now subsided into the role of silent support and photo - shoot prop .
Nor can any woman who marries a politician overlook the media monstering of Cherie Booth .
Her public battle to be a feminist as well as a public wife seemed to be taken as a personal challenge to those sections of the media that think women should generally be seen but not heard .
Almost everything she tried to do was undermined by their relentless hostility and their willingness to hunt down every private misjudgement .
No wonder Sarah Brown chose less contentious causes and pursued them almost silently .
But there is another way , and GonzÃ¡lez DurÃ¡ntez might be it .
She is the Michelle Obama of the coalition , the woman with a sense of purpose bold enough to ignore the constraints of convention .
She has harnessed her husband 's prominence to promote a cause .
She has challenged him as an equal .
And what is scandalous is that almost all the public women in Britain at the moment owe their public role to their husbands ."
2014-04-25,"The Parks and Recreation season finale may have featured Ginuwine , the Decemberists and Jon Hamm , but one guest star outshone them all .
First lady Michelle Obama appeared as the keynote speaker at the National Parks Conference , eventually recruiting Leslie Knope to her
Let 's Move campaign .
Amy Poehler 's Leslie has always been a political overachiever , simultaneously admiring and emulating favoured bureaucrats Hillary Rodham Clinton , Madeleine Albright and Nancy Pelosi .
When Leslieâ€ ™ s then - boyfriend , now - husband Ben Wyatt took a short - term job running a congressional campaign in Washington DC , it gave Leslie a chance to cross bipartisan lines and meet some of her heroes .
But can these real - life politicians act , even if theyâ€ ™ re playing themselves ?
If youâ€ ™ re cynical like me , you just assume politicians are acting all day long .
But when it comes down to actually joining an ensemble cast and reciting lines , how do Parks and Rec 's cameos measure up ?
Senator Barbara Boxer and senator Olympia Snowe Leslie was starstruck and a little breathless when she met the senators , who come in as numbers four and 26 on Leslieâ€
™ s list of amazing women .
She immediately launched into self - deprecation mode by explaining Pawneeâ€ ™ s problem with â€œraccoons and obese toddlersâ€ � before getting teary and running away .
The senators said about five words each , but that was all the occasion called for , and both seemed natural and at ease .
Score :
Solid , but not enough lines to really measure .
Senator John McCain
At the same party , after she has run away from Senators Boxer and Snowe , Leslie ends up in the coat closet .
When McCain comes in to get his coat and tries to console her , Leslie is annoyed and frustrated .
With her back to him , she has no idea who sheâ€ ™ s dismissing , saying ,
â€œNosy people have no respect for personal space.â€ �
McCain is surprisingly funny , and knows his cues .
Heâ€ ™ s worked with Poehler before on Saturday Night Live , and often poked fun at himself in the wake of his failed presidential campaign .
McCain is a good sport .
Score :
Great !
Heâ€
™ s funny without being cloying , and clearly a good actor .
Maybe too good .
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich
When the Parks and Rec guys head out to the St Elmo Steakhouse for Ronâ€ ™ s bachelor party , Jerry really Jerrys it up by sitting at the wrong table , confusing his last name ( Gergich ) for Gingrich .
Gingrich delivers an unconvincing â€œI donâ€ ™ t think so , Jerry , â€ � and is never seen again .
Score :
Terri - bad .
On par with a kindergarten play .
Vice - president Joe Biden Biden is Leslieâ€
™ s hero .
When Ben calls in a favour to arrange a meeting , Leslie goes bonkers .
Biden is a pro â€ “ heâ€ ™ s full of charm and totally at ease , even when Leslie is practically hyperventilating .
He has the most lines of any of the political cameos , and delivers them all like heâ€ ™ s been part of the show since the beginning .
Score :
Fantastic .
Why hasnâ€ ™ t he hosted SNL yet ?
First lady Michelle Obama
This is a huge get .
We all love Michelle Obama â€ “
sheâ€ ™ s like a hybrid sister - mom who you want to hang out with forever .
Leslie was a stuttering , nodding mess when she ran into the first lady in the hallway , and who can blame her ?
On the scale of McCain to Biden , Mrs Obama was squarely in the middle ; she wasnâ€ ™ t wooden , but she was way too on - message for it to feel like effortless , integrating her Letâ€ ™ s Move campaign into the conversation like she was setting off fireworks in a bathroom stall .
Score :
The most promising actor in all of community theatre ."
2014-05-07,"Three weeks after 257 girls were snatched from their school in Chibok , a fortnight after # BringBackOurGirls first appeared on Twitter , and a day after Barack Obama described the kidnapping as both heart - breaking and outrageous , the eyes of the world are finally and firmly fixed on events in the remote reaches of north - eastern Nigeria .
Michelle Obama has become the latest high profile name to tweet her support and in cities as far apart as Abuja , Washington , Los Angeles , Dublin and London , demonstrators have put on red T - shirts to draw attention to the girls ' plight , demand their release , and to vent a deepening sense of anger .
Further protests are due to be held over the next few days in countries including the UK , the US , South Africa , Jamaica and Switzerland .
The hashtag , which started trending in Nigeria two weeks ago , has now been tweeted more than one million times .
It was first used on 23 April at the opening ceremony for a Unesco event honouring the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt as the 2014 World Book Capital City .
A Nigerian lawyer in Abuja , Ibrahim M Abdullahi , tweeted the call in a speech by Dr Oby Ezekwesili , vice - president of the World Bank for Africa to "" Bring Back the Girls ! ""
A global "" social media march "" has also been organised asking supporters to use their networks to promote the campaign for 200 minutes on Thursday and there are also Bring Back Our Girls and a Wear Red Facebook pages .
The campaign has reignited the debate over the value of online campaigning or "" slacktivism "" as it is called by its critics .
The hashtag has been used by different organisations to expose the story further online .
Amnesty International and Unicef have backed the campaign , as have politicians and celebrities , including Michelle Obama , Hillary Clinton , Wyclef Jean and Chris Brown .
Actors Sean Penn , Ashton Kutcher , Justin Timberlake and Bradley Cooper have thrown their weight behind a parallel hashtag : # RealMenDontBuyGirls .
The US first lady said on Twitter : "" Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families . ""
She packaged her tweet with a photo of herself in the White House holding a white piece of paper with the message "" # BringBackOurGirls "" written in black , capital letters .
The Nigerian author Chibundu Onuzo , writing for the Guardian , said : "" We have discovered the power of the hashtag over the last week .
The simple , emphatic demand # BringBackOurGirls has moved across the Twitter timelines of the famous and the unknown , uniting Nigerian housewives and the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton . ""
On Tuesday , 100 red - clad men and women gathered outside the Nigerian defence headquarters in Abuja to beg the authorities to find the girls amid claims they were to be sold into slavery , a protest that continued into Wednesday .
The chief of the Chibok community in the capital , Hosea Sambido , said the uncertainty had left mothers in his home town unable to eat and had forced fathers into the bush in desperate searches for their daughters . ""
Please , we are begging the federal government of Nigeria , please , we are begging our army , which we depend on , please intervene into this matter for us , intervene into this matter for us , "" said Sambido .
"" Our community is relatively small .
If a generation of the same age
â€ “ 276 â€
“ are out , in the future where are we ?
Who cares ?
Can our girls go to school now ?
Help us .
Please .

In Washington , about 75 protesters wearing "" Bring Back Our Girls "" T - shirts rallied outside the shuttered Nigerian embassy this week to accuse the Nigerian government of failing to protect its young females .
"" We are tired of the government putting its head in the sand , "" said Omolola Adele Oso , a 35-year - old Nigerian immigrant from Bowie , Maryland .
"" These girls could be beaten and burned into subservience .
The government wants this problem to disappear , but it will not disappear . ""
Most â€ “ but not all â€ “ of the demonstrators were Nigerian immigrants .
Amy Thomson , 43 , of Chevy Chase , Maryland said she had come to the rally "" because I 'm a mother
and I would feel the same if my daughter were in danger .
"" Thomson was accompanied by her 11-year - old daughter Emma , who said she had been inspired by the efforts of Malala Yousafzai , the teenage activist from Pakistan who was shot and nearly killed by the Taliban for promoting girls ' education . ""
Boko Haram said Allah told them to take the girls , "" said Emma . ""
But I read about Malala , and she said that is not her Allah . ""
Yousafzai herself has lent her support to the campaign to free the schoolgirls .
In a black - and - white picture posted on the Twitter account of her educational fund , she holds up a piece of paper inscribed with the now - familiar plea : "" # BringBackOurGirls "" ."
2014-05-07,"First lady Michelle Obama has been making the rounds on television recently , appearing on the Parks and Recreation season finale and poking fun at her role as Americaâ€ ™ s health cop in a Veep skit shown at the White House Correspondentâ€ ™ s Dinner .
This week , she will appear on the country music drama Nashville at a charity concert organized by Connie Britton 's character Rayna James .
During these cameos , she is usually on - message about her Letâ€ ™ s Move campaign , but what they also show is that she is remarkably savvy about being in on the joke , and using pop culture to further her ideas .
One of the most powerful women in the world is using television to reach out to people , and she 's and doing it well .
Itâ€ ™ s not common for first ladies to appear on television , and certainly not in any way that makes them seem relatable ; they either do it poorly , or avoid it altogether .
My generation had Nancy Reaganâ€ ™ s creaky , jangling appearance on Diffâ€ ™ rent Strokes in 1983 to warn us about the dangers of drugs for her Just Say No campaign ( which was , admittedly , a failure ) .
Hillary Rodham Clinton was appointed to the national health care reform task force when Bill Clinton took office ; most of her television appearances simply served her post , and when she ventured into the realm of pop culture post - White House it was seen as a bid to soften her image .
Both Barbara Bush and Laura Bush were more interested in books than television .
Michelle Obama is using the language of the people to speak directly to the people in a way that makes sense for the moment .
The first lady maintains her amiability by defaulting to self - deprecating humor .
Last year she appeared on Jimmy Fallon to walk us through the evolution of mom dancing .
She convinced Big Bird that her height doesnâ€ ™ t make her half - bird on Sesame Street .
She showed up on iCarly in 2012 to talk to kids about supporting military families and poke fun at her title .
She even dunked on LeBron James when the Miami Heat visted the White House .
While her appearances on The Biggest Loser are fairly standard , in terms of her talking about healthy eating and exercise , the first lady has proven again and again that she wonâ€ ™ t compromise personality for publicity .
Right now there is a strong argument to be made that TV has surpassed movies in terms of cultural cache , and TV producers are throwing out the old model and taking more risks .
This works well for someone like Flotus , who is willing to let her own sense of humor peek out around the edges of the traditional sitcom format .
Subverting the stodgy hokeyness of old model television is part of the joke .
Weâ€ ™ ve grown accustomed to seeing politicians shill for something , like Bob Dole stumping for Viagra , or President Barack Obama appearing on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis to push the Affordable Care Act , but Michelle Obama 's appearances are different .
Her consistency of message across a variety of TV shows are a smart political move that ensures she can reach more than one type of viewer .
Her appearance on Nashville this week is another smart move .
Sheâ€ ™ ll be sending a message of support for the military at Fort Campbell in Kentucky , which simultaneously reminds viewers that the US still has troops deployed all over the world , and works towards answering detractors who think the Obama White House isnâ€ ™ t doing enough to support those troops .
Her many TV cameos to date have revealed that Michelle Obama is a pretty good actor : she is skilled at playing herself in the role of herself .
On - screen , that comes over as sincere and believable , which are qualities most politicians would kill for ."
2014-05-10,"America 's first lady Michelle Obama will deliver her husband 's weekly radio address this weekend to draw attention to the plight of the kidnapped schoolgirls in Nigeria .
As the UN security council on Friday night expressed outrage at the abductions by Islamist militants and demanded their immediate release , a White House spokesman confirmed that Mrs Obama would be making the address ahead of mother 's day , which is on Sunday in the US . ""
As the mother of two young daughters , Mrs Obama is taking up the opportunity to express outrage and heartbreak the president and she share over the kidnapping , "" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said .
"" The first lady hopes that the courage of these young girls serves as an inspiration ... and a call to action for people around the world to fight to ensure that every girl receives the education that is their birthright "" , he added .
Boko Haram kidnapped more than 250 girls from a secondary school in Chibok in remote northeastern Nigeria on April 14 and has threatened to sell them into slavery , while eight girls were taken from another village earlier this week .
The abductions has drawn international condemnation and promises of special forces assistance to find the girls from the US and UK .
In a statement , the UN security council said : "" The members of the Security Council expressed their intention to actively follow the situation of the abducted girls and to consider appropriate measures against Boko Haram , "" the 15-member council , which includes Nigeria , said in a statement .
US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said the security council should act quickly to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group .
"" We 're working with Nigeria in the security council to secure urgently needed UN sanctions ( on ) Boko Haram , "" Power posted on Twitter . ""
Must hold its murderous leaders to account . ""
Boko Haram 's five - year - old insurgency is aimed at reviving a medieval Islamic caliphate in modern Nigeria , whose 170 million people are split roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims , and it is becoming by far the biggest security threat to Africa 's top oil producer .
The security council statement "" demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all abducted girls still in captivity and further expressed their deep concern at statements made by the alleged leader of Boko Haram threatening to sell these girls as slaves .
"" It also condemned the latest big Islamist attack in Nigeria , the killing of 125 people on Monday when gunmen rampaged through a town in the northeast near the Cameroon border ."

2014-05-10,"Michelle Obama has taken the rare step of delivering her husband 's weekly video address to express outrage over the plight of more than 250 schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamist militants in Nigeria .
The US first lady began the address , which is broadcast on radio and uploaded to YouTube , by wishing Americans a happy Mother 's Day , before saying : "" Like millions of people across the globe , my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night .
"" This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education â€ “ grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls .
""
The militant Islamist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from a secondary school in Chibok in remote northeastern Nigeria on 14 April and has threatened to sell them into slavery , while eight girls were taken from another village earlier this week .
The abductions have drawn international condemnation and promises of special forces assistance to find the girls from the US and UK .
The Nigerian president , Goodluck Jonathan , said on Friday he believed the girls were still in his country .
"" I want you to know that Barack has directed our government to do everything possible to support the Nigerian government 's efforts to find these girls and bring them home , "" the first lady said .
"" In these girls , Barack and I see our own daughters .
We see their hopes , their dreams , and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now . ""
The first lady noted that the school where the girls were abducted had been closed recently because of terrorist threats , but the girls insisted on coming back to take exams .
"" They were so determined to move to the next level of their education â€ ¦ so determined to one day build careers of their own and make their families and communities proud , "" she said .
"" And what happened in Nigeria was not an isolated incident .
It 's a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions . ""
The White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said : "" As the mother of two young daughters , Mrs Obama is taking up the opportunity to express outrage and heartbreak the president and she share over the kidnapping . ""

A team of UK experts has arrived in Nigeria to help with the hunt for kidnapped schoolgirls .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : "" The team will be considering not just the recent incidents but also longer - term counter - terrorism solutions to prevent such attacks in the future and defeat Boko Haram . ""
The move comes after Amnesty International claimed Nigerian commanders were warned that armed men were beginning to arrive near Chibok , where the girls were kidnapped from their school , but the military were unable to raise enough troops to respond .
"" This abduction could have been prevented , "" said Amnesty spokeswoman Susanna Flood .
The Nigerian government , which have come under growing criticism at home and from abroad for being too slow to react , says it does not believe the Amnesty allegations are true but they are investigating .
Speaking to Sky News ' special correspondent Alex Crawford , Shettima Haruma , whose daughter was among those taken , said he was angry with the Nigerian government 's response .
He said : "" We beg Nigerians , those in another country like America or
[ Britain ] â€
¦ it 's three weeks , nearly one month
â€
¦ [
and we have n't ] seen any letters from our daughters . ""
Sky News reported that the search for the schoolgirls was closing in on the huge Sambisa forest near the border with Cameroon and that the girls had been divided into at least four groups , which would make a rescue more difficult ."
2014-05-11,"Michelle Obama has taken the unique step of delivering her husband 's weekly presidential address to express outrage at the kidnapping of the Nigerian schoolgirls .
Speaking for the first time instead of the US president , before what is Mothers ' Day in the US on Sunday , she said the couple were "" outraged and heartbroken "" over the abduction of more than 300 girls from a school in Chibok on 14 April . ""
What happened in Nigeria was not an isolated incident .
It 's a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions .

As the international rescue effort to find the girls continues Islamist extremists blew up a bridge on Saturday night , killed an unknown number of people and abducted the wife and two children of a retired police officer in north - east Nigeria .
The events came as a senior aide to the president , Goodluck Jonathan , moved the closest yet of anyone within government circles to admit there was "" much to be remorseful and angry about "" in the way last month 's abduction had been handled politically .
Ken Wiwa , an adviser to the president and son of playwright and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa , wrote in an article for the Observer that there was something "" reassuring "" in the fact that the world cared about the plight of the girls .
He said that , with support , Nigeria could "" overcome this challenge "" , and called it the turning point in the battle against terrorism .
There are now warnings of a refugee crisis emerging from the escalating violence by insurgents , after a quarter of a million people have fled their homes . ""
The brutality and frequency of these attacks is unprecedented , "" Adrian Edwards of the UN refugees agency said .
"" The past two months have seen multiple kidnappings and deaths , creating population displacement both inside Nigeria and into neighbouring countries . ""
Refugees report acts of extreme violence , of homes and fields being burned down and grenades being launched into crowded markets and bus stations .
People are being caught in the crossfire between the insurgents and government forces , and there are allegations of arbitrary arrests and summary executions .
The US ambassador to the UN , Samantha Power , said the security council should act quickly to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group and hold "" its murderous leaders to account "" .
The security council has demanded the release of the girls and is threatening to take action . ""
The members of the security council expressed their intention to actively follow the situation of the abducted girls and to consider appropriate measures against Boko Haram , "" the 15-member council , which includes Nigeria , said .
A team of UK experts is now in Nigeria to help with the hunt , but they admit they face "" large information gaps "" , the Press Association reported .
The UK advisory team in Abuja have been in talks with senior officials , including Jonathan and the national security adviser Sambo Dasuki , in a bid to get to grips with the emergency .
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) spokesman said : "" The scale and complexity of the incident and the environment means there are large information gaps . ""
The priority for the team in the first instance is establishing the facts such as the precise identities of those taken and what has actually happened to help Nigeria build a better picture . ""
Jonathan said he believed the girls were still in the country despite fears , prompted by the sabotage last week of a border bridge , that the kidnappers were trying to stop anyone following them into Cameroon .
In her speech , broadcast nationwide on radio and uploaded as a YouTube video , Michelle Obama said : "" This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education â€ “ grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls . ""

Earlier last week the first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a placard with the # bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag .
On Friday Amnesty International claimed Nigerian commanders were warned before the kidnap that armed men were assembling near Chibok , but the military were unable to raise enough troops to respond . ""

2014-05-17,"Young Americans must confront racism , intolerance and inequality , which still scar the United States 60 years after the end of officially sanctioned segregation , Michelle Obama has said .
The first lady on Friday challenged high school graduates to be prepared to â€œruffle
feathersâ€ � by fighting prejudice and discrimination at home , at college and in the workplace .
â€œOur laws may no longer separate us based on our skin colour , but thereâ€ ™ s
nothing in our constitution that says we have to eat together in the lunchroom or live together in the same neighbourhoods ,
â€ �
she told students graduating from the Topeka school district in Kansas .
â€œSo the answers to many of our challenges today
canâ€

Black parents in Topeka launched a challenge to segregated schooling in 1951 which led to the 1954 Brown v Board of Education US supreme court ruling , a landmark case which helped pave the way for the civil rights movement .
Barack Obama and other government officials marked the anniversary at separate events across the country .
The first lady told her audience they were the the living , breathing legacy of the case .
â€œJust look around this arena .
Look at all the colours , cultures and faiths represented here .
Thatâ€ ™ s why weâ€ ™ re celebrating here tonight because the fact is that your experience here in Topeka would have been unimaginable back in 1954 , when Brown v Board of Education went to the supreme court.â€
�
She hailed impressive strides since then but lamented that many schools and neighbourhoods were still de facto segregated , leaving young people to grow up in mono - ethnic and mono - racial environments .
She railed against crumbling schools , racial profiling and homophobia , fusing the civil rights struggle with other progressive causes , and urged her audience to challenge intolerance whether at home , online , on campus or at work .
â€œWhen folks made a big deal about Jason Collins and Michael Sam coming out as gay , a lot of kids in your generation thought , â€˜So what ?
Whatâ€ ™ s
the issue here?â€ ™ â€ �
she said , referring to the first openly gay athlete to play in the NBA and the first to be drafted by an NFL team .
â€œAnd graduates , itâ€ ™ s up to all of you to lead the way and drag my generation and your grandparentsâ€ ™ generation along with you , â€ � Obama said .
She said honest conversations were needed to heal the wounds of the past and move towards a better future .
â€œGraduates , that is your mission , to make sure all those voices are heard .
This wo n't be easy .
You may need to ruffle a few feathers.â€ �"
2014-06-05,"Launched in 2000 in north London , Asos , which stands for As Seen on Screen , has grown from a tiny start - up into the UK 's largest online fashion and beauty retailer .
Aimed at twentysomethings , it sells more than 850 brands along with its own - label clothes .
Its chequered red - and - white skater dress , priced at $ 93.34 ( now $ 73 ) , was worn by Michelle Obama on the campaign trail with her husband in 2012 , and by Jessica Alba last year .
2000 :

2014-06-05,"When Michelle Obama was pictured wearing a red and white checkered Asos dress while on the campaign trail with her husband , President Obama , in 2012 , the online retailer 's fashion circle appeared to be complete .
At launch in 2002 , Asos was a relatively modest operation built on a simple , but smart , idea : take a picture of a celebrity wearing a cool outfit and offer customers the chance to buy an affordable alternative , unashamedly mimicked by the north London brand 's in - house designers .
Fourteen years on , the brand no longer relies on gauche paparazzi shots to flog its wares .
It sells more than 850 other brands , from high street stalwarts River Island to French designer brand Cacherel , employs more than 4,000 people â€ “ and now it 's the celebrities who are photographed in Asos clothes .
What 's the secret to its success ?
The quality of its in - house design team and quick turnover of trends is the most obvious place to start .
Despite existing on the internet , Asos still dominates the high street by offering clearly identifiable takes on trends such as festival style or 90s revival fashion in a way that makes its rivals appear muddled and lethargic .
The yearly unveiling of well - stocked niche brands , such as Asos Curve for larger women and petite and tall ranges , dresses a customer base who had been waiting a long time for such breadth of choice , and an uncanny ability to move with the technological times and incorporate social media into its brand has been crucial for a company whose customers are in the 20-something bracket .
Its excellent customer service and effortless free returns policy ca n't have hurt , either .
News of Asos 's share price slump may seem alarming , but while its clothes and price points remain in rude health it 's not a sign that public interest is fading ."
2014-06-07,"In a moving tribute to a woman she called â€œone of the greatest spirits our world has ever knownâ€
�
, first lady Michelle Obama on Saturday thanked the writer Maya Angelou for empowering young black women like herself with her clever , sassy words .
Angelou died last month at the age of 86 .
The former president Bill Clinton and TV star Oprah Winfrey were also among speakers and performers at a more - than two - hour memorial service held at Wake Forest University in North Carolina , where Angelou taught for 30 years .
Obama said Angelou taught all women that self - worth â€œhas nothing to do with what the world might sayâ€ � .
â€œFor me , â€ � she said , â€œthat was the power of Maya Angelouâ€ ™ s words , words so powerful they carried a little black girl from the south side of Chicago all the way to the White House.â€ � Obama added : â€œShe touched me , she touched all of you , she touched people all across the globe , including a young white woman from Kansas who named her daughter after Maya and raised her son to be the first black president of the United States.â€
�
The first lady 's nine - minute speech was met with a standing ovation .
She said : â€œShe was the master .
For at a time when there were such stifling constraints on how a black woman could exist in the world , she serenely disregarded all the rules with fiercely , passionate unapologetic self .
â€œShe was comfortable in every last inch of her glorious black skin .
But for Dr Angelou , her own transition was never enough .
You see , she didnâ€ ™ t just want to be phenomenal herself .
She wanted all of us to be phenomenal right along side her .
â€œIn so many ways Maya Angelou knew us .
She knew our hope , our pain , our ambition , our fear , our anger , our shame , and she assured us that in spite of it all , in fact because of it all , we were good .
â€œAnd in doing so she paved the way for me and Oprah and so many others just to be our good old black woman selves.â€
�
In his speech , Clinton recalled the last time he saw Angelou , a few weeks ago at a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the passing of the Civil Rights Act .
The former president , at whose 1993 inauguration Angelou read her poem On the Pulse of Morning , told her he was surprised to see her out and about .
Angelou replied : â€œJust because I am wheelchair bound , doesnâ€ ™ t mean I donâ€
™ t get around.â€ �
Clinton added : â€œShe was without a voice for five years and then she developed the greatest voice on the planet .
God loaned her his voice .
She had the voice of God and he decided he wanted it back for a while.â€ �
An emotional Winfrey also spoke , to say goodbye to the woman she called her â€œspiritual queen motherâ€ � .
â€œShe was always there for me , to be the rainbow , â€ � Winfrey said .
Angelou was a favorite of the Obamas .
In 2011 , Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom , quoting her as he did so : "" History , despite its wrenching pain , can not be unlived , but if faced with courage , need not be lived again . ""
Angelou campaigned for Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential bid .
She told the Guardian : â€œI made up my mind 15 years ago that if she ever ran for office Iâ€ ™ d be on her wagon .
My only difficulty with Senator Obama is that I believe in going out with who I went in with .
Angelou shifted her support to Obama when he was chosen as the Democratic nominee .
Delighted when he was elected president , she declared : "" We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism . ""
Angelouâ€ ™ s grandson , Elliott Jones , began Saturday 's ceremony by reading one of her poems ,
Still I Rise :
â€œYou may write me down in history With your bitter , twisted lies , You may tread me in the very dirt
But still , like dust , I 'll rise.â€
�
In her storied lifetime , Angelou played many roles : civil rights activist , author , poet , actress , director , playwright and songwriter .
She survived several personal trials that colored her memoirs .
She was a child of the depression , grew up in the segregated south , survived a childhood rape by her mother 's boyfriend , who was then murdered by her uncles .
Angelou felt responsible and stopped speaking for five years .
She gave birth as a teenager and was , at one time , a â€œshake dancer in nightclubsâ€ � .
She wrote wrote seven autobiographies , including perhaps her best known work , her 1969 memoir
I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , a scathing indictment of the racial discrimination she experienced during her childhood .
"" If growing up is painful for the southern black girl , "" she wrote , "" being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat .
It is an unnecessary insult . """
2014-06-23,"Name : Hildebeest .
Age : 66 .
Appearance :
Coiffed , formidable .
The horns are formidable , I 'll grant you that .
But I 've never seen one looking coiffed .
Covered in flies ?
Yes .
Getting eaten by a lioness ?
Absolutely .
Being blow - dried ?
Not even close .
You 're thinking of wildebeest .
I 'm talking about the Hildebeest .
An upland - dwelling subspecies ?
No .
A former US senator and secretary of state , and a leading contender for the presidency in 2016 .
I knew US voters could be a bit eccentric , but I did n't realise they had begun electing ungulates .
You misunderstand .
The Hildebeest is a nickname for Hillary Clinton .
How horrid !
There 's such misogyny about first ladies .
Who calls Hillary that ?
Michelle Obama .
Allegedly .
In a new book called Blood Feud , the political journalist Edward Klein says Michelle and her friend Valerie Jarrett love bitching about "" the Hildebeest "" .
Indeed , he says that the Clintons and the Obamas hate each other .
But they 're the two great Democrat couples â€ “ four powerful people with similar interests .
How could they possibly fall out ?
You 've answered your own question there .
Barack and Hillary were rivals for the Democratic nomination in 2008 , during which Klein says the Clinton camp felt unfairly portrayed as racist by the Obamas .
Hey , we 're all alleged racists , deep down .
Klein claims this is very personal .
"" I hate that man Obama more than any man I 've ever met , more than any man who ever lived , "" Bill is supposed to have said .
But he endorsed him for reelection in 2012 !
As part of an alleged deal in which the Obamas are meant to support Hillary 's run in 2016 .
They have to pretend to be friends , and it 's dead awkward .
During a round of golf , Bill apparently bragged about how much better the economy did in his eight years .
Ooh .
When presidents bitch !
Barack retorted that Michelle might make a good president one day .
Backatcha !
"" Bill was speechless , "" says "" a Clinton family friend "" .
"" If he had n't been on a mission to strike a deal with Barack , he might have stormed off the golf course then and there . ""
They tried to patch things up at a dinner party in March 2013 , but Barack played ostentatiously on his BlackBerry when Bill was talking .
Probably just counting his retweets .
No doubt .
Do say : "" Ooh , look at me , I 'm Barack Obama and I use Twitter and stuff ! ""
Do n't say : "" I 'm , like , Hillary with two Ls , and I 'm desperate to be president even though I 'm really annoying ! """
2014-08-08,"When I saw that Michelle Obama joked at the US - Africa Leaders Summit this week that â€œwomen are smarter than menâ€ � , I prepared myself for backlash .
And â€ “ what do you know ?
â€ “ Politico wrote that the First Lady had â€œengaged in a battle of the sexesâ€ � , anti - feminist author and Fox News contributor Suzanne Venker called it a â€œsexist and elitist displayâ€ � , and the headline at Business Standard read â€œMichelle Obama claims women are smarter than menâ€ � .
As if it were a serious assertion rather than a joking aside !
This isnâ€ ™ t the very first time Michelle Obama has taken flak for , well , just about anything .
Her tenure in the White House has been marked by nasty racist and sexist attacks ( in fact , they started before President Obama took office ) on her body , her feminism
â€ “ even her love of BeyoncÃ
© .
But when the First Lady made the quip â€ “ at an event with former first lady Laura Bush , while addressing the spouses of African leaders â€ “
it wasnâ€ ™ t a humorless dig at men .
It was a light - hearted moment of girl - power on the outskirts of a conference for heads of state that is incredibly male - dominated .
Actually , I wish sheâ€ ™
d said it with the intention of mocking men â€ “ with all that political , economic and social power theyâ€ ™ ve cornered by marginalizing women , I think they can take a light ribbing .
( Iâ€ ™ d prefer a total overthrow of the patriarchy , but Iâ€ ™ ve always had champagne tastes . )
Besides , laughter is the best medicine , especially when itâ€ ™ s a guffaw redirected right in the face of sexists .
Of course , women donâ€ ™ t have to smile if they donâ€ ™ t want to or hide when theyâ€ ™ re angry .
But thereâ€ ™ s little that sexists fear more than being mocked by women â€ “ and that makes laughing at them all the more satisfying .
( Itâ€ ™ s interesting , too , how the same misogynists who say feminists have no sense of humor are so quick to pout when theyâ€ ™ re on the receiving end of it . )
Thereâ€ ™ s
some of that same reasoning behind the recent Twitter campaign in protest of a Turkish politicianâ€ ™ s sexist comments :
after deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc said that women â€œshould have chastity ...
she should not laugh in front of everyone and not be inviting in her behaviorâ€ �
, Turkish women posted pictures of themselves laughing online .
Even Harry Potter star and UN goodwill ambassador for women Emma Watson got in on the campaign .
The protest turned Arnicâ€ ™ s own words against him , and the women he thought needed more control didnâ€ ™ t have to lose their sense of joy while doing it .
In all fairness , joking about menâ€ ™ s ( supposed )
inferiority doesnâ€
™ t change the systemic power system through which they benefit .
But so long as it irritates the misogynists in our midst â€ “ and gives women some much - needed moments of levity â€ “ Iâ€ ™ ll keep encouraging women to laugh at ridiculous men who just want them to stop already .
Signaling that women will do whatever they damn please regardless of what men think is a winning strategy ."

Whatâ€ ™ s perhaps more impressive is the fact that they have coaxed Michelle Obama on board as â€œguest curatorâ€ � , which probably means a series of blog pieces bigging up her Reach Higher crusade to inspire Americaâ€ ™ s youth into further education .
Her first blog is snappily titled â€œI

2014-10-07,"â€œAre you listening to me?â€ � Michelle Obama , who is used to handling teenagers at home , asked a crowd of high schoolers in Atlanta on 9 September .
The crowd at Booker T Washington high school seemed restless and the First Lady had an important message to deliver : Do not drop out of school .
Go to college .
Get out of poverty .
Giving up on education is not an option .
â€œDo
you hear what Iâ€ ™ m telling you?â€
�
she asked the students .
â€œBecause Iâ€ ™ m giving you some insights that a lot of rich kids all over the country â€ “ they know this stuff , and I want you to know it , too .
Because you have got to go and get your education .
Youâ€ ™ ve got to.â€ �
Many of them are getting their education
â€ “ at least their high school degrees .
The dropout rate for black students is now at 8 % , a record low .
At the same time , the number of black 18-to-24-year - olds who have a high school diploma or an equivalent has increased to 82 % , according to Pew Research Center .
A high school degree , however , will only get you so far .
Higher education has long been viewed as the way out of poverty .
Unfortunately , it comes at a cost : student loan debt .
For black students this cost is often greater than for their white classmates .
This burden often follows them for decades after school , reinforcing income and racial inequalities that are so prominent in the US .
A Gallup poll released in September found that in the last 14 years about half of black college students graduated with student debt over $ 25,000 â€ “ whereas only 35 % of white students did .
During that same time , the number of black Americans enrolled in college had increased by 74 % .
In 2012 , the total number of black college students was 2.96 million , up from 1.7 million in 2000 .
Black students make up 15 % of US college students .
Often , the only way for these students to afford the college education that eludes many of their friends and classmates is by taking on loans .
Four out of five black students take out loans to go to college .
They are also the most likely to hold the most debt â€ “ with an average debt burden of $ 28,692 as compared to $ 24,742 for white students , according to a 2012 report by the Center for American Progress .
The income inequality is often emphasised by racial inequality .
A Demos analysis of a recent US census report showed that on average white high school dropouts have more wealth than black college graduates .
â€œWhite families with less than a high school education
have $ 161,000 of wealth , which is higher than every black and Hispanic family , except those with college degrees ,
â€ �
Matt Bruenig wrote on Demosâ€ ™ s Policyshop blog .
Black families with college degrees have a mean wealth of $ 162.8k , which is effectively the same as the mean wealth of white families with less than a high school education .
The plight of black students should not come as a surprise .
There is deep racial inequality in the US .
In 2013 , the median income for black households was just $ 34,600 .
The poverty rate for black Americans is 27 % , almost three times that of white Americans .
Even those that manage to make it to college , often drop out because the financial burden is just too much .
The most recent college graduation rate for black students is 20.5 % , about half of the total US graduation rate of 39 % .
Itâ€ ™ s not that they lack drive or ambition .
Itâ€ ™ s that they often canâ€ ™ t afford to stay in school .
According to the Center for American Progress , â€œ69 % of black students who donâ€ ™ t finish school cite the burden of high student loan debt as the reason , compared with 43 % of their white peers.â€ �
Those that do graduate , do so with debt that will take years and years to pay off .
The student loan debt that many black college students have to take on in order to graduate can have lasting effects .
Just 17 % of black college graduates described themselves as thriving financially , compare to 29 % of all graduates , according to Gallup .
The Obamas have never made it a secret that loans helped finance their education .
Just this June , Obama tried to convey to Americaâ€ ™ s youth that he sympathises with their burden .
â€œNeither Michelle or I came from a lot of money , but with hard work , and help from scholarships and student loans , we got to go to great schools .
We did not have this kind of burden that weâ€ ™ re seeing , at least at the undergraduate stages
, â€ � he said .
â€œAs
I said , because of law school , we only finished paying off our own student loans just 10 years ago .
So we know what many of you are going through or look forward â€ “ or donâ€
™ t look forward to.â€ �
They are currently saving money for their daughtersâ€ ™ tuitions , he added .
According to Sallie Mae , about half of black families are doing the same .
On average , they manage to save up about $ 11,445 .
Currently , annual tuition for a public four - year college is on average $ 18,391 .
You do the math ."
2014-10-15,"The Obamasâ€ ™ use of social media to reach the American public is well documented .
But a slightly perplexing Vine which is doing the rounds on social media might just signal the start of a new era in political communications .
The six - second video shows Michelle Obama saying â€œturnip for what?â€ � , before nodding her head along to DJ Snake and Lil Jonâ€ ™
s
Turn Down for What .
The Vine was posted as part of a Q&amp;A organised by the First Ladyâ€ ™ s office on Tuesday afternoon to promote her â€œLetâ€ ™ s Moveâ€ � healthy lifestyle campaign .
The questions were collected from various social media platforms and seven of them were answered in Vine and SnappyTV videos posted to her Twitter account .
This one has had nearly 6 m plays and counting .
Michelleâ€ ™ s answer was in response to a question from the actor / director and online Obama impersonator Iman Crosson .
American politicians have embraced Vine with much more enthusiasm than British ones .
The Senate only approved the use of Vine in June last year and early offerings from US politicians were slightly , erm , dry â€ “ here
itâ€ ™ s being used by congressman Mark Takano .
But with time has come a bit more wit and technical skill , like this from the House Republicans account .
Or this from the House Democrats account .
British politics has been much slower to get involved .
The Conservative party does have a Vine account , but has posted no Vines .
Same goes for the Liberal Democrats .
David Cameronâ€ ™ s Vine account is similarly empty , but No . 10 has the reasonably active UK Prime Minister account .
The best UK political force when it comes to Vine is the Labour party , although itâ€ ™ s all relative .
And the overall winner in the fledgling art of British political Vines is â€ “ surprise , surprise - John Prescott ."
2014-10-21,"Online retailer Asos was back in fashion after full year figures came in line with expectations .
The group , a favourite of the likes of Rita Ora and Michelle Obama , has had a torrid year , with a fire at its Barnsley site , a major investment programme in its warehouses , the launch of a new business in China and the strong pound all hitting its results .
It issued three profit warnings this year , and seen its shares slump by 68 % .
But it has recovered 357p or 18 % to Â£23.01 after profits of Â£46.9 m , down 14 % but much as the City had expected .
Chief executive Nick Robertson said : Despite all that happened this year , we still delivered 27 % growth in sales , with the UK a standout performance at 35 % growth .
We are in a period of major investment that comes at a short term cost , but the medium term benefits will be significant .
Asos has always been about the longer journey to a very big prize to be the worldâ€ ™ s leading fashion destination for 20-somethings , and we are firmly focused on our next staging post of Â£2.5bn sales .
The unofficial aim is to reach that target by 2020 , said analysts .
Meanwhile chief financial officer Nick Beighton has become chief operating officer , with a search for his replacement underway .
Analyst John Stevenson at Peel Hunt said : The fightback begins .
With sales now broadly at the Â£1bn staging post ( Â£975 m ) , management is focusing on the next target , Â£2.5bn .
Management has come out fighting , with focus on operational metrics , noting highest ever order frequency , conversion and basket , exiting the year with 25 % increase in actives to 8.8 m .
There is no real new information in the statement , but it is very stat heavy in terms of new product introductions , efficiency and achievements .
Taking the potential to deliver Â£2.5bn sales base by 2020 at 6 % EBIT margin Asos would deliver 2020 pretax profit of around Â£150 m , earnings per share around 140p , implying six year earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 22.8 % for a current valuation of around 50x PE , 30 times enterprise value / EBITDA .
In comparison , boohoo offers stronger growth at a material discount , with Ted Bakerâ€ ™ s international growth platform already delivering more than 20 % earnings per share compound annual growth rate over the last five years and set to deliver the same for the next five .
Our high growth
Asos discounted cash flowanalysis ( based on 25 % sales growth per annum over 10 years , reaching 10 % EBIT margins ) comes out at around 2,700p .
Given short term disruption risk , we believe the risk remains on the downside .
Oriel Securities issued a reduce recommendation , saying : A small beat of the very much reduced consensus will reassure some but the fundamentals remain of concern .
The valuation still does not discount any bad news and management has work to do to rebuild its reputation ."
2014-10-29,"The rapper Pitbull , known for his shiny suits , reflective sunglasses and lecherous pop , is branching out into TV with two new reality series in development , in collaboration with the Weinstein Company .
The first , Pitbull :
The Lyfe , looks set to be a standard pop reality show :
a fly - on - the- wall look at Pitbullâ€ ™ s lifestyle , following him on tour and in the studio .
The second , however , is more ambitious .
The REAL Change Project will pair him with key people in sport , music and politics as they discuss the mentors that have aided them in their success .
Names attached to the project so far include Paul McCartney , Kobe Bryant , Lady Gaga and Michelle Obama .
The latter series will also feature â€œperformances to help raise money for teachers and educators
internationallyâ€ � , though itâ€ ™ s not clear whether the longed - for Paul McCartney and Pitbull collaboration will become a reality .
Harvey Weinstein called the shows â€œa phenomenal opportunityâ€ � in a statement , while Pitbull described them as â€œtwo series with the point of view that life is what we make it â€ “
some follow the rules , others bend them ...
we will show whatâ€ ™ s behind the curtain and most important , learning , listening from the best plays a huge role in the journey.â€
�
While a meeting between Michelle Obama and the man who sang â€œIâ€ ™ m the plumber tonight / Let me check your pipes /
Oh youâ€ ™ re
the healthy typeâ€ � might seem absurd to some , Pitbullâ€ ™ s political credentials are as healthy as said partnerâ€ ™ s pipes .
His father organised an exodus of hundreds of Cubans to Florida in the 1980s , and Pitbull has been outspoken against the Cuban regime , refusing to play there ; he has also previously partnered with an organisation that encourages Latinos to vote .
Neither of the shows has networks signed up yet , but Pitball has said that â€œthe party kicks off 2015.â€ � His new album Globalized is released on 24 November ."
2015-01-20,"In the weeks leading up to Tuesdayâ€ ™ s State of the Union address
, the White House broke from speech tradition and rolled out the kind of policy proposals usually reserved for unveiling behind the podium .
But the first ladyâ€ ™ s guest list in the viewing box may reveal the surprises to come :
itâ€ ™ s not just Alan Gross , who was held in Cuba for five years , getting an invitation to spend the night within earshot of Michelle Obama and eyesight of the president in Washingtonâ€ ™ s most watched seating box .
From the faces that could lead to Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œFerguson momentâ€ � to the humanity behind the partisan gridlock on issues like immigration , the environment and healthcare , these are the American stories the president will be highlighting , in order to get through the more difficult â€ “ but altogether less wonky and perhaps more memorable â€ “ parts of his penultimate State of the Union speech .
Race and policing : a teenager , a cop and an ex - convict set for reform Malik Bryant
The 13-year - old Chicago resident will be the youngest of nearly two dozen official guests in the box .
He was invited after a letter he sent to Santa Claus â€ “ a letter asking for â€œsafetyâ€ �
â€ “ was rerouted to the presidentâ€ ™ s desk .
Bryantâ€
™ s request could be tied to the racial tensions laid bare between police departments and citizens after the white police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri .
As protests grew across the nation , black 12-year - old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by police in Ohio .
What to watch for : Many have been calling for Obama to make a sweeping public statement about race and police violence , but he has taken a fairly cautious stance in the six monthâ€ ™ s since Brownâ€ ™ s death .
This could be the moment for long - awaited rhetoric .
Captain Phillip C Tingirides With protesters and everyday Americans pushing Obama to speak out on cop killings and the future of community policing ,
the White House has invited the Los Angeles Police Department captain .
Tingirides spearheaded a community policing program in Watts , a neighborhood famous for being the scene of race riots in 1965 .
What to watch for : Obama has created a task force to address the community issues , with recommendations due in March .
He could cite Tingirides as part of an emphasis on where heâ€ ™ d like those ideas to lean .
Prophet Walker
At age 27 , Walker has already served six years in prison for robbery , become a construction engineer and worked in multiple nonprofits aimed at improving the criminal justice system and police relations â€ “ including work with Tingirides of the LAPD .
What to watch for : With US attorney general Eric Holder headed for retirement , some have suggested that a roadmap for major justice - system reform may be in the offing .
Scott Kelly
The most prominent US astronaut of the moment , Kelly is preparing to become the first American to live and work on the International Space Station for a year .
Scientists will also compare Kellyâ€ ™ s medical data with that of his twin brother and fellow astronaut , Mark , to learn more about how the human body works in space .
What to watch for : Scott Kellyâ€ ™ s presence will probably serve as a reminder that Obama wants to send humans to Mars by the 2030s , despite cutting back Nasa funds .
The efforts of his brother and his brotherâ€ ™ s wife , Gabrielle Giffords , will only serve to reinforce the spectre of gun violence .
The economy : faces for Robin Hood , minimum wage and workers
Rebekah Erler Obama spent a day with this Minnesota resident , whose story he sees as a kind of microcosm of how middle - class families are making progress , but still struggling after the economic recession .
Perhaps the most audacious plan Obama outlined ahead of his speech is a proposal to close loopholes for the wealthiest Americans and reform the tax code to benefit the middle class .
What to watch for : The tax overture â€ “ already dubbed the â€œRobin Hoodâ€ � plan â€ “ would seem to dismantle some of the economic principles modern Republicans hold most dear .
The GOP has quickly voiced its opposition , but Obama is already trying to put a human face on the inequality front .
Catherine
Pugh The only politician to be invited into the box , Pugh is Marylandâ€ ™ s state senate majority leader and president - elect of the National Black Caucus of State Legislatures .
She pushed for a minimum wage increase in the state and has introduced a bill to give workers in the state earned paid sick leave .
What to watch for : A handful of local governments have pushed to raise minimum wage , and after years of demonstrations by workers demanding better treatment , large corporations are making small moves to acquiesce to their demands .
LeDaya Epps One of two women to complete a Los Angeles - area union apprenticeship in construction and now , after years of unstable employment , Epps has a job that enables her to support her three children .
What to watch for : Women still earn 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes , according to 2012 census data .
The data is even worse for African American women , who make 66 cents for every dollar all men make .
Carolyn Reed This Colorado resident and her husband own seven sandwich shops and credit the Small Business Administration loan program for allowing them to raise wages for all of their employees last year .
What to watch for : Meanwhile , large corporations are continuing to resist a movement to raise hourly rates for low - wage workers .
And the overall benefits of the SBA loan program have been challenged in several studies .
Studies also show that racial discrimination in loan programs is a pressing issue .
Victor Fugate
This Missouri resident was employed for â€œa
whileâ€ � a few years ago but earned a degree and found a full - time job .
He credited the Affordable Care Act and student loan payment plans for helping himself and his wife get security .
What to watch for : Unemployment rates are continuing to drop , but the latest figures show nine million Americans are still out of work .
And many of those regaining employment are doing so in low - wage industries .
Long - term unemployment is still a problem , with people out of jobs for 27 weeks or more accounting for 32 % of the unemployed .
Tiairris Woodward
This mother of three used to work 17 hours a day at Chrysler and a local school system in Michigan before joining a union and Chryslerâ€ ™ s tuition assistance program .
What to watch for :
Detroitâ€ ™ s recovery is an important spot for Obama to highlight his contributions to the economy , but the cityâ€ ™ s long struggle and nascent rebound are individual to the city , one of several that has had to file for bankruptcy in the wake of the economic recession .
War , peace and diplomacy â€ “ including the face of Cuban - American relations Jason Gibson
After being gravely wounded in Afghanistan , Gibson told Obama that he received excellent healthcare , has become a new father and is moving into a new home .
His story comes months after Veterans Affairs secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in May after failing to conceal or remedy the dangerous systemic backlog of veterans waiting for care on hospital waiting lists .
What to watch for : The Afghanistan war may be winding down , but with many plates to spin on national security and foreign policy , this may be the way to bring it all back home .
Alan and Judy Gross With much fanfare and a menschy press conference
, Alan Gross returned to the US in December after being held in Cuba for five years .
The surprise return accompanied the news that the US would finally ease its relations with Cuba .
What to watch for : The Cuban embargo is still in place and some are concerned about how restoring relations could affect immigration law , a key issue in Obamaâ€ ™ s presidency .
The tough stuff : immigration , the environment and Obamacare Ana Zamora
The daughter of two people living in the US illegally , Zamora travelled from Texas to Washington for the speech as a representative of the benefits of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .
What to watch for : The official White House statement says Zamoraâ€ ™ s parents are â€œpotentially eligibleâ€ � to benefit from the executive action on immigration Obama announced in November .
His sweeping action overlooked the parents of people who were given temporarily relief and work authorization under Daca .
Nicole Hernandez Hammer
An environmental activist who also works as a sea level rise researcher , Hernandez Hammer is working to show how climate change will have devastating effects on her local community in south Florida and the rest of the world .
What to watch for : Obama has announced plans to curb emissions , but the state of the global environment is still dismal , as a report released last week shows that 2014 was the hottest year on record .
Critics say his plan to curb methane emissions overlooks existing oil and gas infrastructure and the considerable pollution it creates .
Astrid Muhammad Muhammad sent a letter to Obama , praising the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) for allowing her to get treatment for a potentially fatal brain tumor .
Under previous healthcare laws , she could have been turned away for having a â€œpre - existing conditionâ€ � .
What to watch for : The law she credits with effectively saving her life is still facing pushback from Republican lawmakers , and the overall economic benefits of the ACA are still unclear .
But itâ€ ™ s tough to jeer a mother of two .
William Elder Jr
This medical student benefited from precision medicine to treat his cystic fibrosis , inspiring him to pursue a career in family medicine with a focus on preventive care .
What to watch for : While his story is touted for showing the benefits of precision medicine , an emerging type of treatment , such nuanced discussions of healthcare are largely unacknowledged in the current political climate as Republicans focus on undoing the five - year - old Obamacare program .
Kathy Pham
This guest blends the worlds of technology and health to improve treatment and care for Americans , especially veterans like her brother .
There has been a drop in backlog claims , which represent the amount of first - time claims to Veteran Affairs that have been unresolved for more than four months , but the latest report shows that it still at about 245,000 .
What to watch for : Phamâ€ ™ s mother also received cancer treatment because of the ACA , which the new Republican majority is attempting to dismantle over the coming months .
Larry Merlo
The president and CEO of CVS Health was invited to the speech because of his companyâ€ ™ s initiative to hire some of the groups hardest hit by the economic downturn : veterans , the long - term unemployed and transition workers moving off public assistance .
What to watch for : The administration also praised his commitment to health , pointing to the storeâ€ ™ s decision to eliminate tobacco sales at all of its stores .
The decision is beneficial , but also overlooks the collection of enormously unhealthy products it continues to stock .
Pranav Shetty
The Washington DC - based doctor has been shuttling between west Africa in the US as a critical figure in the fight against Ebola , which has killed more than 7,500 people since the latest outbreak started in December 2013 .
What to watch for : Liberia and districts in Sierra Leone began the year reporting a decline in the number of outbreaks , but Americans are now using these successes to point to the need to address other global health issues besetting the international community .
Education : affordability , debt and diversity Anthony Mendez
The first person to graduate from high school in his family , this University of Hartford will be in the first ladyâ€ ™ s box because he exemplifies Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s Reach Higher initiative .
The program encourages students to complete some form of education past high school , even if they face setbacks like Mendez , who was at one point living with his family in his homeless shelter .
What to watch for : Students interested in pursuing higher education , however , must face a system of high tuition and the resulting student loan debt .
Katrice Mubiru
This career - technical education teacher wrote to the president to share stories about students achieving degrees in spite of the financial challenges .
Obama highlighted the importance of technical programs in a visit to the school Mubiru teaches at .
What to watch for : Technical education programs are not as costly as a four - year degree â€ “ and theyâ€ ™ re meant to address the opportunity gap faced by low - income families and non - white students .
Chelsey Davis Sheâ€ ™ s set to graduate from Pellissippi State Community College in her home state of Tennessee this year .
Earlier this month , Obama promoted his proposal to make two years of community college free at Davisâ€ ™ s school , but it was immediately met with opposition from the House speaker , John Boehner .
What to watch for : The community college plan requires congressional approval , and its $ 60bn price tag is unlikely to sway the Republican majority ."
2015-01-20,"A 13-year - old boy from Chicagoâ€ ™ s South Side will be first lady
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s guest at the State of the Union address after his letter to Santa Claus pleading for safety drew the White Houseâ€ ™ s attention .
â€œAll I ask for is for safety , â€ �
Malik Bryant wrote to Santa in a letter that reached Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s desk .
â€œI
just wanna be safe.â€ � Malik and more than 8,000 other public school students in the city wrote letters for DirectEffect Charities , but his simple , handwritten note caught the eye of the programâ€ ™ s CEO , Michelle DiGiacomo , who sent a copy of it to her congressman , Michael Quigley .
Quickly then forwarded it to the White House .
Malik lives in Chicagoâ€ ™ s Englewood neighborhood , a poor area with high crime rates in a part of the city where gang violence is particularly bad .
Bryantâ€
™ s
mother told the Chicago Sun - Times that her son sometimes canâ€ ™ t go outside â€œbecause he has to cross gang lines and walk past all these gang members on some of those blocksâ€ � .
Malikâ€ ™ s letter reads : Dear Santa , I would like to ask you sum but first Imma tell you about me .
Iâ€ ™ m a black African American .
I stand 5â€ ™ 10â€ ™ â€ ™ Iâ€ ™ m in 7th grade .
My favorite subject is math .
I have 2 siblings living with me and Iâ€ ™ m the only boy on my moms side of my family .
But anyway all I ask for is safety .
I just wanna be safe .
Sincerely , Malik Bryant .
The letter also lists â€œscarf , gloves , hat , school suppliesâ€
� below , though Bryant does not explicitly ask for them .
President Obama wrote back in December : I want to offer you a few words of encouragement this holiday season .
Each day , I strive to sensure communities like yours are safe places to dream , discover , and grow .
Please know your security is a priority for me in everything I do as President .
If you dare to be bold and creative , work hard every day , and care for others , Iâ€
™ m confident you can achieve anything you imagine .
I wish you and your family the very bets in the coming year , and I will be rooting for you .
Sincerely , Barack Obama .
â€œAll he ever hears on the news about our neighborhood is shootings , gangs and violence , â€ � his mother continued .
Malik told the Sun - Times he would like to play professional basketball or become a teacher , but said that he doesnâ€ ™ t feel comfortable even going outside .
He described seeing a teenager dead from a gunshot wound and â€œjump - onsâ€ � of gang beatings .
Guests of the first lady are often called by name during the presidential address to highlight particular points and agendas during the speech .
Obama may speak about growing racial tensions between minorities and police around the US , in particular about the police shootings of 18-year - old Michael Brown in Ferguson and 12-year - old Tamir Rice in Cleveland .
Michelle Obama also invited a Los Angeles police department captain , Phillip C Tingrides , and a convicted robber and current reform activist , Prophet Walker , adding to speculation that the president will speak about policing and criminal justice reform .
You can read more about the guests at the address here ."
2015-01-20,"Tuesday at President Obamaâ€ ™ s penultimate State of the Union address , when Obama points for effect at someone sitting with the First Lady as her guest , every single guest around her should be a family member of someone killed by a police officer .
I want to see Michelle Obama sandwiched between Erica Garner â€ “ whose father , Eric Garner , was killed by an NYPD officer using an illegal chokehold â€ “ and Tamir Riceâ€ ™ s 14-year - old sister , who was tackled and shackled by police when trying to help her dying 12-year - old brother .
I want to see Leslie McSpadden , Michael Brownâ€ ™ s mother there tonight , and a relative of Tasha Thomas , John Crawfordâ€ ™ s now - deceased girlfriend , who was interrogated by the same police department whoâ€ ™ d just killed the father of her children for shopping at Wal Mart .
Let America look upon the elder Michael Brown , Kadiatou Diallo (
Amadou Dialloâ€ ™ s mother ) , Constance Malcolm ( Ramarley Grahamâ€ ™ s mother ) , Sylvia Palmer ( Akai Gurleyâ€ ™ s mother ) or any of the thousands of relatives of the 1,100 or so Americans killed by police in 2014 .
This of course will never happen , but itâ€ ™ s what I want .
President Obama should use the political theatre of his â€œSkutniksâ€ �
â€ “ the humans used to give a face to presidential pet problems since Ronald Reagan invited Lenny Skutnik to the State of the Union in 1982 â€ “ to focus Americanâ€ ™ s attention squarely on the loss of human life when cops kill black civilians .
If President Obama wants us to believe that he thinks black life matters , itâ€ ™ s not enough for him to form a task force on 21 century policing : task forces and commissions are where serious reforms go to be forgotten .
One police shooting victimâ€ ™ s
family member up in his box with a nice cop like Richmond , California Police Chief Chris Magnus ( who famously held up a # BlackLivesMatters sign ) is not enough .
We donâ€ ™ t need a black kid - white cop hug moment .
When the President paired up a black victim of racism with kindly white folks at his â€œbeer summitâ€ � in 2009 it was a disaster â€ “ at best a distraction , and at worst a prevarication that racism is anecdotal and not systematic .
If President Obama is serious about showing black and brown life matters in this country â€ “ heâ€
™ s made some progress showing this overseas by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , though not so much by employing drone warfare in Pakistan â€ “
he needs to go big at the State of the Union .
Heâ€ ™ s taken on black lives falling victim to gun violence at his annual address before by inviting the parents of Hidaya Pendleton , a black Chicago teenager who was killed in 2013 shortly after performing at Obamaâ€ ™ s second inaugural .
But as Commander in Chief , with all those black folks at his side , Obama could challenge the mortal violence the state itself wages against its citizens through the local police and say to them : Enough .
Ronald Reagan , whom Barack Obama uses as an example for how to sell himself as president , used Lenny Skutnik as an example of how â€œwe saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest , â€ � after Skutnik jumped into icy water of the Potomac River to help the drowning after a plane crash .
But are not the kin of those killed by police violence also displaying â€œAmerican heroism at its finestâ€ � in helping those who canâ€ ™ t breathe ?
It is women like Tawanda Jones who are creating a more perfect union when she boldly speaks out about her brother being killed by police â€ “ even when dissent is under attack and Fox News broadcasts lies about her .
When Erica Garner visits the site where two NYPD cops were killed to offer her condolences , she is saving the union .
Every time a woman like Michael Brownâ€ ™ s mother calls for non - violence â€ “ when she could instead , understandably , lash out with a fraction of the hatred which killed her son â€
“
she is keeping the nation from ripping itself apart and acting with the kind of American heroism that presidents should applaud loudly and publicly .
Skutnik helped save one woman .
The black women who bury their sons and husbands and seek to change the systems that caused their deaths may save countless of lives â€ “ and maybe even the soul of the nation .
The Black Lives Matters movement is a testament that , once again , black Americans are being called upon to force all Americans to examine our addiction to the violence and militarism that oppresses everyone in different ways .
Our first black president , riding an 18 month approval rating high , could choose to do some of that himself tonight , by acknowledging those left behind when black lives are ended by the state and who still choose to use their grief to effect positive change ."
2015-01-21,"First lady Michelle Obama channeled another powerful political woman on Tuesday night when she appeared at the State of the Union address in a gray Michael Kors suit .
Eagle - eye television fans spotted the wide - collared tweed jacket as one sported last season by Julianna Marguliesâ€ ™ s character Alicia Florrick on the CBS drama The Good Wife .
Like the first lady , Florrick is a lawyer and the wife of a powerful figure in Chicago politics
â€ “ the governor of Illinois .
ABC reported that the Kors top , called the Origami Collar Tweed Jacket , retails for just under $ 800 .
The first lady has worn Michael Kors designs several times before .
Her 2012 election night victory dress was a Kors design
sheâ€ ™ d worn at least twice before .
The first ladyâ€ ™ s outfit was almost overshadowed by the presidentâ€ ™ s attire .
Just before 8 pm ET , senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer teased his audience with a variation of Obamaâ€ ™ s 2008 campaign slogan and a picture of a tan suit .
Speculation raged on Twitter that the president would be wearing the suit he famously wore at news conference in August .
Instead , the president appeared before Congress on Tuesday wearing a dark suit , white shirt and blue tie .
Pfeiffer chastised the media industry for its immediate response to his Tuesday night Tweet : â€œEveryone visit the Obama library years from now , pull all the reporter emails on the tan suit tweet and then decide whether to laugh or cry.â€ �
Republican senator Joni Ernst , of Iowa , wore camouflage - print heels before her rebuttal speech .
Ernst is the only female combat veteran to serve in the US Senate and her speech is expected to criticize Obamaâ€ ™ s military actions .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wore a bright red coat and printed scarf , accessorized with a copy of the New York Times .
â€œWhatâ€ ™ s with Paul
Ryanâ€ ™ s beard?â€ � the DC media asked when the latest session of Congress began earlier this month .
But Republican congressman Paul Ryan appeared beard free for the event ."
2015-01-27,"On Monday , the Obamas attended the Indiaâ€ ™ s State Dinner at Rashtrapati Bhawan , the presidential palace in Delhi , and , once again , as various eyewitnesses have reported , Michelleâ€ ™ s outfit broke the internet .
Wearing a navy - print brocade jacquard dress by Carolina Herrera and taupe / grey flats she managed to match and/or complement the carpet , chairs , floor â€ “ and sundry medals and decorations .
Props also to Obama for matching his tie to the curtains at the back ."
2015-01-28,"Michelle Obama has drawn attention to the severe restrictions placed on women in Saudi Arabia by not wearing a headscarf during a visit to the country after the death of King Abdullah .
The US first ladyâ€ ™ s decision to not cover her hair when she and President Obama met Abdullahâ€ ™ s successor , King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud , on Tuesday caused a stir on social media , prompting the hashtag # michelle_obama_notveiled .
Her statement brought plenty of positive responses on Twitter : However , others were less impressed :
Other than not covering her head , Obama dressed conservatively in black pants and a long jacket , which is often chosen by western women visiting the kingdom though forbidden for Saudi women .
Some members of the all - male Saudi delegation shook her hand as they greeted the Obamas , while others simply nodded to her as they passed by .
Obamaâ€ ™ s decision to skip the headscarf illustrates the restraints placed on women living in Saudi Arabia , who are required to wear a headscarf and loose black robes in public .
Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their hair and face with a niqab .
Saudi Arabia imposes many restrictions on women through the strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law known as Wahhabism .
Genders are strictly segregated .
Women are banned from driving , although there have been campaigns in recent years to lift that ban .
Guardianship laws require women to get permission from a male relative to travel , marry , enrol in higher education or undergo certain surgical procedures .
However , women will be able to vote and run for office for the first time in local council elections this year , although under the countryâ€ ™ s absolute monarchy these bodiesâ€ ™ powers are very limited .
Earlier on Tuesday before flying to the Middle East , President Obama challenged Indiaâ€ ™ s record on religious tolerance and womenâ€ ™ s rights in a parting speech to students in Delhi that contrasted with the at - times saccharin feel of a state visit designed to highlight the closeness of the two countries .
Though careful to acknowledge inequality in the US , the president devoted a substantial part of his speech to a lecture on the importance of empowering women in society and addressed a recent spate of sexual attacks in the emerging south Asian power .
â€œWe know from experience that nations are more successful when their women are successful , â€ � said Obama .
â€œThese are facts .
So if nations really want to succeed in todayâ€ ™ s global economy , they canâ€ ™ t simply ignore the talents of half of their people.â€ �"
2015-01-28,"Yes , Michelle Obama wore her hair uncovered during an official visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday .
And yes , some people on the internet found this inappropriate .
But no , dear sweet internet , no , she is neither the first female US official nor the first western official to bare her hair in the kingdom .
Michelle Obama landed in Riyadh wearing a pair of loose - fitting trousers and a loose - fitting blouse , topped with a long - sleeved jacket that hit right at the knee .
Despite her jacketâ€ ™ s bright hues , the outfit was respectful and modest , with nary a collarbone in sight â€ “ seemingly appropriate attire in which to pay respects to the deceased monarch of Saudi Arabia , King Abdullah .
Twitter hashtags were created in outrage , delivering predictable media attention to the first ladyâ€ ™ s hair , immaculate as ever though it was .
But the attention is misplaced .
Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œstatementâ€ � was swiftly praised as an unabashed and â€œbraveâ€ � comment on the countryâ€ ™ s restrictive rights for women , by social media users around the world .
Republican senator Ted Cruz even praised â€œFLOTUS for standing up for women and refusing to wear Sharia - mandated head
scarfâ€
� .
The vehement praise was matched by equally vehement â€œoutrageâ€ � on Twitter , with thousands of users tweeting in both Arabic and English about the â€œdisrespectfulâ€ � and â€œinappropriateâ€ � move by the wife of the US president .
( Though when there are 2.4 million Twitter users in Saudi Arabia representing roughly 40 % of the regionâ€ ™ s active tweeters , â€œoutrageâ€ � expressed by less than two thousand seems like a drop in the bucket . )
Obamaâ€ ™ s uncovered hair could hardly be accused of creating irreparable diplomatic damage : Saudi officials shook the first ladyâ€ ™ s hand , while others greeted her with a nod .
But the hair that launched a thousand vitriol - filled Twitter ships likely remained uncovered in keeping with US diplomatic protocols , long since established .
Though the office of the first lady declined to comment , the White House principal deputy press secretary , Eric Schultz , said at a press briefing : â€œThe attire the first lady wore on this trip is consistent with what first ladies in the past have worn â€ “ First Lady Laura Bush , what Secretary Clinton wore on her business to Saudi Arabia , Chancellor Merkel on her business to Saudi Arabia and including other members of the United States delegation at the time.â€ �
The Saudi Arabian kingdom enforces a relatively conservative dress code in public spaces across most parts of the country ( particularly in Riyadh ) , which for women requires wearing a full - length black robe , known as an abaya , and a cover for their hair .
This is in keeping with the restrictive laws governing womenâ€ ™ s rights in the country , which includes the guardianship system which restricts womenâ€ ™ s independent free movement , and the inability to drive .
Foreign female visitors to the kingdom are generally recommended to abide by the traditional dress code , though often they do not , particularly when they visit the country as part of a foreign delegation .
According to the UK foreign office : â€œWomen should observe the strict Saudi dress code and wear conservative and loose - fitting clothes.â€ �
According to the US State Department website : â€œWomen who choose not to conform to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by the Mutawwa [ Commission of the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice ] and possible detention and arrest.â€ �
In pictures of the same visit to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday , neither Nancy Pelosi nor Condoleezza Rice can be seen wearing head scarves ( and neither did any of the female members of the 27-person - strong delegation including White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and national security adviser Susan Rice ) , mirroring what previous high - ranking members of the US administration have done in the past .
On several visits to the kingdom during her time as US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton did not wear a headscarf either .
Angela Merkel forwent a head covering during her visit to the kingdom in May 2010 , while former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singhâ€ ™ s wife , Gursharan Kaur , did not cover her hair and bared a forearm during a 2013 visit .
â€œIt really is not required for western women to wear a headscarf when they are in a Muslim country , â€ � Anita McBride , the former chief of staff to Laura Bush , told CBS News .
â€œThey could do it , certainly it is a sign of respect but itâ€ ™ s not a requirement , and having traveled to Saudi Arabia myself , and with Mrs Bush , the only time she put a headscarf on was when it was given to her as a gift by a group of breast cancer survivors who made it for her.â€ �
Some keen tweeters noted that Obama wore a headscarf on an official visit to Indonesia in 2010 â€ “ though she wore the head cover during a visit to a mosque in keeping with convention and not elsewhere on her trip .
Anita McBride noted that Laura Bush also wore a veil when she visited the Vatican .
Ultimately , Obamaâ€ ™ s â€œstatementâ€ � was likely nothing more than convention .

2015-02-08,"Americaâ€ ™ s biggest new TV show is a gaudy family saga described as a â€œblack Dynastyâ€ � by its creator , featuring music by uber - producer Timbaland and counting Michelle Obama among its numerous celebrity fans .
In the five weeks since its premiere on Fox , Empire â€ “ essentially a mashup between The Lion in Winter and The Godfather and set in the world of hip - hop music â€ “ has pulled in 11.5 million viewers and dominated watercooler chat .
The internet is awash with memes from the show , while episodes are gleefully discussed on Twitter by viewers whose jaws appear to be in a state of permanent dislocation from the gloriously ripe dialogue .
Its creator , Lee Daniels , the director of films as diverse as Precious and The Paperboy , wouldnâ€ ™ t have it any other way .
â€œ[I wanted audiences ] to sit there and go â€˜No , this bitch didnâ€ ™ t !
Oh my fucking
God!â€
™ â€ �
he admitted in the Hollywood Reporter .
Yet while Empire relishes its crazier moments , whiplash plot twists and Naomi Campbell appearances , itâ€ ™ s also tackling issues from homophobia to abuse with the sort of uncomfortable honesty rarely seen on network TV .
â€œThe way in which the show balances a sense of authenticity with some of the more audacious moments is key to its success , â€ � says Ilene Chaiken , Empireâ€ ™ s executive producer .
â€œLee has really embraced the idea of it being a black Dynasty but from the beginning Iâ€ ™ ve said to him youâ€ ™ re being too modest â€ “ this show is so much more than that .
Thereâ€ ™ s an honesty to the story
weâ€ ™ re telling and audiences have responded to that.â€ � Empire has increased its ratings in each of its five weeks on air , the first show to have done so in 20 years , and a Nielsen report suggested that it was watched in 33 % of black households .
Now critics are wondering if it heralds a new era for television programming .
A report in New York Magazine stated that â€œamong African - American women between 35 and 49 , the show is literally the equivalent of a Super Bowlâ€ � in that the percentages of those viewers watching â€œexceeded the ratings of some NFL championship games this centuryâ€ � .
Itâ€ ™ s easy to see the appeal of this over - the - top tale of ailing mogul Lucious Lyon ( Terrence Howard )
, his estranged wife Cookie ( a magnificent Taraji P Henson ) and their three sons , all jostling for control of Empire Records , the label Lucious built from the ground up .
For starters itâ€ ™ s exceedingly quotable , most notably when Hensonâ€ ™ s Cookie strides onto the screen .
â€œThe streets ainâ€ ™ t made for everybody , thatâ€ ™ s why they made sidewalks ,
â€ � she spat memorably in a recent episode , with other zingers including â€œJust â€˜cos
I asked Jesus to forgive you doesnâ€
™ t mean I doâ€ � and â€œWe donâ€ ™ t have time for you to be having some mental artsy block brain fart , whatever youâ€ ™ re having.â€ �
The show pulls as few punches as its ferocious leading lady .
A plotline about Luciousâ€ ™ s refusal to accept his talented , gay middle son is both sensitively handled and a repository for some outrageous lines .
â€œFor a queen , you sure do keep a messy place , â€ � says Cookie to her favourite child .
One recent episode saw bratty youngest son Hakeem unleash a drunken tirade in a restaurant
â€ “ the object of his opprobrium was Barack Obama , whom he branded â€œnothing but a selloutâ€ � .
The scene caused controversy , although as Henson told Time magazine : â€œ[The scene ] was to prove a point about how reckless young kids are nowadays â€ ¦
they donâ€
™ t understand hard work , what it took for that man to get into office.â€ �
Certainly the fallout doesnâ€ ™ t seem to have halted Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s love for the show ; in a recent radio interview the president admitted heâ€ ™ d yet to see it but his wife was â€œreally into itâ€ � .
Sheâ€
™ s not the only one .
In addition to Campbell playing Hakeemâ€ ™ s mistress , there have been appearances from Cuba Gooding Jr , Gabourey Sidibe and Gladys Knight ; coming episodes are rumoured to feature Rita Ora , Jennifer Hudson , Snoop Dogg , Patti LaBelle and Macy Gray , while Courtney Love will play a hard - living rock star on Luciousâ€ ™ s books .
When Daniels took to Instagram last week to suggest he was tapping Denzel Washington for a role , fans almost expired with excitement even as they recognised it was probably a passing joke between dinner companions .
Behind the screen the talent is equally starry .
One episode was directed by John Singleton of Boyz n the Hood fame and the writing staff includes Orange prize - nominated crime writer Attica Locke , whose highly anticipated third novel , Pleasantville , is out this spring .
â€œItâ€
™ s been fabulous how many talented people have wanted to get involved , both in front of and behind the camera , â€ � says Chaiken .
â€œI think that affirms just how much of a game - changer this really is .
Thereâ€ ™ s a real excitement about putting this world on screen and taking risks , allowing the characters to behave badly and make mistakes.â€ �
Yet , for all the excitement now , critics were initially unsure of Empireâ€ ™ s potential .
Musical dramas are often a risky proposition , although the involvement of Timbaland meant that this had more pedigree than most , and there was some doubt over whether audiences would tune into a show with a predominantly black cast .
The doubts have been replaced by the sense that Empire has tapped into a market that was always present but too long ignored .
In 2013 a Nielsen report suggested black viewers watched more TV than any other US demographic , yet on screen they remained in supporting roles and bit parts .
The success of Shonda Rhimes - produced shows such as Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder , which feature diverse casts and black women in lead roles , has gone some way to change that .
Now Empire , with its almost entirely black cast , is set to ring the changes still further , possibly leading to what Mara Brock Akil , the creator of popular US show Being Mary Jane , which airs on the Black Entertainment Television network , has termed â€œblack on purposeâ€ � casting in contrast to â€œcolour blindâ€ � .
Daniels admits heâ€
™ s been overwhelmed .
â€œNo one could have told me that a television show airing one night could reach more people than all my movies combined , â€ �
he told Vanity Fair last week .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve always been that â€˜film guyâ€ ™ who looked down on television .
Not any more .
I also never thought Iâ€ ™
d see the day when black people would be all over the television .
Itâ€ ™ s wonderful , isnâ€ ™ t it?â€ �"
2015-03-04,"A shocking set of racist emails sent by senior Ferguson law enforcement officials depict Barack Obama as a chimpanzee and characterize Michelle Obama as a bare - chested African woman , according to a damning federal investigation into civil rights violations committed by the police force .
Extracts from seven emails sent by Ferguson police supervisors , published in a long - awaited US Justice Department report released on Wednesday , were seized upon by investigators as illustrative of the â€œunequivocally derogatory ,
dehumanizingâ€ � array of communications obtained in the investigation that were â€œdemonstrative of impermissible biasâ€ � .
In one email , sent in April 2011 , the president is depicted as a chimpanzee .
Another , sent in October 2011 , includes a photograph of dancing women , â€œapparently in Africaâ€ � , with the caption â€œMichelle Obamaâ€ ™ s
High School Reunionâ€ � .
The authors of the emails were not made clear by the federal report .
A June 2011 email describes a man seeking â€œwelfareâ€ � for his dogs as they are â€œmixed in color , unemployed , lazy , canâ€ ™ t speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddies are.â€ �
While another , sent in May 2011 stated : â€œAn African - American woman in New Orleans was admitted into hospital for pregnancy termination .
Two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000 .
She phoned the hospital to ask who it from .
The hospital said , â€˜Crimestoppers.â€ ™ â€ �
Other emails :
Suggest that Obama would not be president for long with the line â€œwhat black man holds a steady job for four yearsâ€ � .
Mock African Americans through speech stereotypes .
Include jokes â€œbased on offensive stereotypes about Muslimsâ€ � .
A separate Justice Department report , also released on Wednesday , cleared the former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in relation to the August killing of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown .
The Justice Department report into the broader behaviour of the Ferguson police notes that the emails come from individuals who are all currently employed Ferguson officials sent from their official emails during work hours , and states that some were sent by police commanders .
Although the report does not name the senders of the extracted emails , a footnote reveals that in 2012 , the Ferguson city manager , John Shaw , forwarded an email that â€œplayed upon stereotypes of Latinosâ€ � .
However , the city manager then sent another email â€œwithin
minutesâ€ � apologising for the â€œinappropriate and offensiveâ€ � message , after claiming not have to seen its entire contents .
â€œOur review of documents revealed many additional email communications that exhibited racial or ethnic bias , as well as other forms of bias , â€ � the report states .
â€œOur investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined.â€ �
The report notes that investigators were able to review many more emails sent by senior Ferguson police personnel , as their correspondence is backed up on hard drives â€ “ whereas patrol officers use a form of email that does not retain messages after they are deleted .
The report continues : â€œThe racial animus and stereotypes expressed by these supervisors suggest that they are unlikely to hold an officer accountable for discriminatory conduct or take any steps to discourage the development or perpetuation of racial stereotypes among officers.â€ �"
2015-03-13,"A presenter on the Spanish - language network Univision has defended himself after he was fired for making comments which appeared to compare US first lady Michelle Obama to â€œsomething from the cast of Planet of the Apesâ€ � .
The comments were made by the Emmy - award winning presenter Rodner Figueroa on the entertainment programme El Gordo y la Flaca on Wednesday .
Univision swiftly condemned Figueroaâ€ ™ s words .
In a statement released on Thursday , the network said : â€œRodner Figueroa made comments regarding first lady Michelle Obama that were completely reprehensible and in no way reflect Univisionâ€ ™ s values or views.â€ �
The statement concluded by saying Figueroaâ€ ™ s employment had been â€œimmediately terminatedâ€ � .
The situation is slightly murkier than it may have at first appeared .
In the segment of the show in question , Figueroa had been discussing the work of a Filipino makeup artist named Paolo Ballesteros , who specialises in transforming himself into celebrities â€ “ including Kim Kardashian , Dakota Johnson and Cate Blanchett , as well as Michelle Obama â€ “ and posting pictures to his Instagram account .
After a co - presenter tells him he is being disrespectful , Figueroa mentions the film again .
The co - presenter says : â€œI think Michele Obama is an attractive woman.â€ �
Figueroa responds :
â€œItâ€ ™ s a representation he has done which I canâ€ ™ t get my head round.â€ �
In a letter released through his PR firm , in Spanish and translated by the Guardian , Figueroa apologised but argued his remarks had been misinterpreted , saying he had been disparaging Ballesterosâ€ ™ s makeup talent , not making a slur about the first lady .
â€œI offer my sincere apologies for a comment which I made about a depiction of you by a makeup artist , â€ � said Figueroa in the letter , which is addressed to Michelle Obama personally , adding : â€œI want to clarify that I am not racist and my comment was in no way directed at you.â€ �
Figueroa said that he felt â€œembarrassedâ€ � and asked forgiveness from the first lady , saying that he had twice voted for Barack Obama .
â€œI apologise , because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make the kind of comment which can be interpreted as offensive and racist in these volatile times this country is living through , â€ � he said .
â€œI take responsibility for this lack of judgment on my part , but I can not accept being labelled as racist by anybody â€ “ and to be fired for this and publicly humiliated by Univision after 17 years at this company .
â€œHowever disagreeable and out of line my comment may have been interpreted to have been , I donâ€ ™ t deserve to be labelled a racist and I have to defend myself.â€ �
He also alleged that his termination had come after a direct complaint made by the White House ; representatives from the office of the first lady could not be reached to confirm this .
Univision could not be reached for comment ."

2015-04-03,"First lady Michelle Obama touched on family , mom dancing , the White House Easter egg roll and , of course , getting kids to eat broccoli when she appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Thursday .
Promoting the fifth year of her healthy eating and exercise campaign , the first ladyâ€ ™ s interview lasted through two commercial breaks .
â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to put my vegetables into everything , but thereâ€ ™ s a sneaky way to do it ,
â€ � Fallon said , about hiding vegetables in his two toddler daughtersâ€ ™ food .
â€œOne thing I did with my kids
, it was basic , if you donâ€ ™ t eat your vegetables
, you canâ€ ™ t have a treat ,
â€ � Obama said , adding that if dinner wasnâ€ ™ t finished she didnâ€ ™ t serve late night meals .
She quipped that after â€œa couple days of starvationâ€ � the children would eat anything .
â€œThey get the point â€

2015-04-03,"Senior police officers and a city official in Ferguson , Missouri , exchanged emails that likened ethnic minority welfare recipients to dogs and joked about stoning Muslim women , it emerged on Friday .
The previously undisclosed messages were released along with full copies of emails referenced in a report by the US Department of Justice that led to the dismissal of a series of senior city officials last month .
One of those emails depicted Barack Obama as a chimpanzee , another doubted his ability as a black man to hold a job for four years , while a third labelled a photograph of a black tribal gathering â€œMichelle Obamaâ€ ™ s high school reunionâ€ � .
The emails were released to the Guardian and other media outlets in response to public records requests filed following the publication of the Justice Departmentâ€ ™ s damning report .
They were written or forwarded by court clerk Mary Ann Twitty , police captain Rick Henke and police sergeant William Mudd .
One email sent from Mudd to Twitty joked that a man had initially been declined state welfare payments for his pet dogs but was successful after explaining they were â€œmixed in color , unemployed , lazy , canâ€ ™ t speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddies areâ€ � .
Included among a series of â€œone - linersâ€ � forwarded by Twitty to Mudd and Henke was a joke about a man who discovered his wife had an affair .
â€œBut , by turning to religion , I was soon able to come to terms with the whole thing ,
â€ � it said .
â€œI converted to Islam , and weâ€ ™ re stoning her in the morning!â€
�
The three former officials could not be reached for comment .
Twitty and Mudd did not respond to messages from the Guardian requesting comment after their dismissals last month .
â€œSome of these emails just touch me more than others , â€ � said the email depicting Obama as a chimpanzee in the arms of former president Ronald Reagan .

2015-04-24,"On any given night , 50,000 of our nationâ€ ™ s veterans are without a safe place to sleep .
As First Lady Michelle Obama said : â€œWhen a Veteran comes home kissing the ground , it is unacceptable that he should ever have to sleep on it.â€ �
In New Orleans , we have proven it doesnâ€
™ t have to be this way by becoming the first major city in America to end veteran homelessness .
And , in doing so , we developed a model that will not only help other cities end veteran homelessness , but can also guide our efforts in tackling the issues that face this nationâ€ ™ s large homeless population .
Immediately after Hurricane Katrina , many of us knew what it felt like to be homeless .
In fact , we had more than 11,600 homeless residents in the years after the storm ( that number is now down to less than 2,000 ) .
Thatâ€ ™ s why one of my top priorities as mayor has been to help all the residents of our city who , for whatever reason , now find themselves on the streets â€ “ and especially our veterans , by whom we can all do better .
We took up the charge to be the first major city in America to complete First Lady Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s
Mayors Challenge to
End Veteran Homeless by the end of 2015 â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s precisely what we did .
In January 2015 , New Orleans became the first major city in America to end homelessness among veterans â€ “ a full year ahead of the national goal .
It was an extraordinary moment , but it took time , hard work , perseverance and all of us working together with partners at every level to get the job done .
We also realized that the sheer amount of work required to help such a small percentage of our cityâ€ ™ s homeless population makes clear how much we still have to do to help all of our homeless residents who need and deserve roofs over their heads .
To end veteran homelessness in New Orleans , we first had to identify and locate each homeless veteran living in our city .
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) , there were nearly 200 homeless veterans living on our streets or in shelters on any given night in 2014 .
Using that information as a starting point , experienced outreach teams then combed New Orleans looking for them .
We also organized a special push over the course of five nights last fall when about 150 active duty military personnel and veterans joined the effort to systematically seek and engage every homeless veteran .
Many of these same service members and veterans would later help move their homeless brothers and sisters in arms into their new homes .
From there , the Department of Veteran Affairs , HUD , nonprofits , our cityâ€ ™ s housing authority and countless others
all pitched in to help .
Through these combined efforts , 227 homeless veterans in New Orleans were permanently housed as a part of the Mayors Challenge â€ “ far more than we originally identified .
The work of ending veteran homelessness never really ends , though .
Thatâ€ ™ s why we not only housed all the homeless veterans we could locate in New Orleans , but we also created a new , sustainable and rapid - response outreach model .
Since fulfilling the Mayors Challenge in January , New Orleans has housed an additional 42 veterans and we are meeting our goal of housing them within an average of 30 days .
Now , when a veteran does become homeless in the city of New Orleans , this homelessness will be rare , brief and nonrecurring .
To date , 432 mayors , seven governors and 131 other local officials across the nation have accepted the challenge to end veteran homelessness .
We hope that our work in New Orleans on the front end of this effort can inspire and guide these cities as they seek to replicate our success .
And , we , as a city , are more motivated than ever to tackle the issue of homelessness across our community so that every New Orleanian â€ “ and eventually every American â€ “ has the opportunity to live a long , happy and healthy life ."
2015-04-30,"As she delivered the inaugural address for the Whitney museumâ€ ™ s new building in downtown Manhattan on Thursday , Michelle Obama praised the museum for its outreach work to children and underserved communities , and challenged other cultural institutions to do the same .
â€œThere are so many kids in this country who look at museums and concert halls and think to themselves : â€˜Thatâ€ ™ s not a place for me , â€ ™ â€ � she said .
The first lady added that as a young girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago , she felt the same way .
Obama praised the museum for its commitment to reaching out to underserved communities and children through educational programming .
â€œEvery cultural institution should be doing this kind of work , â€ �
she said .
â€œWho knows how you might expand a childâ€ ™ s imagination ?
â€œMaybe you can discover the next Carmen Herrera , or Archibald Motley , or Edward Hopper , or maybe even the next Barack Obama .
That is the power of institutions like the Whitney .
They open their doors as wide as possible both to the artists they embrace and to the young people they seek to uplift â€
¦ I truly can not wait to see the impact this extraordinary museum will have in the years ahead.â€
�
In front of a crowd of museum trustees and art world VIPs , New York City mayor Bill De Blasio and architect Renzo Piano joined Obama in officially opening the new Whitney for business .
At 200,000 sq ft , the new building is nearly double the size of its former home on the Upper East Side , which was no longer large enough to house both the museumâ€ ™ s staff and its 22,000-strong art collection .
The first exhibition , America Is Hard to See , shows some 600 works from the Whitneyâ€ ™ s collection .
Obama praised the show and the meaning behind the title , saying that art enabled the viewers to see America â€œin all its glory and complexityâ€ � .
â€œWe already knew we were the mecca of the art world but just in case we needed to make it clearer , this museum does it ,
â€ �
De Blasio said at the ribbon cutting .
Despite the buildingâ€ ™ s considerable presence in the Meatpacking District â€ “ the building weighs 28,000 tons , including 4,000 tons of steel â€ “ Piano
said it was his mission to create a feeling of community and freedom in the museumâ€ ™ s design .
â€œI think public buildings are the essence of cities , â€ � he said .
â€œThey are places where people share values .
Where they meet and speak to each other .
Where they join the city.â€
�
The architect concluded : â€œEspecially among public buildings I love to make buildings for art and beauty .
The reason is very simple â€ “ because art and beauty make people better people ...
Iâ€ ™ m pretty sure that beauty will save the world .
It will save one person at a time .
It will do it.â€
�
Pianoâ€ ™ s building was nine years in the making ; the Whitney raised $ 760 m in order to build it .
The city of New York was the second largest donor , contributing $ 35 m .
The museum opens to the public on Friday ."

2015-05-12,"Danielle Moodie - Mills : Her struggle mirrors many of ours
When First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the graduates of Tuskegee University she did so with a level of realness weâ€ ™ ve come to expect from Flotus , but we also received a glimpse of her very real struggle â€ “ which mirrors that of many African Americans .
The jabs that have been taken at her femininity and personality are similar to the kinds that black women have been dealing with for eons .
Our bodies literally poked and prodded â€ “ never measuring up to the European standard of beauty .
Our demeanor questioned as being â€œsassyâ€ � , â€œangryâ€ � , â€œhostileâ€ � etc .
In her speech the first lady gave us insight into how being ridiculed , stereotyped , overlooked and verbally abused by right wing conservatives can take its toll
â€ “ not just on her and the first family , but on all black Americans who have been wrongly judged and labeled as â€œthugsâ€ �
, â€œtroublemakersâ€ � , â€œriotersâ€ � and worse , for daring to challenge a system that was created to ensure our silence and submission .
We have yet to reach the mountain - top and the arc
hasnâ€ ™ t reached the promise land of justice â€ “ but her sheer presence , grit and fortitude as first lady of the United States reminds us just how far weâ€ ™ ve come and yet her treatment as a black woman shows us just how much further we need to go .
Danielle Moodie - Mills is a contributor with NBC BLK and Chief Creative Officer of Politini Media .
Hannah Giorgis :
This honesty is refreshing but itâ€ ™ s not enough To be a black woman of stature in America is to have slow - climbed to power on a tightrope of resilience and circumstance , never free to forget the valley of stereotypes below .
The first lady named a number of racialized , gender epithets she received on her path toward the White House , as well as during her time there .
Among the vitriol sheâ€ ™ s heard were phrases almost numbingly familiar to black women in America : accusations of being â€œloudâ€ � and â€œangry ,
â€ � being derisively referred to as the â€œbaby mamaâ€ � of the man to whom she is married , and having her hair caricatured .
The speech marks a departure from her more watery ( if also pleasant ) previous public addresses by publicly â€ “ and personally â€ “ acknowledging the stinging reality of black womenâ€ ™ s uniquely perilous journey .
At first listen , I found myself almost embarrassed to feel refreshed at the prospect of hearing the first lady speak candidly about her painful experiences with a social ill that enacts wide - ranging , multi - faceted , fatal harm against people who look like her in the country her husband runs ( and well beyond its borders ) .
It is 2015 ; to simply ask for honesty from public figures as black people lie dying in the streets feels like a paltry , retrograde request .
And yet , juxtaposed with Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s track record of patronizing , pathologizing speeches to Black America â€ “ most notably , a 2013 speech at Morehouse College in which he told an audience of black graduating students that they no longer had â€œtime for excusesâ€ �
â€ “
Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s statements are indeed a breath of fresh air .
But when our communities are suffocating , even that isnâ€ ™ t enough .
Hannah Giorgis is a columnist for The Guardian Rebecca Carroll :
She knows the stereotypes all too well
As someone with a similar racial background to President Barack Obama â€ “ biracial born but black identifying , raised by white parent(s ) , racial authenticity under frequent scrutiny â€ “
I recognized immediately at the start of their public lives his pull to someone so entirely assured of her blackness .
From the fist bump to the chiseled arms to a seminal speech to the 2015 graduating class of Tuskegee , Michelle Obama has not , does not and will not waver in her sense of self , humor and intellect as a black woman .
Her black womanhood predates the now all too commonly employed stereotype in mainstream media of the â€œstrong , loud , emasculating black
womanâ€ �
â€ “ she was holding it down at the intersection of black and female long before folks decided to turn it against her , and black women all over America .
She is strong enough to say now and feel then , in reference to her first magazine cover depicting her as a black militant with an afro and a machine gun : â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m being honest
, it knocked me back a bit.â€
�
Loud enough to focus on her â€œown
truthâ€ � and approach her family life at the White House in â€œcreative and unconventional ways.â€
�
I question the perception of Michelle Obama as an emasculating black woman in a largely matriarchal culture .
There are many deeply rooted complexities within the dynamic between black women and black men
â€ “ while we stand out here in the street marching for Trayvon , Walter , Michael , Tamir , and Freddie
, emasculating our men isnâ€ ™ t at the forefront .
Michelle Obama stood in front of that graduating class and hit point by point â€ “ race , class , hope , intersectional identity ,
education â€ “ with humor and grace , and full - on repped the beauty of a self - realized black woman Zora Neale Hurston - style
: â€œI love myself when I am laughing â€ ¦ and
then again when Iâ€ ™ m looking mean and impressive.â€
�
Rebecca Carroll is a columnist for the Guardian Pam Spaulding :
We have all experienced these slights
It was cathartic to see the first lady focus on the â€œlittle indignitiesâ€ � as well as the coarse , violent struggles we see in Ferguson and Baltimore .
Every black woman has experienced belittling , damned - for - your - color treatment like being followed in stores by clerks assuming you will shoplift or being mistaken as â€œthe help.â€ �
In New York City , a friend
and I used to conduct experiments about what it was like to â€œhail a cab while blackâ€
� .
We watched cab after cab pass us by .
When her husband , who is white , went to hail one , well glory be , the cab stopped on a dime .
Often I would hold a business call with a vendor and later see the shock and astonishment register on their face that I meet them
and they realize I am ... black .
What , was I not speaking in â€œurban dialect?â€ � The number of assumptions people make about me are frustrating in their consistency : from the boldness of people wishing to touch my hair , to asking me if Iâ€ ™ m biracial and inquiring after my taste in music ( what , a woman of color can like ... Journey ? ) .
When it isnâ€ ™ t offensive it borders on the comical .
I have learned to let the small stuff slide and prefer to educate with kindness rather than defensiveness .
But I understand how for others , these indignities can get the hackles up .
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks are remarkable only in that these discussions rarely happen in public .
It is essential that we address the horrors of blatant racism that results in death , incarceration and socioeconomic despair .
But letâ€ ™ s remember the smaller things that profoundly affect quality of life in ways white America doesnâ€ ™ t see and often doesnâ€ ™ t deign to understand .
Pam Spaulding is the former editor of the award - winning national progressive blog Pamâ€ ™ s
House Blend Syreeta McFadden :
She was right about the New Yorker cover Iâ€ ™ ve been rooting for Michelle Obama since 2008 .
Thereâ€ ™ s a bone deep honesty that she speaks with that
keeps me grounded less
I get caught up in sweeping narratives of what kind of America we think we are .
She speaks the truth of these â€œlittle indignitiesâ€ � that I know too well .
I remember that 2008 New Yorker cover and I knew that the images were perpetuating a very specific stereotype and anti blackness by one deliberate representational change â€ ¦ the afro .
Michelle Obama doesnâ€ ™ t have an afro , so why do that ?
While it read small or harmless to a non black person , that change meant to communicate nasty biases about black women , and in doing so , sought to diminish and silence her and by proxy , all black women .
Iâ€ ™ ve had white people respond fearful and hostile because of my hair .
Iâ€ ™ ve had to temper my voice in meetings for fear I be understood as a stereotype , rather than a confident professional .
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s hindsight so crystallizes points we constantly note about anti blackness and racism in America .
Iâ€ ™ ve been the only black woman in a room , party , meeting , dinner where Iâ€ ™ ve had to negotiate my presence and footing with people projecting retrograde impressions and biases .
â€œYouâ€ ™
re so articulateâ€ � is never a compliment when uttered with such wide eye astonishment by white men and women .
I hear and see and know that youâ€ ™ ve already underestimated me and my nappy hair .
It is a joy to watch black femininity negotiated in this space ; Michelle Obama is representationally significant in that complexity of being a black woman with power in the 21st century .
Syreeta McFadden is a columnist for the Guardian"
2015-05-12,"Thereâ€ ™ s one mantra many black parents drill into their childrenâ€ ™ s heads throughout their life : be twice as good .
It goes that as black folks in America , weâ€ ™ ve got to work twice as hard to get half as far as our white counterparts .
Some semblance of this speech has been handed down for generations , and given our history in the US â€ “ forced into chattel slavery , oppressed under Jim Crow , and racially stigmatized to this day â€ “ itâ€ ™ s proven itself to be true .
Over the weekend the first lady , Michelle Obama , gave her version of the â€œtwice as goodâ€ � speech to the graduates of Tuskegee University , a historically black intuition located in Alabama .
Established by Booker T Washington in 1881 , Tuskegee has produced countless politicians , educators , scientists , artists , and entrepreneurs , all of whom have benefited from Washingtonâ€ ™ s desire to prepare graduates â€œto become a centre of influenceâ€ � and show fellow African Americans â€œhow to lift themselves upâ€ � by their bootstraps through the pursuit of education , something Obama also embraces .
On Saturday , she reminded graduates their lives would likely be more difficult than their white peers , simply because the playing field was still not equal .
â€œThe road ahead is not going to be easy .
It never is , especially for folks like you and me .
Because while weâ€ ™ ve come so far , the truth is that those age - old problems are stubborn and they havenâ€ ™ t fully gone away , â€ � Obama said .
â€œSo there will be times
â€
¦ when you feel like folks look right past you , or they see just a fraction of who you really are.â€
�
While some have accused the first lady of delivering a â€œdepressingâ€ � and divisive speech , the facts are clear .
Despite all our strides as a nation , African Americans are still disproportionately affected by crime , poverty , unemployment , and incarceration .
As the war on drugs escalated in the 1980s and 1990s , thousands of black people were swept up into the prison system for narcotics possession despite the fact that white people are more likely to actually possess drugs .
And when it comes to getting a job , the unemployment rate for African - Americans is nearly double that for whites , even among college graduates .
The challenges facing black Americans are daunting , but according to Michelle Obama theyâ€ ™ re not an excuse to fail .
â€œI want to be very clear that those feelings are not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up , â€ � she said .
â€œThey are not an excuse to lose hope .
To succumb to feelings of despair and anger only means that in the end , we lose.â€ �
Though Obama didnâ€ ™ t utter the phrase , â€œblack lives matterâ€ � â€ “ echoing the movement that has swept across America in the wake of several high - profile killings of unarmed African - Americans by police â€
“
the idea permeated her speech .
â€œThe world wonâ€
™ t always see you in those caps and gowns .
They wonâ€
™ t know how hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day , â€ � the first lady told the class of 2015 .
â€œInstead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world.â€ �
She should know .
Prior to entering the White House , the media watched Obamaâ€ ™ s every move to see if the Harvard - trained lawyer would morph into a stereotypical â€œangry black woman.â€ �
When that didnâ€ ™ t happen , some just labeled her as such , accusing her of being everything from unpatriotic and overflowing with race - based rage , to a tyrant who clashed with her husbandâ€ ™ s staff .
Over the years the jabs have kept coming , and theyâ€ ™ ve been painful .
â€œIt knocked me back a bit .
It made me wonder , just how are people seeing me , â€ �
she admitted , explaining how the initial character slights hurt .
â€œAll of this used to really get to me .
Back in those days , I had a lot of sleepless nights , worrying about what people thought of me , wondering if I might be hurting my husbandâ€ ™ s chances of winning his election , fearing how my girls would feel if they found out what some people were saying about their mom.â€ � Obama said she decided to â€œignore all of the noiseâ€ � and instead focus on being â€œtwice as goodâ€ � in every area of her life , from her early days at Princeton , to her tenure as vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals , and finally in the White House .
Despite growing up on the south side of Chicago â€ “ one of the cityâ€ ™ s toughest neighborhoods â€ “ Obama has lived an extraordinary life ; she is the embodiment of Washingtonâ€ ™ s â€œbootstrap philosophy , â€ � which argues that anyone , no matter what their circumstances , can rise to the top .
Unfortunately , this just isnâ€ ™ t true for most Americans .
Our nation continues to lean on the myth of the American dream , but climbing the rungs of the socio - economic ladder remains difficult , particularly for those at the bottom .
For every story of someone who overcame crushing poverty to achieve massive success are thousands of others of those who continue to languish in low - wage jobs and in substandard conditions .
In fact , while nearly two out of three white people make it into the middle class by middle age , according to economic expert Isabel Sawhill , that number drops to just three out of 10 for black people .
For many African Americans like the Obamas , being â€œtwice as goodâ€ � has paid off .
But for the millions who continue to confront both racial and economic oppression , simply encouraging folks to work harder , while refusing to address the systemic hurdles that impede their success wonâ€ ™ t cut it either ."
2015-05-18,"Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s recent commencement speech at Tuskegee University , gave wider society a realistic glimpse into the lives of women of colour .
She revealed that racial stereotypes still plague our progress and ultimately our own hopes and aspirations .
We will only begin to tackle these stereotypes by highlighting and celebrating our high - achieving women of colour .
By talking about her personal experiences around racial stereotyping , Obama highlighted a pervasive societal malaise , that the race of an individual comes above all else and not in a good way .
How can we realise the full potential of all our citizens if we think that one section of the population is only good for twerking , finger snapping and single motherhood ?
These stereotypes relegate our future prime ministers , titans of business and healthcare professionals to dole queues , poor housing and a cycle of deprivation that robs the hardiest characters of their aspirations .
When the USâ€ ™ s first lady is dubbed â€˜Obamaâ€ ™ s baby mamaâ€ ™ then the work in fostering respect on racial and gender lines has a long way to go .
The US is far further ahead in celebrating role models of colour compared to the UK .
It should be worrying to all of us that it was only in 2014 that we had the first black woman read the 10 Oâ€ ™ clock news .
Considering that black people have been in Britain since at least the 12th century , thatâ€ ™ s a long while to wait to see a woman of colour deliver us the news .
The very real judgements women of colour face often interrupt our daily lives reminding us that we do not feature widely in power structures and our life experiences are mainly invisible .
This is problematic because when your talents present as a space scientist ( Dr Maggie Aderin - Pocock MBE ) or the former head of legal for the John Lewis group ( Margaret Casely - Hayford ) you donâ€ ™ t appreciate being mistaken for the cleaner on your first day of work .
People grow to expect what theyâ€ ™ re shown , when they donâ€ ™ t see women of colour in boardrooms , in leadership roles or even reading the news , they assume it can never happen .
Iâ€ ™ ve faced these judgements before .
The comments such as : â€œoh , you speak really wellâ€ � or , â€œwere you born in Britain?â€ ™
And of course , the classic characterisation of the angry , black woman .
The older you get , the more your self - confidence grows , so you learn to spot and ignore these daily digs .
But the knowing whatâ€ ™ s about you and whatâ€ ™ s about someone
elseâ€ ™ s prejudices only comes with age , and how many young girls are put off before they realise this ?
Role models are vital to success .
EYâ€
™ s 2012 survey of 1000 working women showed that 75 % of those questioned had few or no female role models in their organisation .
This probably rings true outside of the workplace too .
What can beauty look like for you if the standard is modelled on someone you will never be ?
What does success look like for you when you have no tangible reference points or examples to draw inspiration from ?
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s speech , reminds us that the intersectional burden women of colour bear is all consuming and the resilient nature needed to overcome those restrictions is a gift we must nurture ."
2015-06-13,"When Michelle Obama shared her story with students at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson school in Islington , London , four years ago , the girls responded with cheers and smiles .
She answered with hugs .
As she climbed into her car , she told aides : â€œI could do that all day.â€ � Obama , who was labouring to define a meaningful White House role for herself , found her voice when she recognised that the lessons of her upbringing as a black girl on the working - class south side of Chicago translated to audiences around the world .
It is a more confident and outspoken American first lady who returns to London on Monday â€ “ accompanied by her mother , Marian Robinson , and daughters Malia and Sasha â€ “ to push Let Girls Learn , her international effort to channel disadvantaged adolescents towards university .
In her seventh year in the White House , with no races left to run , Obama is talking more often about the themes of inequality and uplift that have long been her passion .
Focusing on young people , especially girls of colour , she offers the example of her own trajectory as a member of the first generation to come of age after the civil rights movement .
Her message defines poverty , sexism and racism as enduring hardships to be faced and overcome .
Two in three Americans have a favourable impression of Obama .
She is consistently more popular than her husband .
Yet she faces a vociferous array of critics on the political right who think she talks too much about what ails the United States , especially the stark shortage of opportunity for millions of children limited by poor schools , dangerous neighbourhoods , even unhealthy diets .
She recently recalled the pummelling she took during the 2008 campaign , when she was called â€œMrs Grievanceâ€ � and â€œBarackâ€ ™ s
Bitter Halfâ€
� .
She said : â€œI had a lot of sleepless nights , worrying about what people thought of me , wondering if I might be hurting my husbandâ€ ™ s chances of winning his election , fearing how my girls would feel if they found out what some people were saying about their mom.â€ �
Her answer was to persevere .
â€œThroughout this journey , I have learned to block everything out and focus on my truth , â€ � the 51-year - old first lady told graduates in May at Tuskegee University , a historically African - American college .
â€œI had to answer for myself , â€˜Who am I ?
No , really , who am I?â€ ™ â€
�
The stories Obama tells are rooted in her working - class upbringing in the 1960s and 1970s .
Around the dinner table she learned the history of her parents and grandparents , who knew the sting of racial prejudice in one of Americaâ€ ™ s most segregated cities .
If Fraser C Robinson Jr had been born white , Obama once said of her shrewd and smart paternal grandfather , he would have been a banker .
But in Chicago before the civil rights movement he became a postal worker .
Her maternal grandfather , Purnell Shields , was a talented carpenter , but when he was a young man , the best jobs were reserved for members of trade unions that barred African - Americans .
Obamaâ€ ™ s father , Fraser C Robinson III , was warm and gregarious .
A former boxer , swimmer and soldier , he spent his working life tending boilers at the cityâ€ ™ s water plant , a patronage job he owed to his service to Chicagoâ€ ™ s Democratic machine under mayor Richard J Daley .
As a young man , he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ; he died before his 56th birthday .
Neither of Obamaâ€ ™ s parents graduated from university , a regret they turned into a lesson for Michelle and her older brother , Craig .
Their lessons were rooted in a paradox echoed in Obamaâ€ ™ s thinking to this day .
One was the fact that it was not a level playing field for their children because of their race and class .
The other was the faith that a combination of love , support , perseverance and upright living could win out .
Obama sketched the juxtaposition in a speech to a largely black audience in South Carolina in November 2007 , during the first presidential campaign .
On the one hand , she spoke of the â€œveil of impossibility that keeps us down and keeps our children down â€ “ keeps us waiting and hoping for a turn that may never come .
Itâ€ ™ s the bitter legacy of racism and discrimination and oppression in this country.â€ �
On the other , she reported that her grandfather Fraser â€œfilled my brother and me with big dreams about the lives we could lead .
He taught me that my destiny had not been written before I was born , that it was in my hands.â€ �
Despite warnings from high - school advisers who said her scores were too low , Obama worked her way into Princeton University , where she immediately struggled academically .
She was stunned by the wealth and privilege
she saw among her white classmates at an elite university where just 8 % of the students were African - American .
She felt an outsider even as she earned honours in the sociology department .
Shortly before her 1985 graduation , she wrote that her years on campus made her â€œfar more aware of my Blackness than ever before .
I have found that at Princeton , no matter how liberal and open - minded some of my White professors and classmates try to be toward me , I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus ; as if I really didnâ€ ™ t belong.â€ �
After Harvard Law School , Obama returned to Chicago and a highly paid job at a law firm , where she was asked to mentor a Harvard student called Barack Obama .
He was cute , smart , different .
He grew up in Hawaii , had lived in Indonesia .
He was named Barack .
â€œI always thought heâ€ ™ d be useful ,
â€ �
she said in a talk at Oxford in 2011 .
Obama spent 20 years developing a professional and civic profile in Chicago independent of her increasingly famous husband .
She spent a dozen of those years at the University of Chicago , seeking to bridge the private institution and the surrounding black working - class neighbourhoods .
Opportunities for advancement had increased for African - Americans since the era when her parents came of age .
Obama had possibilities they could hardly have imagined .
And yet , she often said , thousands of young people like her had been left behind for lack of a good school , a supportive family or perhaps a lucky break .
She also thought about gender relationships and the struggle of women to find a satisfying balance between work and family lives .
She spoke openlyof ways her marriage did not always go smoothly .
Although she , too , had a pair of Ivy League degrees and significant professional ambition , more often than not the logistical work of parenting two young girls and running the household fell to her .
Barack was less involved â€ “ and less evolved â€ “ than she had expected .
She sometimes wondered why his ambitions always seemed to take precedence over hers .
Barack said they argued repeatedly about how to juggle their obligations to work and family .
Michelleâ€ ™ s anger towards him
â€œseemed barely containedâ€ � , he wrote .
She told him more than once : â€œYou only think about yourself .
I never thought Iâ€ ™ d have to raise a family alone.â€
�
Her displeasure forced him to confront the ways he was falling short .
In the harsh spotlight of the White House after the history - making 2008 campaign , Michelle Obama worked to define a role that went beyond feelgood photo opportunities .
Ever strategic , she told her staff : â€œDonâ€ ™ t just put me on a plane , send me someplace and have me smile.â€ �
After making certain heryoung daughters were settled , she developed a portfolio of issues , starting with childhood obesity , which afflicts an estimated one in three US children , with higher percentages among black and Hispanic kids .
She focused on the lives of military families , where soldiers and their partners most typically have only a high - school education .
And she began pushing more young people at home and abroad into university and skills training .
Feeling liberated after Barackâ€ ™ s election to a second term in 2012 , the first lady uses her Twitter , Facebook and Instagram accounts to support an array of progressive causes , including immigration reform and LGBT rights .
She also began to speak more directly on issues of race .
She is not afraid of acting in skits on late - night TV or dancing for fitness on YouTube videos that collect tens of millions of hits .
Most recently , she shot a workout video that showed her kick - boxing and lifting weights .
â€œAs
you can see ,
â€ �
she once said , â€œIâ€ ™ m pretty much willing to make a complete fool out of myself to get our kids moving.â€ �
With 18 months left in her White House tenure , Obama is defending her record â€ “ and her husbandâ€ ™ s
â€ “ while making clear she is not yet finished .
She has no interest in following Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s path into politics , but says she has learned something about how a serious - minded first lady can be useful .
Obama discussed the role during a trip to Africa amid a typical media fuss over one of her new hairstyles .
She said : â€œWe take our bangs and stand in front of important things the world needs to see .
And eventually , people stop looking at the bangs and start looking at what weâ€ ™ re standing in front of.â€

His new biography is Michelle Obama : A Life , which was published in April"
2015-06-15,"Michelle Obama is due to arrive in the UK on Monday , accompanied by her mother and two teenage daughters , as part of her global campaign to promote girlsâ€ ™ education .
The US first lady has spearheaded an initiative called Let Girls Learn , which aims to break down the barriers to education that keep 62 million girls around the world out of school .
During her stay , she will visit Mulberry School for Girls , a comprehensive for pupils aged 11 to 18 in Londonâ€ ™ s
East End that has built up a strong reputation for academic success in one of the UKâ€ ™ s most deprived boroughs .
Preparations at Mulberry were intense on the eve of the visit .
The schoolâ€ ™ s headteacher , Dr Vanessa Ogden , said : â€œWe are delighted to be welcoming Michelle Obama to Mulberry School for Girls .
The first lady is one of the greatest , most inspiring women of our time and her visit is an honour for us .
â€œHer use of her platform as first lady to drive change for girls and to break down barriers in access to education is critical for a civilised world .
The moral imperative is clear and the business case supports it .
This is the call to get behind her global campaign.â€ � Achieving success despite deprivation is a key part of Obamaâ€ ™ s message .
A statement from the school said : â€œDespite the fact that over three quarters of pupils are entitled to the pupil premium at Mulberry , the school has consistently proved that socio - economic disadvantage need not prevent students from achieving academic success and flourishing as individuals .
We look forward to discussing our shared values during the first ladyâ€ ™ s visit.â€ �
This weekâ€ ™ s visit to London follows a memorable and emotional visit in 2009 to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School for girls in Islington , north London , when she told excited pupils : â€œWhether you come from a council estate or a country estate , your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude .
â€œWe are counting on you , we are counting on every single one of you to be the best that you can
be.â€ �
She has since kept in touch with the school .
On this occasion , she will host a roundtable at Mulberry on how the UK and the US are working together to expand access for adolescent girls completing their education .
She will also take questions from students alongside Julia Gillard , the former Australian prime minister .
Gillard is the current chair of the Global Partnership for Education , and a strong advocate on international girlsâ€ ™ education .
Obamaâ€ ™ s daughters Sasha , 14 , and Malia , 16 , are not expected to take part in the visit to the school .
Later in the day , Obama will have a private meeting with Prince Harry at Kensington Palace , where they are expected to discuss their shared interest in building better support for military families .
They first met two years ago during a White House tea reception honouring military mothers .
The prince was in the US on official business , including an event promoting the Halo Trust , an anti - landmine charity he supports .
A spokesperson for Kensington Palace said : â€œThey are meeting due to their shared interested in the welfare of military families .
Prince Harry was grateful for the welcome he received at the White House two years ago and is pleased to be able to host the first lady at Kensington Palace during her visit to London.â€

Obamaâ€ ™ s
chief of staff ,
Tina Tchen , recalled the princeâ€ ™ s visit to the US : â€œHe was wonderful and it was wonderful to have him here .
And we hear from his staff that he is happy to return the favour.â€ � A Downing Street meeting with David and Samantha Cameron is also scheduled .
On Wednesday , Obama and her family will travel to Milan to lead the presidential delegation to the cityâ€ ™ s Expo 2015 , which is promoting global dialogue about the future of our food system .
She will use the opportunity to encourage healthier eating for children ."
2015-06-16,"The US first lady , Michelle Obama , is to meet Prince Harry and David Cameron on the first of a two - day visit to the UK to promote her charity work .
Obama is visiting Britain to discuss her campaigns for girlsâ€ ™ education and better support for military families .
She will host an event at the Mulberry school for Girls in Tower Hamlets in east London to discuss cooperation between the US and UK to improve educational opportunities for girls across the world through the Let Girls Learn initiative , championed by her and her husband , Barack Obama .
Preparations at Mulberry were intense on the eve of the visit .
The schoolâ€ ™ s headteacher , Vanessa Ogden , said : â€œWe are delighted to be welcoming Michelle Obama .
The first lady is one of the greatest , most inspiring women of our time and her visit is an honour for us .

The moral imperative is clear and the business case supports it .
This is the call to get behind her global campaign.â€ � Pupils at the single - sex comprehensive will get the chance to grill the first lady â€ “ along with Julia Gillard , the former prime minister of Australia who chairs the board of the Global Partnership for Education .
Writing in the Financial Times , Obama cited figures suggesting that more than 62 million girls were out of school across the world , which she described as â€œa heartbreaking injusticeâ€ � .
Girls faced obstacles to education such as forced marriages , early pregnancies , abuse and sexism , she said .
â€œThat kind of life is unthinkable for the girls in our lives , so why would we accept this fate for any girl on this planet ?
â€œThis week I will join Prime Minister David Cameron in London to begin to answer that question , and announce a series of partnerships between the US and UK to educate adolescent girls in developing countries around the world.â€ �
She praised the UK as a global leader for girlsâ€ ™ education and said one joint scheme included a $ 180 m ( Â£115 m ) investment in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
She added : â€œIn addition , our development agencies and two of the countriesâ€ ™ leading universities will collaborate on evidence - based research to determine the best ways to educate adolescent girls .
And British and American partners will work together to support teacher training , girlsâ€ ™ leadership camps , and other community - based programmes in developing countries .
â€œCombined , these efforts total nearly $ 200 m â€ “ but , given the scope of this challenge , even that is nowhere near sufficient .
Girlsâ€ ™ education is a global issue that requires a global solution.â€ �
Upon arrival in the UK on Monday night , the first lady was greeted by US military families as she stepped off the plane at Stansted airport , followed by her mother and two daughters .
The White House said Prince Harry was hosting Obama two years after attending a tea for military mothers with her in the US .
The prince was in the US on official business , including an event promoting the Halo Trust , an anti - landmine charity he supports .
Her chief of staff , Tina Tchen , said : â€œHe was wonderful and it was wonderful to have him here .
And we hear from his staff that he is happy to return the favour.â€ �
She added that they would be able to talk about â€œthat shared interest that they have on military familiesâ€
� .
The Joining Forces campaign â€ “ another of those spearheaded by the first lady â€ “ â€œworks hand in hand with the public and private sectors to ensure that service members , veterans and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their livesâ€ � .

2015-06-16,"Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s mother , Marian Robinson , made a rare public appearance when she flew to London with her daughter this week .
The first lady usually tries to keep the 78-year - old first grandmother out of the public eye .
Robinson keeps a low profile and rarely gives interviews , saying she prefers to concentrate on looking after her family .
But she is a vital part of the Obama support network .
The retired bank secretary moved into the White House when her son - in - law won the presidency in 2008 to help Malia , now 16 , and Sasha , now 14 , with the transition .
Sheâ€ ™ s the first live - in grandma since Eisenhowerâ€ ™ s mother - in - law Elivera Doud in the 1960s .
Robinson was said to be reluctant to leave her modest bungalow , siblings and friends in Chicago , where she had lived all her life .
She told CBS in 2009 : â€œTheyâ€ ™ re dragging me with them , and Iâ€ ™ m not comfortable with that .
But Iâ€ ™ m doing exactly what you do .
You do what needs to be done.â€ �
Her grand apartment with a four - poster bed , walk - in closet and separate sitting room on the third floor of the presidential home is a world away from the house she shared with her father , a house painter , her mother , a nurse , and her six siblings as she grew up in Chicagoâ€ ™ s South Side .
She married Fraser Robinson , a Chicago water department employee , in 1960 and they lived together until he died from multiple sclerosis in 1991 .
As Malia and Sasha have grown into teenagers , Robinson â€ “ or Mrs R , as she is said to be called around Washington â€ “ has embraced life in DC and enjoys spending time with friends such as Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s former personal secretary Betty Currie .
Staying away from the limelight means she is rarely recognised .
In an interview in 2009 , Barack Obama said she â€œjust walks out the gate and goes over to CVS and starts doing her shoppingâ€ � ."
2015-06-19,"Ofsted inspectors have made a series of snap attendance inspections at schools in the London borough of Tower Hamlets amid heightened fears over students potentially travelling to Syria .
The visits â€ “ which were not classified as formal inspections by Ofsted but come under its remit to monitor pupil safeguarding and behaviour â€ “ were carried out last week , days before the US first lady , Michelle Obama , visited a school in the borough .
Ofsted said : â€œWe are undertaking a small number of unannounced survey visits to schools to look at issues concerning attendance and pupil mobility.â€ �
It declined to give further details on the number or type of schools inspected until it had completed its work .
It plans to brief the Department for Education and Tower Hamlets council on its findings .
The group of schools are understood to include several maintained by the local authority .
The inspections were first reported by Schools Week .
In February , three teenagers from a school in Tower Hamlets , Bethnal Green Academy , are believed to have travelled to areas of Syria controlled by Islamic State .
In March , it was revealed that travel bans had been imposed on a further five pupils at the same school because of fears they would attempt to go to Syria .
A spokesman for Tower Hamlets said : â€œThe council were made aware of these visits to gather information on attendance , persistent absence , pupil mobility and admissions .
We are confident in our processes and await official feedback from Ofsted .
We continue to work closely with local authority schools to ensure the safety of all children in the borough.â€ �
Late last year , Ofsted carried out no - notice inspections of seven schools in the borough , including a state secondary school , Sir John Cass Foundation and Redcoat school .
Sir Michael Wilshaw , Ofstedâ€ ™ s chief inspector , reported that inspectors raised â€œserious concerns raised about social media sitesâ€ � and gender segregation among pupils at the school during break times .
Six private Muslim faith schools in Tower Hamlets were also inspected , with Wilshaw noting â€œserious concerns over the safeguarding and welfare of pupilsâ€ � .
Four of the schools were rated inadequate by Ofsted ."
2015-06-26,"President Obama travels to Charleston , South Carolina , on Friday to deliver the eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney , the pastor of Emanuel AME church who was gunned down last week along with eight others , amid intense speculation over whether he will use such a sensitive moment further to articulate his views on race .
The president will make his funeral oration at TD arena at the College of Charleston , in front of more than 5,000 people including relatives and friends of the victims as well as African American , church and local political leaders .
He will be joined by the first lady , Michelle Obama , and Vice - President Joe Biden and his wife , Jill .
It will be one of the most closely scrutinized engagements of Obamaâ€ ™ s six years in office .
With the aftershocks of the gun rampage by an avowed white supremacist still thundering across the deep south , the presidentâ€ ™ s main focus will be to celebrate the life of a much - loved pastor whom Obama himself knew well .
But he also faces the much more delicate task of offering the nation some kind of moral way forward as it continues to struggle to understand more than a week after the event an act of undiluted racial hatred .
State capitals across the south â€ “ not
just Columbia , South Carolina , where the Confederate flag still flies high â€ “ have been racked with soul - searching since the shooting spree on 17 June , much of it directed towards enduring public symbols of the regionâ€ ™ s slave - owning secessionist past .
In his remarks so far on the Charleston massacre , Obama has tended to emphasize his frustration with Americaâ€ ™ s lax gun laws which , as he put it the day after the shootings , has forced him â€œto make statements like this too many timesâ€ � .
He also made reference in that speech to the Emanuel AME church , the scene of the carnage , as a place of worship founded by African Americans seeking an end to slavery .
But his remarks in public over the past nine days have been restrained , muted almost , in regard to the overt racial nature of the attack .
The past nine days have been in keeping with the cautious stance that Americaâ€ ™ s first black president has consistently adopted when talking directly about the countryâ€ ™
s legacy of racial strife .
Whatever the extent of his comments on race on Friday , it is certain that his eulogy will address the many achievements of its subject .
The president will have rich material to work with â€ “ the aftermath of last weekâ€ ™ s massacre has been marked by an outpouring of affection and praise for the 41-year - old Pinckney in both his public roles , as pastor and as state senator .
On Wednesday several thousand mourners filed past Pinckneyâ€ ™ s open coffin at the South Carolina state house to pay their respects to a man equally at ease in a place of worship as on the floor of the legislature .
On Thursday night a wake was held at his church , a place of worship that was so integral to Charlestonâ€ ™ s African American community over so many years that it became known as â€œMother Emanuelâ€ � .
Obama forged his friendship with Pinckney during his first presidential run in 2008 , in which South Carolina played a key role as a turning point in the fierce battle for the Democratic nomination between the then US senator for Illinois and Hillary Clinton .
Even then , the contest was notable for its racial undertones .
How much further the president chooses to go in the course of his eulogy into the snake pit of modern American race relations remains to be seen .
There are signs that as he approaches the end of his term in the White House he is feeling liberated enough to speak more openly â€ “ just this week he used the N - word in a podcast , stating that the nation has yet to be cured of racism .
He has also indicated that his post - presidency plan is to try to help young black American men cope with the many hurdles that stand in their way .
In the wake of the spate of recent unrest over police behavior towards black citizens in cities such as Ferguson , Missouri , and Baltimore , the subject of race is clearly at the front of Obamaâ€ ™ s mind , though only rarely does he give the nation a glimpse of his thinking ."
2015-07-07,"Demand for summer dresses and festival wear helped business boom for online fashion retailer Asos , which said annual sales would be at the top of forecasts .
The company , whose customers include Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron , said retail sales for the four months to 30 June increased 20 % , or 24 % allowing for currency movements .
Sales in Britain rose 27 % and international sales , worth about 60 % of the total , were up 16 % , or 23 % in constant currencies .
For the year that ends on 31 August , sales will be at the high end of Asosâ€ ™ s previous guidance of 15 % to 20 % .
Nick Robertson , Asosâ€ ™ s chief executive , said top - selling items included sequinned mini skirts , structured sun dresses , dungarees and boots for festivals bought by customers in their 20s .
â€œFestivals and dresses for holidays were really , really strong for us , â€ � he said .
In the UK , new brands such as Misguided and Boohoo helped increase sales .
The company also extended its cutoff time for next - day delivery to midnight from 10 pm and simplified its smartphone app .
Asosâ€ ™ s strong trading is a turnaround from last year when three profit warnings in six months rocked its position as a stock market favourite valued at Â£6bn .
The company , which sells in about 200 countries , blamed weak international sales caused by the strong pound making goods expensive and it also suffered a fire at its main depot in Barnsley .
â€œA year ago our UK performance was OK but where we were struggling was international .
That was with the currency working against us and we were unable back then to change our prices in international territories.â€ �
Asos installed software so it could adjust prices quickly to compete in particular countries .
It has cut prices but better stock control and strong full - price sales have helped keep gross profit margins steady when analysts had expected a sharp fall .
High - street fashion retailers suffered slow spring sales because of cold weather , prompting many to launch their sales early .
Robertson said the unseasonal weather had little effect on Asos .
â€œWe are very global and we are not reliant on the UK , â€ � he said .
The company is on track to reach its target of Â£2.5bn annual sales soon , Robertson said without being more specific .
Andrew Wade , an analyst at stockbroker Numis , increased his estimate for annual pre - tax profit to Â£46.5 m from Â£45.8 m .
Profit last year was Â£43.9 m .
Wade said : â€œWe are seeing clear positive results and a business which has regained its momentum.â€ �
Asos shares , which were valued at Â£70 in February 2014 , were down 2.5 % at Â£37.45 in lunchtime trading .
After plunging in 2014 , they have gained about 50 % this year ."
2015-08-08,"Donald Trump was at the heart of another controversy on Saturday , after the RedState conservative activist Erick Erickson banned him from his event in Atlanta over a comment about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly .
Erickson himself , however , has a long history of making disparaging remarks about women , including calling first lady Michelle Obama a â€œmarxist harpyâ€ � and Texas politician Wendy Davis â€œabortion Barbieâ€ � .
In an interview with CNN on Friday , the day after the first debate of the Republican presidential campaign gave Fox a huge ratings hit , Trump appeared to insinuate that he had received aggressive questioning because Kelly had been menstruating .
Kelly , he said , â€œhad blood coming out of her eyes , blood coming out of her whereverâ€ � , while questioning him about his attitude to women .
He had previously insulted Kelly on Twitter , retweeting a tweet which called her a â€œbimboâ€ � .
Explaining his decision on Friday , Erickson said that though he had â€œtried to give [ Trump ] great latitude , his remark about Megyn Kelly was a bridge too farâ€ � .
In an online blogpost , he added : â€œThere are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross .
Decency is one of those lines.â€ �
Erickson also told reporters : â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to put words in [ Trumpâ€ ™ s ] mouth
and I hate using the label misogynist because I think its used too much but heâ€ ™ s suggesting a woman as a lady asked him a question and did so because it was her time of the month .
â€œItâ€ ™ s just not right .
Iâ€ ™ ve said a lot of shit in my life â€ “ and you can certainly quote me on the record using that word
â€ “
but I would never suggest anything like that.â€
�
Things Erickson has suggested include the notion that â€œObamaâ€ ™ s marxist harpy wife would go Lorena Bobbitt on himâ€ �
â€ “ Bobbitt was a Virginia woman who in 1993 cut off her husbandâ€ ™ s penis
â€ “
should he even think about itâ€ � .
It , in this instance , was â€œshagging hookers behind the mediaâ€ ™ s backâ€ � .
Erickson has also suggested that there was nothing wrong with calling Davis , who in 2013 mounted a 13-hour filibuster against a Texas abortion law , â€œabortion Barbieâ€ � .
â€œThe phrase was intentional to discredit Wendy Davis ,
â€ � he subsequently told the Houston Chronicle ,
â€œbut
I never thought about â€˜Barbieâ€ ™ being something that demeaned women .
I have an eight - year - old daughter who loves Barbie.â€
�
On his own RedState blog â€ “ from which in 2010 he officially purged â€œbirthersâ€ � , those who question Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s right to be president â€ “ he wrote : â€œAs an aside , one of the most hilarious bits of this is seeing liberals proclaim all references to someone as â€˜Barbieâ€ ™ sexist .
Really?â€ �
Erickson has regularly taken aim at feminists in general .
In 2010 , referring to an anti - abortion ad that ran during the Super Bowl , he tweeted :
â€œthatâ€ ™
s it ? ! ? !
Thatâ€ ™ s what the feminazis were enraged over ?
Seriously ? ! ?
Wow .
Thatâ€ ™ s what being too ugly to get a date does to your brain.â€
�
Erickson has recently added his voice to conservative calls for the withdrawal of federal funds from Planned Parenthood , if necessary via a government shutdown .
The womenâ€ ™ s health organisation has come under fire from Republicans after the release of a number of videos purporting to show staff members offering aborted foetal material for sale .
On Saturday , Dawn Laguens , executive vice - president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , released a statement that accused top Republican presidential candidates of taking â€œextreme positions far outside what most Americans believeâ€ � on abortion .
Laguens added : â€œIs it any surprise this weekend theyâ€ ™ re doubling down and aligning themselves with a man loudly calling to shut down the government unless they get their way and block millions of women across the country from accessing basic , preventive care?â€ �
Of the 17-strong Republican presidential field , nine candidates â€“Chris Christie , Rick Perry , Bobby Jindal , Carly Fiorina , Marco Rubio , Mike Huckabee , Ted Cruz , Jeb Bush and Scott Walker â€ “ spoke or were scheduled to speak at the RedState Gathering .
Ericksonâ€ ™ s views on womenâ€ ™ s rights and roles go wider than the issue of abortion .
In 2013 , speaking to Fox Business , he expounded on his view of the roles of men and women in society .
â€œWhen you look at biology , â€ � he said , â€œlook at the natural world , the roles of a male and female in society , and the other animals , the male typically is the dominant role .
The female , itâ€ ™ s not antithesis , or itâ€ ™ s not competing ,
itâ€ ™ s
a complementary role.â€ �
â€œAnd what I find interesting , â€ � he added , â€œis that three - quarters of the people surveyed recognise that having moms as the primary breadwinner is bad for kids and bad for marriage , and reality shows us thatâ€ ™ s the truth.â€ �
On Saturday , as the dispute degenerated into name - calling on social media , the Trump campaign issued a statement in which it sought to explain the candidateâ€ ™ s remark .
â€œMr
Trump made Megyn Kelly look really bad
, â€ � the statement said .
â€œShe was a mess with her anger and totally caught off guard .
Mr Trump said â€˜blood was coming out of her eyes and whateverâ€ ™ meaning nose , but wanted to move on to more important topics .
Only a deviant would think anything else.â€ � Erickson , meanwhile , alluded to past controversies when he used Twitter to say : â€œThe difference between Donald Trump and me is that I apologised and he is just denying he said it.â€

Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs in Atlanta"
2015-09-30,"Educating girls is the key to ending world problems , including poverty , first lady Michelle Obama told nearly a thousand teenage girls Tuesday .
Shrouded in pink spotlights , Obama joined actor and activist Charlize Theron , former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and Nurfahada , a 16-year - old girl ambassador for Plan International , an international development organisation , at the Apollo Theater to talk about the power of education and its lasting importance .
Obama gestured toward Nurfahada , who travelled to the US from the Philippines to talk about how girls in her country miss out on education because of systemic violence , poverty and teenage pregnancy .
â€œJust imagine if [ Nurfahada ] couldnâ€ ™ t get an education , â€ � Obama said .
â€œWhat a waste that would
be.â€ � Other advice from Obama : read , write , go to school ,
donâ€ ™ t be late , do your homework , get the best grade , compete with the boys , beat the boys .
â€œI am worthy , and if Iâ€ ™ m worthy , so are you ,
â€ � she said .
Glamour magazine sponsored the event in collaboration with the White Houseâ€ ™ s Let Girls Learn initiative , and Glamour editor - in - chief Cindi Leive moderated the panel .
The commitment to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and empowerment for women and girls is a part of the UN sustainable development goals , announced last week .
On Saturday , Obama announced a new global education initiative , # 62MillionGirls , in a video featuring BeyoncÃ © and Hugh Jackman .
â€œThe empowerment of women is so important , â€ �
Theron , who founded Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project and acts as the UN Messenger of Peace , said .
â€œWorld poverty , world hunger , health issues
â€ “ all of this stuff lies within the empowerment of young girls and women.â€
� Joking about Instagram food photos and childhood fashions , the women on stage shared stories about their own education and answered questions from the teens in the audience about the value of education and its effects on the world .
The theater lit up when Lieve posed what she said is a common line of thought among schoolgirls â€ “ that doing well in school will make a girl less attractive to boys .
â€œThere is nothing sexier than a smart woman , â€ �
Theron said , enraged at the idea .
Obama encouraged all women and girls to raise their standards for the people in their lives , and push aside negative forces .
No boy is cute or smart enough to stop a girl from pursuing her education , she said .
â€œIf i had worried about who liked me and who thought I was cute when I was your age , I wouldnâ€ ™ t be married to the president of the United States today , â€ � Obama said , high fiving Theron and miming a mic drop .
Another question came from a 13-year - old Girl Scout , who asked Gillard how the lack of education for girls affects â€œthe people in this room.â€ � â€œI want you to grow up and live in a peaceful and prosperous world and the evidence is incredibly clear that the more time people spend in school the more likely they are to support peaceful ways of resolving conflict , the more likely they are to support democracy , the more likely they are to show tolerance of other religions , â€ � Gillard said ."
2015-11-08,"If youâ€ ™ re over the age of 16 , Tyler Oakley might be the most famous person youâ€ ™ ve never heard of .
But this 26-year - old , from a small town in Michigan , has more accolades to his name than most .
Heâ€
™ s interviewed Barack Obama , made a health vlog with Michelle Obama , can claim over 500 m views on YouTube â€ “ and now has penned a New York Times bestselling book .
Oakley is among the new generation of celebrities who have made their name entirely through YouTube .
Posting videos of themselves from their bedrooms , discussing everything from pop culture and shopping to their own sexuality and mental health , teenagers across the world obsessively consume the content , interacting with the internet stars through comments , twitter and Snapchat .
It is a highly profitable occupation â€ “ some of the biggest YouTube celebrities , Oakley included â€ “ are thought to earn six figure salaries through sponsorship and advertising alone .
Oakley , who has been making his chatty videos for over eight years , is one of the most recognisable faces of the online community .
Crowds of screaming boys and girls follow him wherever he goes and the morning before we meet he was the star guest on Radio 1â€ ™ s
Breakfast Show , with Nick Grimshaw .
Yet , there is more to Oakley than discussions of fast food and fan - girling One Direction .
He is openly gay , often discussing his own sexuality and suicide prevention among gay young people ; his first book , Binge , is a series of highly personal essays that reveal his ongoing struggles with an eating disorder , having a father who thought he could â€œcure the gayâ€ � out of him , and his battle with anxiety and depression .
Released two weeks ago , it shot to No 2 in the New York Times bestsellers list in the US and
No 3 in the Sunday Times bestsellers chart in the UK
â€ “ an indicator of how the YouTube phenomenon is increasingly spreading beyond the online realm .
Oakley is a firm believer that YouTube channels such as his own are becoming a major force in spreading the acceptance of homosexuality .
For many young people watching his videos â€ “ particularly in small , isolated towns in America where homosexuality is often condemned as a sin and same - sex marriage is an abomination â€ “ their encounters with Oakley are their first introduction to an openly gay person .
â€œFor sure , YouTube is becoming so so important in challenging those close minded attitudes , â€ � he says .
â€œI think through YouTube a lot of people have met their first openly LGBTQ people .
And by feeling that level of intimacy with people like me and other YouTubers , it has definitely accelerated the sentiment of acceptance.â€
�
As a democratic and uncensored platform followed avidly by teenagers around the world , Oakley is adamant that YouTube is responsible for creating a future generation of more tolerant young people , without their parents ever being aware .
Oakley is far from the only gay voice on the web â€ “ other LGBT vloggers include Hannah Hart , Michael Buckley , Davey Wavey and 5AwesomeGays â€ “ and the push for gay rights has been dubbed by some as YouTubeâ€ ™ s â€œgreatest political movementâ€ � . â€œIn America itâ€ ™ s not even this aggressive homophobia thatâ€ ™ s the problem , itâ€ ™ s also just this casual attitude , â€ � Oakley says .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve heard from a lot of young people who tell me it was normal in their high school to say â€œthatâ€ ™ s so gayâ€ � , or for people to be against same sex - marriage just because their parents are , and they were never conscious of it until now .
So for them to encounter this person online â€
“
maybe itâ€ ™ s me , maybe itâ€ ™ s someone else â€ “ who has a different perspective , it can be the catalyst for a lot of people to wake up from that .
To think about that prejudice for themselves and maybe come round to a different line of thinking.â€ � Oakleyâ€ ™
s disarming honesty is a major part of his success , but many of the topics discussed in his book have never been touched on before in his videos .
For many , his book could be seen as just another progression of the â€œcult of oversharingâ€ � that has been perpetuated by YouTube celebrities , willing to document every aspect of their thoughts and lives for public consumption .
The book , which sits somewhere between a quarter - life memoir and a highly confessional chatty diary entry , reveals everything from Oakleyâ€ ™ s experiences with gay porn , losing his virginity , physical abuse by a boyfriend , his occasional dalliance with drugs and his complicated relationship with his very religious father .
But Oakley is adamant that when he first started vlogging at university , it was never his intention to use his webcam as a portal for the world to become a live audience to his life .
â€œI
never thought I would be revealing this much about myself , â€ � says Oakley with a laugh .
â€œWhen
I first had the realisation that people were watching who didnâ€ ™ t know
, my first reaction was that I should really scale back as to what Iâ€ ™ m sharing .
I was worried about even sharing my last name .
Now itâ€ ™ s the exact opposite.â€ �
In person , Oakley differs little from his online @TylerOakley
personaâ€ “ all bouffant blonde hair and sweet and disarmingly confident chat as he nibbles on blueberries .
Yet while his YouTube vlogs mostly focus on the â€œsilly and the funâ€ � , the book exposes the chinks in Oakleyâ€ ™ s armour more than his videos ever have .
But as someone who struggles still with an eating disorder , is it tough constantly being in front of the unforgiving glare of the camera ?
The internet can be a cruel place even for those blessed with unfaltering self - confidence .
For the first time , Oakley pauses , then answers without his usual exuberance .
â€œYeah ,
itâ€ ™ s a real stresser to have a visible job while also having issues pertaining to body image.â€
�
Oakleyâ€ ™ s
voice quietens .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a little bit â€ ¦ stressful .
Itâ€ ™ s definitely a thing ,
yeah .
There are certain times in my career when Iâ€ ™ ve consciously thought : I donâ€ ™ t want to make a video right now because I donâ€ ™ t feel good .
It was always about how I felt that I looked .
And yeah , thatâ€ ™ s a shitty feeling.â€
�
It was daunting , admits Oakley , to discuss his eating disorder and his depression for the first time , yet insists he did it because as an openly gay teenager , struggling with anorexia whilst growing up in Michigan , he never had any reference points or role models to look to .
â€œI
donâ€
™ t talk about my eating disorder specifically from a guyâ€ ™ s perspective because it is this universal thing that no matter who you are , girl or boy , you are still subject to being told you have to be a certain way and look a certain way
, â€ � he says very frankly .
â€œI was really happy with that chapter , Iâ€ ™ m really proud of it .
I felt good about putting this out in the world because if I had read it from somebody that I looked up to while I was going through it , it might have helped me when I was growing up and figuring things out.â€ � Oakleyâ€ ™ s book could hardly be labelled controversial â€ “
it skims over murky topics such as internet porn with the most superficial of touches â€
“ but the one area that does attract the scorn of this YouTube celebrity is religion , most specifically Catholicism .
His take on the Catholic school he was forced to attend by his born - again Christian father ( â€œmy dad and stepmum worked endlessly to make sure God was on my mind instead of dick â€ ¦
but I never bought any of itâ€ � ) would raise more than a few eyebrows if it was said by any teenage film or TV star .
But such is the power of the YouTube celebrity these days , the subject is not out of bounds for Oakley .
Oakley roars with laughter at the suggestion
it was a brave thing to write .
â€œWas
I scathing?â€ � he asks .
â€œI happily roll my eyes at a lot of things in life and religion is one of them .
It definitely didnâ€ ™ t feel brave .
Iâ€ ™ m just like , who cares ?
I didnâ€
™ t feel like a conscious stick - it - to - the man moment .
It never crossed my mind that any discussion about religion might piss people off .
Because if Iâ€ ™ m going to piss them off , then theyâ€ ™ re probably not going to make it that far into the book.â€ �
Whether Oakley and his cohort of YouTube celebrities are necessarily the best role models for the next generation is still a subject of debate .
Oakley once said he would rather watch Judge Judy than go to a museum , and the obsession with vlogging the minutiae of their lives has been seen as fostering a culture of narcissism amongst young people .
Oakley , however , doesnâ€ ™ t really buy into this theory .
â€œI think the culture of narcissism has always been there and that the medium has just emerged as a way to express it , â€ ™ he says .
He also appears to take a very nonchalant attitude towards internet trolls , who he says donâ€ ™ t bother him at all , despite their often visceral hatred directed towards him- # WeWantTylerOakleyDead , for example , trended on Twitter last year .
But surely a life in the spotlight gets exhausting ?
Are you not ever tempted , I ask , to just log off for good ?
â€œFor sure , â€ � says Oakley , diplomatic to the end .
â€œI try to be level headed about it all , and if the cons ever outweigh the pros then I will step away .
But for now , I really like it.â€ �"

Jay Pharoah â€ “ has dropped her first rap video , about how kids should go to college .
â€œIf you wanna fly jets , you should go to college .
Reach high and cash checks , fill your head with knowledge , â€ � the pair rap .
â€œIf you wanna watch paint , donâ€ ™ t go to college .
But for everything else , you should go to college.â€ �
The video , which was made with the help of the Gregory Brothers and CollegeHumor , is part of the first ladyâ€ ™ s Reach Higher campaign .
It aims to help kids get a higher education , â€œwhether at a professional training program , a community college , or a four - year college or universityâ€ � .
The initiative informs children of college opportunities , helps them understand financial aid and supports high school counsellors , according to its website .
In the video , the first lady and Pharoah , who has impersonated her husband on SNL , donned sunglasses outside the White House and informed the nation that college is necessary , unless you want to â€œwatch paintâ€ � or â€œstare at grassâ€ � .
â€œI want to honor and empower young people who are working hard in school and pursuing their dreams
â€ “
and I want to do it in a fresh and fun way

In the video Obama , who grew up in a working - class family in the South Side of Chicago , raps about her own experiences of working hard to do well at Princeton and Harvard .
â€œWe had to do overtime every night to make it tomorrow and everyone can really make their dream true , â€ � she raps .

The US president spoke to People magazine about his top culture picks of the year alongside Michelle Obama , who most enjoyed Pixarâ€ ™ s Inside Out .
The Martian , based on the best - selling novel by Andy Weir , has been one of the yearâ€ ™ s biggest hits , making more than $ 570 m ( Â£375 m ) worldwide and becoming a strong contender for awards glory next year .
It stars Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on Mars .
Last year , Obama picked Boyhood while the first lady refused to choose a favourite , instead sharing that she preferred the Gillian Flynn novel Gone Girl to David Fincherâ€ ™ s big screen adaptation .
In 2012 , the president counted Beasts of Southern Wild , Life of Pi and Argo as the yearâ€ ™ s best .
The president has previously referred to himself as â€œa movie guyâ€ � and counts Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca among his favourites .
He is also a big fan of The Godfather films .

Announcing Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s guest list on Sunday

Other guests on the list will include a once - homeless veteran , a Syrian refugee living in Michigan , Paris train attack hero Spencer Stone and Jim Obergefell , named plaintiff in the supreme court case which last year legalised same - sex marriage .
Daniel Malloy , the governor of Connecticut who instituted gun control reforms after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting of 2012 , will also attend .

President Obamaâ€ ™ s executive actions to further gun control reform otherwise stymied by the Republican - controlled Congress were announced in a tearful speech on Monday , and duly provoked fierce opposition .
Later in the week , the president made his case at a town hall meeting in Virginia , at which he was confronted by Taya Kyle , the widow of Chris Kyle , the soldier who became the subject of the book and film American Sniper and was himself shot dead in Texas .

2016-01-12,"One by one , I have watched my friends succumb to the sweaty grasp of SoulCycle : a fitness phenomenon that has been compared to a cult .
The indoor cycling chain launched in New York in 2006 ; in the intervening decade it has grown exponentially , gone public and spawned a devoted , influential following .
Michelle Obama recently revealed that she is a fan .
So is Hillary Clinton ; indeed , Chelsea Clinton recently held a SoulCycle election fundraiser for her mum .
Other high - profile devotees include Oprah , Lady Gaga , Lena Dunham and the Beckhams , and it has been parodied everywhere from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt to Mistress America .
The possibility of having a celeb sweating it out on a bike next to you is one reason why people are prepared to pay $ 34 ( Â£24 ) for a 45-minute SoulCycle class .
This is a lot to spend on pedalling a stationary bike in the dark .
But , according to SoulCycleâ€ ™ s devotees , the classâ€ ™ s combination of therapy and fitness is just so , so worth it .
â€œYou dance on a bike with all these beautiful people around you ,
â€ � a friend raves .
â€œAnd gorgeous instructors tell you inspirational messages about how you just need to be you because you are good enough.â€
�
My own experience left me poorer in money , but a little richer in wisdom .
As SoulCycle gears up for a long - awaited London launch , I will share this wisdom with you .
1
Book fast
It is very hard to get a place in a SoulCycle class ; spaces sell out at super - speed .
Remember , you may be paying them money , but the privilege is all yours , apparently .
2
Exhale your expectations SoulCycle studios are covered with slogans such as : â€œWe aspire to inspire .
We inhale intention and exhale expectation.â€ �
Before the class starts , there will be lots of attractive people inhaling intentions while looking around to see if there is anyone famous in the class .
Most of the time , there is not .
3 Buy some soul
At my first class , I am the only person not wearing SoulCycle - branded clothing .
Everyone else has $ 64 ( Â£44 ) tanktops with such things as â€œFind your soulâ€ � on them .
Meanwhile , my soul is obscured behind an old T - shirt .
â€œOh
yeah ,
â€ � says my friend , looking at me pityingly .
â€œYou should have bought the gear.â€ �
Then the music starts ; it is dark , there are candles .
We start pedalling madly as the instructor shouts :
â€œItâ€ ™ s OK to be you!â€
�
; â€œYou are strong and beautiful!â€ �
The room is hot and I feel kind of high ; everything seems possible .
Except , dammit , I should have bought some Soul gear .
4 Remember , the hype cycle will end SoulCycle is fun if you have a lot of disposable income that you donâ€

2016-01-12,"Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s legacy on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights will be front and center during his final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening :
Jim Obergefell , the named plaintiff Obergefell v Hodges , the landmark supreme court case that legalized same - sex marriage across the country last year , will be joining first lady Michelle Obama in her personal box during the address .
Obergefell is one of two dozen guests whom the White House says â€œrepresent the progress we have made since the president first delivered this speech seven years agoâ€ � .
After his prolonged â€œevolutionâ€ � on the issue of same - sex marriage
â€ “
he was for it before he was against it before he was for it
â€ “
some exasperated gay men and lesbians speculated that Obama had lost the faith of a minority that had anticipated faster and more thorough action on its legislative priorities .
But according to the activists , attorneys , plaintiffs and community leaders who helped make the dreams of gay and lesbian Americans a reality , Obamaâ€ ™ s record on the expansion of LGBT liberties has been nothing short of miraculous .
â€œPresident Obamaâ€ ™ s moral leadership and his smart , effective political and legal actions were hugely important and a shimmering part of his legacy , and I think he knows that as well , â€ � said Evan Wolfson , founder and president of marriage advocacy organization Freedom to Marry .
Wolfson , frequently described as the father of the same - sex marriage movement in the US , cites the presidentâ€ ™ s support of the movement both in public and private as crucial to its eventual success .
â€œSecuring the support of the president , and his advocacy , not only through his actions but by his explanation to the American people , was a very important part of helping us build that critical mass of states â€ “ and even more , [ to ] build that critical mass of public support , â€ � said Wolfson .
â€œThe fight was a long fight for LGBT rights , but we struck while the iron was hot , â€ � said Joe Vitale , who along with his husband Rob Talmas and their son Cooper Talmas - Vitale was one of the 31 plaintiffs in Obergefell v Hodges .
â€œThis administration has worked harder and done more to advance LGBT rights than any other â€ “ and it should have , too , given where we are in our history , â€ � said Susan Sommer , senior counsel and director of constitutional litigation at Lambda Legal , the nationâ€ ™ s oldest legal organization dedicated to expanding LGBT civil rights .
Sommer , one of the Talmas - Vitale familyâ€ ™ s attorneys , spearheaded the organizationâ€ ™ s efforts in Obergefell v Hodges .
â€œThis administration has really taken a lot of these issues to heart , â€ � Sommer said , â€œand had a number of people within the administration who have treated LGBT issues as a high priority , and it has paid off in greater equality and liberty.â€ �
Obamaâ€ ™ s record has not been perfect , Mara Keisling , founding executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , told the Guardian , but his work on transgender rights was so strong that â€œyou simply canâ€ ™ t compare it to any other administrationâ€ � .
â€œA lot of these principles are now cemented in place , â€ � said Keisling .
â€œOther [ future ] administrations will have to enforce protections for trans people .
This president helped us blow it open .
Weâ€ ™ re in a whole different context now than we were eight years ago because of President Obamaâ€ ™ s administration.â€
�
Apart from gay marriage , LGBT advocates and activists see plenty of other advances to celebrate in the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s accomplishments , from the successful passage of hate crimes legislation in 2009 to the repeal of â€œdonâ€ ™ t ask , donâ€ ™ t tellâ€ � , the law that prohibited openly gay men and women from joining the US military .
Even the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , perhaps the signature legislative accomplishment of the Obama administration , expanded protections for LGBT Americans in ways that , Sommer says , could not have happened under another administration .
â€œThe rules that have been promulgated under [ the ACA ] â€ “ recommended rules , for example , that provide access to healthcare for transgender people â€ “ are going to save lives , â€ � Sommer said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s going to save lives for transgender people who have been previously barred from getting coverage from private insurers and Medicaid alike for critical transition - related healthcare , and in enacting the Affordable Care Act as its signature piece of legislation ... this administration has taken a very important step for those who are transgender.â€ �
Administrative accomplishments regarding transgender protection , which have historically been sidelined in favor of protections for sexual orientation , have reached historic levels under the Obama administration , said Keisling .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been making policy arguments and legal arguments for decades that federal civil rights laws protect trans people .
But now , we finally have an administration that gets it .
Theyâ€ ™ re enforcing the laws that should be enforced and it has been really lifesaving and life changing trans
people.â€ �
Itâ€ ™ s a record of which the White House is unquestionably pleased .
â€œPresident Obama is proud of the fact that after seven years , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Americans are freer and more secure in the pursuit of happiness than ever before , â€ � Valerie Jarrett , senior adviser to the president , told the Guardian .
â€œNothing demonstrates that point better than hearing from our young people â€ “ both LGBT and straight â€ “ who have grown up these past seven years in a country that has become dramatically more welcoming and supportive of LGBT Americans .
We all have so much work left to do to make this a more equal and just nation , but the president is proud that when it comes to these and so many other issues , the arc of the moral universe has unquestionably bent a little closer towards justice.â€ �
For many LGBT Americans , the long evolution of the presidentâ€ ™ s views on same - sex marriage indicated of a lack of interest on the issue .
But for those who spent their entire careers in the service of expanding the right to marry to gay , lesbian and bisexual Americans in every state , the presidentâ€ ™ s prolonged journey to announcing his full support for same - sex marriage was regrettable , but , in the end , politically necessary .
â€œYou can always say it should have happened sooner , but I donâ€ ™ t hold the president uniquely accountable for that
, â€ � said Wolfson .
â€œIt wasnâ€ ™ t just one person or one thing or one battle or one case
â€ “
it was a movement.â€
�
The presidentâ€ ™ s waiting game on publicly announcing support for same - sex marriage , according to Wolfson , was due more to strategy than uncertainty .
â€œWhen the president did come out in support of the freedom to marry , â€ � said Wolfson , â€œhe did so after having taken some key , important steps , such as calling for heightened scrutiny in judicial review of sexual orientation discrimination cases including marriage , meaning that there would be a presumption of unconstitutionality rather than a rubber stamp.â€
�
Sommer credits the Obama administrationâ€
™ s refusal to defend the Defense of Marriage Act ( Doma ) in court in 2011 as a major boost to the movement that stopped short of fully endorsing marriage rights for gays and lesbians .
â€œBecause of positions that the Justice Department took â€ “ ultimately refusing to defend Doma , going shoulder - to - shoulder with the side of equality for gay people
â€ “ the DoJâ€ ™ s participation made our job easier.â€
� When the president did come out in favor of same - sex marriage in May 2012 , â€œhe did so in a way that helped explain to the American people why they should change their mindsâ€ � , said Wolfson .
â€œHe talked about the journey , the â€˜evolutionâ€ ™ , in his word , and he talked not as a lawyer , not as a commander - in - chief , but as a dad.â€ � Obamaâ€ ™ s framing of his conversion â€ “ personal , not political â€ “ was seen by Freedom to Marry as the most resonant and persuasive among people who had not yet joined their side . â€œ[Obama ] used the language that we had identified as the most effective at reaching the people who were not yet reached , and thereby gave millions more Americans permission to join him and the majority we had by then built , in moving to support the freedom to marry.â€ �
That â€œpermissionâ€ � translated into a huge bump in national support for same - sex marriage .
Support for the rights of gay and lesbian couples to we d had been in a statistical dead heat for years leading up to the presidentâ€ ™ s announcement , according to Gallup , peaking and dipping with nearly every new survey .
But following the interview in which Obama discussed how his own daughtersâ€ ™ feelings on same - sex marriage helped prompt â€œa change in perspectiveâ€ � , support for full marriage rights increased to record highs â€ “ and has not fallen since .
â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s gon na complainâ€ � about his delay in supporting same - sex marriage , said Vitale , who said that he and his husband were more annoyed with what he saw as the gay communityâ€ ™ s disinterest in activism than with any delays in support from the president .
â€œI hold a grudge against a lot of people , but I donâ€
™ t hold one against the president of the United States.â€ �
Despite advances under Obama , however , advocates do see areas of concern .
The Employment Non - Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) , proposed legislation that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity , remains mired in Congress , as it has been for more than four decades .
When Obama came out against so - called conversion therapy , the discredited practice whereby a personâ€ ™ s sexual orientation or gender identity is â€œchangedâ€ � from gay to straight or from transgender to cisgender , he declined to explicitly call for a federal law banning the practice .
But for the most part , activists dissatisfied with the lack of progress in those and other areas consider Congress , rather than the president , the real obstacle to equality .
â€œWhile it [ the administration ] had a more hospitable Congress , it did repeal â€˜donâ€
™ t ask , donâ€ ™ t tellâ€ ™ [ in 2010 ] - that was another major signature advancement , â€ � said Sommer .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a shame that the administration couldnâ€ ™ t accomplish more , in multiple ways.â€ �
â€œYou could argue that if Congress were a different kind of Congress , then it could have passed a law prohibiting discrimination in marriage throughout the countryâ€ � long before the supreme court got involved , said Wolfson .
â€œBut there would be some question of whether that is within Congressâ€ ™ s purview , given that marriage is governed by the states .
â€œHaving said that , â€ � Wolfson added , â€œCongress certainly could pass , and should pass , a federal non - discrimination law that prohibits discrimination in other important areas of life , such as employment , housing , public accommodations , education and so on , akin to the Civil Rights Act.â€
�
But when confronted with a recalcitrant legislature , the Obama administrationâ€ ™ s executive actions , such as the signing of an executive order in 2014 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity , have been important
â€œstop - gapâ€ � measures that expanded LGBT protections , Sommer said .
â€œThatâ€
™ s an example of the administration realistically seeing that it wasnâ€ ™ t going to be able to accomplish further goals in Congress and taking matters more into its own hands , â€ � Sommer continued , emphasizing that there was still room for more action that did not require congressional approval .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been advocating for â€ “ and wishing and waiting on - a federal directive to state and private federally funded providers of foster care services and child - welfare services that you canâ€ ™ t discriminate against LGBT children in the foster care system or prospective foster and adoptive parents ,
â€ � she said .
â€œThatâ€
™ s something that we think is sort of a no - brainer : federal dollars should not be used to discriminate against our nationâ€ ™ s most vulnerable children .
There are children living a daily hell facing discrimination in the foster care system , and our federal funds are being used to support that discrimination.â€ � â€œBut while we wait that clear directive , â€ � Sommer said , â€œthe responsible agency has done quite a bit at a lower level to advance non - discrimination principles and provide resources to make life better for LGBT people .
We still have a ways to go , but itâ€ ™ s been taking steps that would have been unheard of in prior eras.â€ �
Those who have benefitted most concretely from the presidentâ€ ™ s support and action on LGBT issues say that they are more than satisfied .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a supporter of Obama , â€ � said Vitale .
â€œI think Iâ€ ™ m old enough now to understand that politics is politics .
We went to his second inauguration , where he said that â€˜our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters should be equalâ€ ™ , and thatâ€ ™ s when I knew that he was gon na be on our side for the long haul .
I understand that this was an eight - year process , and we needed him here for eight years to make this happen.â€ � â€œObviously , any second - term president has the ability to have more of a voice , â€ � said Talmas .
â€œClearly weâ€ ™ ve never seen this kind of movement from an administration â€ “ in our lifetimes or others .
Iâ€ ™ m totally excited that he lived up to his word .
I , personally , would not have expected it in his first term .
Heâ€ ™ s absolutely set the standard.â€ � Additional reporting by Molly Redden in New York"
2016-01-13,"The meaning of Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s upper arms is a topic to which we will clearly need to return at length before this presidency is out , but for now letâ€ ™ s talk about the dress .
The colour was the prime talking point of the State of the Union address , before designer Narciso Rodriguez confirmed that it is officially â€œmarigoldâ€ � .
( The exact same colour was mustard when J Lo wore it to the Golden Globes two days earlier , but go figure )
The sunniness of the tone was a deliberately upbeat note , chosen as the Obamas begin the final , legacy - minded stretch of their White House tenure .
Compare and contrast with last yearâ€ ™ s serious , dark - toned skirt suit , which chimed with her husbandâ€ ™ s 2015 speech focussing on income inequality .
The dress evoked elements of the first ladyâ€ ™ s greatest fashion hits .
The inauguration of 2009 is a key reference here .
First , the intriguing colour recalled the dress and coat
she wore that day , a a paler yellow which sparked a similar naming frenzy .
( For the record , some called it citrine , but here at the Guardian we backed lemongrass . )
For Obamaâ€ ™ s arrival last night , her marigold dress was teamed with a purple coat , a daring colour combination which also harked back to that inauguration , when the first lady wore olive green gloves with her pale yellow coat , and Malia and Sasha wore bright , jewel - toned scarves in contrasting colours .
Bright colours for optimism , and surprising combinations for daring : these are central to the Michelle Obama fashion message .
The dressâ€ ™ designer was Narciso Rodriguez .
Rodriguez also designed both the black and red dress Michelle Obama wore on election night is 2008 , and the sleeveless shift in aubergine ( or rather , â€œeggplantâ€ � ) which she wore for the first State of the Union address , in 2009 .
Here , again , Michelle Obama is deliberately reminding us of the excitement and glamour of those first chapters of her time as Flotus .
In a conclusion , you need to remind your audience where you started .
Naturally , this Flotus is all over that ."
2016-01-15,"Dr Firouz Naderi has served America for 35 years , climbing the ranks at Nasa , landing spacecraft on Mars and meeting Michelle Obama at the White House .
But lately , he feels he has been treated like a second - class citizen in the country he calls home .
Iranian - born Naderi , a senior scientist at Americaâ€ ™ s space agency , fears that new visa regulations passed in the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino terror attacks will unfairly discriminate against himself and hundreds of thousands of Iranian Americans
â€ “ even those born in the US .
Measures to tighten the US visa waiver programme were passed through Congress last month as part of the omnibus spending bill .
People from 38 countries including Britain and France could previously visit the US for up to 90 days without a visa .
But thanks to a provision folded into the bill , those citizens must now obtain a visa if they are dual Iranian , Iraqi , Sudanese or Syrian citizens .
Under reciprocity agreements , these 38 countries are entitled to impose copycat travel restrictions on Americans with the same dual nationalities ; leaving many Iranian Americans â€ “ who contend that no Iranians have been linked to terrorist incidents in the west â€ “ incensed at both the practical implications and the principle .
â€œIf [ the list of countries ] included Pakistan , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , then you would sort of think that they painted with a very wide brush and it included Iran , â€ � said Naderi , 69 , director of solar system exploration at Nasaâ€ ™ s jet propulsion laboratory .
â€œThis is not based on logic .
This is based on agenda , â€ � he added .
â€œFrom what we understand , adding Iran to the list was at the 11th hour .
It was originally Iraq and Syria , then at the 11th hour they attached Iran to it , so it just smacks of somebody with an agenda that brought this about .
There is no way to logically come to the conclusion that Iran belonged to that list .
â€œIf Europe reciprocates and says , â€˜If our hyphenated Iranians will have to get a visa to come to the US , then American - hyphenated Iranians need to get a visa to come to Europe , â€ ™ â€ � Naderi said .
â€œEven people who werenâ€ ™ t planning to go Europe , or they havenâ€ ™ t gone to Europe
letâ€ ™ s say for the last 20 to 30 years , are saying : â€˜Why the hell us?â€ ™ â€ �
Iranian Americans do not have the option of renouncing their Iranian ancestry to circumvent the problem .
Iran considers anyone born in the country , or born to an Iranian father , to be an Iranian national , leaving many Americans of Iranian descent with no choice over their own dual identities .
Naderi moved to the US in 1964 , studied for a PhD and returned to Iran before emigrating to the US for good after the 1979 Iranian revolution .
He has not been back to his country of birth since , having joined Nasa almost immediately after permanently moving to the US .
In a distinguished career , Naderi has worked in various roles including managing the programme that landed the Spirit and Opportunity rovers on Mars .
He has also been a guest of the first lady at the White House .
The visa restrictions could also affect US secretary of state John Kerryâ€ ™ s son - in - law Brian Nahed , who was born in the US but is of Iranian descent and Andre Agassi , the 1992 Wimbledon champion who is the son of an Olympic boxer from Iran .
They would also affect many influential Silicon Valley leaders , including Twitter chairman Omid Kordestani , Uber director Shervin Pishevar , Expedia chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi and Dropbox co - founder Arash Ferdowsi who , according to the San Francisco Chronicle , all hold US and Iranian citizenship .
Ali Partovi , who moved to the US from Iran at age 11 and helped launch Code.org , a nonprofit which focuses on getting more women and minorities into computer science , says that the new rule amounts to â€œdiscrimination based on national heritageâ€ � .
Active on Facebook , Naderi says the Iranian American community is dismayed by Congressâ€ ™ s little - noticed case of discrimination .
â€œThey believe this was an unjust act , to attach Iranians under the label of , â€˜We need to scrutinise people coming here if theyâ€ ™ re of Iranian background , â€ ™ to be vigilant on the issue of terrorism because they rightly point out : show us the last time there was a single act of terrorism initiated by an Iranian citizen .
Basically , there isnâ€ ™ t any.â€ �
According to the US census bureau , there are 470,341 Americans with Iranian ancestry , although some estimates put the figure above a million , with the biggest concentration in California .
Nadereh Chamlou of the National Iranian American Council said : â€œThe reason Congress put Iran on the list is a quirk because Iran is on another list as an exporter of terrorism , not because they have caught an Iranian blowing himself up .
This has never happened , never .
I would like to know where they have found a single Iranian terrorist .
â€œThis is why we feel we are being singled out .
Iraq and Syria are warzones and I can not comment on Sudan .
Everywhere we have gone as Iranians , we have been exemplary citizens.â€
�
Naderi suspects the measure was intended as a swipe at Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s Iran nuclear deal , which will see some sanctions lifted soon in return for Tehran abandoning its nuclear weapons programme .
In addition to the dual citizenship restrictions , a visa waiver will now not be granted to anyone who has travelled to Iran , Iraq , Syria or Sudan in the past five years .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re a businessman in Europe and youâ€ ™ re thinking about doing business in Iran once the sanctions are lifted , and maybe you have continuing business interests in the US , you might think twice about going to Iran because thatâ€ ™ s going to impact your travelling to America , where it may be your prime market .
You might say , â€˜It would have been nice to go but itâ€ ™ s just not worth the penalty of now having to get a visa to go to the US.â€ ™
So in some way itâ€ ™ s a perpetuation of the sanctions , â€ � said Naderi .
â€œAmericaâ€ ™ s my country .
It has blemishes , warts , but to be honest with you given all that I would still prefer living here to living anywhere else.â€
�
Others have also expressed their dismay .
This week Kourosh Kolahi , an orthopedic surgeon , wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle : â€œBecause of the little - noticed visa reform language included in the federal omnibus spending bill , I am now treated differently than my wife , daughter and other fellow Americans .
I was born in this country and have spent my entire life here .
I am a proud American ; this is my home .
Yet , based on our ancestry , this law discriminates against me and other Americans.â€ �
Not every member of Congress supported the amended rules .
A group of 33 House Democrats wrote a letter , ultimately in vain , that warned : â€œMaking sure that we avoid as many unintended consequences as possible is particularly important when we are proposing to disqualify specific populations of people from long standing immigration practices .
Fundamentally , people seeking entry into our country should be evaluated based on the specific security risk that they themselves pose â€ ” not where their parents are from.â€ �
The State Departmentâ€ ™ s website now carries an â€œimportant
noticeâ€ � stating that the Department of Homeland Security has begun the process of implementing changes to the traveller eligibility requirements of the visa waiver programme .
Beth Finan , a spokesperson , said : â€œAny reciprocal action by European countries is , at this point , a hypothetical situation , and we would not want to speculate.â€ �"
2016-02-16,"Nigeria makes headlines all too often these days â€ “ for the wrong reasons .
Indeed , for the past 18 months whenever I have been outside Nigeria , people always want to know :
â€œWhat happened to those girls?â€ �
They are talking about the 276 girls taken from Chibok government secondary school in April 2014 .
They form part of a total of at least 2,000 women and girls kidnapped between January 2014 and April 2015 , who have sparked protests around the world and the intervention of high - profile figures and celebrities ranging from Michelle Obama to Chris Brown .
But almost two years on the political statements and media reports have yet to translate into meaningful help for the women and girls who come back .
Report after report has documented the brutal realities of their existences under the control of Jamaâ€ ™ at Ahlus - Sunnah Lidaâ€ ™ awati wal - Jihad ( JAS ) , commonly known as Boko Haram : they are forcibly married to fighters and subjected to rape and other sexual violence .
But it is important to not only see the women and girls involved with Boko Haram as victims .
Many try to escape .
Others choose to ferry weapons , indoctrinate and recruit or will take part in attacks .
While the focus on womenâ€ ™ s involvement with Boko Haram has been within the context of abductions , it is important to remember that many women and girls choose to join for reasons ranging from economic to ideological in motive , just as men and boys do .
There is a spectrum between force and choice , victimhood and agency that belies simplistic assumptions based on gender stereotypes .
Not much is known about the situation once the women who were abducted , and their children , are back in their communities .
A report by International Alert and Unicef published today is the first to examine what happens next .
I was part of analysing the key findings with researchers and believe they have much to say about what needs to happen .
In general , survivors of violence usually want and need healthcare , counselling and help reintegrating into their families and communities .
The report found it was no different in Maiduguri .
However , although assistance was reaching survivors , researchers found this was far from adequate given the breadth and depth of the women and girlsâ€ ™ needs and the trauma they had experienced .
It was also uneven .
People spoke of those who arrived at internally displaced camps first or were in older camps having better access and quality of services and goods .
Women and girls living in host communities reported not receiving any services at all .
Importantly , abortion is only permitted to save the life of the mother , leaving women and girls who have become pregnant with few choices .
Although a majority of women interviewed wanted to continue their pregnancy , not all were willing or able to care for the children while some had tried to abort the pregnancy using local methods .
These women and girls are stigmatised and feared by many .
Referred to as â€œBoko Haram wivesâ€ � or annoba ( epidemics ) , people are afraid they have been indoctrinated â€ “ and will spread these views .
Some husbands divorced wives on their return .
Given the lack of economic opportunities , this leaves them facing destitution .
The children they have given birth to , whose biological fathers are Boko Haram fighters , are also viewed with fear and suspicion .
They are considered â€œhyenas among dogsâ€ � , to have bad blood and are assumed likely to be the next generation of fighters .
After all , â€œa child of a snake is a snakeâ€ � .
As a result , children , including babies , and their mothers are being ostracised and left at risk of further violence .
However , many family members have shown acceptance .
Much depends on whether the woman or girl left willingly or was abducted , how long they had been married to their husbands and whether they had children together .
Many cited Quâ€ ™ ranic verses that men should take back their wives if they are in captivity for less than five and a half years and accept any child born as their own .
Most people viewed the women and girls as victims â€ “ but felt they needed to go through a deradicalisation and rehabilitation programme before reintegrating back into the community .
It is easy to know what to think about â€œinnocentâ€ � women and girls who are abducted and in captivity .
There is less certainty when they return when there has been some element of choice or when they have played some part in attacks .
Community reactions are understandable if women and girls have played active roles and given the trauma communities themselves have experienced .
These fears have been exacerbated by stories circulating of women and girls returned from captivity murdering their parents .
Understanding and nuance is needed in response .
The concerns of communities need to be addressed , but the solution is not to view all women and girls with suspicion , stigmatise and marginalise them further and infringe on their human rights .
They need high - quality , long - term , ongoing care as well as conscious efforts to address and respond to community fears .
The current insufficient and partial nature of services available needs to be redressed .
This includes the right to choose whether to continue pregnancies .
At minimum , alternative care systems for children that are monitored and regulated should be established .
Concerted efforts are needed to address the biological determinism that affects how these children are viewed , not just now but at various stages over the next few decades as they grow up .
So far , the scale of needs has outstripped response .
If urgent action is not taken then this trend is only set to increase as more women and girls return .
In 2014 , abductions in Nigeria captured the attention of the worldâ€ ™ s media , politicians and public .
Itâ€ ™ s now time to translate some of that into meaningful and long - term support for the women and girls â€ “ and their children â€ “ who have come back ."

2016-03-16,"Michelle Obama spoke about finding the courage to overcome doubters on the South Side of Chicago , her love of Stevie Wonder and why she wonâ€
™ t run for president , during an engaging and wide - ranging Q&amp;A session at SXSW .
The first lady was in Austin ostensibly to help support her advocacy project :
Let Girls Learn , which she launched at Global Citizen festival in New York last September , and took part in the session alongside Queen Latifah , Missy Elliott , actor Sophia Bush and the songwriter Diane Warren .
The conversation started with the panelists asked to reveal a pivotal moment that changed their way of thinking .
Queen Latifah spoke about the rise of crack cocaine and Aids in the 80s , while Obama chose her childhood in Chicago .
â€œGrowing up as a black girl on the South Side of Chicago , where the expectations of me were limited .
As I was trying to make my way and do good in school and apply to good colleges , there were always people around telling me what I couldnâ€
™ t do , â€ � she said .
â€œMy reaction to that at the time was to prove the doubters wrong .
But not every young person reacts to it that way
and there are many people whose dreams get snuffed out.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve heard horrifying stories of young women who are pushed down because theyâ€ ™ re trying to get an education
, â€ � she continued before referencing Malala Yousafzai and the abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls in northern Nigeria as extreme examples of when young women are prevented from gaining access to education .
Queen Latifah played the role of moderator and guided the conversation which , as well as having serious moments , also included Obama revealing the fact that Stevie Wonderâ€ ™ s Talking Book was her favourite ever album .
The biggest cheer from the crowd , who had to wait three hours and go through airport - style security checks , came when Latifah asked if Michelle Obama would ever consider a presidential run .
â€œIâ€ ™ m going to continue to work with young people all over the world , â€ �
she said before pausing .
â€œNot as president .
I will not run for president.â€ �
After a chorus of playful jeers from the crowd she explained that one of the reasons was that so her children â€ “ Malia and Sasha â€ “ would no longer be in the spotlight .
â€œNo , no not going to do it .
One of the reasons why is that Iâ€ ™ ve got these two young people at home .
Being the kids , the daughters of a president , just think about it .
Come on young people , not so easy .
Theyâ€ ™ ve handled it with grace and with poise , but there are so many ways to impact the world and you donâ€ ™ t have to be president of the United States to do them.â€ �
She said she was planning to continue her advocacy work , with a special focus on working with young people , after her time at the White House and that she wanted a new generation of engaged young people to get into politics .
â€œI
just know that if I can do this and be here and have gone to great colleges and have all these wonderful experiences , you can do it too ,
â€ � she said .
â€œExperiencing this journey with our young people of all ages , Iâ€ ™ ll miss that , but Iâ€ ™ m going to keep doing it for the rest of my life.â€ �"

â€œAside from being great singers , theyâ€ ™ re all strong women .
Like Kelly Clarkson , she doesnâ€ ™ t take shit from anybody , you know?â€ �
Warren said .
â€œNone of these girls do .

Warren , Elliott and Sophia Bush will also feature during Obamaâ€ ™ s speech .
In conjunction with the release of the song , Obama also penned a letter for Lena Dunhamâ€ ™ s newsletter , Lenny , in which she highlighted her personal connection to the global education initiative .
As first lady , she has traveled and met several girls who donâ€ ™ t have access to education , for a variety of reasons , Obama wrote .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve met girls who make long , dangerous journeys each day to school and then come home and study for hours each night .
Iâ€ ™ ve met girls studying at rickety desks in bare concrete classrooms who are raising their hands so hard theyâ€ ™ re almost falling out of their chairs ,
â€ � Obama wrote .
â€œI see myself in these girls â€ “ in their ambition and their determination to rise above their circumstances.â€ �"
2016-03-31,"Hamilton , Lin - Manuel Mirandaâ€ ™ s award - winning Broadway musical , has faced criticism for an open casting call seeking only â€œnon - whiteâ€ � actors .
The hip - hop musical , which has been praised by Michelle Obama and which won a Grammy , features a diverse cast that reimagines the origin story of founding father Alexander Hamilton .
The majority of the cast is multiethnic as well : African Americans play Aaron Burr , George Washington and Thomas Jefferson , while a Chinese American portrays Hamiltonâ€ ™ s wife , Eliza .
Miranda , the showâ€ ™ s creator , is of Puerto Rican ancestry .
The open casting notice for the showâ€ ™ s national tour , posted on Hamiltonâ€ ™ s official website earlier this week , called for : â€œNON - WHITE men and women , ages 20s to
30s.â€ �
The advert was criticised on social media , with Actorâ€ ™ s Equity , the union that represents stage performers in the US , saying the posting did not adhere to the organizationâ€ ™ s policies .
Equityâ€ ™ s guidelines stipulate that all actors must be considered â€œwithout discrimination on the basis of sex , race , color , creed , national origin , age , disability , sexual orientation , gender identity and/or expression or political persuasion or beliefâ€ � .
The association had requested that producers take down the notice .
Civil rights attorney Randolph McLaughlin went so far as to say the call amounts to a violation of the New York City Human Rights Law , which makes it unlawful â€œfor an employer â€ ¦ because of the actual written or perceived â€ ¦ race of any person , to discriminateâ€ � .
â€œYou can not advertise showing that you have a preference for one racial group over another , â€ �
McLaughlin said on Tuesday to CBS .
â€œAs an artistic question
â€ “ sure , he can cast whomever he wants to cast , but he has to give every actor eligible for the role an opportunity to try.â€ � Hamilton producers on Wednesday defended their decision .
A statement released by producer Jeffrey Seller read : â€œHamilton depicts the birth of our nation in a singular way .
We will continue to cast the show with the same multicultural diversity that we have employed thus far.â€ �
A Hamilton spokesperson subsequently released a statement , stressing that â€œit is essential to the storytelling of Hamilton that the principal roles â€ “ which were written for non - white characters ( excepting King George )
â€ “ be performed by non - white actorsâ€ � .
The statement also noted that the producers would amend the language of the casting call to welcome â€œpeople of all ethnicitiesâ€ � to audition for Hamilton .
The updated ad , posted Thursday , now calls for â€œmen and women , ages 20s to 30s , for the non - white charactersâ€ � in Hamilton .
A disclaimer also reads : â€œPerformers of all ethnic and racial backgrounds are encouraged to attend.â€ �"
2016-04-05,"There will be plenty of formal farewells and grand eulogies .
But what the Obamas may miss most when they leave the White House in January are the small , intimate moments such as the annual kitchen garden planting on the south lawn .
â€œI want to take this time to thank all the kids here and all the kids around the country whoâ€ ™ ve been a part of this garden ,
â€ �
Michelle Obama said a little wistfully on Tuesday .
â€œThis is my baby and hopefully this will not be the last planting .
Hopefully there will be other administrations who come in and they take up this project and continue to make this a part of the White House tradition.â€
�
The first lady created the garden eight years ago in response to Americaâ€ ™ s scourge of obesity .
Some of the children who took part in that first planting in 2009 returned to the White House on a bright but cold Tuesday to help her plant garlic , parsley , broccoli , chicory , spinach , rhubarb , turnip and other fruit , vegetables , herbs and flowers .
â€œYou guys were in fifth grade and you are now in high school and you look different!â€ �
Obama said .
â€œYou have grown up !
I kind of remember a couple of faces .
You guys started with us and you ended with us .
You guys are pros now .
Weâ€ ™ ve come full circle.â€ �
Wearing a shiny green jacket , trousers and trainers , Obama put on green gloves and got to work on a bed of lettuce , chatting with the children about what they had seen in Washington , their favourite subjects at school and what books they are reading .
â€œSo , are you into The Hunger Games , all that stuff?â€ �
she asked one girl .
â€œHarry Potter â€
“ youâ€ ™ ve been through that?â€ �
It was the kind of informal scene where the first lady has always been at ease .
Last week she joined Barack Obama at the annual Easter egg roll â€ “ again for the last time .
There will be a last Thanksgiving turkey pardoning , a last Christmas tree , a last parting from the White House and its staff .
The Obamas are ticking them all off .
Healthy eating and lifestyles became a personal crusade for Michelle Obama and found expression in her Letâ€ ™ s
Move !
initiative , which claims to have improved the school breakfasts and lunches of more than 30 million children .
Food and beverage companies have cut 6.4tn calories from their products .
Obama said : â€œIt was eight years ago that we cooked up this really interesting idea that we maybe we could dig up some dirt on the south lawn â€
“
maybe somebody would let us do that â€ “
and we could plant a garden that would be a space for us to talk about the food we eat .
It was always the idea that we would have kids involved in everything we do .
â€œItâ€
™ s been really a fun tradition for us here at the White House because I think weâ€ ™ ve really been able to change the conversation about what you guys eat.â€ �
It has also encouraged an increase in community gardens in local neighbourhoods , she added .
The first lady will now embark on a â€œgarden tourâ€
� around the country highlighting school gardens .
Now spanning 1,700 square feet , hers is the first major vegetable garden at the White House since Eleanor Rooseveltâ€ ™ s Victory Garden in 1943 and has produced nearly 500 pounds of produce for homeless people in the area .
Obama pointed with some pride to a composting bin nearby .
Tuesdayâ€ ™ s planting included the same variety of lettuce that has been grown on the International Space Station and involved Nasa deputy administrator Dava Newman and astronaut Candy Coleman .
Impressed by the childrenâ€ ™ s handiwork , Obama exclaimed at one point : â€œYou guys are so diligent!â€ �
Turning to the press , she asked jokingly : â€œWho wants a worm?â€ �
She gathered for a group photo at the end and got everyone to shout :
â€œI love veggies!â€ �
A moment later she asked : â€œNow whoâ€ ™ s going to come back and help me harvest?â€ �"
2016-04-21,"When Michelle Obama flies in to join her husband for birthday lunch with the Queen on Friday it will also mark an annual ritual for White House schedulers : when in doubt , reach for the royals .
Throughout a presidency known for cordial but somewhat stiff relations with Britainâ€ ™ s political rulers , the monarchy has provided a flexible sticking plaster to cover up any sign of cracks in the special relationship .
Ever since the first lady and the Queen famously put their arms around each other during the Obamasâ€ ™ first official visit to the UK , a series of surprisingly relaxed encounters have delighted diplomats on both sides of the pond .
Princes Harry , Charles and William have all paraded through the Oval Office in the last 18 months , receiving levels of presidential access and bonhomie usually reserved for current heads of state rather than those in the waiting room .
And the celebrity pull of the House of Windsor has captivated American audiences too .
The recent trip to India by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge received such widespread US media attention that one political reporter complained it was temporarily eclipsing the presidential primary race on local television .
Dinner on Friday night at Kensington Palace with Wills and Kate , as they are still better known here , will be another photo - op few networks will pass up .
A visit to Congress by Prince Harry in 2013 also marked a rare moment where Capitol Hillâ€ ™ s studied boredom was abandoned in favour of evident swooning by many young political staffers .
Whether political leaders actually feel the same way is another matter of course , and official claims to the contrary should be treated with caution .
â€œThe president has very much enjoyed his engagements with the Queen over the years , â€ � insists White House adviser Ben Rhodes , who described the relationship as â€œlongstandingâ€ � .
But the Queen has also seen them come and go , meeting all of the last 12 presidents except Lyndon Johnson , and no two families in the world today can have had more experience of making polite chit - chat in front of the cameras look authentic .
Nonetheless , the lack of political baggage that normally travels with the White House on such occasions certainly appears to come as a relief to the Obamas as they enter the twilight months of the presidency .
The US first ladyâ€ ™ s tolerance for diplomatic fakery is noticeably thinner than her husbandâ€ ™ s and her surprise last - minute decision to join him at Windsor Castle on Friday is in stark contrast with her absence from the presidentâ€ ™ s more important , but workmanlike , meeting with King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Thursday .
Their private encounters are not entirely without political substance either .
When Prince Charles escaped from the London goldfish bowl for a few days in Washington and New York last year , he was said to be keen to share his experience of dealing with Gulf monarchies during a meeting with Obama .
How much weight these pearls of wisdom will have carried inside the Oval Office one can only guess .
On the face of it , Obama is about as unlikely a royalist as George Washington .
His memoir , Dreams From My Father , provided a powerful reminder of his familyâ€ ™ s anti - imperialist past in Kenya , and there are suggestions that his grandfather was tortured at the hands of colonial forces .
More recent interviews suggest scepticism about Downing Streetâ€ ™ s modern - day commitment to maintaining international order and prompted the UK Independence party leader , Nigel Farage , to claim that Obama was the most anti - British president in history .
The allegation is firmly denied by White House officials , who view the trip to the UK as a chance to lend a hand to Cameron during the difficult weeks leading up to the Brexit referendum .
But the need to preserve a fig - leaf of neutrality on domestic political matters will always limit the extent of any Downing Street love - in this close to an election .
What better venue can there be instead to stress the enduring , non - political , aspect of the special relationship than Windsor Castle , a real life Downton Abbey , where there is another family that knows what it is like to live life under the relentless glare of television lights ."
2016-04-22,"The Duke of Edinburgh , 94 , turned chauffeur when he ferried the US president and first lady to lunch at Windsor Castle .
As Barack and Michelle Obama touched down in the castle grounds in their helicopter , Marine One , waiting to greet them was the Queen , wearing a floral headscarf to protect against a chill wind , and her husband Philip in a casual raincoat .
After greeting the Obamas with a firm handshake , Philip gestured them towards the waiting Range Rover before clambering into the driving seat .
The president hopped in the front with him , while the Queen and first lady sat in the back .
Marine One had landed on the golf course of the estate next to the castle walls , so the drive was only about 400 yards .
As the two heads of state and their spouses arrived safely at the castle , Obama appeared to move as if to offer the Queen assistance in disembarking the Range Rover , but she navigated her own exit .
Onlookers thought she had said something to the president about often having trouble stepping down from that vehicle .
The Queen and president than walked toward the steps of the castle , while the first lady , who had chosen an Oscar de la Renta dress and Narciso Rodriquez coat for the occasion , waited for the prince .
Initially there seemed to be some confusion among the US media , who landed in Marine Three minutes before the president , and who appeared to have forgotten UK vehicles have their driving seats on the opposite side to those in the US .
â€œIs Obama driving?â€
�
they were heard exclaiming , before realising it was , in fact , the elderly prince .
Philip , 95 next month , is a very experienced driver of both vehicles , and , famously , horse - drawn carriages .
If the presidentâ€ ™ s security detail harboured any nervousness about the age of the driver , they did not betray it as the royal couple and the leader of the free world and his wife headed off for a private lunch .
They were followed by the presidentâ€ ™ s 11-car motorcade for the brief journey .
There were no complicated driving manoeuvres required .
While the prince and the Queen were waiting to greet the Obamasâ€ ™ s helicopter , their car had conveniently been turned around by a member of staff , thus negating the necessity for Philip to turn it round himself or , even trickier , reverse it back up the drive .
Once inside the castle , the four posed for a photograph in the Oak Room in the Queenâ€ ™ s private apartment .
On the day after her 90th birthday , this was to be an intimate lunch attended only by the Queen , Philip , and the Obamas .
The president and his wife have developed a close bond with the royals since Obama came to office , and the Queen hosted them at Buckingham Palace during their 2011 state visit to the UK .
On another occasion , the first lady was seen putting an arm around the monarchâ€ ™ s waist .
Arriving at Kensington Palace for a private dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry , Obama and his first lady were greeted with an apology .
â€œSorry about the weatherâ€
� , said Prince William , seeing the presidential couple sheltering under a black umbrella on leaving their car .
They were also greeted to the sight of Prince George , wrapped up in check pyjamas and a white dressing gown who had been given a 15-minute bedtime extension and was waiting in the hallway for a glimpse , though his 11-months - old sister , Princess Charlotte , was asleep .
A Kensington Palace spokesman said : â€œPrince George stayed up to meet the president and first lady when they arrived at Kensington Palace .
â€œHe was able to show the president and first lady a rocking horse â€ “ given to George when he was born â€ “ and a stuffed toy â€ “ given to George when Princess Charlotte was born - that had been previously given to him by president and Mrs Obama.â€
� Photographs of the presidential visit offered a rare glimpse of the interior of the Cambridgesâ€ ™ 20-room abode , Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace , refurbished at a cost of Â£4.5 m to the public purse ."
2016-04-27,"Hereâ€ ™ s a quick prediction : Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s appearance on NCIS next month will be a huge disappointment .
It has been revealed that , in the forthcoming episode Homefront , the first lady will host NCIS special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs at the White House for a discussion about her military charity , Joining Forces .
Thatâ€ ™ s it .
What a wasted opportunity .
Not that we shouldnâ€ ™ t have seen it coming , of course â€ “ over the past couple of years , the Obamas have embarked on a highly targeted media assault in a bid to reach audiences that might not otherwise be engaged by traditional political discussion .
Thatâ€ ™ s why Barack Obama has turned up on MythBusters and Between Two Ferns , and Michelle has shown her face on Nashville and slow - danced with Big Bird to Donâ€ ™ t Want to Miss a Thing by Aerosmith on Billy on the Street .
Itâ€ ™ s a smart formula .
You show up , play along for a bit and then â€ “ just when youâ€ ™ ve lulled everybody into a false sense of security â€ “
you smack them over the head with an awkward call to arms about climate change or healthy eating or whatever .
In this regard , NCIS is the perfect vehicle for Joining Forces .
Not only is it broadly about the military , but itâ€ ™ s also the most - watched scripted drama on US television right now .
Not that you watch it yourself , of course .
Youâ€ ™ ve got better things to do than keep up with the dizzying treadmill of identical initial - based all - caps American procedurals and their infinite array of identical spin - offs .
What if you start to get into NCIS , then , halfway through , realise that you actually switched to NCIS : New Orleans â€ “ or worse , CSI :
Cyber ?
You would never be able to show your face in public again .
But that doesnâ€ ™ t matter .
Americans watch NCIS in their millions , which means itâ€ ™ s where Michelle will make the biggest splash .
Or at least she would , if her episode didnâ€ ™ t sound like such an incredibly dry government - sanctioned infomercial .
Imagine if Samantha Cameron burst on to the set of Downton Abbey and started to lecture the Dowager Countess on fiscal responsibility .
Youâ€ ™
d hate her for upsetting the balance of the show , wouldnâ€ ™ t you ?
Thatâ€ ™ s precisely the risk Michelle runs by appearing on NCIS .
But itâ€ ™ s not too late .
Thereâ€ ™ s still a week before her episode airs in the US ( itâ€ ™ s on in the UK later in May ) , which is more than enough time for her to order some reshoots .
Rather than the stilted , momentum - sapping , agenda - pushing appearance it sounds like she has already filmed , she should roll up her sleeves and dive straight into the action .
It wouldnâ€ ™ t take much .
She would just need to run down a suspiciously well - lit corridor with an assault rifle , or quaver â€œI see the way she looks at youâ€ � to another character in a deep breathy whisper in order to maintain the showâ€ ™ s general air of soapy trashiness .
Worst comes to worst , she just needs to look up from a computer and read a torrent of impenetrable exposition from an off - camera cue card , since that sort of thing apparently makes up about 90 % of NCIS anyway .
See ?
Easy .
Michelle Obama , I just saved your skin ."
2016-04-29,"The first date between Barack and Michelle Obama is brought to the screen in Southside
With You , a Before Sunrise - style indie that has already received positive reviews at Sundance .
The trailer has now arrived , giving us our first real look at the romantic drama .
Little - known actors Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter take on the leads as the politically aware and ambitious twentysomethings who spend a day exploring the Chicagoâ€ ™ s South Side together .
It is written and directed by first - time film - maker Richard Tanne and produced by John Legend .
The film was well received when it premiered earlier this year at the Sundance film festival , with Varietyâ€ ™ s Justin Chang calling it â€œdisarmingly romanticâ€ � and the Hollywood Reporterâ€ ™ s Todd McCarthy recommending it as â€œwarm and surprisingly engagingâ€ � .
While the Obamas themselves havenâ€ ™ t made an official comment on the film , Tanne claimed at a Q&amp;A that they were supportive .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve heard from some pretty reliable sources that they are aware [ of the film],â€ � he said .
â€œThey are excited .
And they are also a little baffled by its existence.â€ � Tanneâ€ ™ s knowledge of the intricacies of the date itself has been informed by â€œpublic - domain articles , interviews ,
videosâ€ �
and he claims the trajectory of the date is 90 % accurate .
â€œThey went to the art institute , â€ �
he said .
â€œThey had lunch afterwards .
They saw Do the Right Thing .
They had ice cream .
They kissed outside the ice cream parlour ...
there was some question as to whether or not the community organising meeting happened on the first date , or if it just happened early in the courtship , but dramatically it worked , so I just put it in .
Again , itâ€ ™ s a fictionalised account ,
so I tried to be as authentic as possible.â€ �

With You is released in US cinemas on 19 August with a UK date yet to be confirmed ."
2016-04-29,"It is a promotional video with a rather more high - profile cast than usual : Barack and Michelle Obama , Prince Harry and the Queen herself .
The last time the 90-year - old monarch featured in a spoof video , she was escorted to the London Olympics by Daniel Craig as James Bond .
This time , she is seen with grandson Harry in a video to promote the Invictus Games for disabled veterans .
Prince Harryâ€ ™ s role as a patron of the games has helped him pull in the big names for the 40-second promo .
Its starts with Harry and the Queen sitting on a sofa in front of a fire , leafing through a brochure of the games , when the princeâ€ ™ s mobile goes off , to the tune of Hail to the Chief .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a message from Michelle , how very amusing .
Shall we watch it together?â€ � he asks .
When he opens the message , the Obamas appear , arms folded , with two servicemen and a servicewoman behind them .
â€œHey Prince Harry , remember when you told us to bring it at the Invictus Games , â€ � says the first lady .
â€œCareful what you wish for , â€ � says the US president , whose last contribution to matters British was more serious : he suggested on a visit to London last week that the UK would move to the back of the queue in any trade talks with the US if it left the EU .
After the president does his bit , one of the servicemen does a mock gangster gesture , saying â€œBoomâ€ � .
Switching back to this side of the pond , the Queen grins at her grandson and appears to utter : â€œBoom ?
Really , pleaseâ€ � , although there was debate online about whether she actually only said : â€œOh , really ,
please.â€ �
The Games are for serving personnel and veterans who are wounded , injured or sick .
Named after the Latin word for unconquered or undefeated , the inaugural Invictus games were held in London in 2014 .
This yearâ€ ™ s event will feature more than 500 athletes from 15 countries competing in 10 events , including archery , indoor rowing , powerlifting , road cycling and wheelchair tennis .
The Games start in Orlando , Florida , in a weekâ€ ™ s time ."
2016-05-03,"Malia Obama is taking a gap year , the White House has announced , before taking up a freshman place at Harvard , and who could blame her ?
Anyone would need a break after spending eight years enduring the scrutiny of a White House childhood ( for that matter , I hope Michelle Obama gets a gap year , too , in which no one remarks upon her outfits or hair or critiques her for having thoughtful opinions ) .
But for many young Americans , a year off spent working at the Gap in order to earn money to fund an undergraduate education would be an unattainable dream , much less an opportunity to take a year between high school and college to decompress and transition from childhood to something that resembles being an adult .
Long a rite of passage for the privileged in the UK , where naive eighteen - year - olds have for decades been attempting to find themselves in foreign climes , one large backpack at a time , gap years are increasingly a trend for the lucky and few young Americans who arenâ€ ™ t afraid of a future in which theyâ€ ™ ll graduate from college into a job market with low pay and little security , and with an average of nearly $ 30,000 in student loan debt .
Thatâ€ ™ s not to say that gap years arenâ€ ™ t a good idea : I think it would have been great if my first year as an undergraduate hadnâ€ ™ t coincided with my first time living away from my parents , living in a major metropolitan area , drinking alcohol and fraternizing with 19-year - old men who wore black turtlenecks .
But time out was then , and is still , a luxury mostly afforded to those young people who are in little haste to enter the job market and support themselves , and who donâ€ ™ t fear the mounting expenses of college .
Higher education seemed expensive when I matriculated in the Clinton years , and seems downright terrifying now .
( I do know one person who took time out between high school and college without benefiting from financial support from parents , but he was from a country where undergraduate education was free . )
While the US lacks a class system as entrenched by the accident of birth as that of our British friends , access to education makes rapid work of filtering teenagers into buckets of relative privilege .
Iâ€ ™ m well aware that my access to the university where I received my undergrad degree was strongly influenced by things that had little to do with my aptitude and much to do with who my parents were : that they were able to afford a home in a school district with a highly ranked public high school .
That they had gone to college themselves .
That they didnâ€ ™ t need me to have a job to contribute to the household income while I was in high school .
For this reason , in professional situations when Iâ€ ™ ve been part of hiring committees , Iâ€ ™ ve advocated that we ignore where people studied as undergraduates , because itâ€ ™ s tantamount to judging the financial situation of , say , a 30-year - oldâ€ ™ s parents when they were 15 .
But my position on this is not shared by many top employers , where candidates are still rejected outright for having made the grave mistake of attending state schools .
If a gap year becomes a de rigueur addition for the CVs of the children of privilege , if paying a company to spend a year volunteering overseas between high school and college is taken into account as a factor for adults entering the job market , I fear weâ€ ™ ll only be further losing the battle between equality and capitalism .
Malia Obama is a private citizen , not a politician , and itâ€ ™ s not up to her to work on these issues : I hope she has a great , interesting , enlightening time on her gap year .
But this might be a nice opportunity for her understandably proud father to take a strong position .
In these waning months of his presidency , might he address the issue of why post - high school education is so burdensome to so many young Americans ?
We need college to , once again , be a route to some kind of American dream , rather than a descent into a debt - ridden American nightmare ."
2016-06-03,"In a commencement address , Michelle Obama delivered a withering attack on Donald Trump , warning graduates that intimidation and fear are ingredients for a national demise .

2016-06-03,"Michelle Obama has delivered a withering attack on Donald Trump , warning a graduating class of New York students , and through them America , that those who seek to rule by intimidation and fear end up diminishing the hope and freedom of their nations .
Without mentioning the presumptive Republican presidential candidate by name , the first lady made one of the most sustained and potent attacks on Trump since he began his bid for the White House last year .
She portrayed his brand of politics as un - American and dangerous , comparing him to world leaders â€œwho stifle the voices and dismiss the potential of their citizens â€ ¦ who demonise and dehumanise entire groups of people because they have nothing else to offer.â€ � Addressing the class of 2016 at the City College of New York in her 23rd and final commencement speech as first lady , she said :
â€œGraduates , that is not who we are .
That is not what this country stands for.â€ �
She went on : â€œHere in America we donâ€
™ t let our differences tear us apart .
Here in America we donâ€ ™ t give in to our fears , we donâ€
™
t build walls to keep people out.â€ �
She alluded to those who â€œtell us to be afraid of those who are different , to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree .
They act as if name - calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate , as though anger and intolerance should be our default rather than optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.â€ � Obamaâ€ ™ s speech , possibly the last major public statement she will make as first lady , was a tour de force of a form of quiet political activism that she has made her own , almost without anybody noticing .
At a time of unparalleled bitter partisanship in American politics , Obama has managed to pull off the seemingly impossible : while her husband has become a hate figure for the right and a subject of sustained racially tinted trolling , she has managed to keep above the fray while continuing to be a powerful advocate for greater racial tolerance .
Her favorability rating has remained steady at an astronomical 70 % , even at times when the presidentâ€ ™ s have slumped to 40 % .
The public adoration towards her is reflected in her 5 million followers on Twitter and Instagram , and by the crowd of almost 4,000 students before her under a grey New York sky who chanted â€œFour more years !
Four more years!â€ � as though she were the president whose term limit is approaching .
Obama , who will be 52 when she leaves the White House , chose the venue for her final commencement carefully .
Founded in 1847 on a hill overlooking Harlem , City College was the first free public college in the US with a specific mission to serve the children of poor and immigrant families , in stark contrast to its rich neighbour down the road , Columbia University .
Today , it retains a highly diverse student body .
Among Obamaâ€ ™ s audience on Friday were students speaking more than 100 languages , 40 % of whom were first - generation college students .
Some have been homeless , and many work two jobs to pay for themselves throughout college .
They join a body of alumni that includes Ira Gershwin , Colin Powell and 10 Nobel laureates .
Obama said she had chosen City College for this poignant moment in her own life
â€
“
â€œthis is a big day for me too ,
â€ �
she said â€ “ for the very reason that it was what she called a â€œdynamic inclusive placeâ€ � .
She said it represented â€œthe power of our differences , making us smarter and more creative .
That is how the infusion of all our cultures , generation after generation , created the matchless alchemy of our melting pot and helped us build the strongest , most vibrant , most prosperous nation on the planet.â€ �
A melting pot , she went on to imply in front of the students who at that point fell ominously silent , Trump was determined to destroy .
â€œDespite our history , some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective , â€ � Obama said .
â€œThey seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped.â€ �
She listed the creations of immigrants to America : Google and eBay , the telephone and the artificial heart , even blue jeans and the national anthem .
â€œNational landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge and , yes , the White House â€ “ both were designed by architects who were immigrants.â€
� The underlying theme of Obamaâ€ ™ s speech â€ “ the value of racial , religious and ethnic diversity to Americaâ€ ™ s future â€ “
lies at the core of how she has moulded her undefined role as the nationâ€ ™ s first lady .
The three great causes she has made her own â€ “ encouraging young people , especially girls to take up higher education ; supporting members of the military and their families , and fighting obesity â€ “ relate to problems and challenges that African Americans in disproportionate numbers have struggled with over generations .
Yet she did so without being accused of radicalism or anti - white animosity ; rather she deployed humour and the power of her own example to bring others along .
Her followers included not just liberals and human rights campaigners , but Walmart and big food companies who were cajoled into making major changes that would benefit particularly the poor and disadvantaged .
Just last week she was instrumental in introducing a new rule that will force companies to disclose on labels how much added sugar their products contain â€ “ a reform that she helped to achieve against considerable opposition from the food industry .
The same gentle yet forceful persuasion epitomised her work on racial equality .
She reminded the City College students that her family had come to America â€œin
chainsâ€ �
â€ “
but she said it not as an admonition but as an exaltation that they follow her on to higher things .
As Peter Slevin , who teaches journalism at the Medill School at Northwestern University and is author of Michelle Obama :
A Life , puts it :
â€œItâ€ ™ s hard to imagine any other first lady shouting , â€˜Black girls rock!â€ ™ as she did so joyfully on a BET awards show last year.â€ �
Though sheâ€ ™ s mastered the appearance of being relaxed and at ease as first lady , and at times has been self - deprecating â€ “ famously saying that she was â€œprepared to make a complete fool of myselfâ€ �
if it did good â€ “ the impression is misleading .
She approached the role with the precision and determination of the Harvard - trained lawyer that she is .
Slevin said that Obama is â€œnothing if not disciplined .
Aides say she is the most strategic person they have ever met .
She is not a ribbon - cutter or one of those political spouses who gazes silently and adoringly from the wings.â€ �
Before Obama spoke , she listened to the address of the City College salutatorian Orubba Almansouri , who was born in Yemen and after coming to the US had to persuade her disapproving family that she should be allowed to break a tribal tradition and go to college rather than marry .
â€œThey wanted me to go to the university of the kitchen , â€ � Almansouri said ,
â€œbut I fought to be allowed to pursue an education , for the right to be here today.â€
�
Obama said that Almansouri and her fellow Class of 2016 were â€œthe living , breathing proof that the American dream endures in our time
â€ “
it is you.â€
�
As she ended the speech , preparing to return to her final few months in the White House , she urged them to find strength in the â€œpower of our differencesâ€ � .
â€œTake
an oath to make your city and your world greater and more beautiful , â€ �
she said .
â€œThat is the American story.â€ �"
2016-06-24,"Celebrities singing along to the car radio sounds like unlikely TV gold , but when Michelle Obama said she would take part in James Cordenâ€ ™ s
Carpool Karaoke
it was the ultimate seal of approval for what has become a global viral phenomenon .
The US first lady will be the latest big name to appear in the front seat alongside Corden in the most popular slot of his CBS talkshow .
Adeleâ€ ™ s appearance at the beginning of this year , belting her way through her hits and even the Spice Girlsâ€ ™ Wannabe and a Nicky Minaj rap , has been watched by more than 110 million people online , around 100 times the number who watch Cordenâ€ ™ s
Late , Late Show .
Corden has persuaded everyone from Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez to George Clooney and Jennifer Hudson to take part in the segment , which critics have described as the must - see moment of late - night US TV .
But it is one of the luxuries of the YouTube era that you donâ€ ™ t have to stay up late to watch it .
Cordenâ€ ™ s friend and producer , fellow Brit Ben Winston , has described it as a â€œgateway drugâ€ � into the rest of the show .
The idea for Carpool Karaoke , now being made into a standalone series , dates back to the 2011 edition of Comic Relief when Corden did a similar thing alongside George Michael .
Three years later , he did it in a BBC1 road trip documentary with Take That frontman Gary Barlow .
The format was resurrected in the first week of Cordenâ€ ™ s CBS show , in March last year , when Mariah Carey was going to be away from Los Angeles at the time of recording , so they filmed her in a car instead .
Some 25 m YouTube views later , a format was born .
Its success , and the popularity of Jimmy Fallonâ€ ™ s Lip Sync Battle on NBCâ€
™ s
The Tonight Show , has prompted rival broadcasters to launch a hunt for their own viral hits .
The BBC is hopeful that a new 10 pm show being developed for BBC2 will have something of the Saturday Night Live about it , although how it will fare on UK budgets â€ “ a fraction of those in the US â€ “ remains to be seen .
Corden attributed the skitâ€ ™ s success to freeing up celebrities from their entourage and giving them the legroom to be themselves .
Or , at least , appear to be .
â€œYouâ€ ™ re dealing with people like Justin Bieber or Stevie Wonder or Mariah Carey â€ ¦ who , for a very long time , have never really been on their own , â€ � he has said .
â€œWe shoot them for about 40 minutes and theyâ€ ™ re completely on their own .
Itâ€ ™ s me and them and fixed cameras and thatâ€ ™
s it .
I think they find that very liberating and thereâ€ ™ s a joy in that Iâ€
™ m very proud of.â€
�
Graham Stuart , the long - time business partner of Graham Norton and executive producer of his BBC1 show , said : â€œItâ€ ™ s an incredibly clever piece of television , based on principles that we have worked with , that you take a famous person out of context and get them to do stuff and people love it .
â€œJames Corden can sing and , although itâ€ ™ s a spoof , the performances are really good .
When you crank up the fame â€ “ with the first lady or the worldâ€ ™ s biggest pop stars
â€ “
a small idea becomes a giant idea and youâ€ ™ ve got yourself a major item.â€
�
If there is a potential downside it is that the slot becomes so successful that it overshadows the rest of the show .
But if they have created a monster , then CBS will ensure it is a money - making one , bringing McDonaldâ€ ™ s and Coca - Cola on board as sponsors ( in a recent episode Corden and guest Selena Gomez stopped at a McDonaldâ€ ™ s drive through and ordered a Coke ) .
Wayne Garvie , chief creative officer for international production at Sony Pictures Television , said : â€œWhat I like about it
â€ “ and itâ€ ™ s the same with
Jimmy Fallon â€ “ is that it just makes you feel happy
and you have a laugh .
Thereâ€ ™ s not enough TV at the moment that makes you feel like that .
â€œItâ€ ™ s a very brilliant simple idea , driven by James Cordenâ€
™ s
electric personality .
It feels like a party that you want to be a part of â€ “ you want to be in that car with Corden â€ “ as opposed to looking at rich people having a good time .
Thatâ€ ™ s a very subtle thing.â€
�
But would it work in the UK ?
Garvieâ€ ™ s not so sure .
â€œThey are shooting in Hollywood which is essentially an entertainment business and thatâ€ ™ s where most of the people are ,
â€ � he said .
â€œThey had Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt [ on Lip Sync Battle ] .
In Britain it would be some bloke off Big Brother and an Apprentice contestant.â€ �"
2016-07-09,"â€˜Twice as goodâ€ � is a phrase that some know so well , but which others , those who have never needed to be taught about it , may not recognise at all .
When Michelle Obama used it in her commencement address at Tuskegee University last year , the writer Britni Danielle described it on this website as the â€œone mantra many black parents drill into their childrenâ€ ™ s heads throughout their lifeâ€ � .
Be twice as good .
â€œIt goes that as black folks in America , weâ€ ™ ve got to work twice as hard to get half as far as our white counterparts , â€ � Danielle wrote .
â€œSome semblance of this speech has been handed down for generations.â€ �
In his famous essay Fear of a Black President , Ta - Nehisi Coates described it as an â€œold admonishmentâ€ � black parents would have to give their children , and lamented it as a necessary lesson on which â€œacceptance dependsâ€ � .
Whether or not Richard Williams used those precise words , he certainly instilled their spirit into his daughters as he drilled them in rudiments of tennis on a public court in Compton .
You could hear their echo in Serena Williamsâ€ ™ s extraordinary remarks after her Wimbledon semi - final , when she was asked how she felt about reaching , and losing , the finals of both the Australian and the French Open earlier this year .
â€œFor anyone else in this whole planet , it would be a wonderful accomplishment ,
â€ �
Williams said .
â€œFor me , itâ€ ™ s not enough .
But I think thatâ€ ™ s what makes me different .
Thatâ€ ™ s what makes me Serena.â€
�
She mentioned those feelings again after winning the final .
â€œOne loss per tournament which really isnâ€ ™ t bad , and anyone else on this tour would be completely happy about it.â€ �
Anyone else but her .
This , of course , was Williamsâ€ ™ s 22nd grand slam title , which means she is now equal with Steffi Graf , as the most successful player , male or female , of the modern era .
She said she had been suffering sleepless nights , struggling with the pressure she was putting on herself .
There may be more ahead .
Soon enough , surely , Williams will win a 23rd title and overtake Graf altogether .
Beyond that , the only record left for her to break is the one belonging to Margaret Court , who won most of her 24 grand slam titles in the midâ€‘1960s , when tennis was still an amateur sport .
Along the way Williams will also break Martina Navratilovaâ€ ™ s record for the winning the most grand slam matches .
This was a wonderful final , far harder fought than the straight - sets scoreline suggests , and Williams did not disagree when one journalist suggested it was the best she had been involved in here at Wimbledon .
Kerber is the 15th woman Williams has played in a grand slam final , and one of only five to have beaten her .
That was at the Australian Open in January , when the score was 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 .
That night Kerber confused Williams with her southpaw serve , which stays low and spins away from the Americanâ€ ™ s two - handed backhand .
It sometimes seemed Williams would have found Cyrillic an easier read .
Then in the rallies , instead of being suckered into trying to out - slug Williams , as some of her other opponents have done , Kerber confounded her by hitting soft balls at sharp angles .
But of those five women who beat Serena in a grand slam final , only one , her sister Venus , ever did it again .
And in the intervening months Williams and her coach Patrick Mouratoglou had been figuring out what they would do differently next time around .
And while they undoubtedly made a couple of tactical adjustments , the main changes seem to have been in the way she was thinking about her own game .
â€œThis tournament
I came in with just a different mind frame and mindset , â€ � Williams explained .
â€œI knew that going into this one , I just needed to keep calm , be confident , just play the tennis that Iâ€ ™ ve been playing for well over
a decade.â€ �
The biggest lesson from the loss in Melbourne , Williams said , had nothing to do with Kerberâ€ ™ s serve .
â€œI also learned that you canâ€ ™ t win everything , even though I try really hard .
I do the best that I can .
I still am not going to be perfect.â€ �
At one point in the second set , Williams confessed , she took a â€œreally , really deep breathâ€ � and told herself â€œif
I can just play my game ,
I know I have a really good chance at winning this matchâ€ � .
Her power and accuracy from the baseline , the speed with which she swept in to the net , they were all too much for Kerber , who was overwhelmed , inexorably , like a sandcastle in the oncoming tide .
At 3 - 3 in the second set Kerber had a break point , a chance won with a popped cork of a forehand pass , celebrated with rapturous applause by the crowd .
Williams set herself , served one ace on the outside and then another ace on the inside .
Kerber turned to the crowd , spread her arms , and shrugged in frustration .
â€œWhat am I supposed to do with that?â€ �
Truth is , twice as good does not even begin to cover how much better again than everyone else Williams has become .
She is the best there has ever been ."
2016-07-17,"Spring 2015 : in a desperate bid to book guests for his upcoming The Late Late Show , James Corden drives around the streets of LA knocking on publicistsâ€ ™ doors to introduce himself .
Summer 2016 :
Corden drives around the White House gardens with a singing / rapping Michelle Obama for the latest instalment of his online global phenomenon , Carpool Karaoke .
Itâ€ ™ s a rapid rise by anyoneâ€
™ s standards , not least for the man whose appointment as Craig Fergusonâ€ ™ s replacement on the CBS show met with a resounding â€œWho?â€ � in the US .
Add in last weekâ€ ™ s four Emmy nominations , the 1bn - plus views for the dedicated YouTube channel and the fact that the show has created the three most - viewed clips in the history of American late night television â€ “ and Corden could be excused the odd air punch .
But on the CBS studio lot where The Late Late Show is shot , celebration is minimal .
Itâ€ ™ s the morning after â€œChewbacca Momâ€
�
Candace Payne appeared on the show and , again , Cordenâ€ ™ s clips are spanning borders and spawning headlines .
Payne , a Texan mum , shot to fame after filming herself in a Star Wars mask , complete with infectious laugh , and Cordenâ€ ™ s subsequent sketch saw her driving him to work , accompanied , it turns out , by the filmâ€ ™ s director JJ Abrams .
Clocking up over 15 m YouTube views , securing her was a coup for Corden who saw off more - established rivals â€ “ among them Ellen DeGeneres .
With four shows every week ,
year round , heâ€ ™ s already moved on â€ “ to the eveningâ€ ™ s rap battle , or â€œDrop the Mic with Anne Hathawayâ€ � .
But even if , as Corden says , you donâ€ ™ t have time to dwell on your wins or mourn your losses ( â€œweâ€ ™ ve bombed a lot of timesâ€ � ) , surely itâ€ ™ s exhilarating to conceive bonkers ideas in the middle of the night and make them happen the next day ?
â€œThatâ€ ™ s it .
That is the show and thatâ€ ™ s the best and worst thing about it , â€ � he says , before using a recent parody of BeyoncÃ
© â€ ™ s monologues in her visual album Lemonade as an example .
â€œWe called it Lemonjames and we wrote it , shot it and cut it in four hours ;
you donâ€ ™ t have time to dither about it , you go with your instinct and hope that itâ€ ™ s right .
And then the next day I think there were 2,100 articles about us .
Thatâ€ ™ s thrilling to be in the centre of it , but

Itâ€ ™ s in stark contrast to his experience on Skyâ€ ™ s A League of Their Own , which has the luxury of more time , but also his previous experience crafting comedy .

But perhaps Cordenâ€ ™ s refusal to bask in last nightâ€ ™ s glory , or any of his recent successes , suggests he has learnt lessons from a sometimes difficult past when he went from the dizzying heights of The History Boys , Gavin and Stacey , panel shows and awards hosting , to the depressing depths of the 2008 Baftas when he infamously complained his two awards should have been three .
His widely - panned sketch show Horne and Corden , off - screen antics and a reputation for arrogance added to the backlash and his descent was as ugly as it was swift .
He remade himself with One Man , Two Guvnors , which transferred to Broadway and won him a Tony award .
It was during the playâ€ ™
s
interval that CBS president Leslie Moonves called his entertainment boss Nina Tassler and said he wanted Corden on his network .
( It would take Corden , who was happily developing scripts for HBO and lining up a play in New York , many months and three approaches to finally say yes . )
These days , Corden appears more self - deprecating than self - obsessed , but heâ€ ™ s clearly been scarred by the experience .
Asked about the noise surrounding him getting his talk show gig â€ “ which combined much bemusement , considerable praise and a dose of cynicism â€ “ he focuses only on the latter .
â€œI think in terms of hit rates â€ “ things that have done well and that havenâ€ ™ t
â€ “
I feel like Iâ€ ™ m sitting on the right side of that , but at same time , occasionally at home , there will be some people who â€ ¦ â€ �
- he pauses before explaining why he sometimes feels unfairly treated .
â€œIn truth , I donâ€ ™ t really understand it because I donâ€
™ t feel if people were sitting down to interview Bradley Cooper theyâ€ ™ d be like â€˜letâ€ ™
s talk about [ his flops ] Aloha and Burntâ€ ™ , or if they were sitting down with Robert De Niro , â€˜letâ€ ™ s talk about Dirty Grandpaâ€ ™ â€ “ and that feels sort of different with me .
I donâ€
™ t really know why , I give it very little thought.â€ � Corden and The
Late Late Showâ€ ™ s executive producer , Ben Winston , a fellow Brit and friend , were initally circumspect about their chances of success .
With less than three months to create and launch a network show , fronted by a relative unknown , they doubted they would last more than two months .
Says Corden : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a great bit in that Jerry Seinfeld doc where someone asks him if being famous helps with doing stand - up and trying new material , and he says â€˜I get three minutes of good grace from an audience whereas someone else gets 30 secondsâ€ ™ .
We very much felt that we just had 30 seconds .
â€œSo we knew we had to put a stake in the ground early and go
â€˜we are a show where people come and do stuffâ€ ™ .
In retrospect , I donâ€
™ t think we realised quite how valuable it was having Tom Hanks do that montage of his film career on our first show.â€ �
Cordenâ€ ™ s bid was to find a niche in the ferociously competitive talk - show arena by striving to be unpredictable .
For Moonves , it was this promise of reinvention that sealed the deal .
Instead of adopting the formulaic US structure of host monologue , followed by consecutive guests and a music ending , Fulwell 73 Productionsâ€ ™
executive producer Winston wanted to shake things up by creating a 360Â ° set ; immersing the audience in the action ; pre - recording internet - friendly elements ; and , of course , the distinctively British trick , inspired by Graham Norton , of bringing guests out at the same time .
â€œSome publicists would say , â€˜well
my client wouldnâ€ ™ t be happy to do thatâ€ ™ and it was wonderful to say ,
â€˜well
your client already did on Grahamâ€ ™ s show and it was brilliant â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s the best Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen them , â€ � says Corden .
However , he acknowledges that while the technique feels more organic , it makes for a harder interview .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve realised Graham is a maestro â€
¦ thereâ€
™ s
something brilliant about making something difficult look easy and I donâ€ ™ t think Iâ€ ™ ve cracked that yet.â€ �
Indeed the talk element of Cordenâ€ ™ s talk show is the least remarkable part .
Itâ€ ™ s segments like â€œDrop
the Micâ€ � that play to his strengths .
This was another crucial aspect for Winston â€ “ using Corden not just as a comedian , given he isnâ€ ™ t a stand - up like NBC rivals Jimmy Fallon and Seth Myers , but as an actor , singer and dancer .
He advised Moonves : â€œIf youâ€ ™ ve got James Corden , youâ€ ™ ve got to know how to use him.â€ �
Filmed in the style of a boxing match , with a fired - up crowd and plenty of dry ice , Corden mocking
Hathawayâ€ ™ s bad British accent and movie flop , and Hathaway taking aim at his waistline and ratings
, the battle was the highlight of that eveningâ€ ™ s show .
Like Carpool Karaoke , the segmentâ€ ™ s popularity means it is launching as a format in its own right .
It wasnâ€ ™ t always plain sailing for Carpool and Winston says that the team struggled to find guests .
â€œWere musicians knocking down our doors to get in a car with James ?
No we had to beg them .
We got â€˜noâ€ ™ s from everyone for Carpool .
People just thought it was a mad idea
and they didnâ€ ™ t want to do it.â€
�
Stevie Wonder was the â€œturning pointâ€ � .
Unlike most stars , he had nothing to promote at the time , but two days after his appearance , his 2002 Definitive Collection greatest hits album went to No 1 worldwide .
Success has come quickly , certainly in a digital sense , and the show has been picked up by Sky in the UK and Ireland for on - demand .
However , there is little talk of ratings , which at an average of around 1.3 m are respectable , if unimpressive , for its post - midnight time slot .
So , some 210 shows and 18 Carpool Karaokes later , are online hits the key ?
â€œIâ€ ™ m only driven by that , â€ � says Corden .
â€œI genuinely couldnâ€
™ t tell you how many people watch our show , because I feel like in this slot , weâ€ ™ re not really in the ratings business , weâ€ ™ re just in the relevance business .
My major ambition is just to stay relevant .
Thatâ€ ™ s it , to be in the conversation â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s all that was ever asked of us really.â€ � â€¢A masterclass on The Late Late Show with James Corden takes place at the Edinburgh International Television festival on 25 August"
2016-07-18,"The first day and night of the 2016 Republican national convention is complete .
Hereâ€ ™ s what we learned : The program reached its dramatic climax with a splashy entrance by Donald Trump , who emerged in a cloud of blue smoke to We Are the Champions by Queen .
He said â€œweâ€ ™ re gon na win so bigâ€ � and introduced his wife , Melania , the next speaker .
There was a moment of major uncertainty on the arena floor in mid - afternoon when the presiding officer ignored and spoke over an attempt by delegates opposed to Trump to derail a rules adoption process .
The movement failed .
The failure of the Anybody but Trump movement complete , it appeared that no hurdle remained to Trumpâ€ ™ s official nomination on Tuesday .
Monday eveningâ€ ™ s program was devoted to national security issues , which meant a movie about Benghazi and emotional testimonies by parents who had lost children to intoxicated drivers who turned out to be undocumented migrants .
At times the hearty opposition of the arena crowd to illegal immigration seemed to tip over into an antipathy toward immigrants more broadly , and from there to foreigners or anything falling outside the tightly defined boundaries of â€œUSA !
USA!â€ � a repeated chant .
â€œThe world outside our borders is a dark place , a scary place ,
â€ �
retired Navy Seal Michael Luttrell said to applause .
â€œAmerica is the light.â€ � Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani brought the crowd to its feet with some charged lines about race and policing .
â€œWhen [ police ] come to save your life , they donâ€ ™ t ask if youâ€ ™ re black or white , they just come to save you!â€ �
he said .
The program seemed to stretch later than expected , with Melania Trump speaking more than an hour before the end , and senator Joni Ernst delivering her headliner speech to an emptyish room .
The crowd seemed charmed by Melania , clapping enthusiastically at her heavily accented descriptions of how much her husband loves America .
But it was revealed that she had borrowed lines verbatim from the speech Michelle Obama gave to the 2008 convention .
The day began with the Trump campaign disparaging non - attendees .
Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said the Bushes were â€œpart of the pastâ€ � and said Ohio governor John Kasich was â€œembarrassing his stateâ€ � by not participating in the convention .
Cleveland police reported that two protests of 450 - 500 people concluded â€œpeacefullyâ€ � and there was just one arrest Monday for misdemeanor obstruction and resisting arrest .
Thatâ€ ™ s it for tonight .
See you back here bright and early tomorrow .
Thanks for all the comments .
A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump at the Republican national convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention .
Journalist Jarrett Hill was among the first to point out that lines Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s wife spoke about the necessity of hard work and strong family values seemed familiar .
â€œBarack
and I were raised with so many of the same values , that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do , â€ �
Obama told the gathering of Democrats in 2008 .
â€œFrom a young age , my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do , â€ �
Trump said in 2016 .
The resemblances in the speeches go further , as illustrated in the video mashup below : Now Reince Priebus is back out .
He recognizes delegate Christine Brooks from DC .
She makes a motion that the convention adjourns .
The resolution is adopted by voice vote , although a few stalwarts shout â€œno , â€ � apparently wanting to stay all night .
Priebus strikes the gavel in a one - down , three - to - go kind of way .
Itâ€ ™ s a wrap .
Weâ€
™ re hearing a loud Sweet Caroline cover .
Zinke wraps up .
â€œMontana , I love ya!â€ � he says .
California continues to chant USA !
USA !
Itâ€ ™ s unclear whatâ€ ™ s supposed to happen now .
The people left onstage leave it , after a pause .
Now they should probably just turn the lights off .
But thereâ€ ™ s a pause .
Nothing is happening .
Is it over ?
No , Paula White , senior pastor of New Destiny Christian center in Florida , takes the stage to pray .
Up next is Representative Ryan Zinke , for whom the room is even emptier than it was here : Jason Beardsley , former master sergeant with the US special forces , becomes the next speaker not to be the last speaker .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time for us , once again , to choose freedom over tyranny , â€ � he says .
The Iowa delegation has sat back down , except for two guys .
Three delegates from West Virginia remain , unless those are other people taking a break in the West Virginia chairs .
Ernstâ€ ™ s speech is painfully echo
- y because the Q arena is so increasingly empty .
She is soldiering on .
The Iowa delegation is standing at attention , almost literally , and dutifully applauding each applause line .
â€œDonald Trump will not hesitate to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name.â€ �
She becomes the fifteenth person to make the charge .
Now they bring out about ten chairs .
The last speakers are joined onstage by military veterans .
The delegates are streaming out .
Those California folks are having a great time and sticking around , though .
Maybe because theyâ€ ™ re on Pacific time and simply not tired ?
Hereâ€ ™ s a pic of the empty seats : Senator Ernst begins , addressing , extremely optimistically at this hour , â€œmillions of my fellow Americans watching around the country.â€ �
Flynn began speaking right when Melania left stage .
Now sheâ€ ™ s long gone .
And heâ€ ™ s stiiiill talking .
Even the media is leaving , some of them .
Flynn is reacting to the crowd chanting â€œLock her up !
lock her up!â€
� â€œYou know why weâ€ ™ re saying that?â€ � he says .
â€œIf
I did a tenth of what she did , I would be in jail today.â€ �
Then he says , â€œCrooked Hillary Clinton , leave this race
nowâ€ � and is finally applauded .
He says something about the country being founded on Judeo - Christian values and being the greatest country in the history of the world .
â€œNow is the time to elect fresh , bold leadership .
â€œWe are just beginning , â€ �
Flynn says .
Is Joni Ernst backstage cursing him ?
There are fewer and fewer spectators waiting around for her .
Former top Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer thinks the nightâ€ ™ s schedule has gone off the rails , which â€ “ listening to what feels like the 100th minute of Flynnâ€ ™ s speech , and looking ahead to the senator , congressman and military veteran yet to speak â€ “ feels plausible .
Delegations to have left the area now include a good share of Connecticut , Florida , Utah , etc .
Hillary Clinton retweets the campaign account Literally_Trump , rolling its eyes at his big entrance :
Trumpâ€ ™ s entrance on to the stage earlier , all silhouette and dry ice , is coming in for some mockery online .
The stands are emptying fast .
Even some delegations have left .
Minnesota , looking at you .
Flynn is not an electrifying speaker , for this crowd .
But the star power of Melania Trump had them entranced : Lt general Michael Flynn is next .
He gets to be the one that the crowd streams out during .
He says his message is â€œwake up America.â€
�
But the aisles are full of spectators leaving .
Most delegates have remained in their seats .
Melania Trump : â€œMy husband offers a new direction , welcoming change , prosperity and greater cooperation ...
â€œDonald intends to represent all of the people , not just some of the people , â€ �
she says .
That includes , for the record , all races and religions , â€œand the poor and the middle class , â€ �
she says .
She does not mention rich people .
This part definitely sounds like a movie trailer : Now is the time to use those gifts like never before for purposes far greater than ever .
And he will do this better than anyone can , and it wonâ€ ™ t even be close .
Melania Trump says the primaries are done and â€œlet us all come together.â€
� â€œThe race will be hard fought .
There will be good times and hard times ...
It would not be a Trump contest without excitement and drama ....
â€œIf Iâ€ ™ m honored to serve as first lady , I will use that wonderful privilege to try to help people in the country who need it most.â€ �
She says sheâ€ ™ ll help women and children .
To help â€œevery child live in comfort and security , with the best possible education.â€ � Melania Trump says that Trump has proven he â€œknows how to winâ€ � and â€œhow to remain focus [ sic ] on improving our country.â€ �
Then Melania Trump reads what sounds like a bedtime story about the benevolent king Donald Trump : â€œIf you want someone to fight for you and your country , I can assure you , heâ€ ™ s the guy .
He will never ever give up , and most importantly , he will never let you down.â€ �
â€œHeâ€ ™ s tough when he has to be but heâ€ ™ s also kind and fair and caring.â€
�
â€œThis kindness is not always noted ... that is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with.â€ � â€œI traveled the world , working hard in the incredible arena of fashion , â€ �
she says .
When she moved to New York
she saw the hard parts of life and the nice parts .
â€œI was very proud to become citizens [ sic ] of the United States , â€ �
she says .
â€œI would like to take a moment to recognize an amazing veteran , the great senator Bob Dole , â€ �
she says .
Melania Trump says the 16 Republicans Trump beat are talented .
â€œThey deserve the respect and gratitude of all of us.â€ �
But sheâ€ ™ s biased about her husband .
Sheâ€ ™ s known him 18 years and he has loved the country the whole time without a hidden agenda .
â€œI was born in Slovenia , a small beautiful and then - Communist country in eastern Europe ,
â€ � she says .
She says her mother introduced her â€œto fashion and beautyâ€ � and her father instilled in her a love of travel .
Her accent is undiminished , pace Bixby :
Trump says itâ€ ™ s his great honor to present the next first lady , â€œMy wife , an amazing mother an incredible woman , Melania Trump .
Thank you.â€ �
He actually read that off a Teleprompter .
Hereâ€ ™ s Melania .
Sheâ€ ™ s whistled and applauded .
Trump leaves the stage .
â€œYou have all been very kind to Donald and me , to our young son Barron and to our whole family , â€ � she begins .
â€œWe love
you!â€
� somebody yells .
Now theyâ€ ™ re playing Queen
We are the Champions and suddenly hereâ€ ™ s Trump .
The crowd goes , as they say , wild . â€œOh
weâ€ ™ re gon na win , weâ€ ™ re gon na win so big ,
â€ � he says .
Giuliani strikes an apocalyptic tone .
There is no next election .
This is it .
There is no more time for us left to revive our great country .
No more time to repeat our mistakes of the past .
Washington needs a complete turnaround and Donald Trump is the agent of change and he will be the leader of the change we need .
Giulianiâ€ ™ s done .
He about blew the roof off .
Another protester attempts to interrupt but is shouted down by chants of USA !
USA !
USA ! â€œIt means weâ€ ™ re getting to them .
It means weâ€ ™ re getting to them , â€ �
Giuliani says .
Trump / Pence 2016 :
Weâ€ ™ re getting to them .
Giuliani says any time New York had a tragedy Trump would reach out to help and insisted on doing it anonymously .
Which is what Trump himself has claimed about charitable donations that have not been able to be confirmed despite the exhaustive reporting efforts of the Washington Postâ€ ™ s David Farenthold .
â€œI am sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign!â€ � Giuliani says .
Heâ€ ™ s impassioned .
The crowd is too .
Now Giuliani is gesturing with both fists : â€œradical Islamic terrorism!â€ �
He is in control â€
“
thereâ€
™ s
no spittle or anything
â€ “ but heâ€
™ s getting the crowd excited because he is so impassioned he seems on the verge of losing control .
â€œRadical Islamic terrorism!â€ � Giuliani says .
â€œYou know who you are , and weâ€ ™ re coming to get you!â€
�
The crowd loves the idea of going after the terrorists and any mention of killing the terrorists and getting tough against the terrorists .
Giuliani is giving it to them in pure undiluted form .
Former NY mayor Rudy Giuliani says â€œthank you New York , for a New Yorker for once on the ticket , Donald Trump.â€ �
He says heâ€ ™ s here to speak about a very serious subject , how to make America safe .
He says most people donâ€ ™ t feel safe .
A big early applause line : â€œWe say thank - you to the Cleveland police department for protecting us .
Thank you !
We know the risk youâ€ ™ re taking.â€ �
Giuliani then scores the most powerful moment of the evening yet , applause - wise , with what appears to be an improvised riff ( itâ€ ™ s not in the Teleprompter ) about race and policing : â€œWhen [ police ] come to save your life , they donâ€ ™ t
ask if youâ€ ™ re black or white , they just come to save you!â€ � he says .
Giuliani is pumped , and the crowd loves him .
By far the most animated speaker of the evening .
We pray for our police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge and their families ;
And we say thank you to the Cleveland Police Department for protecting us and all police officers protecting all of us .
We also reach out with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings unjustified and justified .
Itâ€ ™ s time to make America safe again .
Itâ€ ™ s time to make America ONE again .
I know it can be done because I did it by changing New York City from â€˜the crime capital of Americaâ€ ™ to according to the FBI the safest large city in America .
What I did for New York City .......
Donald Trump WILL do for America .
I have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years .
And he has created and accomplished great things .
But beyond that this is a man with a big heart .
Thereâ€ ™ s some kind of commotion in the stands .
It appears to be a protester .
Sessions drones on .
The protester , a woman , is rocking back and forth in the stands with an arm raised .
She appears to have calmed down .
Sheâ€
™ s not a delegate .
She has a pink flag or banner of some kind .
Itâ€ ™ s not legible from here .
It appears it could be a Code Pink protester .
Sessions drones on , then heâ€ ™ s done , then Rudy Giuliani is introduced , and the protester has yet to be removed .
Sessions sticks in a line not in his prepared remarks : Letâ€ ™ s consider the facts .
We lawfully admit 1.1 million permanent residents annually , more than any other country .
But then he adds a line about â€œmost of themâ€ � being law abiding , good people .
The crowd claps uncertainly .
Now onstage is senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , Trumpâ€ ™ s first , strongest and proudest supporter in the senate .
Heâ€ ™ s applauded wholeheartedly .
But in contrast with most speakers tonight , his speech is pretty textbook Washington stuff , and the applause through these lines is merely pro forma : Average Americans have been the first to know something is wrong with this economy .
Our middle class is steadily declining , with our African American and Hispanic communities being hurt the most .
But , the Washington establishment , the media , and big corporations have been in denial .
Fellow Republicans , we must understand that the incomes of middle class Americans today are $ 4,186 per year less than in 1999 .
This is an economic disaster .
We are on the wrong track and the people know it .
Yet , Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s plan is more of the same : more government , more taxes , more regulation , more immigration , and more debt .
Celebrity and convention speaker Scott Baio told the Guardian in an exclusive interview tonight that he supported Brexit .
â€œYou left .
I love it , â€ �
he said , echoing the presumptive Republican nominee in supporting the UK withdrawing from the European Union .
Baio , who proclaimed in his remarks that Trump isnâ€ ™ t a messiah but â€œjust a man , â€ � has long been a vocal supporter of the Republican nominee .
The star of television sitcoms like Joani Loves Chachi and Charles in Charge , Baio told the Guardian that he found the experience of speaking â€œsort of surrealâ€ � but â€œgreat fun.â€ �
The actor said he planned on continuing to be active supporting Trump through November .
â€œI want Donald Trump to be elected president so whatever I have to do Iâ€ ™ ll do it , â€ �
Baio told the Guardian .
Baio said before Trump picked Mike Pence to be vice president that he was â€œ a big Condoleezza Rice fan.â€ �
However , he added â€œI like Mike Pence .
I like him
a lot.â€ �
The actor noted that while he thought Pence was â€œa really good choice , â€ � he didnâ€ ™ t think the vice presidential selection mattered .
â€œTrump is Trump .
He is going to win this thing on his own .
Thatâ€ ™ s my feeling.â€

Hereâ€ ™ s an update from the Cleveland police , who report just one arrest so far today : Â · Two mid - scale protests concluded peacefully .
Â
· Protesters numbered between 450 and 500 individuals , combined .
Â · Bicycle officers were dispatched to discourage conflict between opposing positions .
Â · There are no scheduled protests after 6 p.m. today .
Â · No reported physical damage to City of Cleveland property .
There was one arrest : Â · A female was arrested on a felony warrant and misdemeanor of obstruction of official business and resisting arrest .
Â ·
Although there were no related arrests , police confiscated a small knife , gas masks and a slingshot â€ “ all items listed on the prohibited items list .
Cotton says â€œhelp is on the wayâ€ � .
Hereâ€ ™ s an excerpt from his speech : Thirty - five years later , I did the same .
Against the wishes of my family , I gave up my legal career and I volunteered for the Army .
I became an infantryman .
I went to Iraq and Afghanistan .
My dad said he felt like God was punishing him for what he did to his dad .
But God wasnâ€ ™ t punishing them ; God had called us to serve .
Just as He calls so many of you .
My family isnâ€ ™ t extraordinary ; in fact , weâ€ ™ re very ordinary .
From farms in Arkansas to fire stations in New York , many families could tell the same story .
The defense of this country is a family affair .
We donâ€
™ t fight because we hate our enemies , but because we love our country .
We love its freedom .
We love that weâ€ ™ re born equal and live free , that no one rules without consent .
We know these things are worth fighting and dying for because they make life worth living for .
Our warriors and their families donâ€ ™ t ask for much .
But there are a few things weâ€ ™ d like .
A commander - in - chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars , calls the enemy by its name , and draws red lines carefully , but enforces them ruthlessly .
And politicians who treat our common defense as the chief responsibility of our federal government , not just another government program .
This isnâ€ ™ t much to ask for , but eight years without it is more than enough .
So I say again : In a Trump - Pence administration and with a Republican Congress , help is on the way .
In response to a speech at the Republican National Convention by the mother of a foreign service officer who was killed in the terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi , Libya , in 2012 , in which she declared that she blames Hillary Clinton â€œpersonally for the death of my son , â€ � Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s rapid - response team issued a statement debunking the rumor that Clinton issued a â€œstand - downâ€ � order to US military personal in the area during the attack , writes Scott Bixby :
â€œThis unfounded allegation has been widely debunked , â€ � the statement reads .
â€œMultiple bipartisan investigations have concluded that no â€˜stand downâ€ ™ order was ever issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli .
Even Republicans from the House Armed Services Committee have refuted this claim.â€
�
The statement also repeated the testimony of former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and the Africom general commander who confirmed that they had received no â€œstand - downâ€ � order from anyone that night .
â€œIn fact , contrary to the GOPâ€ ™ s erroneous allegations , military assets were allocated and mobilized to address the crisis , â€ � the statement continues .
â€œThe militaryâ€ ™ s ability to respond was limited - not because of Clinton or any officialâ€ ™ s doing - but due to the status of U.S. forces that night and the speed of the attacks that unfolded.â€ �
â€œThe fact is , â€ � the response paper concludes ,
â€œall of the numerous official sources analyzing the military response â€“from the countless interviews with military officials , to congressional reports , to the Independent Accountability Review Boardâ€”have concluded that the military did everything it could , given the circumstances , in their response to the attacks.â€ �
Now Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas .
Glenn is full of happy one - liners .
He looks like heâ€ ™ s having a good time up there .
On Clinton : We know she loves her pantsuits .
But we should send her an email and tell her that she deserves a bright orange jumpsuit !
The crowd likes it .
Heâ€ ™ s done .
El Paso county commissioner Daryl Glenn , whoâ€ ™ s running for senate in Colorado , says heâ€ ™ s â€œoften asked , why are you a Republican?â€ � â€œWell , he says , â€œitâ€ ™ s because the Democrat party is the party of handoutsâ€ � and after seven - and - a - half years â€œall you have left in your pockets is change.â€
�
â€œDid you see the new black panthers outside ?
Whereâ€ ™ s Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .
They donâ€ ™ t speak for black America and they donâ€ ™ t speak for me.â€ �
He says
itâ€ ™ s not about black or white or brown America , itâ€ ™ s about the United States of America .
Heâ€ ™ s cheered .
Then he says â€œAll lives matterâ€ � and heâ€ ™ s cheered more .
Almost 10 pm here in Cleveland , and the crowd , which is packed to capacity on the floor , though there are scattered empty seats in the risers , seems ready for the big names .
There are a couple senators to get through before Melania , however .
How sharp is Antonio Sabato Jrâ€
™ s
view of where the country is headed and where it must go ?
Heâ€
™ s sure the president is a Muslim
, so thereâ€
™ s that .
Next up : U.S. Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and his wife , Rachel Campos - Duffy , whom he met while appearing on the reality TV show The Real World .
The couple has eight children .
â€œWho said nothing good comes out of reality TV?â€ �
they crack .
They say they keep their lives sane by following simple house rules .
The joke is that the last two rules are â€œno private serversâ€ � and â€œno lying especially to the FBI.â€ � Campos - Duffy outs herself as a descendant of Mexicans .
But her grandparents emigrated legally
so itâ€ ™ s OK .
Governor Mike Pence is in the house .
And look whoâ€ ™ s here : Next up is sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County , whom a lot of people know from Fox News .
â€œLadies and gentlemen , I would like to make something clear , â€ � he begins .
â€œBlue lives matter in America!â€ �
Big big applause line .
He hails the news of the acquittal of Lt Brian Rice , tried in the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore by the â€œmalicious prosecution of activist states attorney Marilyn Mosby , â€ � he says .
Congressman Michael McCaul , chairman of the Homeland security committee , is speaking .
He warns against the threat of â€œradical Islamic terrorâ€ � and says â€œa Trump administration will take on this fight.â€ � â€œYou may have fired the first shot , but rest assured , America will fire the last , â€ � he tells the terrorists .
There are chants of USA !
USA ! ,
but McCaul is kind of flat on the chanting thing , mustering only a listless â€œUSA.â€
�
Donald Trump is due on stage in Cleveland to introduce his wife Melania later this evening .
But he hardly seems glued to the convention program so far .
During the painful speech by Pat Smith , the mother of one of the Americans killed in Benghazi , the presumptive Republican nominee phoned in to Fox News to discuss the recent killings of police officers and the decision of his former rival John Kasich not to show up to the convention .
According to Politico , he said that â€œin certain circumstancesâ€ � the Black Lives Matter movement could be blamed for the killings of the officers .
â€œThey certainly have ignited people and you see that
â€
¦
Everybody is free to say what you want to say up to a point .
But when you are calling death to police and to kill the police , essentially , which is what they said , thatâ€ ™ s a real problem.â€

There is no evidence of any leading figures in the movement ever calling for the killing of police .
Of Kasich , the governor of Ohio , Trump admitted : â€œIf I were him and gotten beaten that badly I probably wouldnâ€ ™ t show up either.â€ �
But he said that from the â€œstandpoint of honorâ€ � Kasich should have shown up to the Cleveland convention : â€œEven if this were for the Democrats he should at least show up and say hello and how are you doing?â€

Next up is a fear - inducing video about immigration .
Fear - inducing because the entire bass bandwidth of the Quicken arenaâ€ ™ s impressive sound system is brought to bear .
The video then reveals Kelly Terry - Willis and Kent Terry , broadcasting live from the Arizona - Mexico border .
Their brother , Brian Terry , was a Border Patrol agent who died on patrol , with guns in the attack against his group traced to the Fast and Furious gun - walking program .
Tiegen and Geist finish up with this : Benghazi is not about politics .
Itâ€ ™ s about opportunities .
Opportunities taken when we defied stand down orders and opportunities squandered when Hillary Clinton failed to protect her people on the ground .
Had she done her job , we would not have had to compromise the annex .
Ty , Glen , Sean , and Ambassador Stevens would be alive today .
Now we as Americans have the opportunity to elect someone who will make this country safe again .
Someone who will have our backs .
Someone who will bring our guys home .
Someone who will lead with strength and integrity .
That someone is Donald Trump .
We did our part .
Now do yours .
Thank you .
The crowd rises to its feet to applaud .
Most of them do .
During a round - table discussion regarding the uniformly white leadership of the Republican party , six - term congressman Steve King of Iowa declared that white people have contributed more to the advancement of human civilization than any other â€œsub - group of people , â€ � igniting a firestorm of crosstalk that almost resulted in one of the panelists walking off the set , writes Scott Bixby : â€œThis
whole â€˜white peopleâ€ ™ business does get a little tired , â€ � said King , a six - term congressman , of critiques that the homogeneity of Republican leadership has lead to policies insensitive to racial and religious minorities .
Fellow panelist Charlie Pierce , a writer for Esquire , had declared that demographic realities imply that the 2016 election â€œis the last time that old white people will command the Republican Partyâ€ ™ s attention , its platform , and its public face.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™
d ask you to go back through history and figure out where these contributions that have been made by these categories of people that youâ€ ™ re talking about , â€ �
King continued .
â€œWhere did any other sub - group of people contribute more to civilization?â€ � â€œThan white people?â€ � asked host Chris Hayes incredulously .
â€œThan Western civilization itself , â€ �
King responded , â€œwhich is rooted in western Europe , Eastern Europe and the United States of America , and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world .
Thatâ€ ™ s all of Western civilization.â€
�
The set immediately broke into a torrent of nearly unintelligible denunciations from fellow panelists Pierce and April Ryan , Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks .
â€œWhat about Africa ?
What about Asia?â€
� asked Ryan .
â€œNo , no , no , no
, no.â€ �
Hayes , attempting to moderate , told the panel that â€œwe are not gon na argue the history of civilization , â€ � and closed the segment by uneasily declaring that â€œon cable news , we are not going to resolve the relative strengths of various strands of civilizational prowess.â€
�
Hayes tweeted after the incident that he was â€œtaken abackâ€ � by the congressmanâ€ ™ s statements , and that he should have allowed Ryan to respond : Tiegen and Geist continue .
The crowd seems to have tuned out , lost the thread of the narrative .
A few laugh lines or potential laugh lines have passed with no reaction .
Thereâ€ ™ s the sound of low chatter throughout the room .
â€œAfter I got Oz up , he kind of mumbled a little bit ...
I went over to the next guy
there was ...
I rolled him over , immediately checked for a pulse ...
didnâ€ ™ t get anything ...
I got the flashlight , checked for a pupil dilation , and there was nothing .
So I knew he was gone.â€ � Mark Geist and John Tiegen , members of a security team assigned to the embassy annex in Benghazi , and survivors of the 2012 attack , stand up to tell the story of the attack .
Itâ€ ™ s a detailed account ( theyâ€ ™
ve written a book about it ) .
Both boast of shooting â€œterroristsâ€ � dead .
â€œYouâ€ ™ d take that guy out and another guy would pop up then another guyâ€ ™
d pop up , â€ � says Tiegen .
â€œIt was kind of like ... whack - a - mole , â€ � Geist says .
â€œA guyâ€ ™ d stick his head up and youâ€ ™ d shoot him.â€ �
Thatâ€ ™ s applauded .
The venue has been filled with talk of taking on terrorists .
Here are two guys who have actually killed multiple terrorists , and at Benghazi no less .
Tiegen gives Geist a hard time for putting gauze in his ear for sound protection .
â€œIt was really funny
â€ “ looks like heâ€ ™
s got a tampon in his ear!â€
�
Tiegen says , and the crowd laughs .
â€œSorry.â€ �
The account is lengthy .
â€œThatâ€
™ s when the second mortar hit .
Hit about fifteen feet to my right ...
my left arm about six inches above the wrist was kind of hanging off at a 90-degree angle.â€ � A wrenching speech now from Pat Smith , mother of Sean Smith , one of four Americans killed in the 2012 Benghazi attack .
â€œThe last time I talked to Sean , the night before the terrorist attack , he told me , â€˜Mom , I am going to die , â€ ™ â€ �
she says .
She says Sean told her that the consulate was under - secured .
And the next day he was killed .
â€œTo this day ,
I donâ€ ™ t know why a computer guy like Sean was sent to Benghazi , â€ �
she says .
She sounds as if she may break down in tears at any word .
â€œFor all of this loss
... I blame Hillary Clinton!â€
� she says .
And sheâ€ ™ s applauded .
â€œI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son .
Personally!â€ � she says .
Thereâ€ ™ s a strange interplay between her palpable sadness and the crowdâ€ ™ s palpable excitement at her fierce blaming of Clinton .
â€œWhenever
I call the state department , no one will speak to me , because they say I am not a member of the immediate family ,
â€ � she says .
â€œHillary Clinton is a woman , a mother and a grandmother of two .
I am a woman , a mother and a grandmother of two .
How could she do this to me ?
How could she do this to Any American family?â€ �
Her face is twisted in what appears to be anguish , and anger .
â€œDonald
Trump is everything Hillary Clinton is not .
He is blunt , direct and strong.â€ � â€œHe will not hesitate to kill the terrorists who threaten American lives , â€ �
she says .
Sheâ€ ™ s applauded , the lights go on , and a video about Benghazi rolls .
But she does not move , standing at the lectern in the shadows as the video plays .
Someone comes out and escorts her back .
In Luttrellâ€ ™ s telling , to leave the United States is to risk instant death or worse : â€œThe world outside our borders is a dark place , a scary place , â€ � he says .
â€œAmerica is the light.â€ �
â€œThe only way weâ€ ™ re going to keep America safe is to have an elite military ,
alright?â€ � Luttrell says .
He seems a bit choked up .
Heâ€
™ s emotional talking about how political leaders must lead by example .
Then Luttrell says heâ€ ™ s going to go off script , that â€œIâ€ ™ m used to speak from the heart and not reading this.â€ �
But he keeps reading from the Teleprompter .
â€œIn order for any life to matter , we all have to matter ,
â€ � he says .
Tonight Trump may be Rick Perryâ€ ™ s answer for whatâ€ ™ s wrong with America .
Unless you read his web site , where Trump is still a cancer : Perry : â€œTonight our commitment is this :
making America great again starts by taking care of our veterans.â€ �
The crowd is on its feet , and they keep applauding when Perry announces , â€œplease welcome American hero , the lone survivor ,
Marcus Luttrell!â€ � Now
thatâ€ ™ s applause .
Heâ€ ™ s clapped and clapped and clapped .
He canâ€ ™ t even start speaking .
The crowd starts chanting USA !
USA !
Hereâ€ ™ s Luttrellâ€ ™ s thumbnail bio : Marcus Luttrell is a retired U.S. Navy SEAL and author of the book Lone Survivor , in which he tells the harrowing tale of a fierce battle in eastern Afghanistan in 2005 .
Since returning from war , Luttrell has started the Lone Survivor Foundation and become involved with The Boot Campaign .
He also has written a second book , Service , which honors and praises all members of the military Next up : former Texas governor Rick Perry .
He gets even bigger cheers than Baio when he walks out .
The first thing Perry says is the last thing he said before leaving the stage in a mic check a couple hours ago : â€œHello
Cleveland!â€ �
There are a lot more people in the arena this time to cheer .
Baio closes with this :
â€œOf course ,
letâ€ ™ s make America great again .
But letâ€ ™ s make America America again.â€ �
Thatâ€ ™ s excitedly applauded too , everyone likes the idea .
Scott Baio controversially says Trump is not the Messiah .
Then he mentions Hillary Clinton , and everyone boos .
â€œI agree , â€ � he says .
The actor Scott Baio â€ “ Happy Days , Joanie Loves Chachi â€ “ takes the stage , to excited applause .
Baio has some serious star wattage in this room .
Baio thanks Trump for inviting him to speak :
â€œI canâ€
™ t tell you how much of an honor it is to be up here and talk about a man that I trust with the lives of our country and the health of our country .
America , the greatest country God ever created .
â€œBut for you first time voters ,
itâ€ ™ s important
you know what it means to be an American .
It doesnâ€

Republicans adopted a platform on Monday that embraces Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s controversial proposals on immigration , including a stated commitment to building a wall along the US - Mexico border , writes Guardian politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui : The long - awaited platform , a blueprint of the partyâ€ ™ s agenda in 2016 , was agreed upon by a voice vote on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland .
While there are few surprises in its contents , much of which was made public at a meeting of the Republican Platform Committee last week , the influence of Trump is apparent with respect to the presumptive nomineeâ€ ™ s
signature issues of immigration reform and trade policy .
The platform takes a hardline on immigration , calling for a border wall and â€œprotecting all ports of entry.â€ � â€œThe border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic , â€ � it states .
The document also demonstrates little sympathy for undocumented immigrants .
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s executive orders in 2012 and 2014 , which provided deportation relief to millions of immigrants brought to the US as children and immigrant parents of US citizens and lawful permanent residents , are dubbed as â€œunlawful amnesties.â€ �
The platform calls for a Republican president to immediately rescind them .
It moreover casts suspicions on the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants in the US and immigrants more broadly , as Trump has repeatedly done on the presidential campaign trail .
â€œIn a time of terrorism , drug cartels , human trafficking , and criminal gangs , the presence of millions of unidentified individuals in this counter poses grave risks to the safety and sovereignty of the United States , â€ � the platform reads .
â€œOur highest priority , therefore , must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws.â€ �
While it does not endorse Trumpâ€ ™ s proposed ban on Muslim immigration , the GOP agenda includes more watered - down language to acknowledge national security fears and their intersection with who seeks entry into the US .
The platform seeks â€œmajor changesâ€ � to how the US grants entry to refugees and asylum - seekers , stating that refugees who can not be carefully vetted â€ “ â€œespecially those whose homeland have been the breeding grounds for terrorismâ€ �
â€ “ should be denied entry .
There is also a mandate to apply special scrutiny â€œto those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror - sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism.â€ �
Some reflections of Trump in the platform put Republicans at odds with party orthodoxy , particularly on trade and financial reform .
Further to come shortly ...
Republican leaders faced down an angry last - ditch effort to derail the nomination of Donald Trump on Monday amid extraordinary scenes on the floor of the partyâ€ ™ s national convention in Cleveland , write the Guardianâ€ ™ s Dan Roberts and Ben Jacobs :
Trumpâ€ ™ s four - day coronation as the party candidate degenerated into chaos as rival factions shouted and jeered attempting to drown one another out .
Ignoring howls and whistles from opponents of Trump , the convention chair twice refused calls for a roll call vote which would have counted the number of people backing the rebellion , insisting instead that a package of procedural rules be passed solely on a voice vote .
The rebels , a coalition of diehard Trump opponents and conservative activists dissatisfied with the party establishment , believed they had secured the support of 11 states , more than enough to force the vote during an afternoon of backroom scheming and arm - twisting .
However , after a long period of chaos and confusion on the convention floor , the presiding officer , congressman Steve Womack of Arkansas , dashed their hopes by revealing that delegates had been arm - twisted to withdraw their names from the petitions that would force a roll call vote and that the effort had failed .
In the angry aftermath , large numbers from several state delegations , including those from Colorado and Washington , walked out of the hall in disgust and the opening session at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland , intended to show party unity , was left marred by repeated calls of â€œroll call voteâ€ � from the floor â€ “
Trump loyalists could be seen walking the floor encouraging delegates from friendly states to chant â€œU - S - A , U - S - Aâ€ � to drown out the damaging cries of dissent .

A Donald Trump supporter with a primetime speaking slot at the Republican national convention , who is billed as a small business owner employing more than 100,000 people , is actually a â€œmulti - level marketerâ€ � who does not employ anyone , reports the Guardianâ€ ™ s Jon Swaine :
Michelle Van Etten was personally invited by the Trump campaign to address the Republican party gathering in Cleveland , Ohio , during a pro - business session on Wednesday evening titled Make America First Again .
The official schedule for the convention states : â€œMichelle employs over 100,000 people and is a strong supporter of Donald Trump , knowing his policies will support businesses all across America.â€ �
In an interview on Monday , however , Van Etten said the billing was incorrect .
â€œI donâ€ ™ t employ , â€ � she said , adding that she did not know who wrote the text .
Read the full piece here : About a half hour ago , party officials asked lingerers on the convention floor to clear the space so that delegates may move back to their chairs .
Some delegates are doing so .
Florida appears to be in place .
The Texas cowboy hats are missing .
Iowa is in the house .
Hereâ€ ™ s a taste of what the delegates will hear , in addition , apparently , to Rudy Giuliani reading the Gettysburg address .
What follows are the highlights of the speech highlights released this afternoon by the RNC , with thumbnail bios as supplied by the Republicans :
Willie Robertson , CEO of Duck Commander and Buck Commander , star of Duck Dynasty â€œWe need a president who will have our back .
â€œI can promise you this : no matter who you are , DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re looking for a jobâ€ ¦ or trying to grow a businessâ€ ¦ DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re a serviceman fighting overseasâ€
¦ or a cop keeping us safe at homeâ€ ¦
DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK .
Scott Baio , Actor and Television Producer â€œWe have a choice in November .
We can go for Hillary Clinton : who wants to continue the same policies that are wrecking this country .
Policies that make us unsafe .
A woman who somehow feels entitled to the presidency . . .
that she is somehow owed it .
â€œOr we can go for Donald Trump :
A man doing this from the goodness of his heart and genuinely wants to help .
A man who knows how to get things done . . .
and a man who says what he means and means what he says.â€ � Mark Geistâ€ ”
aka OZ :
U.S. Marine Corps veteran , Fought in Battle of Benghazi â€œThank
you America for showing us the support and dedication that should have been offered by Hillary and her State Department to those who saved their butts .

Had she done her job , we would not have had to compromise the annex.â€ �
Kelly Terry - Willis and Kent Terry , The Brian Terry Foundation
[ â€œBrian Terry was a Border Patrol agent who died tragically while protecting our nationâ€ ™ s border with Mexico.â€ � Speaking about the late Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry :
â€œBrian was supposed to come home to Michigan for Christmas for the first time in three years .
Instead of celebrating the holidays with him , we buried him not far from the family home .
Two weapons recovered at the scene were traced to the Obama Administrationâ€ ™ s doomed â€œFast and Furiousâ€ � gun - tracking operation .
No one was ever held accountable for its failure.â€ � Sherriff David Clarke , Sheriff of Milwaukee County â€œDonald
Trump understands that what can make our nation safe again is a recommitment to a justice system in which no government official , not even those who have fought their way to the marble and granite halls of Washington ; no private citizen , not even Hillary Clinton ; and no group of people , despite the fervor with which they press forward their grievances , can claim privilege above the law.â€ � Tom Cotton , US senator from Arkansas â€œOur warriors and their families donâ€ ™ t ask for much .
But there are a few things weâ€ ™ d like .
â€œA commander - in - chief who speaks of winning wars and not merely ending wars , calls the enemy by its name , and draws red lines carefully , but enforces them ruthlessly .
â€œAnd politicians who treat our common defense as the chief responsibility of our federal government , not just another government program.â€ � Lt . General Michael Flynn , former director of the defense intelligence agency â€œI promise you that Donald Trump knows that the primary role of the President is to keep us safe .
He recognizes the threats we face and is not afraid to call them what they are .
Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s leadership , decision - making and problem - solving abilities will restore Americaâ€ ™ s role as the undeniable and unquestioned world leader .
He will lead from the front , not from behind .
He will lead with courage , never vacillating when facing our enemies or our competitors .
And he knows that the advantage in life , in business , and in wartime goes to the competitor that does not flinch and does not broadcast his game plan.â€ � Joni Ernst , US senator from Iowa â€œUnfortunately , Hillary Clinton can not be trusted .
Her judgment and character are not suited to be sitting in the most powerful office in the world .
â€œWith Hillary Clinton
itâ€ ™ s always about her , when it should be about you .
Donald Trump is focused on you .
He gave voice to a movement of millions of Americans who are tired of politics as usual , and I know as president he will work tirelessly to keep our nation safe.â€ � Action on the floor !

Ohio governor John Kasich , a notable absentee from the convention , held a somewhat chaotic event at a steakhouse just five minutesâ€ ™ walk away , Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith writes : First , journalists who had sent RSVPs were told there was no space and they should wait outside .
Eventually the matter was resolved and they were ushered into a sweltering back room , where an organiser repeatedly begged cameramen to move back so the guests - Republicans from Illinois â€ “ could get to food tables .
Kasich turned up later than planned and talked amid a melee of reporters and guests clutching phones , microphones and cameras .
He had only just got started when he was briefly interrupted by music blaring loudly from the sound system .
He spoke mainly about Illiniois , even though most of its delegates were not in the room and the national media would doubtless have preferred at least a reference to Donald Trump .
Kasich also cited Ohioâ€ ™ s progress in jobs growth , running a surplus and rising from 48th most desirable place to do business to the top 10 .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t want to cut anybody out ,
â€ � he said , â€œWe are a big tent
but we have to act like it
and we have to have ideas and policies that allow us to expand who we are as Republicans without abandoning our principles.â€
�
Kasich was the last rival to drop out of the primary race against Trump and there will be some in the Republican establishment who wish it was him on stage accepting the nomination this week .
With a nod to the potential for violent protests , he urged : â€œStay safe .
Theyâ€ ™ re doing everything they can here with the secret service , the highway patrol , state and local law enforcement and people from all over the country .
Stay in the perimeter as best you can .
Thatâ€ ™ s important .
â€œWe hope weâ€ ™ re going to have a great convention , a great success .
I think itâ€ ™ s so critical that the House and the Senate stay Republican and we continue to pick up seats in the legislature because in those places weâ€ ™ re seeing the most amount of progress.â€
�
After six minutes he was done .
A TV reporter attempted to ask him a question but Kasich declined to answer .
Guests swooped on the mini - cheeseburgers .
Moments after Kasich had left , a man called out to the party that delegates should return to the arena to support Trump in what turned out to be a short - lived floor fight .
â€œAny Illinois delegates : thereâ€ ™ s a fight on the floor right now , â€ � he said .
â€œIf youâ€ ™ re for Trump youâ€ ™ ve got to come back to the room.â€ � Protests throughout the city of Cleveland remained peaceful on Monday as authorities reported only one arrest by the late afternoon , reports Oliver Laughland .
At a rally in the cityâ€ ™ s Settlerâ€ ™ s Landing park , organized by the lobbyist and former Trump strategist Roger Stone , around 400 Trump supporters assembled as a host of fringe politicians , conspiracy theorists , talk radio hosts and singers took the stage .
Many in the crowd , some of who claimed an allegiance to the Bikers for Trump group , carried firearms , despite calls from the cityâ€ ™ s largest police union for Ohio governor John Kasich to temporarily suspend the stateâ€ ™ s gun laws amid security fears .
During an enraged diatribe , Alex Jones , operator of the conspiracy website InfoWars , frequently decried what he described as the â€œglobalistâ€ � policies of the Democratic party and claimed presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was a â€œforeign agentâ€ � of the Chinese and Saudi Arabian governments .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re sick and tired of what weâ€ ™ ve been seeing , and thatâ€ ™ s why we want Donald Trump , â€ � Jones said as members of the crowd branded Clinton a â€œreptileâ€ � , a â€œbitchâ€ � and chanted â€œHillary for prisonâ€ � .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s a great guy and has amazing courage , â€ � Jones continued , â€œbut we donâ€ ™ t have to put our faith in any one individual , itâ€ ™ s all of us together the line of liberty coming together , nothing is going to be able to turn this around.â€ �
Wayne Dupree , an African American conspiracy theorist and radio host , told the crowd he left the Democratic party in 2008 after discovering they were responsible for slavery and founding the KKK .
â€œTake your ass to the ballot box and vote for Donald Trump ,
â€ �
Dupree screamed as the crowd roared .
Stone , who arrived at the event late dressed in a cream suit , paid tribute to Jones and other conspiracy minded journalists including the Matt Drudge , and told the crowd that Trumpâ€ ™ s rise was â€œnot about Republicans versus Democratsâ€ � but â€œelites v Donald J. Trumpâ€ � .
He then led the crowd in chants of â€œNo Justice , No Peace , â€ � as he called for the arrest of Clinton over the misuse of her personal emails during her tenure as secretary of state .
A member of Bikers for Trump , who gave his name only as â€œDaveâ€ � , told the Guardian he had rode in from Wisconsin as he displayed his loaded pistol , carried in a brown leather holster .
He claimed he brought it for protection against members of the Black Lives Matter movement , whom he described as â€œterroristsâ€ � set on â€œassaulting law abiding citizensâ€ � .
Despite the animosity , the event remained peaceful .
A spokesman for the city of Cleveland said police had arrested only one individual by late Monday afternoon .
That person , a white woman , was arrested in the cityâ€ ™ s public square on an outstanding warrant .
Police made one arrest on Sunday after , they said , a protester at another march , reached for an officerâ€ ™ s gas mask .
In a swift vote , the delegates at the Republican National Convention ratified the partyâ€ ™ s 2016 platform , with only a few scattered â€œnaysâ€ � audible from the press section .
Co - chair of the Republican National Conventionâ€ ™ s platform committee and Oklahoma governor
Mary Fallin has taken the stage at the RNC , asking the contentious audience whether they are ready to â€œmake
America great again!â€ �
A man from the bleachers shouts â€œRoll call!â€ � as others cheer .
â€œThe platform is among the most important work we do as a party , â€ �
Fallin , a vice presidential short - lister , says .
Rep. Steve Womack , appearing uncertain , has retaken the lectern as entire state delegations shout â€œroll call vote!â€ � â€œI need your help and your cooperation ,
â€ �
Womack says , attempting to project calm .
â€œWithout objection , the chair will put the question on adoption of the report from the Committee on Rules , â€ � Womack continues , after retaking the lectern .
â€œRoll - call!â€ � more shout .
â€œIn the opinion of the chair , the ayes have it , â€ � Womack says , after another vote by acclamation .
â€œI make a motion that we have a roll - call vote on the rules , â€ � the chair of the Utah delegation says .
â€œThe secretary received requests from a total of nine states on a roll - call vote , â€ � Womack responds , but received requests to rescind those requests from three states .
With a seven - state threshold to call for a roll - call vote , Womack says , â€œthe chair has found insufficient support for the request for a record vote.â€ �
Republican delegates attempting to force a vote on a so - called â€œconscience
clauseâ€

that would un - bind delegates from having to vote for Donald Trump were gaveled down by Rep. Steve Womack .
Alternating chants of â€œTrump !
Trump !
Trump!â€ � , â€œU - S - A !
U - S - A !
U - S - A!â€ � and â€œRoll call vote !
Roll call vote!!â€ � echo across the floor of the RNC as the more than 2,000 delegates leap to their feet either in protest of the vote or in celebration of it .
The # NeverTrump contingent , headed by Utah senator Mike Lee , appear pleased to have driven the Republican leadership from the podium after the fight .
As funk music plays in the background , Lee tells reporters that â€œthe podium has been abandoned.â€ � â€œI want a roll - call vote , â€ � Lee continued .

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Oliver Laughland is getting close with Bikers for Trump : Video contains nudity :
Caught your attention , eh ?
One hundred women posed nude for an art installation near the site of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , Ohio , yesterday , carrying large mirrors that they shone in the direction of the convention , as a way to reflect â€œthe knowledge and wisdom of progressive women.â€ �
The artist behind the project , Spencer Tunick , said the installation was also a way for women and minorities to positively channel â€œtheir anger through art against the hateful repressive rhetoric of many in the Republican party.â€ �
If Tiffany Trump doesnâ€ ™ t sing at the RNC , we will demand a refund .

Alex Smith , the first female chair of the College Republicans in the organizationâ€ ™ s 124-year history , told the assembled delegates that â€œMillennials cost us the White House four years ago , and thatâ€ ™ s caused some of the political elite to write us off.â€ �
But , Smith cautioned , â€œWe are some crazy , freedom - loving people!â€ � â€œFor too long , Republican leaders havenâ€ ™ t been making our case to millennials , â€ � Smith said of the so - called Grand Old Party .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s just too much â€˜oldâ€ ™ and not enough â€˜grandâ€ ™ in how we express our values to the next generation of voters.â€ �
But â€œTogether , we are an unstoppable force the cause of freedom!â€ �
Later , Young Republicans president David Cook - who appeared to be at least 40 years old - said that â€œRepublicans face an uphill battle with young Americans in contrast to the party of unicorns and fairy tales.â€ �
But â€œthere is no better illustration of the American dreamâ€ � for young people , Cook said , than the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence .
# Classy .
Featuring reality television personalities , supermodels and soap opera stars , program of speakers at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week is a massive departure from traditional convention fare .
With 26 speakers scheduled to address the convention just today , weâ€ ™ re going to be introducing speakers with a miniature biography , including their choicest comments from the RNC stage and a quick evaluation of whether the speaker would still be here if Donald Trump werenâ€ ™ t the Republican nominee .
First up : Willie Robertson , CEO of Duck Commander and star of Duck Dynasty RNC - provided biography : â€œThe star of A&amp;Eâ€ ™ s hit series Duck Dynasty , Willie Robertson , is the CEO of Duck Commander and Buck Commander , a New York Times bestselling author , traveling speaker , father of five , and an avid outdoorsman.â€ � Fun facts :
Robertsonâ€ ™ s father , Phil , endorsed and campaigned with Texas senator Ted Cruz during the Republican presidential primaries , and was floated as a potential United Nations ambassador by the senator .
Sample tweet : Would he address the RNC any other year ?
If Ted Cruz were the nominee , Phil Robertson would likely have jumped the queue , so weâ€ ™ ll say â€œno.â€
�
The Texas delegation : The RNCâ€ ™ s proceedings feature a house band , currently singing ( shouting , really ) a rendition of Cleveland Rocks by the Presidents of the United States of America .
Sample lyrics : Cleveland rocks !
Cleveland rocks !
Cleveland rocks !
Cleveland rocks !
And it goes on like this .
Hours before the beginning of the Republican National Conventionâ€ ™ s first night of primetime programming - themed â€œMake
America Safe Againâ€ � - Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign has released a blistering statement on what it called Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s â€œdangerous and divisive national security proposals.â€
�
â€œFrom
Trump and his running mate
Mike Penceâ€ ™ s shared support for a ban on Muslims , to their advocacy for the use of torture , to Trumpâ€ ™ s proposals to allow more countries to have nuclear weapons , to his secret plan to defeat ISIS , to his cozying up to strongmen and dictators like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jung Un , to his threat of abandoning our allies , one thing is clear : a Trump presidency would leave both our country and the world dramatically less safe
, â€ � the release stated .
Calling out Trumpâ€ ™ s positions in subheads labeled â€œIslamophobia , â€ � â€œTorture , â€ � â€œNuclear
Weaponsâ€ � and â€œPraise for Dictators , â€ � the Clinton campaign accuses Trump of thinking â€œvery little of the United Statesâ€
� and endorsing policies that are â€œineffective , unethical , and dangerous.â€ �
â€œThis convention will come to order!â€
�
With the crack of a gavel , Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus has officially opened the Republican National Convention here in Cleveland .
After a presentation of colors , the Pledge of Allegiance , the national anthem ( performed by a childrenâ€ ™ s group called the Singing Angels ) and the invocation - originally to have been led by Ivanka Trumpâ€ ™ s rabbi , before he pulled out after pressure from his congregants - the convention has officially begun .
Ben Carson , former Republican candidate turned surrogate for Donald Trump , has blamed Americaâ€ ™ s lack of unity on the decline of Christianity .
Speaking at a Latino Leaders Network lunch , Carson said : â€œAll this divisiveness you see going on right now in our country , I personally believe it is intentional from those who want to destroy this country or at least bring it back down to size , according to their philosophy .
â€œBut I believe that God blessed this country for a reason and it was because we were a decent people who honoured him .
Our founding document , the Declaration of Independence , talked about certain inalienable rights give to us by our creator .
Every coin in your pocket , every bill in your wallet , says , â€˜In God we trustâ€ ™ .
Our pledge of allegiance says , â€˜One nation under Godâ€ ™ .â€
�
The neurosurgeon warned : â€œAnd now weâ€ ™ re in the process of trying to throw all of that out .
And as we throw all of that out , I think the baser instincts begin to take over , and canâ€ ™ t you see this hatred and this divisiveness that is going on ?
This is something we have to put an end to because a house divided against itself can not stand .
I think we need to begin to de - emphasise the external characteristics and begin to emphasise the character of our American people.â€ �
Carson said he is advising Trump on education policy and commented that China and Indiaâ€ ™ s vast populations meant that the US can not afford not to develop all its people .
He also commented that the phenomenon of face transplants show the folly of discriminating by race .
Leaving aside the riots at the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago , the precursors to the presidential race have always been rather staid .
The most exciting thing to happen is usually a balloon drop or maybe Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair .
In fact , the conventions were so famously boring that back in 2002 , the West Wing aired an episode where the fictitious broadcast networks banded together and told the White House they would be limiting the amount of air time theyâ€ ™ d be giving them .
Then 2016 happened .
Thanks to the heated race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the completely insane one - man horror show that is Donald Trump , this year everyone is obsessed with the conventions .
Just like on the West Wing , television is reacting accordingly , but with even more coverage than ever before , mostly with late - night talk shows .
The Daily Show , which has always made hay out of the political process , is sending a team of nearly 90 people to both Cleveland for the Republican national convention and Philadelphia for the Democratic national convention .
To give themselves an even bigger advantage , host Trevor Noah will go live at 11 pm ET on both 21 and 28 July immediately following the big speeches given by Trump and Clinton , respectively .
( Late night shows are usually filmed earlier in the evening . )
The Comedy Central staple will also be airing those episodes on Facebook Live so all of those millennial cord - cutters we hear so much about can get a taste of the show without paying for cable .
Jon Stewart , who used to anchor the Daily Show , will be joining his old friend Stephen Colbert , whose Late Show on CBS will also be going live for the next two weeks , but at 11.35pm ET , giving Noah the slight edge timing - wise .
Itâ€ ™ s still unclear what Stewartâ€ ™ s role will be , but itâ€ ™ s sure to get his liberal base very excited .
Colbert also has a great slate of political guests lined up in including fellow Daily Show alum and current HBO host John Oliver , progressive saint Senator Elizabeth Warren and disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner .
The Denver Postâ€ ™ s editorial board has called for a min - insurrection at the Republican National Convention this week , publishing an editorial urging Coloradoâ€ ™ s delegates to the convention to refuse to back â€œa racist , misogynist megalomaniacâ€ � for the Republican nomination , comparing presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump to an abusive spouse .
â€œThe state partyâ€ ™ s
delegates find themselves in a unique situation , and they should make the most of it , â€ � the editorial board writes .
â€œIf ever a vote required the kind of purity test activists are so fond of , refusing to back a racist , misogynist megalomaniac would be the time.â€ �
Citing the refusal of the vast majority of the stateâ€ ™ s congressional delegation to attend the convention , as well as Trumpâ€ ™ s poor fit with the â€œmore libertarian Colorado conservative base , â€ � the editorial board pushes for the delegates to abstain from voting .
â€œWe understand that the party is under practical pressures that now look insurmountable , â€ � the editorial board concludes .
â€œBut Donald Trump would be bad for the nation and bad for the Republican brand .
A principled abstention preserves the spirit of the rules .
And if enough delegates from other states join in and give them the chance , then Coloradoâ€ ™ s delegates should dump Trump.â€ � â€œWhen you find yourself in an abusive relationship , the smart thing to do - the right thing - is to get a divorce.â€

The Guardianâ€ ™ s Oliver Laughland has updates from the sparsely attended Women Vote Trump event here in Cleveland , where the presumptive Republican nomineeâ€
™ s
difficulties with female voters appear to have influenced turnout : The chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee has defended Donald Trump and denied that he will cost the party seats in the House of Representatives .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re all adjusting , â€ � admitted Greg Walden , a representative from Oregon , at an Atlantic magazine breakfast .
But he added : â€œYou go round the country race by race and you realise weâ€ ™ re in pretty darned good shape.â€ �
People are worried about national security and the economy , Walden said , and have turned to Trump because â€œtheyâ€ ™ re looking for a fighterâ€ � .
He also praised the candidateâ€ ™ s running mate .
â€œI think Mike Pence is a good choice .
Heâ€ ™ s a very thoughtful guy ...
You build a team , itâ€ ™ s not just one person.â€
�
Although Trump is behind Hillary Clinton in fundraising , the Republican National Committee is better organised , Walden claimed .
â€œThe Democratic party is no longer the party of Bill Clinton .
Itâ€ ™ s
the party of Bernie Sanders.â€ � Michael Steele , former chairperson of the Republican National Committee , dismissed criticism that Trump has failed to provide stars in the convention line - up .
Looking around the room , he asked : â€œCan we get comfortable with the idea
that Donald Trump just doesnâ€ ™ t care?â€ � The only thing that matters to him , Steele argued , is put himself , his wife and children on stage .
â€œThis is about branding.â€ �
Trump was â€œtornâ€ � over his vice - presidential pick , Steele added .
â€œI think his heart really was with [ Chris ] Christie.â€
�
But his family and campaign chairperson Paul Manafort advised otherwise .
Steele , now a political pundit , said there is a side to Donald Trump that the public often donâ€
™ t see .
â€œThe guy Iâ€ ™ ve got to know actually genuinely cares about workers , individuals , communities of people .
Heâ€
™ s still paying the bills of people who left his employ 15 years ago .
â€œThat side of the narrative does not get discussed .
I donâ€
™ t know why heâ€ ™ s allowed [ the negative ] narrative to really define his persona.â€
�
Looking forward to the election against Clinton , Steele predicted a high voter turn out .
â€œI think the debates are going to be the most watched public events in the history of this country , â€ � he said .
â€œThe candidates animate people in a way that makes them want to lash out with their vote.â€ �
The Atlantic event also heard from David Wasserman , an analyst at The Cook Political Report .
â€œThe golden triangle of the electoral college this year is Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania , â€ �
he said .
â€œA lot of us pay exclusive attention to Donald Trump at our peril because in a lot of these districts polls show Hillary Clinton is just as unpopular.â€ �
Outside the Quicken Loans Arena , knockoff pro - Trump merch has emerged as a cottage industry : Late - night comedian Stephen Colbert was as stealthy as a man could be while wearing an electric - blue wig , but cell - phone video has surfaced of the former Colbert Report host doing a bit on the main stage of the Republican National Convention as Caesar Flickerman , the toothsome host of The Hunger Games .
Although if Flickerman looks like anybody , itâ€ ™ s Paul Manafort .
Even after Lesley Stahl grilled him about it , Indiana governor and designated running mate Mike Pence has not deleted this tweet : Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is causing a little bit of mischief during the week of the Republican National Convention , watering the seeds of discord sown during a contentious primary that has left some Republicans worried that their party has left them behind .
Cut to Clintonâ€ ™ s latest web video : â€œConfessions of a Republican II ,
â€ � a spiritual successor to an iconic 1964 advertisement that featured character actor Bill Bogert wondering what has happened to his party .
Bogert makes a return to Clintonâ€ ™ s sequel , raising many of the same concerns about Trump that he did about Goldwater , a similarly divisive party nominee who flouted conservative orthodoxy .
â€œI was a Republican who voted for Eisenhower and Nixon .
My father was a Republican , his father was .
The whole family was , â€ �
Bogert says .
â€œBut Donald Trump ...
Heâ€ ™ s a different kind of man .
This man scares me.â€ �
â€œA friend of mine said to me , â€˜Listen , just because a man sounds irresponsible during a campaign doesnâ€
™ t mean heâ€ ™ s going to act that way.â€ ™
Well , I donâ€
™ t buy that .
Trump says â€˜we need unpredictabilityâ€ ™ when it comes to using nuclear weapons !
What is that supposed to mean ?
When a man says that , he sounds a lot like a threat to humanity.â€ � â€œIâ€ ™ ve thought about just not voting , but you canâ€ ™ t do that - thatâ€ ™
s saying you donâ€ ™ t care who wins , and I do care , â€ �
Bogert continues .
â€œI think the party is about to make a terrible mistake in Cleveland , and Iâ€ ™ m going to have to vote against that mistake on the eighth of November.â€ �
Chris Christie is getting mouthy ...
Campaign manager Paul Manafort said that his comments earlier this morning regarding John Kasichâ€ ™ s decision to avoid the Republican National Convention are not a symbol of disunity , but rather part of the â€œhealingâ€ � process .
â€œWe wanted him to participate and he chose not to , â€ �
Manafort said , also speaking to the absence of the Bush family , including two former presidents and a failed presidential nominee .
â€œWe hope that when the Bush family decides to participate again in the political process that they will join us ... but healing takes time.â€ � â€œIt is a difficult situation when the host - state governor doesnâ€ ™ t participate in the convention process , â€ � Manafort admitted .
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will introduce wife Melania Trump tonight for her speech to the Republican National Convention , breaking form by appearing onstage before his own official acceptance of the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination .
â€œMr .
Trump will be accompanying his wife to the Q , â€ � campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters during a morning press briefing , referring to the Quicken Loans Arena .
â€œHe will introduce her tonight , and then she will speak .
They will then , after her comments , jointly leave and go back to New York .
Heâ€
™ ll be coming out here formally on Wednesday.â€ � Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech - her first major address as a potential first lady - is the kickoff of a series of family testimonials that Manafort said â€œwill describe Donald Trump the man - itâ€ ™ s the part that I think is historic , â€ �
Manafort says , pointing out that a record five members of Trumpâ€ ™ s family will speak at this weekâ€ ™ s convention .
Melania Trump , referred to on the RNC app and her own website as â€œthe aqua - eyed beauty , â€ � is rarely seen on the campaign trail , and in the past has only spoken for a few minutes to introduce her husband .
Republican National Convention CEO Jeff Larson and Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager Paul Manafort have taken the dais here at the RNCâ€ ™ s morning press briefing , where the dayâ€ ™ s plans will be laid out .
â€œWe , I think , have a good program today , with a number of speakers we laid out yesterday , â€ � Larson says .
â€œAntonio Sobato will be speaking this evening , Mary Ann Mendoza , immigration - reform advocate ...
thereâ€
™ s a whole host of great speakers.â€ � â€œWeâ€ ™
ll conclude with Mrs. Trump speaking tonight , â€ � Larson continues , referring to Melania Trump , the Solvenian - born former model who is rarely seen and even more rarely heard on the campaign trail .
â€œThe first dayâ€ ™ s gon na turn out to be very good.â€
�
Manafort takes the lectern to speak to campaign - related matters .
â€œOur goal all week is to present a picture of Donald Trump that is broader than just the campaign image that people have developed from the primary season , â€ � Manafort says .
â€œWe also understand that , since Mr. Trump has not been active in the political arena prior to becoming a candidate a year ago , the biography of the man ... is not
well - known.â€ �
The goal of this weekâ€ ™ s convention , Manafort elaborates , is to introduce Trump â€œnot just as the political figure running for office , but as the father , as the businessman , as the compassionate human being he is when the spotlights arenâ€ ™ t on.â€ � â€œWe really have got three different groups speaking today ...
youâ€ ™ ll have certainly the family and personal aspect presented through Melania Trump ,
â€ �
Manafort says .
â€œYou then have some people who have been affected by world events who will be speaking to the issue of making America great again , â€ �
and then others speaking on political figures speaking to policy .
More news from MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe , where former House speaker Newt Gingrich blamed what he characterized as the poor state of race relations in the US on President Barack Obama .
â€œAs long as you have Barack Obama doing what he did over the last few years , if youâ€ ™ ve had seven - and - a - half years of a black president , seven - and - a - half years of a black attorney general , Gallup reports race relations today are worse than any time in the last 17 years ,
â€ �
Gingrich said .
Why ?
â€œBecause how often has he hit the police , â€ �
Gingrich said of Obama .
â€œHe hit the police in Cambridge and he was wrong .
He hit the police in Ferguson , he was wrong .
He hit the police about Florida , he was wrong .
At what point does the president have some obligation to say , you know - there are two parts of this .
One , weâ€ ™ ve got to better understand the experience of being black in America and in places like Chicago where 3,200 people have been killed in the Obama presidency , we had better have a strategy that works .
We donâ€ ™ t.â€ �
Gingrich also spoke to being passed over as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s running mate , telling Morning Joe that he was pleased just to be considered .
â€œIt was a great honor to be considered , â€ �
Gingrich said .
â€œAs
I said to Trump at the time , you know , you could run a two - pirate ticket
[ Ed .
: Yes , he said pirate . ]
and then Trump and I â€ “ we would certainly have had a lot of catalytic energyâ€
¦ I think he made the right decision that having a balanced ticket will actually , in the long run , serve him well.â€ �
Weâ€ ™ re waiting for the morning # RNCinCLE briefing - which will begin â€œmomentarily , â€ � according to an RNC staffer - but before we kick off todayâ€ ™ s slate of platform votes , speakers and protests , a quick story of intra - party sniping during a week of putative party unity : Paul Manafort , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign manager , told MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe this morning that the host governor of the Republican National Convention is not being as , well , gracious as he might hope .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s hurting his state - heâ€ ™
s embarrassing his state , frankly , â€ � Manafort said of John Kasich , the Ohio governor who has chosen to host a listening tour around the state this week instead of attending the convention .
â€œYou know what , heâ€ ™ s making a big mistake , â€ � Manafort said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s making a big mistake .
Heâ€ ™ s looking at something thatâ€ ™ s not going to happen .
Heâ€ ™ s hurting his state - heâ€ ™ s embarrassing his state , frankly .
But ... most of the Republicans who arenâ€ ™ t coming are people who have been part of the past .
And the people who are part of the future of the Republican Party are , frankly , going to be here participating in the program.â€ �
Good morning , and welcome to the Guardianâ€ ™ s campaign live blog , coming at you live from Cleveland , Ohio , site of the long - anticipated Republican national convention .
Less than 20 hours before kickoff , the Republican National Committee finally released its full slate of speakers , events and themes for this weekâ€ ™ s convention on Sunday , the theme of which was perhaps best summed up by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign chief , Paul Manafort : This is a Trump convention .
Rather than the typical slate of party leaders , loyalists and luminaries , the 2016 RNC program largely features a â€œnon - traditionalâ€ � roster of Trumpâ€ ™ s family members , business associates and personal friends , with the stated agenda of helping â€œthe American people understand more about Donald Trump , the manâ€ � , as Manafort put it to the press yesterday .
Each day is programmed around a theme , carefully tweaked from Trumpâ€ ™ s ever - present campaign slogan of â€œMake America
Great Again , â€ � that loosely corresponds to its speakers .
Todayâ€ ™ s theme : â€œMake America Safe Again.â€
�
With speakers largely focused on threats posed by terrorism and undocumented immigrants , the stated goal of todayâ€ ™ s speeches are to emphasize that â€œthe policies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us vulnerable , â€ � according to the program .
Weâ€ ™ ll have more on the full roster of speakers as the day begins , but hereâ€ ™ s a sampling of the headliners : Melania Trump , Lieutenant General ( ret . )
Michael Flynn , Iowa senator Joni Ernst , Concerned Veterans for America advisor Jason Beardsley and Montana congressman Ryan Zinke .
Before we go full - tilt on the RNC , hereâ€ ™ s a quick rundown of what you need to know from the campaign trail this weekend :
In their first joint interview on 60 Minutes , Donald Trump and running mate
Mike Pence revealed an uneasy union as host Lesley Stahl grilled them on major policy differences on immigration , international trade and their personal styles .
Trump frequently interrupted his running mate , with Pence speaking about 50 times and Trump more than 100 .
Key Trump line : â€œI think I am , actually humble .
I think Iâ€ ™ m much more humble than you would understand.â€
�
A West Virginia Republican lawmaker said yesterday that his comments on Twitter calling for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s public execution were not meant to be taken literally .
In the tweet , House of Delegates member Mike Folk said that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee â€œshould be tried for treason , murder , and crimes against the US constitution
â€ ¦ then hung on the Mall in Washington
DCâ€ � .
Samaria Rice , the mother of Tamir Rice , has one message for Donald Trump ahead of the convention in Cleveland : â€œI wish he wasnâ€ ™ t coming here.â€ � â€œDonald Trump doesnâ€ ™ t really care about the murders of Alton Sterling , Philando Castile , and other young men , â€ � Rice told the Guardian .
Her 12 year - old son was shot dead by a white Cleveland police officer as he played with a plastic pellet gun in Cleveland in November 2014 .
â€œI donâ€
™ t really think that he has a need to care , because I donâ€ ™ t believe that he cares for African American people anyway , â€ � she said .
The head of the Cleveland police union called on the governor of Ohio to declare a state of emergency and to suspend open - carry gun rights during the Republican national convention , following the killing of three officers in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , yesterday .
â€œI
donâ€ ™ t care what the legal precedent is
, I feel strongly that leadership needs to stand up and defend these police officers ,
â€ �
Steve Loomis , the head of the Cleveland Police Patrolmenâ€ ™ s Association , told Reuters in an interview at the unionâ€ ™ s headquarters on Sunday .
â€œAn AR-15 , a shotgun , multiple handguns .
Itâ€ ™ s irresponsible of those folks , especially right now , to be coming downtown with open carry ARâ€ ™ s or anything else
, â€ � Loomis told CNN .
â€œI
couldnâ€ ™ t care less
if itâ€ ™ s
legal or not.â€ �
Caught up ?
Good â€ “ now on with the show ..."
2016-07-19,"A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump at the Republican national convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention .
â€œBarack
and I were raised with so many of the same values , that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do , â€ �
Obama told the gathering of Democrats in 2008 .
â€œAnd Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values , and pass them on to the next generation .
Because we want our children â€ “ and all children in this nation â€ “ to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.â€ �
Trump told GOP delegates on Monday : â€œFrom a young age , my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise .
â€œThat you treat people with respect .
They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life .
That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son , and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow , because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.â€ � Journalist Jarrett Hill was among the first to point out that lines Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s wife spoke about the necessity of hard work and strong family values seemed familiar .
The Trump campaign has denied accusations of plagiarism .
On Tuesday morning , Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said it was â€œjust absurdâ€ � to claim that Melania Trump had plagiarised the first lady .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no cribbing of Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s speech , â€ �
Manafort told CNN , adding â€œthereâ€ ™ s no feeling on her part that she did
it.â€ �
Manafort suggested that she was simply using â€œwords that are common wordsâ€ � .
In an initial statement issued at 2 am , Jason Miller , the campaignâ€ ™ s senior communications adviser and Trumpâ€ ™ s speechwriter , had said Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech included â€œfragmentsâ€ � of othersâ€ ™ speeches that â€œreflected her own thinkingâ€ � , though did not directly answer accusations of plagiarism .
Miller added that the speech was produced by Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s
â€œteamâ€ � .
This runs counter to her own statements in an interview with NBC prior to the speech , in which she claimed to have written the speech herself .
A campaign source suggested to the Guardian that the blame lay with Rick Gates , a longtime aide to top Trump strategist Paul Manafort .
The source said Gates signed off on the speech and edited it .
Manafort is a veteran Republican operative with connections to a number of foreign regimes , including that of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych .
The strategist , who joined the Trump campaign in March to advise on a potential delegate fight , soon gained control of the entire campaign and edged out campaign manager Corey Lewandowski .
Manafort took advantage of his decades of experience as well as the fact that he refused to accept a salary from Trump as he moved into the presumptive nomineeâ€ ™ s orbit .
A veteran of campaigns going back to Gerald Fordâ€ ™ s 1976 re - election effort , Manafort moved to hire longtime advisers and associates such as Gates .
Jon Favreau , a White House speechwriter for the Obama administration , pointed out that Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s writer used to work for Hillary Clinton : Plagarism scandals have periodically haunted American politics .
Infamously , the 1988 presidential campaign of the current vice - president , Joe Biden , was ended over allegations that the then senator from Delaware had plagiaried Neil Kinnock , the leader of the British Labour party at the time .
In an interview with Matt Lauer of NBC , Melania Trump said of her speech : â€œI wrote it with a little help as possible.â€ �"
2016-07-19,"Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech at the Republican convention bore more than a passing resemblance to that delivered by Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic convention .
In following very close to parts of someone elseâ€ ™ s speech , the would - be first lady was in good company .
Joe Biden , the US vice - president , was famously caught out , as were others .
Joe Biden and Neil Kinnock
In September 1987 , the New York Times columnist , Maureen Dowd , noted the striking similarities between a closing speech in a Democratic presidential debate by then Delaware senator Joe Biden and a political ad by the UK Labour leader , Neil Kinnock .
In the August debate at the Iowa state fair , Biden said : Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go a university ?
Why is it that my wife â€ ¦ is the first in her family to ever go to college ?
Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright ?
â€
¦
Is it because they didnâ€
™ t work hard ?
My ancestors who worked in the coal mines of north - east Pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours ?
Itâ€ ™ s because they didnâ€ ™ t have a platform on which to stand.â€ �
In May 1987 , Kinnock told the Welsh Labour party conference : Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university ?
Was it because our predecessors were thick ?
Does anybody really think that they didnâ€
™ t get what we had because they didnâ€ ™ t have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment ?
Of course not .
It was because there was no platform upon which they could stand.â€
�
Biden said he had credited Kinnock on several occasions , but failed to do so that time .
Michael Dukakis , one of Bidenâ€ ™ s rivals , released a video putting together the two speeches .
The ensuing furore was a huge embarrassment to Biden and helped scupper his campaign .
Dowd was caught up in a plagiarism row of her own in in 2009 , when she was accused of lifting from a blog for a column criticising Dick Cheney on the use of torture .
Stephen Harper and John Howard
In 2008 , Owen Lippert had to resign over a speech he wrote five years earlier for his boss , Stephen Harper , the Canadian prime minister from 2006 to 2015 .
In 2003 , Harper , then the leader of the Canadian Alliance , was calling for troops to be deployed to Iraq in a speech in the House of Commons in support of the US invasion .
He said : As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads , the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups will multiply , particularly given in this case the shameless association of Iraq with rogue non - state organisations .
That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent .
Possession of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct , undeniable and lethal threat to the world , including to Canada and its people.â€ �
A few days earlier , the Australian prime minister , John Howard , a strong supporter of the Bush administration , had told the Australian parliament : As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads , so the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups will multiply .
That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent .
Possession of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct , undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people.â€ �
Lippert said that , pressed for time , he â€œhad been overzealous in copying segments of another world leaderâ€ ™ s speechâ€ � .
Lippert said Harper had been unaware of his action .
Barack Obama and Deval Patrick
In February 2008 , the Hillary Clinton campaign accused Barack Obama of plagiarism after he made a speech that closely resembled a 2006 speech by his friend , the Massachusetts governor , Deval Patrick .
In his speech , Obama was responding to Clintonâ€ ™ s charge that all he had to offer was â€œjust wordsâ€ � .
Obama cited well - known speeches and documents including those by Martin Luther King , John F Kennedy and from the declaration of independence and asked if they were just words .
Patrick had used many of the same quotes .
Obama subsequently acknowledged that he should have credited Patrick .
â€œHe [ Patrick ] had suggested we use these lines .
I thought they were good lines .
Iâ€ ™ m sure I should have .
Didnâ€ ™ t this time.â€

In January 2015 , Buzzfeed found that the Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson had lifted passages for his book , America the Beautiful , from the website socialismsucks.net as well as plagiarising from conservative historians W Cleon Skousen , who died in 2006 , and Bill Federer , although the latter is cited by Carson in the acknowledgements .
From socialismsucks : Sure , there are several different brands of socialism â€ “ at least as many types as there are would - be people - planners who wish to impose their plans to control the moral and economic lives of other people .
But are you willing to surrender your precious liberties to a socialist state which promises â€˜securityâ€ ™ for everyone or government - enforced equality ?

2016-07-19,"Republicans scrambled to prevent a plagiarism scandal from overshadowing the coronation of Donald Trump on Tuesday after his wife Melania borrowed large chunks of her opening night speech from Michelle Obama .
Campaign officials did not deny the similarities between Trumpâ€ ™ s speech to party delegates at the GOP convention in Cleveland and near identical segments delivered by the first lady during the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver â€ “ arguing instead that the words used were commonplace .
On Monday , Mrs Trump , a Slovenian - born former model , said her parents taught her â€œthat you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promiseâ€ � .
Yet within minutes , commentators noted that Obama had also said in 2008 that she had been raised in Chicago to feel â€œthat you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do.â€ � Trumpâ€ ™ s claim that she would pass these values on to future generations â€œbecause we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for
themâ€
�
also closely matched Obamaâ€ ™ s wish to share those values â€œbecause
we want our children â€ “ and all children in this nation â€ “ to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for themâ€ � .
As delegates prepared to formally offer Donald Trump the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nomination on Tuesday evening , the plagiarism controversy reopened internal wounds and undermined his campaignâ€ ™ s attempts to present a more polished appearance ahead of Novemberâ€ ™ s general election .
A campaign source said responsibility for the plagiarism incident lay with a longtime aide to top Trump strategist Paul Manafort .
The source said the aide had signed off on the speech and edited it .
Manafort declined to comment on the allegation during a rumbustious briefing with reporters on Tuesday morning , insisting instead that Trumpâ€ ™
s
use of commonplace language should not lessen the impact of her words .
â€œThese are themes that are personal to her , but they are personal to a lot of people depending on the stories of their lives , â€ � said the Trump campaign chairman .
â€œWe donâ€ ™ t believe there is anything in that speech that doesnâ€ ™ t reflect her thinking and we are comfortable that the words that were used are personal , to her .
The fact is that words like â€˜careâ€ ™ and â€˜respectâ€ ™ and compassion are not extraordinary words , â€ � added Manafort .
â€œAnd considering you are talking about family they are ordinary words .
Obviously Michelle Obama feels very much similar sentiments towards her family.â€ �
But Manafortâ€ ™ s longtime rival , former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , took the opportunity to twist the knife in a television appearance on CNN Tuesday morning .
â€œWhoever signed off with the final sign up he should be held accountable , â€ � said Lewandowski .
Lewandowski added : â€œI think if it was Paul Manafort , heâ€ ™
d do the right thing and resign .
If heâ€ ™ s the last person who saw this happen and brought this on the candidateâ€ ™ s wife , I think heâ€ ™ d resign because I think thatâ€ ™ s the type of person he would
be.â€ � Lewandowski frequently clashed with Manafort over the direction of the campaign and was finally pushed out after losing internal battles with both the veteran strategist and Trumpâ€ ™ s three oldest children in June .
Reince Priebus , chairman of a Republican national committee that has also at times had strained relations with the Trump campaign , told Bloomberg he would â€œprobablyâ€ � fire the speechwriter concerned if it were his decision .
Privately , Trump was said to be furious at seeing his wifeâ€ ™ s rare speaking engagement ruined , and his few senior allies in the party rushed to seek ever more elaborate explanations .
â€œIf Melaniaâ€ ™ s speech is similar to Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s speech , that should make us all very happy because we should be saying , whether weâ€ ™ re Democrats or Republicans , we share the same values , â€ � former GOP candidate Ben Carson told reporters .
â€œIf we happen to share values , we should celebrate that , not try to make it into a controversy.â€ �
Nevertheless , the incident threatens to overshadow Trumpâ€ ™ s attempt to show a polished and united face after angry scenes on the convention floor earlier in the day when â€œNever Trumpâ€ � rebels staged one last attempt to block his nomination .
On Tuesday , the convention was expecting to hear from House speaker Paul Ryan , who has yet to endorse Trump and has expressed concerns over comments from the presumptive nominee he said showed signs of â€œtextbook racismâ€
� .
A chaotic convention schedule on Monday meant that retired general Mike Flynn , leading chants of â€œlock her upâ€ � about Hillary Clinton , forced rising Republican star Joni Ernst out of a primetime slot .
Ernst , a telegenic first - term senator from Iowa who recently retired from the army national guard as a lieutenant colonel , spoke after 11 pm to an emptied convention center .
Ernst was one of the few prominent elected officials to agree to speak at the convention and the scheduling snafu represented an unintentional insult and yet another sign of disorganization within the campaign .
The Trump campaign , however , brushed aside mounting questions on Tuesday and blamed the media for ignoring what it called the successful culmination of a year - long effort to win the nomination .
â€œThe fact that the [ Melania Trump ] speech itself has been focused on for 50 words â€ “ and that includes â€˜andsâ€ ™ and â€˜thesâ€ ™ â€ “ is totally ignoring the facts of the speech itself , â€ �
Manafort told reporters , claiming the lines were not exactly â€œword - for - wordâ€ � the same as Obamaâ€ ™ s and furthermore were only part of a 1,400 word speech .
â€œShe was speaking before 40 million people and ... to think that she was trying to do anything unnoticed is absurd .
â€œYou are all focused on trying to distort [ her ] message .
There is a political tint to this whole episode , â€ � he added , claiming the media was taking its cue from Democrats .
â€œItâ€ ™ s another example that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female , the first thing she does is try to destroy the person .
Itâ€ ™ s
politics.â€ �
Online critics also highlighted a lighter hearted instance of apparent plagiarism , noting that Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s claim that her husband â€œwill never ever give up , and most importantly , he will never ever let you down , â€ � echoed Rick Astleyâ€ ™ s 1987 hit

2016-07-19,"Donald Trump entered the convention backlit amid theatrical smoke as Queenâ€ ™ s
We Are the Champions resounded .
He introduced Melania â€ “ â€œmy wife , an amazing mother , an incredible womanâ€ � , and , it transpires , not a particularly original speechmaker .
The would - be first lady went on , with some poise , to deliver remarks that suggested she is so eager to emulate Michelle Obama that she will repeat her almost verbatim .
â€œFrom a young age , my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do , â€ �
she said .
At the 2008 Democratic convention , Obama had said : â€œBarack
and I were raised with so many of the same values , that you work hard for what you want in life , that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€ ™ re going to do.â€
�
There was another section too that some writers would say was borrowed or paid homage to ; others would call it plagiarism .
Until some eagle - eyed viewers called her out , it had all seemed to go well for Melania in this rare public appearance at the Republican national convention .
That may have been relative and had something to do with the two hours of relentless nationalism , scaremongering and emotional manipulation that preceded her .
Compared to the politicians who went before , including the raving Rudy Giuliani , the polyglot former model was a positively Evita - esque breath of fresh air .
At last , a flash of razzle - dazzle we had all been promised .
When Giuliani was done , the convention hall dimmed and spotlights roved over the delegates in the sports arena and Van Morrisonâ€ ™ s Brown Eyed Girl belted out from the loudspeakers .
The â€œaqua - eyed beautyâ€ � , as her website puts it , took to the shiny black stage wearing white , her 5 ft 11 in boosted by high heels , and sporting a giant diamond ring .
One delegate shouted : â€œI love you!â€
�
Melania , 46 , delivered a calm speech in an unwaveringly strong eastern European accent that appeared to charm most delegates .
There was little to suggest a shift from what she said in 1999 about what role she would play if Trump became president : â€œI would be very traditional like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy.â€ �
Melania could become Americaâ€ ™ s first foreign - born first lady since Louisa Adams in the 19th century and the first born and raised in a communist nation .
â€œI was born in Slovenia , a small , beautiful and then communist country , â€ �
she recalled , with a particular emphasis on â€œthenâ€ � .
She described moving to New York and , a decade ago , becoming a US citizen â€ “ â€œthe greatest privilege on planet Earthâ€ � .
She did not regale her audience , or the millions watching at home , with the story of how she met Trump , 24 years her senior , at the Kit Kat Club in New York in 1998 .
Perhaps because itâ€ ™ s not exactly When Harry Met Sally : he asked for her number , she refused because he was with another date , he persisted and she gave in .
And now she lives this fabulous life .
It was , all in all , a decent pitch from a likeable salesperson .
Just one problem : she was singing the praises of Donald Trump , that peerless narcissist , deceiver , dodgy deal maker and demagogue .
She has seen the â€œsimple goodness of the heart that God gave himâ€ � , she said , and apparently really meant it .
â€œIf
you want someone to fight for you and your country , I can assure you he is the guy .
He will never , ever give up and most importantly he will never , ever let you down .
Donald is and always has been an amazing leader .
Now he will go to work for you.â€ �
Perhaps the most improbable attempt to give Trump a human face in the arena where signs proclaim â€œMake America great again!â€ � came towards the end .
She said : â€œHis success indicates inclusion rather than division .
Donald intends to represent all the people , not just some of the people .
That includes Christians and Jews and Muslims .
It includes Hispanics and African Americans and Asians and the poor and the middle class .
Throughout his career , Donald has successfully worked with people of many faiths and with many nations.â€ �
After Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , this first lady would be a throwback .
Melania gave little detail about her plans for the role except to say the cause of children and women is near her heart .
On came the sound of We Are the Champions again , though thousands of balloons suspended from the ceiling will remain there until the nomineeâ€ ™
s
own speech later this week .
Amid cheers and applause , Donald Trump took to the stage looking suitably chuffed , and there was an exchange of kisses .
He looked at the crowd and , smiling , pointed to his wife a few times .
Unwittingly , he appeared to be aiming at her breasts .
But just for once , he knew when to remain silent ."
2016-07-19,"Donald Trump sought to assert control over a fractured Republican convention on Monday with a slate of speakers who emphasised his unabashed appeal to the fears of Americans .
Appearing on stage for the first time , the once improbable candidate who will now be confirmed as the partyâ€ ™ s nominee after quashing an earlier rebellion , simply declared : â€œWe are going to win so big.â€ �
He spoke briefly to introduce his wife Melania as â€œthe next first lady of the United Statesâ€ � and watched as she painted a picture of the values they would bring to the White House , some of which were later revealed to have been plagiarised from a previous speech by Michelle Obama .
But it was the fiery performances of earlier speakers that helped set the tone for a staunchly nationalist campaign message in the coming days .
â€œThe vast majority of Americans donâ€ ™ t feel safe , â€ � claimed former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , who said there had been five major Islamist terrorist attacks on the US and its allies in the past seven months .
â€œYou know who you are .
And weâ€ ™ re coming to get you
, â€ � he warned terrorists , drawing the biggest cheers of the night .
â€œIf they have committed themselves to war against us
then we must commit us to unconditional victory against them.â€ � â€œThe world outside our border is a scary place , â€ � added former Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell in an emotional address .
â€œAmerica is the light , â€ � he added .
House homeland security chair
Mike McCaul claimed America was â€œin

â€œLetâ€ ™ s cut through the suffocating political correctness and call the threat what it really is : the enemy is radical Islam.â€

â€œWe unleashed some hell on them , â€ � added his marine colleague Mark Geist .
But it was not just external threats that were paraded before the convention ; there were also a series of speakers who told of deaths caused by undocumented immigrants living inside the US .
â€œItâ€ ™ s time that we had an administration that cared more about Americans than illegals
, â€ � said Mary Mendoza , the mother of police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant driving over the legal speed limit .
Jamiel Shaw prompted loud boos when he said his son had been killed by an â€œillegal alien gangbanger from Mexicoâ€ � .
â€œGod bless America , God bless Donald Trump ,
â€ � added two relatives of a murdered border control agent .
Delegates were also encouraged to fear Hillary Clinton .
There were repeated calls from the podium for the imprisonment of Trumpâ€ ™ s election opponent .
â€œLock her up , lock her up , â€ � chanted the crowd , to the encouragement of speakers on the podium .
Pat Smith , the mother of one of the four Americans killed in the Benghazi attack in 2012 , a now - infamous rightwing touchstone , even said she â€œblamed her personally for the loss of my sonâ€ � .
â€œThat night we lost four brave Americans and the American people lost the truth , â€ � Smith said .
â€œShe lied to me and then called me a liar .
Hillary for prison .
She deserves to be in stripes.â€ �
The Clinton campaign issued a statement to journalists responding to the repeated attacks .
â€œIn their continued quest to politically damage Hillary Clinton , Republicans have falsely claimed that Clinton told former secretary of defence Leon Panetta and US military personnel to â€˜stand downâ€ ™ in the wake of the Benghazi attacks , â€ �
it said .
â€œThis unfounded allegation has been widely debunked.â€ �
But Democrats reserved their strongest criticism to respond to the RNCâ€ ™ s attempt to shut down a mini - rebellion earlier in the day , when anti - Trump delegates sought to force a vote on rules that could have given them one last chance to block his expected nomination on Tuesday .
â€œDonald Trump lost control of his own convention before it even started , â€ � Clinton said .
Nonetheless , the evening session appeared far more unified than the earlier votes had been , with only two small protesters disrupting proceedings .
A long list of speakers meant some such as Iowa senator Joni Ernst were forced to address an emptying hall as the evening wore on .
Delegates gave a warm welcome to the heavily - accented keynote address from Slovenian - born Melania Trump , who regaled them with a homily about her husbandâ€ ™ s character values .
â€œIf you want someone to fight for you and your country , I can assure you , heâ€ ™ s the guy .
He will never ever give up , and most importantly , he will never let you down ,
â€ � she said .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s tough when he has to be but
heâ€ ™ s also kind and fair and caring .
This kindness is not always noted ... that is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with.â€ �
Mrs Trump also claimed : â€œDonald intends to represent all of the people , not some of the people , â€ � including Muslims and Hispanics , she said .
Outside the convention centre , protests throughout the city of Cleveland remained peaceful on Monday as authorities reported only one arrest by the late afternoon .

2016-07-20,"Donald Trump sought to draw a line under increasingly damaging plagiarism allegations on Wednesday with the release of a statement admitting his wife had provided a campaign speechwriter with lines taken from Michelle Obama .
In a statement released via the campaign , Meredith McIver , a junior aide working on the speech , takes responsibility for the lines subsequently appearing in Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s opening - night address to the Republican convention and reveals she offered to resign .
â€œIn working with Melania Trump on her recent First Lady speech , we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the American people , â€ � said McIver .
â€œA person she has always liked is Michelle Obama .
Over the phone , she read me some passages from Mrs Obamaâ€ ™ s speech as examples .
I wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech.â€ �
McIverâ€
™ s apology â€œfor the confusion and hysteria my mistake has causedâ€ � comes as the sight of the would - be first lady lifting whole chunks of her speech from a political rival threatens to destroy attempts to present a more polished and competent campaign in Cleveland .
Neither Trump nor his wife have apologised for the incident and previously the campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , insisted the similarity was due to the two wives sharing a common view of family values .
Earlier on Wednesday Trump had attempted to put a positive spin on the controversy : â€œI did not check Mrs Obamaâ€ ™ s speeches .
That was mistake , and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps , as well as to Mrs Obama , â€ � said McIver in her statement .
â€œYesterday , I offered my resignation to Mr Trump and the Trump family , but they rejected it .
Mr Trump told me that people make innocent mistakes and that we learn and grow from these experiences .
â€œI am honored to work for such a great family , â€ �
she added .
Asked about the controversy at the White House press briefing in Washington , spokesman Josh Earnest said : â€œObviously , in 2008 Mrs Obama spoke movingly in her own words about her life story , about her values , and she was warmly received by the crowd .
She got strong reviews from pundits and Iâ€
™ m confident in the future , aspiring first ladies and potential first husbands would draw on the same kinds of sentiments to advocate for their spouse .
â€œMrs
Obama is obviously quite proud of the speech she gave in 2008 , and Iâ€ ™ m confident that sheâ€ ™ ll deliver another speech thatâ€ ™ s equal to the test next week , â€ �
he added , referring to the Democratic convention that will begin in Philadelphia on Monday .
â€œI have not spoken to the president and first lady since that letter became public , â€ � he said of McIverâ€ ™ s statement , â€œso Iâ€ ™ m not sure if theyâ€ ™ re aware of it right now.â€ �"
2016-07-20,"Not again .
A day after Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s wife , Melania , was found to be plagiarising chunks from a Michelle Obama speech , his son , Donald Jr , was accused of parroting phrases lifted from previously published work .
In what had seemed a smooth , confident and well - received speech , Trump Jr had described the malaise in America .
â€œOur schools used to be an elevator to the middle class , â€ � he complained .
â€œNow theyâ€ ™ re stalled on the ground floor .
Theyâ€ ™ re like Soviet - era department stores that are run for the benefit of the clerks and not the customers.â€ �
As in the case of Melania on Monday , the Twitterati soon pounced .
Comedy Centralâ€ ™ s The Daily Show highlighted an article by Frank H Buckley published two months ago by American Conservative magazine .
â€œWhat should be an elevator to the upper class is stalled on the ground floor , â€ � it read .
â€œOur schools and universities are like old Soviet department stores whose mission was to serve the interests of the sales clerks and not the customers.â€ �
It was all the more extraordinary because , after the Melania debacle , it seemed fair to assume that Trump would hire an infinite number of monkeys to check his sonâ€ ™ s speech and ensure it contained not a syllable of copying .
Buckley himself , however , did not seem upset .
â€œI was a speechwriter for this speech , â€ � he told Business Insider .
â€œSo
Iâ€ ™ m afraid
thereâ€ ™ s
no issue here.â€
�
Indeed , but for the previous farce , a speechwriterâ€ ™ s self - plagiarism would probably have passed without incident .
But in the current climate , to use one old phrase may be regarded as a misfortune ; to use two looks like carelessness .
The pity of it was that , like Melania , Trump Jr had in fact been a more agreeable speaker than many of the professional politicians the GOP convention has witnessed , many of them full of bile and rancour .
With his tanned complexion and slicked - back hair , the 38-year - old looks like an actor playing the US president in a TV drama set in Washington .
And he was perhaps the ultimate Trump spokesman in that he was selling the tycoonâ€ ™ s peculiar version of the American dream .
How can a billionaire businessman from New York be the one who â€œgetsâ€ � the struggling working class ?
It is the paradox that has been at the heart of the Trump phenomenon .
Describing himself as â€œthe son of a great manâ€ � , Trump Jr attempted to square the circle .
Regular guys , common sense and capitalism : good ; intellectuals , experts and fancy universities : bad .
Watched by thousands of delegates , some waving â€œMake America great againâ€ � banners , Trump Jr recalled that , from as soon as he could walk , he was at his fatherâ€ ™ s side on the frontline .
â€œHe didnâ€ ™ t hide out behind some desk in an executive suite , â€ �
he said .
â€œHe spent his career with regular Americans .
He hung out with the guys on construction sites , pouring concrete and hanging sheetrock .
He listened to them and he valued their opinion as much , and often more , than the guys from Harvard and Wharton locked away in offices away from the real world .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s recognised the talent and the drive that all Americans have .
Heâ€
™ s promoted people based on their character , their street smarts and their work ethic , not simply paper credentials .
To this day many of the top executives in our company are individuals that started out in positions that were blue collar , but he saw something in them and he pushed them to succeed.â€ �
Trump Jr continued : â€œHis true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they donâ€ ™ t even see in themselves .
The potential that other executives overlook because their rÃ © sumÃ
© s donâ€
™ t include the names of famous colleges and degrees .
I know he values those workers and those qualities in people because those were the individuals he had my siblings and me work under when we started .
That he would trust his own childrenâ€ ™ s formative years to these men and women says all you need to know about Donald Trump .
â€œWe
didnâ€ ™ t learn from MBAs .
We learned from people who had doctorates in common sense ...
Itâ€ ™ s why weâ€ ™ re the only children of billionaires as comfortable in a D10 Caterpillar as we are in our own cars .
My father knew that those were the guys and gals who would teach us the dignity of hard work from a very young age .
He knows that at the heart of the American dream is the idea that whoever we are , wherever weâ€ ™ re from , we can get ahead , where everyone can prosper again.â€ �
And the central argument was that , according to the great man theory of history , Donald Trump can reanimate that dream because we are all workers on his construction site .
His son said : â€œI know when people tell him it canâ€ ™ t be done , that guarantees that he gets it done .
I know that when someone tells him that something is impossible , thatâ€ ™ s what triggers him into action .
When people told him it was impossible for a boy from Queens to go to Manhattan and take on developers in the big city , rather than give up , he changed the skyline of New York.â€ �
In this most unorthodox of election years , there was something quite traditional about Trump Jrâ€ ™
s drawing of battle lines : his father the superhero of capitalism and competition ; the Democrats representing big state regulation and stultification .
â€œItâ€ ™ s called the free market .
And itâ€ ™ s what the other party fears .
They want to run everything , top - down , from Washington .
The other party gave us a regulatory state on steroids.â€ �
As for Trumpâ€ ™ s rival : â€œIf Hillary Clinton were elected , sheâ€ ™ d be the first president who couldnâ€ ™ t pass the basic background check .
Itâ€ ™ s incredible .
Hillary Clinton is a risk that Americans canâ€ ™ t afford to take.â€ � Earlier , Trumpâ€ ™ s daughter Tiffany , 22 , had taken the stage , disarmingly admitting that she was nervous and giving her father a PR boost .
â€œI never expected to be here , addressing the nation , â€ �
she said .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve given a few speeches in classrooms , but never in an arena with 11 million people watching.â€ �
She told the crowd that she kept her report cards going back to kindergarten , not just for her grades but the notes her father scribbled on each one .
â€œFor me , the measure of a parent is how much they bolster you when youâ€ ™ re down , â€ � she said , telling the audience that her father had always supported her .
She told how Trump comforted her after the death of a close friend .
â€œWithout his support , I donâ€ ™ t know how I would have made it through.â€
�
Her friends find Trump to be â€œso friendly , considerate , funny , and realâ€ � , she said .
There have been no claims of plagiarism against Tiffany so far ."
2016-07-21,"While Ted Cruz was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention and Melania Trump continued to ward off accusations of plagiarism , the US first lady , Michelle Obama , injected some much - needed humour into US politics with the help of TV host James Corden .
Obama rocked out to Stevie Wonderâ€ ™ s Signed , Sealed , Delivered as well as Beyonceâ€ ™ s girl - power anthem Single Ladies for a special episode of Cordenâ€ ™ s sketch Carpool Karaoke .
â€œWe just dropped the mic , we were making honey in the beehive , we were making honey to put in our lemonade , â€ � Obama joked from the passenger seat of Cordenâ€ ™ s car .
During a tour of the White House , the pair were also joined by the rapper Missy Elliott for a rendition of This is For My Girls and later Elliottâ€ ™ s hit
Get Ur Freak On .
Inbetween songs Obama highlighted her
Let Girls Learn initiative , which aims to promote education for girls around the world .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re doing a really important trip to Liberia , Morocco and Spain , â€ �
she said .
â€œRight now
thereâ€ ™ s 62 million girls worldwide that arenâ€ ™ t in school for a variety of different reasons .
So much could be corrected in the world if girls were educated and had power over their lives .
â€œMy message to kids here is donâ€
™ t take your education for granted , because there are girls around the world who would die to get the education we have , they would do anything , they would move mountains to make it happen.â€
�
The first lady also revealed that this was only the second time in seven and a half years that she had been in the passenger seat of a car listening to music .
The last time was some months ago â€œwith my daughter , who learned to drive , and we rocked out with her â€ ¦
so this is a treatâ€ � .
Asked what she would miss the most about the White House , Obama responded : â€œThe people ; these are people you see every single day , they help you , they love you , thatâ€ ™ s going to be hard.â€ � Carpool Karaoke , a regular segment in Cordenâ€ ™ s Late Late Show , sees celebrities join him for light - hearted conversations and singalongs .
Previous guests have included Adele , Justin Bieber , One Direction , Elton John and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers ."
2016-07-21,"For several months America has been obsessed with what will happen once either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president .
But there is one important question no one has been posing : what the hell are we going to do without Michelle Obama ?
Not since Jacqueline Kennedy has there been a first lady as charming , glamorous , or inspirational .
All of those qualities were on display during her chance to do Carpool Karaoke with James Corden .
From the moment she strapped on her seatbelt and started singing Stevie Wonderâ€ ™ s Signed , Sealed , Delivered she had the audience in the palm of her hand .
It turns out that Michelle doesnâ€ ™ t have a bad singing voice ( though you couldnâ€ ™ t get the full extent of it with Stevie and James carrying the track ) .
It was a bit shocking to learn that Ms Obama has only been able to ride in the passenger seat of a car and rock out to music once in the last seven years â€ “ when teaching her daughter , Malia , how to drive .
I would watch a whole documentary about learning to drive at the White House .
Speaking of which , the strangest part of this Carpool Karaoke is that Corden is only allowed to drive around the White House driveway repeatedly , which is presumably how Malia learned to drive too .
It removes the improvisational nature of the exercise , since thereâ€ ™ s no dealing with traffic or actual driving .
Regardless , it was great to see Michelle Obama doing the Single Ladies dance while singing along to BeyoncÃ © , entering the Beyhive â€œand making honey to put in our Lemonadeâ€ � .
The two may be friends , but it was BeyoncÃ ©
â€ ™ s
former band mate Kelly Rowland who Obama called up to sing
This Is For My Girls , the anthem for her
Let Girls Learn initiative that is helping draw attention to the 62 million girls around the world who arenâ€ ™ t in school .
â€œSo much could be corrected in the world if girls were educated and had power over their lives ,
â€ � she says .
Yes , whenever Obama does something fun like this itâ€ ™ s because she has an important message to deliver .
Missy Elliot does a guest rap on This
Is
For My Girls
and she popped up in the back seat to deliver her verse , then joined Corden and Obama on Get Ur Freak On , a song whose lyrics didnâ€ ™ t seem to phase Michelle one bit .
It turns out she can really spit some flow too .
But is that surprising ?
Over the past eight years we have learned that Michelle Obama can do absolutely anything â€ “ from teaching kids to exercise to delivering epic levels of side eye .
Neither Bill Clinton nor Melania Trump would be nearly as fun to watch ."
2016-07-23,"For Alan Stansbery , it was a sniper .
For Timothy Phelps , it was God .
For Haleigh Stallworth , it was Michelle Obama .
Many of the people in Clevelandâ€ ™ s Public Square on Tuesday seemed to have something to fear .
The space had become the de facto hub for a small carnival of exhibitionists â€ “ protesters , conspiracy theorists , religious extremists and hate groups â€ “ who had descended on the city for the Republican national convention .
Hundreds of police circled like cogs in a gear system , then swarmed at the first sign of conflict .
Stansbery , a builder from Dayton , Ohio , was holding an AR-15 rifle .
His pistol was holstered to his flak jacket and a large hunting knife protruded from his belt .
Sweat dripped from his brow in the roasting heat .
The 38-year - old was one of eight members of the West Ohio Minutemen patrolling
the squareâ€ ™ s perimeter .
â€œThat would be the worst , â€ � he said , of the sniper that existed only in his imagination .
â€œ[If
they ] start taking people out , that would be terrible.â€
�
Phelps , a 52-year - old corrections officer from Topeka , Kansas , held a sign that said â€œGod is Americaâ€ ™ s
terrorâ€ � .
He and members of his religious hate group , the Westboro Baptist church , who said they â€œhatedâ€ � both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , had stood in the square on Tuesday afternoon , drawing boos from the crowd as they told onlookers â€ “ who heckled them â€ “ to prepare for hell .
â€œI think I donâ€ ™ t care about anything but obeying God , â€ � Phelps said , when asked what he was afraid of most .
Stallworth , a 47-year - old white woman from Huntsville , Texas , had come to show her support for Trump and to â€œtake
my country backâ€ � .
She accused the first lady of making â€œextremely incendiaryâ€ � speeches , which encouraged African American students to â€œstop being put downâ€ � .
This anger and fear was mirrored half a mile away .
At the Quicken Loans Arena , speakers took turns to spell out a host of worst - case scenarios .
Major American cities were at risk of being lost to terrorists with weapons of mass destruction , warned the former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich .
â€œInstead of losing 3,000 people in one morning ,
â€ �
Gingrich said , with reference to the 9/11 attacks , â€œwe could lose more than 300,000.â€ � Hillary Clinton could have indirect links with Lucifer , said the retired neurosurgeon and failed presidential candidate Ben Carson .
â€œThe vast majority of Americans do not feel safe , â€ � said the former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to an audience who gave him a standing ovation on Monday evening .
â€œThey fear for their children.â€ �
Trump gave his acceptance speech on Thursday .
â€œOur convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation , â€ � he said .
â€œThe attacks on our police , and the terrorism in our cities , threaten our very way of life.â€ �
â€˜The speeches havenâ€ ™ t frightened me .
Theyâ€ ™ ve inspired
meâ€
™ Many inside the air - conditioned hall said such terrifying themes actually made them feel better .
As the band fired up on Wednesday evening , reeling off an up - tempo rendition of Sweet Caroline , delegates danced arrhythmically .
In the Wisconsin delegation , Barbara Finger sat in her chair .
On her head was an enormous wedge of Styrofoam cheese â€ “ the adoptive headgear of devoted fans of the Green Bay Packers .
â€œThe speeches havenâ€ ™ t frightened me , â€ � she said .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ve inspired me .
There is kind of an electric atmosphere to this convention.â€ �
Despite the fact that the 60-year - old lives in the small city of Oconto , 1,574 miles from Mexico , she worried that terrorists may have made it to her hometown by crossing the southern border .
â€œPeople from the Middle East , they tend to have the darker hair , maybe slightly darker complexion .
They blend in with the South Americans and
Mexicans.â€ � â€œYou mean like me?â€
�
I asked .
â€œIt could be.â€ �
There is no evidence to suggest Fingerâ€ ™ s broad fears are well - founded .
Jeffrey Barke , a 53-year - old member of the Californian delegation , from Orange County , shared the Wisconsiniteâ€ ™ s sense of joy .
â€œThere was nothing scary .
It was real , â€ � he said ,
dressed in a two - piece suit made of the stars and stripes .
â€œIt was encouraging .
It was uplifting .
â€œFinally somebody is going to take our problems seriously and not just talk political nonsense and do something about it .
So , not unlike Great Britain , that just disassociated itself with the European Union , I look at Trump as a similar movement to fix whatâ€ ™ s wrong with America.â€ �
What did Barke make of Carsonâ€ ™ s insinuations about Clinton and Lucifer ?
â€œI think
heâ€
™ s spot on , â€ � Barke said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s absolutely refreshing to call , by name , the enemy that we face.â€
�
Throughout the four - day convention , Clinton remained in sight : speeches were punctuated with loud chants from delegates to â€œlock her upâ€ � .
The chants were the best indicator of the naked , aggressive populism that had filtered onto the convention floor .
Roger Stone , one of Trumpâ€ ™ s closest former advisers , could barely contain his elation .
Speaking to the Guardian at the Westin hotel on Wednesday , where minutes later Trumpâ€ ™ s son Donald Jr could be seen embracing Gingrich before the former speakerâ€ ™ s convention speech that night , Stone said : â€œThe American people are ready for a non - politician.â€ �
After describing Clinton as a â€œvenal greedy witchâ€ � , a comment he defended as â€œthe realityâ€ � , Stone said he himself feared nothing .
â€œOne can not live in fear ,
â€ �
he said , straight - faced .
â€œI get 10 to 12 death threats a day
â€
¦ and theyâ€ ™
re always the same .
â€˜I have a bullet with your name on it.â€ ™ â€˜I have a second bullet with Trumpâ€ ™ s name on it.â€ ™ â€œIâ€ ™ m not going to be deterred by some anonymous goon , who probably works for the mainstream media , making these calls.â€ �
â€˜This is not new for Americaâ€ ™ Fears for the city of Cleveland never became reality .
Despite widespread concerns that Trumpâ€ ™ s presence could lead to civil unrest , the thousands of police who descended on the city from all over the country made just 24 arrests .
Protests were small .
Journalists were often the largest cohort in the scrum .
In one bizarre moment on Wednesday , reporters were invited to a â€œflag burning protest at 4pmâ€ � on Prospect Avenue , close to the arena .
The flag was extinguished by firefighters and law enforcement after , police claimed , the man who set it on fire accidentally set fire to himself .
The philosopher and academic Cornel West made cameos at marches .
Asked what he feared the most , he was circumspect .
â€œThis is not new for America , â€ � he said .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve always had moments in which the politics of fear surface and you get that lethal combination : the rule of big money , the scapegoating of the most vulnerable â€ “ in this case itâ€ ™
s Muslims and Mexicans â€ “ and then militaristic policies abroad .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the makings of an indigenous American neo - fascism .
And we have to be very clear about that .
We donâ€

It doesnâ€ ™ t have magical powers .
Trump is not almighty.â€ �"
2016-07-25,"Bernie Sanders will on Monday urge supporters to consider how â€œfar
superiorâ€ �
Hillary Clinton is to the alternative , as Democrats seek to defuse outbreaks of tension at the start of their four - day national convention in Philadelphia .
In a crucial opening night address to delegates , the Vermont senator will appear alongside first lady Michelle Obama as the party seeks a display of unity in contrast with Republican infighting in Cleveland last week .
The star - studded convention got off to a rocky start on Sunday , when Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to announce her resignation on the eve of proceedings , following revelations of bias against Sanders during the long and bitter primary contest with Clinton .
But the Sanders campaign seemed keen to put the fight behind it over the weekend , despite the leaked emails which showed DNC staff sought to exploit his religious beliefs and Wasserman Schultz openly dismissing the notion that he could ever win .
â€œSanders will make it clear that Hillary Clinton is by far superior to Donald Trump on every major issue from economics and health care to education and the environment , â€ � said his spokesman Michael Briggs , in a statement before news of Wasserman Schultzâ€ ™ s resignation .
In a surprisingly muted response to the resignation , Sanders said she had made the right decision but paid tribute to her â€œyears of serviceâ€ � .
Despite tense relations between the campaigns during the primary fight , Sanders has swung rapidly behind team Clinton since a full - throated endorsement speech two weeks ago in New Hampshire , claiming he had moved the partyâ€ ™ s nominee to the left in a series of negotiations over policy .
â€œSanders will stress that the most progressive platform in Democratic party history includes agreements he reached with Clinton to dramatically expand healthcare access and to make public colleges tuition - free for students from families with annual incomes up to $ 125,000 a year , â€ � said Briggs , in a preview of the Monday night speech .
â€œIn his remarks , Sanders also plans to rip into Trump for siding with the Koch brothers and echoing fossil fuel industry claims that climate change is a hoax despite the virtually unanimous scientific consensus that the warming planet is causing devastating harm.â€ �
Nevertheless , some Sanders supporters were in an angry mood over the DNC email revelations and there were an ambivalent atmosphere , at best , reigned over some events in Philadelphia on Sunday evening .
Some activists planned demonstrations and sit - ins , in protest against the partyâ€ ™ s continued use of superdelegates in its nominating process .
But the Sanders campaign appeared satisfied with the outcome of a rules committee meeting on Saturday that proposed a commission to reduce the number of the controversial unelected delegates in primary contests .
â€œThis is a tremendous victory for Senator Sandersâ€ ™ fight to democratise the Democratic party and reform the Democratic nominating process , â€ � said Jeff Weaver , Sandersâ€ ™ campaign manager .
â€œWe were pleased to work with the Clinton campaign to enact this historic commission.â€ � Sanders will use his speech to flag ways in which supporters can continue pushing their agenda outside the mainstream .
â€œ[He ] will send a message to the convention and to the 13 million voters who supported him that they have begun a political revolution to transform America and that the revolution â€ “ Our Revolution â€ “ continues , â€ � said Briggs .
â€œTogether , â€ � Sanders will say , â€œwe continue the fight to create a government which represents all of us , and not just the 1 % â€ “ a government based on the principles of economic , social , racial and environmental justice.â€ �"
2016-07-26,"Oh , how weâ€ ™ ll miss her .
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s speech endorsing Hillary Clinton at the Democratic convention was , as Barack said , incredible .
But it was also a bittersweet fashion farewell .
Obama was a fashion natural eight years ago when she first came to the White House and she has stayed that way ever since â€ “ whether in McQueen or J Crew .
She has influenced a generation of women to wear bright cardigans and flared skirts , and made them aspire to have upper arms like hers .
She appeared on the cover of Vogue , and helped American designers such as Jason Wu and Thakoon sell out of any dress of theirs that she wore .
Last night continued on the theme .
To a room full of people waving purple â€œMichelleâ€ � signs ( surely the accessory of the year ? ) , Obama wore a Democrat - blue , capped - sleeve dress with that trademark flared skirt , designed by Project Runway winner , and PokÃ © mon avatar lookalike , Christian Siriano .
The earrings â€ “ spiky metal poles with pearls on the end
â€ “ were a nice touch .
But it was the hair that was the real triumph .
As a podium pro , Obama knows the dress is one thing â€ “ but itâ€ ™ s all really about the TV shot .
So , the hair .
Itâ€ ™ s wavier than usual , and it moves , unlike the pob that her friend Hillary prefers .
But , crucially , itâ€ ™ s nothing like that of first lady wannabe Melania Trump , whose hair resembles that of a Disney princess .
Obama is her own woman , and imitation is not in her makeup .
While Melaniaâ€ ™ s speech last week spookily resembled one that Michelle made in 2008 , the first lady isnâ€ ™ t the kind to get involved in any fallout .
Instead , she lets her hair do the job for her .
As she said last night : â€œWhen they go low , we go
highâ€
� .
And you canâ€
™ t get higher than hair that frames one of American fashionâ€ ™ s favourite faces .
Like we said , weâ€ ™ ll miss her ."
2016-07-26,"Here , at last , the profound , moving and devastating riposte to Donald Trump that many in America , and the world , had been waiting for .
And the antidote to the non - politician came from another non - politician â€
“ a mother .
Michelle Obama , the first black first lady in American history , gave a 15-minute address to the Democratic national convention that drew cheers , left some delegates openly weeping and did more than any governor or congressman to unite and fire up the party for Novemberâ€ ™ s presidential election .
It also added a chapter to the dynastic saga of the Obamas and the Clintons , coming four years after Bill Clinton gave an extraordinary speech to help Barack Obama get re - elected .
The former president was in the audience on Monday â€ “ caught on camera mouthing the word â€œwowâ€ � as Michelle Obama delivered one of the most passionate speeches of election year .
On Twitter , President Obama wrote : â€œIncredible speech by an incredible woman.â€ �
She made reference to a speech made by Hillary Clinton when she conceded defeat to Barack Obama in 2008 , saying : â€œWe werenâ€ ™ t able to shatter that highest , hardest glass ceiling this timeâ€ � after a bruising primary campaign .
Clinton â€œhas the grace and the guts to keep coming back and put cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling until she finally breaks through , lifting all of us with herâ€
� , the first lady told a packed arena in Philadelphia .
â€œThat is the story of this country .
The story that has brought me to this stage
tonight.â€ �
The election of the first African American president , and now potentially the first female president , were testament to the true America and a repudiation of all Trump stands for , she continued .
â€œThe story of generations of people who have felt the lash of bondage , the shame of servitude , the sting of segregation but who kept on striving and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves and I watch my daughters , two beautiful , intelligent black young women , playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.â€
�
Her voice cracking with emotion , she continued : â€œAnd because of Hillary Clinton , my daughters , and all our sons and daughters , now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.â€
�
The veteran civil rights activists John Lewis and Jesse Jackson were present .
Some delegates could be seen wiping away tears .
â€œSo
donâ€ ™ t let anyone ever tell you this country isnâ€ ™ t great , that somehow we need to make it great again , because this right now is the greatest country on earth , â€ � she said .
The elegant inversion of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign slogan prompted the crowd to erupt in cheers and wave regal purple placards bearing the name â€œMichelleâ€ � .
Obama went on : â€œAnd as my daughters prepare to set out into the world , I want a leader who is worthy of that truth , a leader who is worthy of my girlsâ€ ™ promise and all our kidsâ€ ™ promise .
A leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children.â€ �
After a rocky start to the convention , with supporters of Bernie Sanders rebelling over leaked emails , Obama urged Democrats to get to work and recapture the spirit of the past two elections when she was such a force for her husband .
â€œSo in this election we can not sit back and hope that everything works out for the best .
We can not afford to be tired or frustrated or cynical .
No , hear me : between now and November , we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago.â€ �
She permitted herself just a little wistful looking back in a speech that focused on how a president , like a parent , should set an example to children .
She told how during their time at the White House she and Barack saw their daughters â€œgrow from bubbly little girls into poised young womenâ€ � .
Recalling their first day at school , she said : â€œI will never forget that winter morning as we watched our girls , just seven and 10 years old , pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns .
And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window and the only thing I could think was : what have we done ?
â€œBecause at that moment I realised that our time in the White House would form the foundation of who they would become and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them .
That is what Barack
and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls for the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight .
â€œHow we urge them to ignore those who question their fatherâ€ ™ s citizenship or faith .
How we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country .
How we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully , you donâ€ ™ t stoop to their level .
No , our motto is : â€˜When they go low , we go high.â€ ™ â€
�
She spoke of the young black boy who looked up at the president and asked : â€œIs my hair like yours?â€ �
She said : â€œAnd make no mistake about it , this November when we go to the polls , that is what weâ€ ™ re deciding .
Not Democrat or Republican , not left or right , no â€ “ this election and every election is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives.â€ � The one person she trusts , she said , is Hillary Clinton .
â€œWhat I admire most about Hillary is that she never buckles under pressure .
She never takes the easy way out .
And Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life .
And when I think about the kind of president I want for my girls and all our children , thatâ€ ™ s what I want .
â€œI want someone with the proven strength to perserve .
Someone who knows this job and takes it seriously .
Someone who understands that the issues a president faces are not black and white and can not be boiled down to 140 characters.â€ �
That dig at Trumpâ€ ™ s tweeting produced another roar from the crowd .
â€œBecause when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command , you canâ€ ™ t make snap decisions .
You canâ€
™ t have a thin skin or tendency to lash out .
You need to be steady and measured and well informed.â€ �"
2016-07-26,"When Michelle Obama spoke before the Democratic national convention four years ago , her self - description as Americaâ€ ™ s â€œmom - in - chiefâ€ � made many white feminists squirm .
Those critiques glossed over race and in particular , that having a black woman in the White House â€ “ to say nothing of a whip - smart , strong , professionally accomplished black woman in the White House
â€ “ is nothing short of revolutionary .
But in her thunderbolt of a speech on Monday night , Michelle Obama didnâ€ ™ t let America forget where she came from , or how far the country had come , and how those storylines relate to one another in embracing her role as a mother and a leader .
â€œThat is the story of this country , â€ �
she said .
â€œThe is the story that has brought me to this stage tonight .
The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage , the shame of servitude , the sting of segregation , but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done â€ “ so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.â€
� â€˜It was spectacularâ€ ™
The speech alluded to Republican nominee Donald Trump , but it also drove home the profundity of all she personally had achieved just by virtue of standing where she was , there on the stage of the DNC encircled by star - shaped lights and thronged by thousands of adoring Americans .
â€œIt was spectacular , â€ � said Bob Shrum , a Democratic consultant and strategist .
â€œIt had the gift of all really great speeches : authenticity .
It wasnâ€ ™ t manufactured or pre - cooked .
It had a wonderful narrative line.â€
�
Obama did not mention Trump by name .
But Anita McBride , former chief - of - staff to first lady Laura Bush , described the address as unusually politically charged for first ladies in general and Obama in particular .
She said : â€œOf all the speeches Iâ€ ™ ve seen her do , this was by far the most political .
She has a clear view of how high the stakes are for the legacy of her husband .
â€œAfter eight years starting as a political novice , she has come full circle to a recognition of how important her voice is in the process .
Most importantly , sheâ€ ™ s a far cry from her first public statement [ in 2008 ] that got such attention â€ “ â€˜for the first time in my adult lifetime Iâ€ ™ m really proud of my countryâ€ ™ â€ “ to saying this â€˜is the greatest country on earthâ€ ™ .
Itâ€ ™ s been an education for her over eight years of what the country represents.â€ �
Asked how Obama would be remembered , McBride , now executive - in - residence at the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington , said : â€œSheâ€ ™ s taken advantage of the platform and put her personal stamp on it and followed her path while not compromising her personal life of family .
She found her voice and used it the way she felt best.â€ � â€˜Nurturer - in - chiefâ€ ™
In the rapturously received speech , Obama outlined parallels between parenting and the presidency .
Joshua Kendall , author of First Dads : Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama , said : â€œDonald Trump can show off his kids , and theyâ€ ™ re reasonably articulate , but the one thing thatâ€ ™ s really missing is a vision of the future and what weâ€ ™ re going to leave our children .
Thatâ€ ™ s what came through her speech : looking through the eyes of her daughters .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s very aware that kids see her as a mother
so she chooses her words carefully , drawing a contrast with Trump who uses language carelessly.â€ �
Kendall added :
â€œShe and Hillary Clinton have had a frosty relationship .
In 2008 it was kind of tough .
The subtext from this is that like many Americans sheâ€ ™ s really scared of Trump .
It was a very passionate speech and whatever conflicts sheâ€ ™ d had with Hillary , sheâ€ ™ s putting that in the past.â€ �
Back in 2008 , Kendall said , Obamaâ€ ™ s popularity was down at 22 % .
â€œPeople saw her as an â€˜angry black womanâ€ ™ .
But now sheâ€ ™ s carved out this turf as nurturer - in - chief .
People can see that her campaigns , like for childrenâ€ ™ s nutrition , really come from the heart.â€ �
Political legacy Michelle
Obamaâ€ ™ s
political legacy is not just a laundry list of everything she has spearheaded politically , from the â€œLetâ€ ™ s Move!â€ � campaign to her lectures on parenting , and how to raise happy and healthy kids .
Itâ€ ™ s something that cuts to the core of her identity .
She is only the fourth first lady ( after Pat Nixon , Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush ) to achieve a postgraduate degree , and back when she was a lawyer at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin
it was she who mentored Barack Obama , not the other way around .
When she talks about motherhood , it casts the flexibility to choose motherhood not as the role into which women are forced into over a career , but as the privilege it is .
But what was perhaps more impressive was the singularity with which she appreciates the role Clinton has carved out even as she has gone in a different direction : after she leaves the White House she will return to her personal life and career , eschewing politics .
But her speech on Monday night illustrated the new frontiers she might go on to pave for black women in power , and as such it underscored more than ever the loss of what could be politically .
Obama often gets compared to Clinton , who as first lady once said : â€œI am not some Tammy Wynette standing by my man , â€ � and , â€œI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas , but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.â€ �
But Michelle Obama has had a harder road to tread .
She is not just a fiercely accomplished , powerful woman remaking her identity as a woman in the White House
â€
“
she is all of that and African American .
She is also uniquely qualified to appreciate the struggles Clinton has had to deal with both during her time as first lady , and as a presidential candidate â€ “ and perhaps also to illustrate how surprising it is that a former first lady such as Clinton has gone through the fire of press and political scrutiny in that role and then chosen to run for president at all .
This article was amended on 27 July 2016 .
A previous version incorrectly cited Obama as the second first lady who had earned a postgraduate degree ; she was the fourth ."
2016-07-26,"Itâ€ ™ s hard to imagine two political conventions more dissimilar than the ones weâ€ ™
ve watched this past month .
The Democratic and Republican gatherings have played out as a study in differences : hope against fear ; love against hate .
And perhaps most starkly , theyâ€ ™ ve demonstrated a shocking contrast in gender politics â€ “ authenticity against Republican fakery .
On Monday night , the DNC stage hosted women talking about everything from pay equity to disability rights .
In Cleveland last week , Republican speakers promised they had womenâ€ ™ s best interests at heart while stoking the crowd to yell â€œlock her upâ€ � and â€œguiltyâ€ � in reference to Hillary Clinton , a move more reminiscent of a Salem witch trial than a 2016 political event .
In Philadelphia , people are sporting feminist shirts and carrying pro - labor signs ; shirts at the RNC said things like â€œHillary sucks but not like Monicaâ€ � .
The Democrats had Michelle Obama , bringing down the house in an epic speech on Monday where she tearfully noted , â€œbecause of Hillary Clinton , my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United Statesâ€ � .
The speakers brought out to demonstrate Trumpâ€ ™ s bonafides with women ?
His wife , who delivered a plagiarized speech ; and his daughter , who promised feminist policies her father does not support , wearing a dress probably made in China that she hawked on Twitter the same night .
The Trump campaignâ€ ™ s strategy with female voters is sort of like the new Lean Cuisine campaign that tells women they â€œare so much more than their looksâ€ � : itâ€ ™ s a nice sentiment until you remember that they want you to eat shit .
Even Donald Trump is starting to come around to the fact that he has a problem with women .
The same night he was being eviscerated by the first lady and Senator Elizabeth Warren , Trump addressed the gender gap that could undo his campaign , noting at North Carolina rally : â€œFifty per cent of our country is men , where I am doing very , very well .
Record - setting numbers , folks .
â€œLet me give you the bad news .
The women , I donâ€
™ t know what is going on with the women here.â€ �
Perhaps itâ€ ™ s that most of us donâ€ ™ t like being referred to as â€œpigsâ€ � or â€œdogsâ€ � , or having our menstrual cycles referenced in an insult .
( Women , so sensitive ! )
Never one to admit complete failure , however , Trump waxed delusional that Ivanka would halt the trend .
â€œShe is doing well with the women , â€ � he said .
â€œShe understands the real Donald , and I think we are going to do well with women.â€ �
While Ivanka is dangerous â€ “ as the New Yorkerâ€ ™ s Emily Nussbaum wrote , sheâ€ ™ s
â€œmade a conscious choice to deodorize the stink of her fatherâ€ ™ s misogynyâ€
�
â€ “
I believe most female voters will see through it .
The level of sexism on display by Republicans can not be hidden with platitudes or telegenic daughters .
Senator Cory Booker ended his speech on Monday with Maya Angelouâ€ ™ s poem
And Still I Rise .
Michelle Obama reminded us : â€œWhen
they go low , we go high.â€

We can look forward , and up â€ “ or we can wade in the muck with Trump .
For American women , thereâ€ ™ s really only one choice ."

2016-07-26,"A stormy opening night of the Democratic convention battered the Philadelphia arena on Monday as defiant Bernie Sanders supporters resisted attempts to persuade them to embrace Hillary Clinton .
Impassioned pleas for unity from a trio of Democratic women led by Michelle Obama raised hopes that the tumultuous first day of the convention may provide catharsis .
But despite a direct plea for calm from Sanders , many of his 1,846 delegates in the arena repeatedly jeered at mentions of the partyâ€ ™ s presumptive nominee for the first hour or two of the evening .
Only after the Vermont senator appeared on stage at the Wells Fargo Center to urge them that the decision to choose between Clinton and Trump was
â€œnot
even closeâ€ � did the rebellion that has divided the party for much of the year show signs that it had reached its peak .
â€œAny objective observer will conclude that â€ “ based on her ideas and her leadership â€ “
Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States , â€ � Sanders said , after three minutes of trying to quiet the floor .
Signs that a week of big - name Democratic speakers may help overcome the uncomfortable split also emerged when the first lady delivered a speech that brought the room to a standstill .
â€œBecause of Hillary Clinton our daughters , and all our sons and daughters , now take for granted that woman can be president of the United States , â€ � said Obama with evident emotion in her voice .
â€œIn this election we can not sit back and hope that everything works out for the best ...
Between now and November we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago , â€ � added the first lady .
â€œWe need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing Hillary Clinton as president of the United States of America .
Earlier , even a live rendition of Bridge over Troubled Water from Paul Simon , ripe with symbolism , could not disguise scenes of open revolt that proved far more vocal than expected and caused consternation on stage .
â€œCan I just say to the Bernie or Bust people : you are being ridiculous , â€ � said Sanders - supporting comedian Sarah Silverman as she called for unity and backed Clinton â€œwith gustoâ€ � .
â€œI will be respectful of you .
And I want you to be respectful of me , â€ � demanded Ohio congresswoman Marcia Fudge of the vocal Sanders supporters after she was repeatedly interrupted .
â€œWe are all Democrats and we need to act like it.â€
�
The tone of the evening was set when the religious invocation at the start of the session was interrupted by rounds of competitive chanting for different corners for the room : â€œBernie !
Bernie!â€ � drowned out by â€œHillary !
Hillary!â€ � and back again , as the pastor stood awkwardly on stage .
Congressman Elijah Cummings had his speech about the struggle of his family against racism interrupted by Sanders supporters protesting against trade deals .
Other speakers nervously approached applause lines not knowing whether they would be booed or cheered by the fractious crowd .
At times , there was a faint echo of the mood at the Republican convention last week , where every mention of Clintonâ€ ™ s name also prompted boos , albeit much louder and without the balancing cheers of her supporters .
During a two - minute pause while an official photograph was taken of the hall , a lone shout of â€œBernieâ€ � punctuated the awkward silence .
And as a violent thunder storm forced the evacuation of marquee tents outside the arena , party officials sent a warning to those outside :
A text to Sanders delegates was also sent to try to calm the storm inside .
â€œI
ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor
, â€ � said the text signed â€œâ€“Bernieâ€ � .
â€œIt is of utmost importance you explain this to your delegations.â€ �
Yet the anger was intensified by leaked emails suggesting bias against the Sanders campaign by party officials , and the Democratic National Committee began the night with an apology .
â€œThese comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process ,
â€ � it said .
â€œThe DNC does not â€ “ and will not â€ “ tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates .
Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments , and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.â€ �
The turning point came when Obama took to the stage , to a rapturous welcome from Democrats waving a sea of â€œMichelleâ€ � purple placards .
She called Clinton â€œthe president I want for my girlsâ€ � and someone â€œwho knows that the world is not black and white and easily boiled down to 140 charactersâ€ � .
â€œOnly one person I trust with the responsibility to be president and that is our friend Hillary Clinton , â€ � said Obama .
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren , a popular figure on the left , also focused her attention on defeating Trump in a calm speech that drew out what was at stake in Novemberâ€ ™ s election .
â€œFor me this choice is personal ; itâ€ ™ s about who we are as a people , â€ � said Warren , blasting Trump as â€œa man who thinks of nothing but himselfâ€ � .
In an extended call for Sanders supporters to join her on the journey toward backing Clinton , Silverman memorably described her Republican opponent as â€œcalling people names from his gold - encrusted sandbox because [ he ] was given money instead of human touchâ€ � .
Richard Trumka , president of the labor organisation the AFL - CIO , struck a similar note : â€œHe thinks heâ€ ™ s a tough guy .
Well Donald , I worked in the mines with tough guys .
I know tough guys , theyâ€ ™ re friends of mine .
And Donald , youâ€ ™ re no tough guy .
Youâ€ ™ re a bully .
But it fell to Sanders himself to list the ways in which Clintonâ€ ™ s policies increasingly matched the priorities of his supporters .
â€œI understand that many people here in this conventional hall and around the country are disappointed at the result ...
I think
itâ€ ™ s fair to say no one is more disappointed than I am , â€ � he said .
â€œOur revolution continues â€ ¦ Election days come and go but the struggle of the people to create a government that represents all of us and not just the one percent continues.â€ �
After he left the stage , an email to supporters announced he was creating a new organisation , called Our Revolution , which would â€œtransform American politics to make our political and economic systems once again responsive to the needs of working familiesâ€
� .
John Parker , a delegate from Florida , said he was not too concerned with the rancor within the party on the first day of its convention .
â€œDemocracy is not always pretty and people have the right to their opinion , â€ � he said .
â€œIt is what it is .
But look around , weâ€ ™ re all good now .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no choice
but Hillary Clinton .
We canâ€ ™ t take Donald Trump.â€ � Gary West , a Sanders supporter and delegate from Texas , said the email leaks revealed â€œa major bias in the partyâ€ � .
Having volunteered out of pocket to organize for Sanders across the country , West said he had not yet warmed up to Clinton and the controversy â€œmade it
more difficultâ€
� .
â€œWe
all suspected that these things were going on , the rigging of the primaries and the collusion between the DNC and the Hillary campaign , â€ �
West said .
â€œAnd we were all told we were crazy .
â€œNobody on stage has brought it up as an apology to Bernie , as an apology to the delegates.â€ �
â€œItâ€ ™ s an uphill battle for Hillary to get the support of the progressive movement , â€ � he added .
â€œShe has to prove herself.â€ �"
2016-07-27,"When Michelle Obama told the Democratic convention â€œI wake up every morning in a house that was built by slavesâ€ � , the backlash was as immediate and swift .
Some denied enslaved blacks
â€ “ our mutual ancestors
â€ “ built the White House or accused Obama of exaggerating .
Others expressed outrage that the first lady brought up slavery at all .
Fox News talk show host Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly took a kinder approach : he acknowledged this shameful history , but with a twist of the knife .
â€œSlaves that worked there were well fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government , which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802 .
However , the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor .
So , Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House , but there were others working as well , â€ � said Oâ€ ™ Reilly .
Forget that the enslaved workers were chattel , dehumanized property with no rights to person , self - determination or respect for their familial bonds : at least they were â€œwell fedâ€ �
, Oâ€ ™ Reilly seems to be saying .
But thatâ€ ™ s not the only troubling thing about his comments .
Oâ€ ™ Reilly was also suggesting that enslaved people had a balanced diet .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Food rations given to the enslaved were weekly , monthly or rarely , daily disbursements of nourishment , and they were often inadequate .
Enslaved life was always colloquial to its environs and discretionary to the personal choices of slave holders and the enslaved , thus â€œtypicalâ€ � rations for an enslaved person are not easily encapsulated by one account .
But records show they often failed to adequately meet their dietary and nutritional needs .
Even those working at the White House were badly mistreated .
Another first lady , Abigail Adams , herself described slaves at the residence as â€œhalf fed and destitute of clothingâ€ � .
In 1732 , William Hugh Grove recorded that enslaved workers were allotted a peck of corn per week .
( A peck is equal to the dry measure of two gallons . )
By the 19th century rations are described as being disbursed on a weekly basis .
Weekends and Mondays are frequently mentioned as the days when enslaved people were given their most meager allowances .
Age , gender and status all determined how much or how little food a person was allotted .
Harriet Jacobs remembered that in eastern North Carolina ; â€œ(t)hree pounds of meat , a peck of corn and perhaps a dozen herrings were allowed each man .
Women received a pound and a half of meat , a peck of corn and the same number of herring.â€ � While prized or skilled workers may have received more food , enslaved women , in turn , received reduced rations during pregnancy .
Elderly men too old to work might be completely denied an allowance ; and children were largely fed on mush that was filled with parasites and chips of wood .
For some , the myths about rations have fueled the notion that being enslaved was preferable to being white , poor , free and without support .
Frederick Law Olmstead , who worked as a journalist in the 1850s , stated : â€œI think the slaves generally ( no one denies there are exceptions ) have plenty to eat ; probably are fed better than the proletarian class of any other part of the world.â€ � Tobias Boudinot , who wrote about the conditions of slaves in the south , reported : â€œThe slaves down the Mississippi , are half - starved , the boats , when they stop at night , are constantly boarded by slaves , begging for something to eat.â€ ™ â€ ™ Reverend Horace Moulton , who also offered testimony about slavery , stated : â€œAs a general thing on the plantations , the slaves suffer extremely for the want of food.â€ ™ â€ ™
And Lillian Clarke of Virginia noted that her Aunt Lucinda received â€œone salt herrinâ€ ™ fish up on a shelf fer her to eat .
Mind you , dats all poâ€ ™ Cinda got fer all day long .
No ainâ€ ™ t giveno bread with hit .
She had to eate dat or nothinâ€ ™
.â€ �
As standardized as the ration system became , it was not a guaranteed source of food .
Rations were used , as any other necessity or reward during enslavement , as a means of control .
Rations did not always include protein .
As one planter said : â€œMeat , when given , is only by way of indulgence or favor.â€ ™ â€ ™ Certain foods were dangled before enslaved workers as treats rather than allowances which they had a right to by law or custom .
Let me challenge Bill Oâ€ ™ Reilly to eat like an enslaved black person for a week if he feels they were so â€œwell fedâ€ � .
Iâ€ ™ ve eaten the dry , crumbly half - burned ashcake , rusty salted meat and plain mush and hominy .
Even with molasses , theyâ€ ™ re far from good eating .
That diet damned generations to impaired health and assumptions that people of color needed less nourishment than others .
If Oâ€ ™ Reilly is so convinced that our ancestors were well fed he should let me whip him up a batch of trough mush to go with his southern fried crow ."
2016-07-28,"Like millions of Americans , on Monday Anna Gunn watched Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s endorsement of Hillary Clinton at the Democratic convention in complete awe .
â€œI made it up to my room just in time to see it
and I thought , â€˜Yes!â€ ™ â€ �
the actor says , her eyes shining .
Itâ€ ™ s the day after the first lady made her stirring plea to voters , and a happy , relaxed Gunn is seated in a posh hotel suite in New York .
â€œI was applauding and shouting back at the TV .
It was just
so exciting.â€
� Gunn has reason to be doubly revved - up .
Equity , her first film since completing five seasons on Breaking Bad , opens on Friday , months after premiering to enthusiastic reviews at the Sundance film festival .
Given Clintonâ€ ™ s recent historic clinching of the Democratic nomination , the timing for Gunn â€ “ an avid Clinton supporter
â€
“ couldnâ€
™ t be sweeter .
Equity , you see , is an anomaly in Hollywood : not only does it boast an all - female core creative team , including producer co - stars Sarah Megan Thomas and Alysia Reiner , screenwriter Amy Fox and director Meera Menon ; itâ€ ™ s also the first financial thriller in which women call the shots .
â€œI really did like The Wolf of Wall Street ,
â€ �
Gunn says , looking almost guilty .
â€œBut not seeing women represented in that world , it definitely had less resonance for me.â€ �
In Equity , Gunn plays Naomi Bishop , an ambitious senior investment banker .
At the outset of Menonâ€ ™ s sleek and arresting film , Bishop is reeling from a recent deal gone sour because her client had a last - minute change of heart .
Bishop asks why , and is told : â€œYou rub people the wrong way.â€
�
As a result , her snide male boss overlooks her for a deserved promotion , forcing her to latch on to the public offering of a new viral media privacy app that could help her score big , and put her back on top .
â€œFor women , no matter what career , what path you choose , itâ€ ™ s still an uphill battle to work your way up to these top leadership positions , â€ � Gunn says .
â€œAnd youâ€ ™ re much more closely scrutinized for everything â€ “ for things that men are not .
Now , because of this time [ weâ€ ™ re in ] , itâ€ ™ s a much broader conversation really .
We really wanted to not only talk about women in Wall Street but women in all positions of life.â€
�
The world of trading was somewhat familiar to Gunn before making the film , because her father once worked as a stockbroker .
To beef up on her finance knowledge , Gunn spent time shadowing a number of Wall Streetâ€ ™ s top female bosses , some of whom are executive producers on Equity .
Gunn , however , didnâ€ ™ t need much assistance to get inside the mind of a powerful woman battling institutional sexism in her profession .
Being a successful female actor in Hollywood , Gunn knows all too well what itâ€ ™ s like to be routinely put under the microscope .
After winning her first Emmy in 2013 for playing Skyler White ( she won a second for the showâ€ ™ s final season ) , the long - suffering wife to Bryan Cranstonâ€ ™ s drug kingpin husband Walter White , Gunn was barely given a moment to revel in her achievement , before having to talk about her weight in public after publications such as the Daily Mail , described her appearance as â€œworryingly thinâ€ � .
Talking to People magazine , Gunn explained that while filming the show , she was on medication that caused her to gain weight , and that sheâ€ ™ s simply back to her old , fitter self .
â€œI run around after two kids â€ “
and I do pilates ,
â€ �
she said at the time .
â€œI reached a career high , and all the questions were not about what I put into the world , but more about how I looked , â€ �
Gunn recalls .
â€œThat was disturbing .
I didnâ€ ™ t even want to really comment on it , because why should you ?
Why should I have to explain myself ?
But I got tired of being asked about it.â€
�
At the same time , Gunn also endured attacks from fans of Breaking Bad , incensed by the reluctance of her character to accept her husbandâ€ ™ s double - life cheerfully .
The online vitriol got so intense that Gunn felt compelled to pen an opinion column that ran in the New York Times , in which she directly addressed the troubling nature of Skylerâ€ ™ s unpopularity .
â€œMy character , to judge from the popularity of websites and Facebook pages devoted to hating her , has become a flash point for many peopleâ€ ™ s feelings about strong , non - submissive , ill - treated women , â€ � she wrote .
â€œBecause Skyler didnâ€ ™ t conform to a comfortable ideal of the archetypical female , she had become a kind of Rorschach test for society , a measure of our attitudes toward gender.â€ � Looking back on that troubling episode , Gunn shares that the â€œpersonal attacksâ€ � are what hurt the most .
â€œIt went from disliking the character , then hating the character , to then hating me .
It became about not liking the way I look :
Iâ€ ™ m either too thin ; Iâ€ ™ ve gained too much weight ; Iâ€ ™ m too tall ; they donâ€ ™ t like my face ; they donâ€ ™ t like my voice .
To be picked apart in that way is brutal .
â€œSkyler was demonized as a character â€ “
and I was demonized as the actor playing her , â€ �
she continues .
â€œItâ€ ™ s the same thing I think women in any profession who are rising to the top endure : they get scrutinized more closely and more harshly than men do.â€
�
Gunn says she sympathizes with Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones , who recently endured even harsher racist and misogynist abuse on Twitter .
â€œIt made me angry , â€ �
Gunn says of the slurs hurled at Jones .
â€œIt makes me sad .
Whoever has the time to be sitting down and writing all that stuff , I donâ€ ™ t know what kind of life that is , but it doesnâ€ ™ t seem like a great life to me.â€ � Jones didnâ€ ™ t cave in to her attackers by leaving Twitter ; nor did Gunn retreat from the spotlight , even after receiving what she describes as a death threat from a female Twitter user , who wrote : â€œI want to find out where Anna Gunn lives , so I can kill her.â€ � Gunn likens the gender - targeted venom to the some of the attacks made on Clinton by her opposers .
â€œI just have to silence the TV sometimes because itâ€ ™ s just overwhelming , â€ �
she says , sighing heavily .
For that reason , she says she found the experience of making Equity , a female - empowering project , â€œextraordinarily liberatingâ€
� .
â€œItâ€ ™ s important for women to continue to break through barriers in our industry , in politics , in Wall Street , â€ � she says .
â€œAnd now that I have two daughters , thatâ€ ™ s even more important .
â€œMy mom told me I could do anything I want , be anyone I want .
I believed it .
And so I want my daughters to as well.â€ �"

In an analysis of Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s speech at the Democratic national convention ( First ladyâ€ ™ s address puts seal on legacy , 27 July , page 8) , we said that she was â€œonly the second first lady

2016-08-04,"For the Democrats who could hardly wait to make a rightward pivot for the general election , Donald Trump created the perfect opportunity .
His wink - wink , nod - nod racist slogan , â€œMake America great again , â€ � together with his apocalyptic dirge of a convention , left exposed and unguarded a flank that is usually the Republicansâ€ ™ specialty .
So at the Democratsâ€ ™ convention , from Michelle Obama the first night to the nominee herself on the last , Democrats saw their opening and hit back hard : America is extremely great already
â€ “ the greatest , really â€ “ and anyone who says otherwise should be run out of town .
In between patriot politicians , soldiers and law - enforcement officers provided a chorus of the my - country - right - or - wrong tune that their professions instill in them .

“ started wishing they could be With Her .
The trouble is , the Democratic strategistsâ€ ™ brilliant stratagem comes at the cost of a contradiction .
What Bernie Sanders called the partyâ€ ™ s â€œmost progressive platform in historyâ€ � , holds as its highest ambitions â€ “ accessible healthcare , affordable higher education , basic gun restrictions
â€ “ a collection of reasonable policy proposals that most other wealthy nations accomplished decades ago .
If we have such a hard time making even modest progress on such things , what makes this country so great ?
What does â€œgreatâ€ � even mean ?
Its political usefulness depends on its vagueness .
But since the word is in this case on loan from the Trump campaign , we can at least take some hints from there .
For Trump , America will be great again when it is responsible to no one , when it can bend neighbors to its will through magic feats of negotiation , when its military abandons all remaining ethical standards , when it defers its problems to a messianic strongman .
Greatness is power , control and license to dominate .
Democrats , by adopting Trumpâ€ ™ s language , canâ€ ™ t help adopting some of his narcissism as well .
The Democratic convention partly succeeded in doing otherwise , presenting as evidence of greatness examples of our popular music , our capacity for self - deprecating humor and our ethnic diversity by which we are â€œstronger together.â€ �
Yet in the festivitiesâ€ ™ wake , the most lingering controversy has consisted of Democrats and Republicans alike uniting against Trump in the conviction that even a baldly ad hominem political salvo , by virtue of being from the father of a fallen serviceman , is beyond reproach .
Being great means being unable to question the purveyors of our power .
One of the oddities of the Bernie Sanders campaign , which so much of the Democratic convention sought to tame , was its willingness to speak as if other countriesâ€ ™ experience could be worth learning from .
If nearly free , universal healthcare and college are so impossibly utopian , why do so many others nations take them for granted ?
This is a line of reasoning that worked well with a younger generation that is better traveled , more networked and less inclined to see national borders as holy and fixed realities .
They realize , for instance , that they have more in common with young people in other countries than they do with their own leaders , or anyone elseâ€ ™ s .
Recall , also ,
President Obamaâ€ ™ s earnest attempts to cite the highly relevant and applicable case of Australia in explaining the wisdom of stricter gun laws in even a gun - friendly country .
No dice .
The necessary prerequisite for any idea gaining traction in US political culture is that it can be framed in such a way as to make us feel great ( again ? ) .
People in other countries , awkwardly enough , are watching our political spectacles as well .
Perhaps they can laugh it all off more easily , but only to the extent that the show doesnâ€ ™ t instill terror for how this countryâ€ ™ s greatness will be inflicted on them next .
Even the word â€œAmericaâ€ � , the thing that is allegedly so great , disregards the existence of other countries in North and South America , as people during my travels in those countries have always made sure to remind me .
There is a lot about the land and people bound together in the United States of America to like , to love and to live by .
I am grateful to have come of age on solo road trips across its weird and wonderful contours , to have imbibed certain shared mythologies , regardless of their truth value , and to have the privilege of trying to make this place better .
Thankfully the Democratsâ€ ™ own platform largely belies their cynical rhetoric .
Perhaps someday , in a society more just and accountable , we can overcome our fears and insecurities enough to notice that there is worthwhile greatness in others than ourselves ."
2016-08-09,"Can the self - proclaimed greatest country in the world really be all that great if
itâ€ ™ s never even won an Olympic medal in handball ?
Two weeks ago at the Democratic National Convention , tens of millions heard the party spend four nights espousing the United States as the best of the best , citing freedom and opportunity for all .
â€œDonâ€
™ t let anyone ever tell you that this country is not great , â€ � Michelle Obama said in her widely - praised speech .
â€œBecause
this right now is the greatest country on Earth.â€ � Fine .
But Mrs First Lady , with all due respect , wouldnâ€ ™ t a truly superior nation have won a medal in rhythmic gymnastics by now ?
The week before the Democrats pro - America rally , Donald Trump and the Republicans dumped all over the nation , but vowed to restore the United Statesâ€ ™ place in the world .
â€œMake
America
Great Again , â€ � Trump and his supporters say over and over and over again .
But when is this great era of Americaâ€ ™ s past ?
If you think greatness is defined by badminton glory â€ “ and thatâ€ ™ s undoubtedly a way one could define it â€ “ then the sad fact is that America has never been great , as no American man or woman has ever climbed the Olympic podium to receive a badminton medal .
Perhaps the fear and xenophobia that drives so many Trump fans came from watching the American badminton duo of Howard Bach and Tony Gunawan get routed in the group state of the 2012 Games by South Korea , Malaysia and Japan , failing to win a single set .
Perhaps Trump voters want a wall because a net has given them no protection .
If only Americaâ€ ™ s humiliation was limited to handball , rhythmic gymnastics and badminton .
But the land that insists it is a superpower has also never medaled in table tennis or trampoline .
That list of shame could add golf and rugby sevens after Rio , where those sports are being contested for the first time in an Olympics .
The US has failed at the Winter Olympics , too , having never medaled in the biathlon .
America canâ€ ™ t medal in a sport that combines shooting and skiing ?
So many in the snowy Rocky Mountain states demand their second amendment rights , yet theyâ€ ™ ve somehow not once been able to use their right to bear arms to put a medal in their hands .
Sad .
Further discussion of the USAâ€ ™ s Winter Olympics disgrace can wait two years for Pyeongchang , however .
For now , the country has its hands full ( and medal display cases empty ) with the Summer Olympics and the five - possibly - going - on - seven sports in which the former British colony repeatedly fails .
Optimists will point out that the US won the first gold medal of these Rio Games .
And that the US was tied for the most medals at the end of day one .
Or theyâ€ ™ ll say that the US has nearly 2,500 summer medals , and just under 1,000 of those gold , in its Games history .
They may mention that the US is the heavy favorite to lead the medal count at the end of Rio .
But tell all those facts to the young American boy or girl who dreams of one day winning trampoline gold and see where it gets you .
Who are to be their role models ?
Team USA trampoline participant Nicole Ahsinger of San Diego , California ?
Come on .
She was merely a non - competing alternate at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics .
But America , for all its many flaws â€ “ from zero trampoline medals to economic inequality to zero biathlon medals
â€ “ never gives up , even when its back is against the rhythmic gymnastics mat .
So in order to form a more perfect union , the US must set its sights on ending its medals drought .
Call it the new â€œmoon shotâ€ � mission , but launched from a trampoline .
If Cleveland can win a sports championship , surely the United States can manage bronze in ping pong .
First , the US must funnel its best athletes into its worst sports .
What else can Serena Williams prove in tennis ?
She has accomplished everything .
Everything but become a two - sport star .
After Rio she has one more Olympics left in her 30s .
Letâ€ ™ s get a badminton racket in her hand and watch her bring glory to the stars and stripes at Tokyo 2020 .
Venus , a little older than Serena and less mobile , will be tasked with ending the US goose egg in table tennis .
Americaâ€ ™ s most famous table tennis player currently is Forrest Gump and everyone â€ “ everyone outside of Philadelphia ,
at least â€ “ knows it is embarrassing to champion a fictional person as a sports hero .
Venus could change that .
Handball can be addressed with a resource the United States has more than any other nation : mobile quarterbacks .
Imagine a team featuring the likes of Cam Newton , Russell Wilson , Andrew Luck , Ben Roethlisberger , Marcus Mariota and Eli Manning .
( Sure , Manning is not particularly mobile , but his facial expressions deserve the exposure of the international stage . )
American football is not in the Olympics , making handball the only chance NFL stars have of hanging a gold medal in their trophy cases .
Then clinch the sale by telling them that moving to competitive handball will make them free of Roger Goodell .
( Leave out the fact that the IOC is even worse . )
Team USAâ€ ™ s first trampoline medal can be won with well - known , but under - utilized members of the American sporting community : the mascots .
Long before trampoline became an Olympic event in 2000 , American mascots were using trampolines to delight and amaze NBA fans .
They are the best of the best and deserve the chance to show the world .
What a moment it would be to see the Phoenix Suns Gorilla leap atop the medal stand , a gold medal nestled deep within his synthetic chest fur .
And what a way to honor the memory of the great Harambe .
That leaves rhythmic gymnastics .
This one has no silver bullet .
There are no American sports that easily translate to tumbling around with ribbons , hoops and balls , save what you might see from an especially clumsy team equipment manager .
Russell Westbrook isnâ€ ™ t capable of dominating the the ball quite this much in Oklahoma City .
To achieve success in rhythmic gymnastics , America must build a national program that can grow and nurture the sport until it produces athletes that are the best in the world .
It could take decades .
If the US menâ€ ™ s soccer program is any indication , this approach might take centuries .
But it will happen .
America will one day win a rhythmic gymnastics medal and truly earn its place above all other nations .
Best of all , it will have fancy ribbons in hand to celebrate ."
2016-08-27,"Tired of rapping with Michelle Obama and showing off to Adele , sycophantic churner of chat James Corden is back in London and kindly picking up his mate from Waterloo .

2016-09-16,"Michelle Obama used her debut appearance on the campaign trail on Friday to cast Donald Trump as unprepared to succeed her husband in the White House , saying : â€œBeing president isnâ€ ™ t anything like reality TV.â€ � Speaking at George Mason University in Virginia , Obama described the election as a choice between â€œone of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become presidentâ€ � and someone who did not â€œtake the job
seriouslyâ€
� .
Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husbandâ€ ™ s administration , she argued that if the past eight years were a guide , Trump was neither prepared nor qualified for the presidency .
â€œA candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office â€
“ itâ€ ™ s the opposite , â€ � Obama told a crowd of mostly students and young people .
â€œBecause the minute that individual takes that oath , they are under the hottest , harshest light there
is.â€
�
The first lady also made reference to her well - received speech at the Democratic national convention in July , saying of Republican campaign tactics , â€œwhen they go low , we go
highâ€
� .
Obama recalled the 2008 campaign that propelled her husband to the White House .
â€œThen there were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and up through this very day whether my husband was even born in this country , â€ � she said , again alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name .
Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism , a conspiracy theory that claims President Obama was born in Kenya and is thus not qualified to be president , using the issue to help propel his political ambitions .
On Friday morning , facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters , Trump said for the first time that Barack Obama was in fact born on US soil .
Michelle Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton , especially among young voters .
New polling shows that millennials , disappointed by their options for president , have increasingly turned toward third - party candidates .
The first ladyâ€ ™ s appearance on a college campus in Virginia , a battleground state , was part of a broad push by the Clinton campaign to win back some millennial voters who have strayed .
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , the challenger whose strong primary challenge to Clinton was powered by young people and students , will campaign for the Democratic nominee .
â€œElections arenâ€ ™ t just about who votes but who doesnâ€ ™ t vote , â€ � Obama said on Friday , imploring young people in the crowd to support Clinton and to fight the urge to â€œhide under the bedâ€ � , to avoid becoming â€œtired or turned offâ€ � by the election .
She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired by Sanders .
â€œI hear folks saying they donâ€ ™ t feel inspired in this election , â€ � Obama said .
â€œWell let me tell you , I disagree .
I am inspired .
Because for eight years , Iâ€ ™ ve had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job , and here is what I absolutely know for sure .
â€œListen to this
: right now we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.â€ �
Above all , the event was a testament to Obamaâ€ ™ s enduring popularity .
â€œIt is so hard to believe that it is less than two months until election and that my family is almost at the end of term , â€ � she said .
The crowd broke into a raucous round of chanting , demanding â€œfour more yearsâ€ � .
â€œNo , â€ � Obama said , waving her hand .
The chant continued .
â€œNo!â€
�
â€œI promise you ,
â€ �
she said , â€œBarack
and I will continue to work for you for the rest of our lives.â€ �"
2016-09-18,"Michelle Obama earned the nickname â€œthe Closerâ€ � during her husbandâ€ ™ s 2008 campaign for her ability to win over wavering voters .
After two successful presidential campaigns , the first lady is being called upon to perform one last trick : elect his successor .
On Friday , the ever - popular first lady stepped on to the campaign trail to rally support for a predecessor and one - time rival , Hillary Clinton , whose victory in November is crucial to preserving the presidentâ€ ™ s legacy .
Students and supporters had waited hours to hear the first lady speak .
â€œThe presidency doesnâ€ ™ t change who you are , it reveals who you are ,
â€ �
Obama told the crowd of mostly young people at George Mason University .
â€œThe same thing is true of a presidential campaign .
â€œSo if a candidate is erratic and threatening , if a candidate traffics in prejudice , fears , and lies on the trail , if a candidate has no clear plans to implement their goals , if they disrespect their fellow citizens â€ “ including folks whoâ€ ™ ve made extraordinary sacrifices for our country â€ “ let me tell you : that is who they are .
That is the kind of president they will be.â€
� Obama is known for being averse to politics , and she has managed to remain supremely popular , especially among young people , in large part thanks to her ability to stay above the fray .
But the 2016 presidential race is deeply personal .
Donald Trump , the Republican nominee , for years promoted the false â€œbirtherâ€ � movement that questioned Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s origins â€ “ to the extent that he claimed to have sent investigators to Hawaii to search for his birth certificate in 2011 .
On Friday , Trump conceded that the president was born in the United States .
Trumpâ€ ™ s
careful cultivation of the lie , and his refusal to denounce it even as recently as Thursday , has crippled the Republicanâ€ ™ s standing with black voters , who widely view the birther campaign as an attempt to delegitimize the first black president .
Public opinion polls show that he draws a historically low support from black voters , with some surveys showing 0 % among black voters .
In her speech at the Democratic national convention , an aspirational and devastating riposte to Trumpâ€ ™ s vision for America , Michelle Obama remembered her daughtersâ€ ™ first day of school , and the lurching feeling when she realized that they would grow up in the White House .
â€œI realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become , and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them , â€ �
she said .
â€œThat is what Barack
and I think about every day as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight â€ “ how we urge them to ignore those who question their fatherâ€ ™ s citizenship or faith .
â€œHow we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country .
How we explain that when someone is cruel , or acts like a bully , you donâ€ ™ t stoop to their level â€ “
no , our motto is , when they go low , we go high.â€
�
Obamaâ€ ™ s
swan song speech was quickly elevated to the pantheon of historic political addresses .
Some delegates in the audience wept freely as the first lady spoke .
On the campaign trail , Clinton voiced appreciation for her powerful and most popular ally .
â€œAs
Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention , when we go to the polls this November , the real choice isnâ€ ™ t between Democrat or Republican , â€ �
Clinton said in Greensboro , North Carolina , on Thursday .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.â€
�
Though they share a goal on the campaign trail , Obama and Clinton could not have had more opposite ambitions in their roles as first lady .
â€œMichelle Obama canâ€ ™ t wait to leave the White House and Hillary Clinton
canâ€
™ t wait to get back in , â€ � said Kate Andersen Brower , journalist and author of First Women .
Unlike Clinton , who broke with many of the traditions and norms expected of a presidential spouse , including the unprecedented step of setting up an office in the West Wing , Obama has remained firmly in the East Wing .
She has devoted herself to supporting military families , fighting childhood obesity and advocating for girlsâ€ ™ education .
Under Obamaâ€ ™ s leadership , the White House launched the Letâ€ ™ s Move campaign to reduce child obesity and the Let Girls Learn initiative , to improve access to education for girls around the world .
She has also cemented herself as a cultural icon , with a reach far beyond the realm of politics .
Last week , she poured boxed wine for customers at a drug store with talk show host Ellen Degeneres .
Before the DNC , she sang carpool karaoke with comedian James Corden .
And the Obamas posed for an intimate portrait published on the cover of the October issue of Essence , a lifestyle magazine directed toward black women .
â€œI think when it comes to black kids , it means something for them to have spent most of their life seeing the family in the White House look like them , â€ � she told the magazine .
â€œIt matters .
All the future work that Barack talked about , I think over these last few years , weâ€ ™ ve kind of knocked the ceiling of limitation off the roofs of many young kids ; imaginations of whatâ€ ™ s possible for them.â€ �
At the university on Friday , the graduate student Katie Boyette echoed the first ladyâ€ ™ s sentiments , and recalled watching Obamaâ€ ™ s inauguration , â€œwalking on to the stage with his family , and they just looked so beautifulâ€ � .
â€œI was only 15 at the time , but seeing them , as an African American , â€ � she said , â€œit was a pivotal moment for me .
I started to cry .
It was a moment Iâ€ ™ ll never forget.â€ �
Before the event , Obama reflected with former first lady Laura Bush at the National Archives , in Washington DC , about the power of their platform .
â€œThe fact is you really have a podium , really , always .
People still listen to Barbara Bush , donâ€ ™ t
you think ?
I certainly do , â€ � Bush said , referring to her mother - in - law , the wife of George HW Bush .
Obama said she would continue to the work she started in the White House : â€œI canâ€ ™ t imagine that Iâ€ ™ ll leave here and really kick my feet up and say , â€˜Oh , well , good luck with that.â€ ™ â€ �
After Obamaâ€ ™ s rousing DNC speech , speculation â€ “ most wishful â€ “ mounted that it might launch a national political career , as such a speech did for her husband in 2004 .
But Obama has swatted away any speculation that she might seek office one day and earlier this year , the president lowered the chances of a double act to zero .
â€œThere are three things that are certain in life , â€ � the president said during a town hall in Louisiana .
â€œDeath , taxes and Michelle is not running for president.â€ �
And yet some still hold out hope .
â€œFour more years!â€ � the college crowd chanted on Friday when Obama said her familyâ€ ™ s time in the White House had nearly come to an end .
â€œNo!â€
�
Obama said , waving her hand and laughing .
â€œNo , â€ � she tried again , more emphatically .
After the event , Rachelle Campbell didnâ€ ™ t hesitate for a moment .
â€œOh , I would love for her to run for president one day ,
â€ �
she said excitedly .
â€œMichelle for president!â€ �
As she closed out her speech to the students , Obama spun one of Clintonâ€ ™ s slogans , â€œIâ€ ™ m with herâ€ � , into her own .
â€œI urge you
â€ “
I beg of you â€
“ to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves , which candidate really has the experience , the maturity , and the demeanor to handle the job I just described to you?â€
�
she asked the crowd .
â€œI need your help to do that as well .
Are you with me?â€ �"
2016-09-24,"â€œThis is the story of this countryâ€ ¦ generations of people who felt the lash of bondage , the shame of servitude , the sting of segregation , but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today , I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.â€ �
The most powerful speech of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia earlier this summer was made not by the partyâ€ ™ s presidential nominee , nor the president , but by the first lady , Michelle Obama .
Her words remind us of the extent to which the slave trade â€ “ and the terrible legacy it left the United States â€ “ is part of that countryâ€ ™ s national consciousness .
Not so in Britain .
Our political leaders hardly make reference to the dominant role this country played in the global slave trade .
British slave traders generated immense spoils by transporting 5.5 million African slaves to its Caribbean colonies , forcing them to work in terrible conditions on plantations in Jamaica , Barbados and beyond .
A new database launched last week by academics at UCL , cataloguing the details of 20,000 British slave owners , illustrates the extent to which the historic wealth of the slave trade extends its reach into modern Britain : in the Georgian architecture of cities such as London , Liverpool and Bristol ; in businesses such as Greene King and the Royal and Sun Alliance ; in the several recent or serving MPs with slave owners in their family history .
The extraction of this wealth came at terrible cost .
Slaves were shackled and transported in appalling conditions aboard disease - ridden ships .
Those who survived the journey were often treated with unspeakable physical and emotional cruelty .
Countless lives were lost : by the time of abolition , the African slave population in the Caribbean stood at a small fraction of the total number of slaves who had arrived over the years .
The scars are still visible across Britainâ€ ™ s former colonies .
After abolition , former slaves were left in abject poverty , a legacy from which no country has recovered .
In Jamaica , Britainâ€ ™ s largest slave colony , 80 % of its population lacked functional literacy at the time it was granted independence in 1962 .
In Britain , the wealth extracted from African slaves has continued to contribute to our society flourishing long after slavery was abolished .
But unlike in the United States , the horrors of British slavery unfolded on plantations on distant shores and its legacies affect populations Britain has long washed its hands of .
So our role in this dark period has been all to easy to obscure .
Tony Blair was the first British prime minister to address this grim period of Britainâ€ ™ s past , but only after decades of political leaders ignoring it altogether .
When David Cameron visited Jamaica last year , he called for Jamaica to â€œmove onâ€
� from its past and spoke positively of Britainâ€ ™ s role in abolition .
He neither acknowledged Britainâ€ ™ s role as a perpetrator , nor the fact that even the act of abolition was itself a terrible injustice .
While British slave owners were paid huge amounts of compensation by the government â€ “ between Â£16bn and Â£17bn in todayâ€ ™ s prices ; 40 % of government expenditure in 1834 â€ “ their slaves were forced to work for a further four years without pay in order to further compensate their owners .
Britainâ€ ™ s
true role in the slave trade must feature more prominently in our collective history and our national consciousness : not so that our political leaders should constantly apologise for Britainâ€ ™ s past wrongs , or that contemporary descendants of slave traders should bear an ongoing burden of shame , but so that we view Britainâ€ ™ s role in the modern world in the context of our history .
Our international responsibilities can not be understood devoid of that context .
They are derived not just from the deep injustice of the structural inequalities that divide global north from global south but from the fact that in the past Britain has helped create those very inequalities .
Few would disagree with this principle in abstract .
Yet it is rarely played out in concrete debates about international aid , migration and refugee policy .
Too often , Britain is portrayed as a benevolent benefactor rather than a country with a burden of debt to some of the worldâ€ ™ s poorest nations .
We can not understand our role in the world using only a sanitised version of our history ."
2016-09-29,"Gymnast Simone Biles stood tall at the White House on Thursday â€ “ though not quite as tall as first lady Michelle Obama .
The 19-year - old Olympian found herself being playfully used as an arm rest by 5 ft 11 in Michelle at a ceremony honouring the 2016 US summer Olympic and Paralympic teams .
â€œOnly one American woman has ever won gold on the vault , â€ �
Barack Obama said .
â€œOnly one American has won four golds in gymnastics in a single Games .
That would be this young lady , Simone Biles.â€

The event was attended by relatives of Jesse Owens and Americaâ€ ™ s 17 other black athletes from the 1936 Olympics for the acknowledgement they , unlike their white counterparts , did not receive from Franklin Roosevelt 80 years ago .
Sprinter Allyson Felix , the only female track and field athlete to win six golds , told reporters afterwards :
â€œItâ€ ™ s been just so moving , so inspiring .
Weâ€ ™ re just honored to be able to share this moment with them.â€ � Tommie Smith and John Carlos , who raised gloved fists on the podium at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968 in what they called â€œa human rights saluteâ€
� , were also present .
Felix reflected : â€œWeâ€ ™ re inspired by what they did .
It was a peaceful protest and it brought so much attention .
â€œEspecially with everything thatâ€ ™ s happening now , as athletes we do have a voice and we want to show that change should happen , so we want to use your voice for that in a peaceful way because we still are so proud to represent this country.â€ � Obama praised the diversity of the 2016 Olympic team , which ranked first in the medal table with 46 golds .
Simone Manuel had become the only African American woman to win a swimming gold , he noted .
â€œImagine what it means for a young girl or a young boy who sees somebody who looks like them doing something and being the best at what they do , â€ � he said .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s no kid in America who canâ€
™ t look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere.â€ �
The president also noted that the athletes are â€œall very good - looking , just exuding health .
Like everybodyâ€ ™ s teeth are really white and their eyes are really shiny.â€

2016-09-30,"When Michelle Obama gets on the microphone , the world listens .
Her speech at the Democratic convention in July was judged by many to be the best of the week , reaching the emotional and inspirational heights that Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s presidential campaign has sometimes struggled to achieve .
Her turn on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden this summer , singing BeyoncÃ © and Stevie Wonder , has , at the time of writing , been watched nearly 44 m times on YouTube .
But for most of the eight years she has lived in the White House , there has been no microphone .
Obama is seen a good deal more than she is heard , so how she looks has taken on disproportionate significance .
Her image sets the emotional tone for the White House , becoming a symbolic ideal for other women , for other wives and mothers .
Every new hairstyle has been combed as a cipher for a change in the national mood ; every dress evaluated for the values it embodies .
There is no denying that this feels retrograde for a woman of Obamaâ€ ™ s intellect and background .
There is a call - and - response rhythm to this kind of coverage , with every fashion feature on her wardrobe triggering an opinion piece raging at this unbefitting treatment of a high - achieving lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton .
Yet , contrary to what many expected , Obama herself has played the role in a notably traditional key .
In contrast to her predecessor Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s battles over public healthcare
, she has adopted relatively uncontroversial causes : family nutrition , childhood health and girlsâ€ ™ education , issues that sit neatly around her self - proclaimed identity as Mom - In - Chief .
While these causes are , perhaps , more culturally loaded than they first appear â€ “ the campaign against childhood obesity has a more progressive slant when you take into account the fact that the issue disproportionately affects low - income and black families
â€ “ they have frustrated those who hoped for a more radical rewrite .
Obama has followed in the first lady tradition by putting fashion centre stage of her public persona .
On the night of her husbandâ€ ™ s election to office in 2008 , she wore a Narciso Rodriguez dress in a fiery red - and - black speckle pattern .
The fashion press reported the pattern as â€œdÃ © gradÃ
©
â€ � , while others went with â€œlava lampâ€ � .
To wear a very eye - catching dress at such a moment made it clear that Obama had no intention of allowing the White House to cramp her style .
She had broken an unspoken rule of modern culture , which holds that a serious person must have a sober wardrobe .
Until Obama , the iconography of the first lady revolved around Jackie Kennedy .
There had been glamorous presidentâ€ ™ s wives since â€ “ Nancy Reagan with her Dynasty gowns , say â€ “ but the notion of first lady chic remained almost synonymous with that sunny yet streamlined early-1960s style that is for ever Camelot .
Half a century later , wives of heads of state all over the world are still measured against Kennedy , but the comparison is sharpest in the White House .
Where her predecessors had tiptoed around the edges of Kennedy style , as if anxious to avoid the comparison , Obama has embraced many elements of the look and made them her own .
The sleeveless shift dresses she favours are a direct link , as are the outsize strings of pearls , often framed by wide - set necklines .
Even elements of the two womenâ€ ™ s hair and makeup are similar , despite their physical difference : note the full , stiffly curled hair and the penchant for false eyelashes .
The Kennedys represent an American ideal that is classy and democratic , and Obama has used fashion to ally herself and her husband with that same message .
The visual connection with the Kennedys draws the eye to the obvious difference : their skin colour .
Itâ€ ™ s a way of emphasising the historic nature of the Obamas as the first black family to live in the White House , while at the same time telling the world that this family , and this administration , is traditionally American .
At the first inauguration , in January 2009 , Obama wore a dress and matching coat in an unusual shade of pale greenish yellow that observers struggled to put a name to .
( The Guardian went with lemongrass . )
Her elder daughter , Malia , wore a purple coat with black scarf and gloves ; her younger daughter , Sasha , a pink coat with orange scarf and gloves .
The colours made for a dazzlingly confident family portrait .
Other elements of the look were formal , even traditional ( the first ladyâ€ ™ s sleek leather gloves , the two girls in their cosy , buttoned - up coats ) , but the colours were modern , the cheery brights of a holiday snap rather than the sepia tones of an official photograph .
That was the day Obama took first lady chic and made it modern and down - to - earth .
Later that year , on a state visit to Britain , she wore an Azzedine AlaÃ¯a cardigan to meet the Queen .
â€œYou donâ€
™ t go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater , â€ � sniffed the designer Oscar de la Renta â€
“
but he was already out of touch .
Obamaâ€ ™ s approachable , real - life wardrobe had struck a chord .
Without wearing a single outfit that could be considered truly rule - breaking , Obama has rewritten the playbook .
In early 2009 , when the first ladyâ€ ™ s official website was launched featuring a photo of her wearing a sleeveless dress , the Chicago Tribune reported that it had received hundreds of online responses , many of which criticised the look for its inappropriate informality .
Since then , the trend for the sleeveless dress as grownup but fun , dressy but comfortable â€ “ fuelled , in huge part , by Obama herself â€ “ has grown and grown .
She made it OK for a middle - aged woman to wear a dress showcasing arms that speak of serious push - ups , as well as those signature warm Mobama hugs .
In that sense , she represents a generation growing old in a different way .
Many of her fashion choices
â€ “ from the girlish , bridal Jason Wu gown she wore for the first inauguration to the full skirts she often favours for daytime
â€ “ are looks that not long ago would have been thought too young , too cute , for a woman in her 50s to carry off .
Instead , she has captured something of the confidence of a generation who will not accept that they should slip into the shadows .
Obama has consistently played down any interest in fashion .
â€œItâ€ ™ s so hard .
Iâ€ ™ m kind of a tomboy - jock at heart , but I like to look nice , â€ �
she told ABC news in 2008 .
But she has steered her image carefully nonetheless .
When she appeared on the cover of American Vogue in March 2009 , she did it on condition that the choice of dress was hers , without input from the Vogue team , and that she used her own hair and makeup stylists , something the magazine had not agreed to before .
Even the designer and film - maker Tom Ford , renowned for his control freak tendencies , alluded to Obamaâ€ ™ s strictures in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter , when he related the experience of dressing the first lady for an audience with the Queen in 2011 .
â€œDoing something like that is easy because youâ€ ™ re dictated to , â€ � he said .
â€œâ€˜She needs to wear that colour , she has to have gloves , she doesnâ€ ™ t like this
, she doesnâ€ ™ t like that.â€ ™ Itâ€ ™ s pretty simple.â€ � Simple , but strategic .
Obamaâ€ ™ s mastery of fashion is less about the clothes than about a modern womanâ€ ™ s innate understanding that visual messaging is a crucial part of public life .
As she told American InStyle magazine last month , â€œWe can fool ourselves into thinking that everybody is still watching the evening news , but I live with Generation Z , and I know that their habits , the way they take in information , are so differentâ€
¦ Weâ€ ™ ve got to meet our constituents where they are , and theyâ€ ™ re on Snapchat.â€ � Obama has been on Snapchat since June .
Her opening post ?
A selfie and the emoji of the girl in pink , her hand raised .
This is a woman who doesnâ€ ™ t need a microphone to get her words across ."
2016-10-13,"Michelle Obama on Thursday delivered a devastating rebuke to Donald Trump , calling past comments and alleged misconduct by the Republican nominee â€œcruelâ€ � , â€œfrighteningâ€ � and beyond the â€œbasic standards of human decencyâ€ � .
As Trump prepared to respond to a wave of women who had stepped forward in the previous 24 hours to accuse him of sexual misconduct , the first lady took the stage in Manchester , New Hampshire , at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton .
â€œI
canâ€ ™ t believe that Iâ€ ™ m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women , â€ � Obama said , her voice trembling as she addressed a university gymnasium filled with several hundred people .
â€œAnd
I canâ€
™ t stop thinking about this .
It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldnâ€ ™ t have predicted.â€ �
In visceral terms and with a heightened sense of urgency , Obama painted the choice for president as a moral imperative .
â€œThis is not normal , this is not politics as usual ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œThis is disgraceful , it is intolerable , and it doesnâ€
™
t matter what party you belong to . ...
No woman deserves to be treated this way
â€ “
none of us deserves this kind of abuse.â€ �
The Trump campaign was rocked last week by the publication of a live microphone recording from 2005 , in which Trump boasted in explicit terms about kissing and groping women without their consent .
The nominee dismissed the tape as â€œlocker room banterâ€ � and denied during the second presidential debate on Sunday that he had ever done what he boasted of .
Obama did not accept his response .
â€œThis wasnâ€ ™ t just a lewd conversation , â€ �
she said .
â€œThis wasnâ€ ™ t just locker room banter .
This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women , using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV .
â€œTo make matters worse , it now seems very clear that this isnâ€ ™ t an isolated incident .
Itâ€ ™ s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.â€ �
The New Hampshire rally was
Obamaâ€ ™ s sixth campaign event for Clinton .
The ever - popular first lady has proved to be one of the Democratic candidateâ€ ™ s most powerful surrogates , after delivering a smash - hit speech at the party convention in July .
On Thursday , Obama told the crowd she had planned to deliver her normal campaign speech , but said it would have been â€œdishonest and disingenuousâ€ � to do so , as she felt compelled to address Trumpâ€ ™ s remarks on women .
She never referred to Trump by name , instead calling him â€œher opponentâ€ � or simply the Republican â€œcandidateâ€ � .
She did not turn to discuss Clinton until halfway through her remarks .
Obama implored voters repulsed by the coarseness of the presidential campaign to consider the impact a Trump presidency would have on young girls and boys â€ “ and the message it would send to the world .
â€œIf you vote for someone other than Hillary , or you donâ€ ™ t vote , you are helping to elect her opponent ,
â€ � she said .
â€œImagine how that will feel.â€
�
She continued : â€œWe need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country .
We need you to roll up your sleeves , we need to get to work.â€ �
Later on Thursday , Clinton tweeted her praise , saying she was â€œin
aweâ€ � of
Obamaâ€ ™ s words ."
2016-10-13,"In a campaign speech in Florida , Donald Trump said the many women who stepped forward to accuse him of sexual assault in the past 24 hours are â€œhorrible , horrible liarsâ€ � making â€œviciousâ€ � allegations .
Trump allegations arenâ€ ™ t new In an impassioned speech that electrified her audience , Michelle Obama said â€œenough is enoughâ€ � regarding misogyny from Trump , who she said had engaged in â€œsexually predatory behaviorâ€ � .

2016-10-13,"Nigerian defence officials say they believe more schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram will be released in the coming weeks , raising the prospect of a swift end to one of the most high - profile kidnappings perpetrated by a terrorist group in recent years .
Twenty - one of the 276 schoolgirls taken from their hostel in a government boarding school in the town of Chibok by the Islamic militant group in April 2014 , were freed early on Thursday morning in a deal brokered by international mediators .
The kidnapping of the girls led to the global campaign # BringBackOurGirls , with public figures including the US first lady , Michelle Obama , taking part .
Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls , many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped .
Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks .
About 190 girls from Chibok are still held by the militants .
Fifty - seven fled within hours of being captured , and in May this year , one girl was found and rescued in an area close to Boko Haram strongholds .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re not authorised to release the details of how the girls were retrieved yet , but the operation to retrieve the girls is ongoing .
We are optimistic we will retrieve more of the Chibok girls from Boko Haram very soon , in the coming weeks , â€ �
Gen Rabe Abubakar , a defence ministry spokesman , said .
The freed girls were being transported from the north - east of the country , where Boko Haram has its remaining strongholds , to Abuja , the capital , on Thursday afternoon .
A team of social workers , doctors and counsellors were awaiting their arrival .
Many were reported to have babies with them , born in captivity .
Earlier in the day , a spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari , the Nigerian president , confirmed that 21 of the missing girls were in the custody of the department of state services .
â€œThe release of the girls , in a limited number , is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and Boko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government .
The negotiations will continue , â€ �
he said .
â€œThe president welcomes the release of the girls but cautioned Nigerians to be mindful of the fact that more than 30,000 fellow citizens were killed via terrorism.â€ �
The information minister , Lai Mohammed , denied reports that four Boko Haram prisoners were exchanged for the girls .
â€œThis is not a swap , but a release , â€ � Mohammed said .
The release will be a boost to Buhari , who vowed to crush Boko Haram within a year when he took power in May 2015 .
While government forces have taken back large amounts of territory from the group , it has remained active , killing hundreds of people in suicide bombings .
The # BringBackOurGirls campaign group said Thursdayâ€ ™ s release was a â€œwonderful developmentâ€ � that confirmed â€œwhat we have always known about the capacity of our government to rescue our # ChibokGirlsâ€ � .
Prof Emma Shehu , a leader of the group , said she was relieved by the news .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve been castigated by the past government , by the military and by the hardliners in the current administration for continuing with our advocacy and protests for the kidnapped girls .
Theyâ€ ™ ve treated us as though we were mad but weâ€ ™ re happy that this is partly a vindication of our insanity .
For the parents itâ€ ™ s raised their hopes , â€ � Shehu said .
The Chibok girls are among thousands of adults and children who have been abducted by Boko Haram during its seven - year insurgency .
The group is short of manpower and has turned to abductions as recruitment has slowed .
Negotiations with Nigerian government representatives for the release of the schoolgirls have been complicated by splits within Boko Haram .
The movement has fractured into two , possibly three factions over the issue of links with Islamic State .
Isis , of which the Nigerian group is still theoretically an affiliate , announced last month that Abu Musab al - Barnawi was the new leader of Boko Haram , replacing the erratic Abubakar Shekau .
The decision may have been prompted by Shekauâ€ ™ s use of female suicide bombers and targeting of Muslims .
Shekau has continued to claim to be in control of the group .
A video released of the Chibok girls in August seemed to have come from his camp somewhere in the sprawling Sambisa forest , in Borno .
It showed about 50 of the girls and included a demand for the release of imprisoned militants in exchange for them .
A suicide bomber in Maiduguri , the capital of Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram , killed eight people on Wednesday .
British and US special forces have been assisting the Nigerian military in their campaign against Boko Haram .
Support by soldiers from the neighbouring countries of Niger , Cameroon and Chad â€
“ was critical in pushing back the extremists , experts said .
The previous Nigerian government , under Goodluck Jonathan , conducted high - level negotiations before realising it was talking to impostors .
Buhariâ€ ™ s government was previously thought to be attempting to rescue the girls .
The army had launched airstrikes on Boko Haram strongholds and claimed to have wounded or even killed Shekau but he subsequently appeared , apparently unhurt , in a video .
Abubakar said on Thursday : â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t matter whether he is dead or alive , the main thing is the group is being defeated.â€ �
â€œThe Boko Haram of today is not the one of years ago .
They can only bomb locations now because they hold no territory and we are defeating them at each stage .
The government is negotiating with Boko Haram , including prisoner swaps , but at the same time we the military are degrading them where we can .
That is proving an effective way of defeating this group.â€ �
Elizabeth Donnelly , an expert at Londonâ€ ™ s Chatham House , said the release suggested â€œa potential opening with the insurgentsâ€ � .
â€œThere is still a question of why only this number [ of girls has been released ] but it shows that negotiations are possible and that is really important in trying to shift the nature of the conflict , â€ �
Donnelly said .
In the past year , the Nigerian army has retaken towns and villages in the north - east controlled by Boko Haram , and has freed hundreds of women and children held captive .
However , many survivors face rejection or are stigmatised when they return to their families or are settled in refugee camps .
In many areas of northern Nigeria , millions of victims of malnutrition , neglect and in some cases famine are surfacing , threatening a vast humanitarian crisis .
Aid workers say hundreds of thousands of children are chronically malnourished ."

â€œWe further urge the international community to continue to support our governmentâ€ ™ s effort to rescue all other abducted Nigerians , so that parents , the Chibok community , the nation and the world can finally put an end to this nightmare once and for all.â€

2016-10-14,"Michelle Obama delivered a masterly rebuke of years of racist and sexist attacks in a speech on Thursday about the man who has capitalized on them for more than a year .
With searing rhetoric , the nationâ€ ™ s first African American first lady described the pain and humiliation women have endured for generations in a speech denouncing Donald Trump , whose political beginnings are rooted in the conspiracy around her husbandâ€ ™ s citizenship and whose path to the White House is blocked only by a candidate who would be the first female president .
Obama shamed the Republican nominee for his â€œsexually predatory behaviorâ€ � after a wave of women came forward with sexual harassment and assault allegations , following the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump boasts about groping and kissing women without their consent .
â€œI listen to all of this
and I feel it so personally , and Iâ€ ™ m sure that many of you do too , particularly the women , â€ � she said ,
her voice trembling with emotion as she addressed a gymnasium full of people in New Hampshire .
â€œThe shameful comments about our bodies .
The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect .
The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman .
It is cruel .
Itâ€ ™ s frightening .
And the truth is , it hurts.â€ �
In her 25-minute speech , Obama did not mention black women or women of color
but she didnâ€ ™ t have to .
That it was her â€ “ a black mother of two daughters she raised in a â€œhouse built by slavesâ€ � â€ “ who delivered the definitive rebuke to Trump and his treatment of women registered the point that all women are vulnerable to sexism , sexual harassment and assault .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t stop thinking about this , â€ � Obama said .
â€œIt has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldnâ€ ™ t have predicted .
So while Iâ€ ™ d love nothing more than to pretend like this isnâ€ ™ t happening , and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech , it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all
just a bad dream.â€ � More than a year before the tapeâ€ ™ s release and the allegations
, Trump lost his temper over a debate question about his history of making offensive and lewd remarks about women .
In the months between , Trump attacked a grieving Gold Star mother , who is Muslim , and body - shamed a Latina beauty queen who revealed that he had called her â€œMiss Piggyâ€ � .
All the while Republicans largely stood by his side .
As many have noted , Republicans and the media only drew the line on his behavior in response to instances of impropriety â€ “ and later allegations of sexual assault â€ “ against white women .
The Obamas , as articulated often by her husband , have long believed that the â€œarc of the moral universeâ€ � bends away from people like Donald Trump , but the 2016 election has surely tested their faith .
At turns , itâ€ ™ s hard not to see 2016 and the rise of Donald Trump as a referendum on history , a sharp rebuke to the candidacy of the first black president and a blockade against the first woman president .
In so many ways , he is everything Obama and Clinton are not .
â€œIt reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how , back in their day , the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office , and even though they worked so hard , jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves , it was never enough , â€ � Obama said .
â€œWe thought all of that was ancient history ,
didnâ€ ™ t we â€ ¦
but here we are , in 2016 , and weâ€ ™ re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail.â€
�
Michelle Obama , who has carefully cultivated an everywoman appeal , is indisputably Clintonâ€ ™ s most powerful â€ “ and popular â€ “ surrogate on the trail .
And perhaps only Trump could have brought together the former rivals and first ladies
â€ “ one who can not wait to leave the White House and the other who can not wait to get back in .
During the second presidential debate on Sunday , Trump tried to step between the women .
He falsely claimed that Obama had run â€œsome of the most vicious commercials Iâ€ ™ ve ever
seenâ€
� against Clinton during the 2008 Democratic primary .
â€œYou talk about friend ?
Go back and take a look at those commercials , â€ �
Trump said .
But to anyone paying attention , the attack on their friendship felt empty .
Obamaâ€ ™ s
New Hampshire speech was her sixth campaign event for Clinton in a month .
In battleground states across the country , Obama has aggressively made the case for Clinton in a way
no one else â€ “
not even Bill Clinton â€ “ has been able to crystallize .
â€œIn Hillary , we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service , someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting ,
â€ �
Obama said on Thursday .
â€œShe is an outstanding mother .
She has raised a phenomenal young woman .
She is a loving , loyal wife .
Sheâ€ ™ s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days .
â€œAnd if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton , we would be so proud .
We would be proud.â€ �"
2016-10-14,"Michelle Obama may have done the seemingly impossible .
She may just have rescued the US elections from the grotesque and demeaning mire into which they have descended .
She did something even more remarkable , and just as badly needed .
With the touch of a poet , her speech last night shamed the tat and the tawdry of populism and held out the possibility of something better .
She lent her extraordinary ability to say what people are feeling to every English - speaking woman in the world .
Nominally , she spoke for Hillary Clinton at a run - of - the - mill political rally .
In fact she made a passionate and clear - eyed appeal for decency and respect in public life .
Clintonâ€ ™ s Republican rival Donald Trump did not get a single mention , but he was in every word of every sentence .
It was one of the most sustained put - downs in modern democratic politics .
There have been many protests this week as Trumpâ€ ™ s lewd bragging about sexually assaulting women finally registered in the Republican scale of shame .
His campaign is floundering , at last .
Obamaâ€ ™ s contribution was not to add to the direct attacks on him .
Instead , on behalf of American voters â€ “ women and girls , of course , but men and boys too â€ “ she gave a victimâ€ ™ s statement .
The Trump tape , she said , had shaken her to her core .
â€œI feel it so personally â€ “ and Iâ€ ™ m sure you do too â€ “ particularly the women .
( I love that â€œparticularlyâ€ � ) .
â€œThe shameful comments about our bodies .
â€œThe disrespect of our ambitions and our intellect .
â€œThe belief that you can do anything you want to a woman .
â€œItâ€ ™ s
cruel â€ “ itâ€ ™ s frightening â€ “ and the truth is it hurts.â€ �
This hits home in a way that a direct attack on the insolent , impervious figure of Trump himself does not .
It appeals to people of every political persuasion .
She pitches this attack as defence .
A defence of humanity .
She brings to it her extraordinary mix of talents .
She can find words that make pictures .
She brings passion and intellectual clarity .
She has an actorâ€ ™ s sense of timing .
This morning she seems the worldâ€ ™ s most complete leader .
On Monday , in the second debate between the presidential candidates , Clinton quoted Obama : â€œWhen they go low , we go high.â€ �
Great advice
â€ “ a nightmare to follow .
The first lady has found a way of doing it that avoids the elephant traps and the little snares .
She has a graceful humanity .
She looks normal .
Glamorous , but in a normal kind of way .
She sounds like a normal person , she uses the language of normal people and she expresses normal hopes and fears .
As a wife and a mother , an American , a black woman â€ “ all these parts that make her who she is
â€ “
she has a fine capacity to say what millions of women and men have been thinking since the Trump tape first came to light last weekend .
It was hardly a surprise to hear her speak so well .
Her speech introducing Clinton as the Democrat nominee to the partyâ€ ™ s convention in July revealed the exceptional talent that she has been nurturing over these past eight years .
That was the speech where she reminded her listeners what could be done by collective effort .
She talked of the â€œlash of bondageâ€ � and the â€œsting of servitudeâ€ � and then described waking up every morning in the White House , â€œa house built by slavesâ€ � and watching her daughters , â€œtwo beautiful intelligent young black womenâ€
� playing with their dogs :
â€œand because of Hillary Clinton , my daughters , and all our sons and daughters , take for granted that a woman can be president of the United Statesâ€ � .
Last night she talked of women doing what women have always done â€œjust trying to get through it â€ ¦ trying to pretend this doesnâ€ ™ t really bother usâ€ � .
She ended : â€œThis is not normal , this is not politics as usual â€ ¦ this has got to stop right now.â€ �
When she speaks , Michelle Obama doesnâ€ ™ t stop being the wife of the president , but she transcends it .
She becomes the personification of the best of her country .
Perhaps there is something in the first lady status , in politics but not of it , that uniquely privileges the holder of the office .
Who in Britain can make that nonpartisan appeal to ordinary human decency ?
Last night she spoke for everyone who thinks politics can be better than this ."
2016-10-14,"My goodness !
You guys are fired up !
Well , let me just say hello everyone .
I am so thrilled to be here with you all today in New Hampshire .
This is like home to me , and this day â€ “ thank you for a beautiful fall day .
You just ordered this day up for me , didnâ€ ™ t you ?
Itâ€ ™ s great to be here .
Let me start by thanking your fabulous governor , your next US senator , Maggie Hassan .
I want to thank her for that lovely introduction .
I also want to recognize your Congresswoman Annie McKlane Kuster , whoâ€ ™ s a dear , dear friend .
Your soon - to - be congresswoman once again , Carol Shea Porter â€ “ all of whom have been just terrific friends to us .
And your executive council and candidate for governor , Colin Van Ostern .
And , of course , thanks to all of you for taking the time to be here today .
Audience member :
We love you !
Thanks so much .
Thatâ€ ™ s very sweet of you .
I love you guys too .
I canâ€
™ t believe itâ€ ™ s just a few weeks before election day , as we come together to support the next president and vice - president of the United States , Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine !
And New Hampshire is going to be important , as always .
So Iâ€ ™ m going to get a little serious here , because I think we can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election .
This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because it has been a week of profound contrast .
See , on Tuesday , at the White House , we celebrated the International Day of the Girl and Let Girls Learn , and it was a wonderful celebration .
It was the last event that Iâ€ ™ m going to be doing as first lady for Let Girls Learn .
And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet , young girls here in the US and all around the world .
And we talked about their hopes and their dreams .
We talked about their aspirations .
See , because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school , jeopardizing their personal safety , their freedom , risking the rejection of their families and communities .
So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how valuable and precious they are .
I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls .
And I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect , and I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them , and that they should make their voices heard in the world .
And I walked away feeling so inspired , just like Iâ€ ™ m inspired by all the young people here â€ “
and I was so uplifted by these girls .
That was Tuesday .
And now , here I am , out on the campaign trail in an election where we have consistently been hearing hurtful , hateful language about women â€ “ language that has been painful for so many of us , not just as women , but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring , respectful adults , and as citizens who think that our nationâ€ ™ s leaders should meet basic standards of human decency .
The fact is that in this election , we have a candidate for president of the United States who , over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign , has said things about women that are so shocking , so demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today .
And last week , we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women .
And I canâ€
™ t believe that Iâ€ ™ m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women .
And I have to tell you that I canâ€
™ t stop thinking about this .
It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldnâ€ ™ t have predicted .
So while Iâ€ ™ d love nothing more than to pretend like this isnâ€ ™ t happening , and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech , it would be dishonest and disingenuous of me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream .
This is not something that we can ignore .
Itâ€ ™ s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season .
Because this was not just
a
â€œlewd conversationâ€
� .
This wasnâ€ ™ t just locker - room banter .
This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior , and actually bragging about kissing and groping women , using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV .
And to make matters worse , it now seems very clear that this isnâ€ ™ t an isolated incident .
Itâ€ ™ s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life .
And I have to tell you that I listen to all of this
and I feel it so personally , and Iâ€ ™ m sure that many of you do too , particularly the women .
The shameful comments about our bodies .
The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect .
The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman .
It is cruel .
Itâ€ ™ s frightening .
And the truth is , it hurts .
It hurts .
Itâ€ ™ s like that sick , sinking feeling you get when youâ€ ™ re walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body .
Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close , stares a little too long , and makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin .
Itâ€ ™ s that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them , or forced himself on them and theyâ€ ™
ve said no
but he didnâ€
™ t listen
â€ “ something that we know happens on college campuses and countless other places every single day .
It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how , back in their day , the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office , and even though they worked so hard , jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves , it was never enough .
We thought all of that was ancient history , didnâ€ ™ t
we ?
And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect , but here we are in 2016 and weâ€ ™ re hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail .
We are drowning in it .
And all of us are doing what women have always done : weâ€ ™ re trying to keep our heads above water , just trying to get through it , trying to pretend like
this doesnâ€ ™ t really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how much it hurts makes us as women look weak .
Maybe weâ€ ™ re afraid to be that vulnerable .
Maybe weâ€ ™ ve grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet , because weâ€ ™ ve seen that people often wonâ€ ™ t take our word over his .
Or maybe we donâ€
™ t want to believe that there are still people out there who think so little of us as women .
Too many are treating this as just another dayâ€ ™ s headline , as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted , as if this is normal , just politics as usual .
But , New Hampshire , be clear : this is not normal .
This is not politics as usual .
This is disgraceful .
It is intolerable .
And it doesnâ€
™
t matter what party you belong to â€ “ Democrat , Republican , independent â€ “
no woman deserves to be treated this way .
None of us deserves this kind of abuse .
And I know itâ€ ™ s a campaign , but this isnâ€ ™ t about politics .
Itâ€ ™ s about basic human decency .
Itâ€ ™ s about right and wrong .
And we simply can not endure this , or expose our children to this
any â€ “ not for another minute , and let alone for four years .
Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough .
This has got to stop right now .
Because consider this : if all of this is painful to us as grown women , what do you think this is doing to our children ?
What message are our little girls hearing about who they should look like , how they should act ?
What lessons are they learning about their value as professionals , as human beings , about their dreams and aspirations ?
And how is this affecting men and boys in this country ?
Because I can tell you that the men in my life do not talk about women like this .
And I know that my family is not unusual .
And to dismiss this as everyday locker - room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere .
The men that you and I know donâ€ ™ t treat women this way .
They are loving fathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language about women .
They are husbands and brothers and sons who donâ€
™ t tolerate women being treated and demeaned and disrespected .
And like us , these men are worried about the impact this election is having on our boys who are looking for role models of what it means to be a man .
In fact , someone recently told me a story about their six - year - old son who one day was watching the news â€ “ they were watching the news together .
And the little boy , out of the blue , said , â€œI think Hillary Clinton will be president.â€
�
And his mom said , â€œWell , why do you say that?â€
�
And this little six - year - old said , â€œBecause the other guy called someone a piggy and , â€ � he said , â€œYou can not be president if you call someone a piggy.â€
�
So even a six - year - old knows better .
A six - year - old knows that this is not how adults behave .
This is not how decent human beings behave .
And this is certainly not how someone who wants to be president of the United States behaves .
Because letâ€ ™ s be very clear : strong men â€ “ men who are truly role models
â€ “ donâ€ ™ t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful .
People who are truly strong lift others up .
People who are truly powerful bring others together .
And that is what we need in our next president .
We need someone who is a uniting force in this country .
We need someone who will heal the wounds that divide us , someone who truly cares about us and our children , someone with strength and compassion to lead this country forward .
And let me tell you , Iâ€ ™ m here today because I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president .
See , we know that Hillary is the right person for the job because weâ€ ™ ve seen her character and commitment not just in this campaign , but over the course of her entire life .
The fact is that Hillary embodies so many of the values that we try so hard to teach our young people .
We tell our young people â€œwork hard in school , get a good educationâ€ � .
We encourage them to use that education to help others â€ “ which is exactly what Hillary did with her college and law degrees , advocating for kids with disabilities , fighting for childrenâ€ ™ s healthcare as first lady , affordable childcare in the Senate .
We teach our kids the value of being a team player , which is what Hillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed to work for her opponent as our secretary of state
â€ “ earning sky - high approval ratings serving her country once again .
We also teach our kids that you donâ€
™ t take shortcuts in life , and you strive for meaningful success in whatever job you do .
Well , Hillary has been a lawyer , a law professor , first lady of Arkansas , first lady of the United States , a US senator , secretary of state .
And she has been successful in every role , gaining more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime
â€ “ more than Barack , more than Bill .
And , yes , she happens to be a woman .
And finally , we teach our kids that when you hit challenges in life , you donâ€ ™ t give up , you stick with it .
Well , during her four years as secretary of state alone , Hillary has faced her share of challenges .
Sheâ€ ™ s traveled to 112 countries , negotiated a ceasefire , a peace agreement , a release of dissidents .
She spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee .
We know that when things get tough , Hillary doesnâ€ ™ t complain .
She doesnâ€ ™ t blame others .
She doesnâ€ ™ t abandon ship for something easier .
No , Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life .
So in Hillary , we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service , someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting .
She is an outstanding mother .
She has raised a phenomenal young woman .
She is a loving , loyal wife .
Sheâ€ ™ s a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days .
And if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton , we would be so proud .
We would be proud .
And regardless of who her opponent might be , no one could be more qualified for this job than Hillary â€ “ no one .
And in this election , if we turn away from her , if we just stand by and allow her opponent to be elected , then what are we teaching our children about the values they should hold , about the kind of life they should lead ?
What are we saying ?
In our hearts , we all know that if we let Hillaryâ€ ™ s opponent win this election , then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything theyâ€ ™ re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK .
We are validating it .
We are endorsing it .
Weâ€ ™ re telling our sons that itâ€ ™ s OK to humiliate women .
Weâ€ ™ re telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated .
Weâ€ ™
re telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country .
Is that what we want for our children ?
And remember , we wonâ€ ™ t just be setting a bad example for our kids , but for our entire world .
Because for so long , America has been a model for countries across the globe , pushing them to educate their girls , insisting that they give more rights to their women .
But if we have a president who routinely degrades women , who brags about sexually assaulting women , then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world ?
How can we continue to be a beacon of freedom and justice and human dignity ?
Well , fortunately , New Hampshire , hereâ€ ™ s the beauty : we have everything we need to stop this madness .
You see , while our mothers and grandmothers were often powerless to change their circumstances , today , we as women have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this election .
We have knowledge .
We have a voice .
We have a vote .
And on November the 8th , we as women , we as Americans , we as decent human beings can come together and declare that enough is enough , and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior in this country .
Remember this : in 2012 , womenâ€ ™ s votes were the difference between Barack winning and losing in key swing states , including right here in New Hampshire .
So for anyone who might be thinking that your one vote doesnâ€ ™ t really matter , or that one person canâ€ ™ t really make a difference , consider this : back in 2012 , Barack won New Hampshire by about 40,000 votes , which sounds like a lot .
But when you break that number down , the difference between winning and losing this state was only 66 votes per precinct .
Just take that in .
If 66 people in each precinct had gone the other way , Barack would have lost .
So each of you right here today could help swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves , your families , and your friends and neighbors out to vote .
You can do it right here .
But you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillaryâ€ ™ s opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration .
Because hereâ€ ™ s the truth : either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected president this year .
And if you vote for someone other than Hillary , or if you donâ€ ™ t vote at all , then you are helping to elect her opponent .
And just think about how you will feel if that happens .
Imagine waking up on November the 9th and looking into the eyes of your daughter or son , or looking into your own eyes as you stare into the mirror .
Imagine how youâ€ ™ ll feel if you stayed home , or if you didnâ€ ™ t do everything possible to elect Hillary .
We simply can not let that happen .
We can not allow ourselves to be so disgusted that we just shut off the TV and walk away .
And we canâ€
™ t just sit around wringing our hands .
Now , we need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country .
We need you to roll up your sleeves .
We need to get to work .
Because remember this : When they go low , we go â€ ¦ Audience :
High !
Yes , we do .
And voting ourselves is a great start , but we also have to step up and start organizing .
So we need you to make calls and knock on doors and get folks to the polls on election day and sign up to volunteer with one of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today just waiting for you to step up .
And , young people and not - so - young people , get on social media .
Share your own story of why this election matters , why it should matter for all people of conscience in this country .
There is so much at stake in this election .
See , the choice you make November 8 could determine whether we have a president who treats people with respect â€ “ or not .
A president who will fight for kids , for good schools , for good jobs for our families â€ “ or not .
A president who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our bodies and our health â€ “ or not .
Thatâ€ ™ s just a little bit of whatâ€ ™ s at stake .
So we can not afford to be tired or turned off .
And we can not afford to stay home on election day .
Because on November the 8th , we have the power to show our children that Americaâ€ ™ s greatness comes from recognizing the innate dignity and worth of all our people .
On November the 8th , we can show our children that this country is big enough to have a place for us all â€ “ men and women , folks of every background and walk of life â€ “ and that each of us is a precious part of this great American story , and we are always stronger together .
On November 8 , we can show our children that here in America , we reject hatred and fear and in difficult times , we donâ€
™ t discard our highest ideals .
No , we rise up to meet them .
We rise up to perfect our union .
We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty .
We rise up to embody the values of equality and opportunity and sacrifice that have always made this country the greatest nation on Earth .
That is who we are .
And donâ€ ™ t ever let anyone tell you differently .
Hope is important .
Hope is important for our young people .
And we deserve a president who can see those truths in us â€ “ a president who can bring us together and bring out the very best in us .
Hillary Clinton will be that president .
So for the next 26 days , we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election .
I know Iâ€ ™ m going to be doing it .
Are you with me ?
Are you all with me ?
You ready to roll up your sleeves ?
Get to work knocking on doors ?
All right , letâ€ ™ s get to work .
Thank you all .
God bless .

2016-10-14,"Clinton raises prospect of landslide victory Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election , exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser on Thursday to help her â€œhave the kind of victory we needâ€ � to serve as a â€œrebukeâ€ � to Donald Trump .
â€œEverything we care about is at risk , â€ � she said .
â€œIf you can help me to have the kind of victory we need , that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry and bullying weâ€ ™ ve seen , then together , together we will build the future that all of us , particularly the children of our country , deserve to have.â€ �
Clinton says landslide would be rebuke to Trumpâ€ ™ s â€˜bigotry and bullyingâ€ ™ Michelle Obama :
Trump beyond â€˜basic standards of human decencyâ€ ™ The first lady delivered a devastating rebuke to Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s boundless vulgarity , describing his recent remarks about groping women without their consent as â€œdisgracefulâ€ � and â€œintolerableâ€ � .
â€œI
canâ€ ™ t believe that Iâ€ ™ m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women , â€ � Obama said , as she addressed several hundred people in Manchester , New Hampshire .
â€œAnd

Trump blames sexual assault claims on Clinton - media collusion
Meanwhile , Republican nominee Donald Trump scrambled to dig himself out from an avalanche of fresh abuse allegations on Thursday after a series of women came forward to dispute his claim that his comments about sexual assault were only empty boasts .
The Republican nominee called his many accusers â€œhorrible , horrible liarsâ€ � .
Many of nearly a dozen women who have now come forward said they were moved to speak after Trump claimed his boasts about sexually assaulting women were â€œwords not actionâ€ � .

s disenfranchised voters
Nearly six million Americans can not vote due to felony disenfranchisement .
In Florida , 1.7 million people are disenfranchised , or 10.4 % of the stateâ€ ™ s total population .
The Guardian takes a closer look at the consequences , and the fight to regain the right to vote , in the midst of a heated election season .
Floridaâ€ ™ s disenfranchised :
voices of the 1.7 million not allowed to vote Bashar al - Assad : Aleppo must be â€˜cleanedâ€ ™ Syriaâ€ ™ s president , Bashar al - Assad , has spoken of â€œcleaningâ€ � the besieged city of Aleppo , where a quarter of a million people are caught under heavy bombardment by his governmentâ€ ™ s forces , and using it as a â€œspringboardâ€ � for winning the countryâ€ ™ s war .
Speaking to Russiaâ€ ™ s Komsomolskaya Pravda , Assad said Aleppo was effectively no longer Syriaâ€ ™ s industrial capital but taking back the city would provide important political and strategic gains .
Victory in the city would allow the Syrian army to liberate other areas of the country from who Assad calls â€œterroristsâ€ � .
Aleppo must be â€˜cleanedâ€ ™ , declares Assad , amid outcry over bloody siege â€˜Hard Brexitâ€ ™ to come After months of wishful thinking over the consequences of the UKâ€ ™ s vote to leave the European Union , the British have received a sharp reality check from European political leaders .

Who won the marijuana war ?
Candi CdeBaca voted to legalize the free sale of marijuana in Colorado four years ago because she thought it would be good for her Denver neighborhood .
Now sheâ€ ™ s not so sure .
â€œWe have just swapped one kind of drug dealer for another , â€ � said CdeBaca .
â€œI believed it would positively impact communities of colour by decriminalizing it .
So watching it unfold has been surprising.â€ �
As CdeBaca sees it , all legalization has done is open the door to a takeover by corporate interests .
â€œItâ€ ™ s your typical capitalist who is in our neighborhood now and benefiting from an industry that at one time was our only option , â€ � she said .
â€˜Commercialization won outâ€ ™ : will legal marijuana be the next big tobacco ?

There are conceivably â€ “ or inconceivably â€ “ 2tn galaxies in the universe , up to 20 times more than previously thought , astronomers reported on Thursday .
The surprising finding , based on 3D modeling of images collected over 20 years by the Hubble Space Telescope , was published in the Astronomical Journal .
The new calculation comes with a caveat : even within the â€œobservable universeâ€ � , current technology only allows us to glimpse 10 % of what is out there .

2016-10-14,"At the end of a devastating week for Republican election hopes , many Democrats felt that all that was left to do was refer to Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s emotional evisceration of Donald Trump and shrug :
â€œWhat she said.â€ �
â€œThe speech that she gave , I think put into words what so many people are feeling
, â€ � Hillary Clinton told Ellen DeGeneres , after urging a landslide victory on 8 November as a â€œrebuke of all the bigotry and bullyingâ€ � .
â€œIf you want to hear the best case for Hillary Clinton , if you want to hear the very real stakes in this election , I would advise you to link up to Michelleâ€ ™ s speech from earlier today in New Hampshire , â€ � added her husband Barack in Ohio before focusing on the stateâ€ ™ s Senate race instead .
Not long ago , it would have looked like complacency .
But in the seven days since a video emerged of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women , even many Republicans concede the US election race has changed out of all recognition .
The week before that , Trump had been neck - and - neck in national opinion polls .
On the morning of the first presidential debate in Long Island on 26 September , respected statistician Nate Silver put the Republican partyâ€ ™ s chances of winning the White House at more than 45 % .
But two divisive debate performances and a dozen sexual harassment allegations later , this weighted extrapolation of polling saw his predicted chances sink as low as 13 % .
A popular rolling average of raw survey numbers now shows Clinton with a comfortable seven - point lead , while a poll carried out during the weekend of the tape by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal had her up by double digits â€ “ the highest since springtime .
Trump continues to boast in his speeches of the occasional outlier which shows a tighter race .
The clearest indication of what his campaign thinks in private came this week , when aides confirmed reports they were pulling staff and advertising out of Virginia to preserve resources for battleground states where the campaign still thinks there is a chance of turning things around in the 24 days left .
With diverse swing states like Virginia and Colorado now firmly off any realistic target list , Trumpâ€ ™ s sole remaining path to victory relies on winning Ohio , Florida , Pennsylvania and North Carolina , states where he is currently an average of two points , three points , eight points and three points behind , respectively .
Instead , Democrats are now increasingly focused on attacking Republican strongholds rather than defending Rust Belt swing states that once looked vulnerable to Trumpâ€ ™ s populist surge .
Clintonâ€ ™ s running mate , Tim Kaine , has spoken of his growing confidence about winning Arizona and Georgia .
Other â€œexpansion statesâ€ � that the Democrats have their eyes on in the hope of the landslide include Utah , where an unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin is destroying Trumpâ€ ™ s natural lead among religious conservatives .
Even Trumpâ€ ™ s lead in Texas is now down within the margin of error in some polls .
Republicans still hope there is time to push back .
One of Trumpâ€ ™ s few remaining loyal supporters in the party , running mate Mike Pence , has promised his boss will respond swiftly and specifically to the deluge of recent sexual abuse allegations .
Others , such as a former candidate Ben Carson , say â€œit doesnâ€ ™ t matterâ€ � whether Trump accusers are â€œlying or notâ€ � because bigger issues are at stake for America .
What matters is that â€œthe train is going off the cliffâ€ � , Trumpâ€ ™ s erstwhile opponent told CNN on Friday .
But the reason that many other party leaders , such as the House speaker , Paul Ryan , have deserted their candidate in recent days is that the real battle has now shifted from the White House to Congress .
Despite a naturally favourable set of Senate races up for Democrats this cycle , Republicans had hoped there was a chance of holding on to control of the upper chamber thanks to strong candidates such as Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona .
But the Trump effect now seems to be hurting them whether they distance themselves from the nominee or not .
The latest Florida poll shows Rubio clinging to just a two - point lead , while McCain has finally unendorsed Trump .
For Democrats , the dithering of uncertain Republicans is irresistible .
â€œI understand that Ted [ Strickland]â€ ™ s opponent has finally withdrawn his support from Donald Trump , after looking at the polling , now that itâ€ ™ s politically expedient , â€ �
Obama said of his partyâ€ ™ s rival in Ohio .
â€œBut he supported him up until last week .
So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities , and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were unpatriotic , and insulting Gold Star moms , and making fun of disabled Americans .
I guess that didnâ€
™ t quite tip it over the edge .
Why was that OK?â€ �
Even the uphill battle to regain control of the House of Representatives is now seen as possibly winnable .
Despite gerrymandered boundary maps that entrench Republican control , the Washington Post estimates a dozen once safe seats in places such as Virginia and California could now swing it too .
A challenge for both parties is making sure that the electorate does not tune out entirely .
A poll by the American Psychological Association found more than half of Americans say the 2016 election has become a â€œmajor source of stressâ€ � .
â€œAfter watching MSNBC last night , I have decided to unplug â€ ¦
I am so rattled and disturbed , â€ � says Mark Herzog , one Washington parent typical of those deciding they have heard enough .
Many Republican women are particularly appalled by Trumpâ€ ™ s sexually graphic language and aggressive tone .
The GOP chairman of Ohio recently revealed his wife will no longer let him put up a Trump yard sign in front of their house .
Democrats insist this is what Republicans have brought upon themselves .
â€œThis is in the swamp of crazy that has been fed over and over and over and over again , â€ � concluded President Obama in Ohio ."
2016-10-14,"Lashing out at his accusers this afternoon , Donald Trump attacked all the women who say he has groped , kissed or inspected them naked without their consent .
He called them â€œhorrible , horrible liarsâ€ � and vowed to sue the New York Times for reporting their accounts .
Minutes before the Florida rally where Trump declared war on women and the media , Michelle Obama offered a diametrically opposite view of reality and morality at a campaign appearance in New Hampshire .
Condemning Trumpâ€ ™ s conduct as â€œintolerableâ€
�
, she forcefully argued that no woman deserves to be treated this way .
The contrast between the two couldnâ€ ™ t have been more dramatic .
â€œThis is not about politics .
Itâ€ ™ s about basic human decency , â€ � the first lady said , urging her listeners to vote for Hillary Clinton .
â€œItâ€ ™ s about right and wrong .
Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say , â€˜Enough is enoughâ€
™
.â€
�
Her words echoed the thoughts of millions of women who watched last Sundayâ€ ™ s presidential debate and heard Trump deny heâ€ ™ s ever sexually assaulted women , even though he himself has publicly described having habitually done just that .
What Trump didnâ€ ™ t realize was how many of his listeners were thinking about all the times that men had done such things to them .
And in the moment future historians may define as an historic turning point , countless women said to themselves , â€œEnough.â€ �
By midweek , even before Michelle Obama voiced that thought , the floodgates had opened as a rapidly expanding array of women described various forms of sexual assault they said Trump had inflicted on them â€ “ and told their stories , on the record , to the Guardian , the New York Times , Buzzfeed , People magazine , and the Palm Beach Post , among a growing list of publications .
Since Trump thinks the best way to deal with any charges is to counter - attack as viciously as possible , his campaign immediately promised to dredge up more allegations of Bill Clintonâ€ ™ s past sexual misconduct .
But no matter what Bill Clinton has done , heâ€ ™ s not running for president â€ “ and nobody has ever accused Hillary Clinton of grabbing the genitals of a stranger or pushing a man up against a wall and shoving her tongue down his mouth .
The overwhelming majority of sex crimes are committed by men , and neither Trump nor most of the commentators trying to keep up with the current firestorm seem to understand that that fact alone has transformed this race .
What Trump is now up against is not only his own actions , but the lived experience of every American woman .
Is there a gender empathy gap ?
The last couple of decades brought a sea change in womenâ€ ™ s sense of empowerment , as well as a new awareness of issues ranging from harassment to sexual consent .
And as Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes could attest , women are no longer willing to remain silent about what men have done with impunity in the past .
This week , a man finally acknowledged on national television what many women already understood about the 2016 election .
â€œThis is a gender war , â€ �
Donny Deutsch announced on MSNBCâ€ ™ s Morning Joe the morning after the second debate .
â€œWomen in America are going to stand up and revolt â€
“ every woman in American who has ever been held down , oppressed , harassed .
And if youâ€ ™ re not seeing that , youâ€ ™ re missing it.â€ �
And yet many men are still missing it .
Following the second debate , a series of national polls revealed a gender split that showed women opposing Trump by increasing margins .
If only women voted on election day , Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide with 458 electoral votes to only 80 for Trump , as Nate Silver reported on FiveThirtyEight.com .
As recent days have finally made clear , the 2016 election constitutes a referendum on male entitlement â€ “ and a Clinton victory will herald an earthquake that remakes the social landscape as dramatically as it does the national agenda .
On one issue after another , polls reveal the widening divisions between men and women .
Announcing the results of a survey measuring public reactions to Trumpâ€ ™ s infamous â€œgrab her by the pussyâ€ � remarks , ABCâ€ ™ s Rachel Tillman wrote , â€œThere was a stark gender gap , with 62 % of women less likely to vote for him while 55 % of men say it will make no difference on their vote.â€ � Such differences should surprise no one , because men lead entirely different lives than women .
Over the course of their lifetime , 57 % of women report having been touched or grabbed in a sexual way by a stranger in public .
Thirty - seven percent of women have had a stranger masturbate in front of them at least once in public .
But strangers pose less of a danger than loved ones ; more than a third of female murder victims are killed by their intimate partners .
One in five women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime â€ “ most often by someone they are close to .
Trumpâ€ ™ s first wife accused him of such acts ; in a sworn deposition during their divorce , Ivana Trump used the word â€œrapeâ€ � to describe forced sex in which her husband pulled out fistfuls of her hair .
Is it any wonder that the segment of the electorate that is routinely victimized views such offenses differently than the segment of the electorate that commits them ?
Whether the crime is harassment , domestic violence or murder , the root cause includes an overwhelming sense of male entitlement : â€œI get to do this to you because
Iâ€ ™ m the man and youâ€ ™ re a woman.â€ �
Such privilege carries an assumption of ownership , as with property rights : experts on domestic violence attest that men are more likely to assault female partners when they feel theyâ€ ™ re losing control , as when threatened with a divorce or a restraining order .
And men who fear theyâ€ ™ re losing control have fueled the rise of Donald Trump .
The gender gap between Trumpâ€ ™ s support and Clintonâ€ ™ s is particularly staggering among men who are ill - equipped in comparison with their female peers .
An ABC News / Washington Post poll at the end of September showed Trump with an overwhelming 59-point lead among among white men who donâ€ ™ t have college degrees â€ “ 76 % of whom supported him .
In an era when women make up nearly 60 % of college and graduate school students , those men are falling further and further behind .
Despite such numbers , any real recognition of their import has been a long time coming .
For the last year and a half , as myriad so - called experts struggled to understand the Trump phenomenon , their analyses focused on race , religion , ethnicity , class and income .
With notable obtuseness , they resisted the most universal explanation well past the time when it should have been obvious .
Throughout this campaign , Trumpâ€ ™ s public persona has constituted a textbook illustration of male domination : gaslighting , threatening and insulting at every turn .
he has consistently acted like a vicious bully who will stop at nothing to subordinate his foes .
At his first debate with Hillary Clinton , he interrupted her 51 times .
But Trumpâ€ ™ s interrupting and shouting over his adversaries during the debates were only an extension of the domineering traits that have long been clear .
This weekâ€ ™ s news included reports from Miss USA contestants , some as young as 15 , that Trump deliberately walked in on them backstage while they were naked .
Trump has even bragged about doing so : â€œI sort of get away with things like that , â€ � he said on The Howard Stern Show in 2005 .
As the possessor of a penis , celebrity and a fortune , Trump has never questioned his right to inspect and rank women in terms of his own interest in having sex with them .
For decades his objectification of women has remained as consistent as the ugliness of his values ; as a self - appointed judge of female worth , he and his beauty pageants and reality shows have perpetuated the misogynistic standards that nullify the value of any woman who is not very young , very thin and conventionally attractive .
And with Trump , the double standards are so extreme it would be laughable if they werenâ€ ™ t so destructive , from his fat - shaming of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado to the gratuitous insult he lobbed at Heidi Klum when he announced , apropos of nothing , that the supermodel was â€œsadly , no longer a 10â€ � .
Nor did Trump â€ “ a chronic philanderer currently married to his third wife , having dumped the previous two after each
had borne him children
â€ “ see anything wrong with attacking Hillary Clinton over her husbandâ€ ™ s past infidelity .
No matter what awful things men do , itâ€ ™ s always the womanâ€ ™ s fault .
But women are becoming ever less compliant â€ “ and female insurrection is particularly upsetting to men who are already anxious about their ability to maintain their authority .
Women have always been penalized for violating conventional gender norms , but no woman has ever had a realistic chance of winning the White House until now â€ “ and the backlash against Clintonâ€ ™ s temerity was apparent from the start of her campaign .
As Sandy Garossino wrote in the National Observer , â€œUntil she ran for president , Clinton was the most admired woman in the world â€ ¦
So what the hell happened ?
The woman ran for president , thatâ€ ™ s what .
Who does she think she is?â€ � Clintonâ€ ™ s approval ratings have fluctuated wildly for decades .
But the 2016 campaign ratcheted up the stakes to the point where the Republican nominee has promised to jail the female opponent who trounced him in both debates .
The confidence of the mediocre white man Invoking the popularity of a tote bag that reads , â€œLord , Give Me the Confidence of a Mediocre White Man , â€ �
Jessica Valenti wrote about how exasperating it is to deal with â€œa bombastic but woefully under - informed man who is convinced of how much smarter he is than youâ€ � .
When the article was published in the Guardian , its headline was : Why the mediocre maleâ€ ™ s days may be numbered .
Such predictions are , of course , what those men are worried about .
In the early days of the modern womenâ€ ™ s movement , Gloria Steinem observed humorously that the reason many men oppose equality is that they fear women will treat them the same way theyâ€ ™ ve treated women .
Then as now , itâ€ ™ s true that Not All Men behave badly .
But the archetype is painfully familiar , as Nicholas Kristof pointed out in a New York Times op - ed column headlined : A 7th grade bully runs for president .
Kristofâ€ ™ s litany of characteristic behaviors was withering : â€œThe boasts about not doing homework , the habit of blaming others when things go wrong , the penchant for exaggerating everything into the best ever , the braggadocio to mask insecurity about size of hands or genitals , the biting put - downs of others , the laziness , the self - absorption , the narcissism , the lack of empathy â€ “ and the immaturity that reduces a woman to her breasts.â€
�
As Kristofâ€ ™ s list suggests , the less hard - working or accomplished men are , the more threatened they seem by the prospect of having to compete on a level playing field â€ “ and the more they resist the prospect of real female empowerment .
Despite growing competition , many men â€ “ like Trump in the run - up to the first debate â€ “ refuse to compensate by working harder , no matter how poorly they fare .
Time - use studies show that even when men donâ€ ™ t have jobs , they do far less housework and childcare than their working wives .
Whether the issue is slacker husbands or discriminatory bosses who perpetuate the inequities of the gender pay gap , some women remain acquiescent to the unfairness of the status quo â€ “ but a lot of others are simply fed up .
The question is : how many â€ “ and are they exasperated enough to head for the polls in droves ?
And will enough fair - minded men join them to elect the first female president in American history ?
The answer depends on how far weâ€ ™ ve come in accepting the idea of women as truly equal human beings who sometimes outdo their male counterparts .
Last month Vanity Fair reposted a profile I wrote in 1994 , when the then first lady was working on healthcare reform .
The article quoted a powerful Capitol Hill insider who compared Mrs Clintonâ€ ™ s performance with that of her husband , the president .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve seen them both make presentations , with dozens of senators at the table , and sheâ€ ™ s better than he is , â€ � he said .
â€œAnd these guys know it .
Theyâ€ ™ ve sat in rooms with her , and theyâ€ ™ ve sat in rooms with him .
Heâ€ ™ s good â€ “ heâ€ ™ s very good .
Sheâ€ ™ s just fucking perfect.â€
�
In a globalized world increasingly riven by conflicts of byzantine complexity , Clintonâ€ ™ s hard - earned knowledge and experience constitute her strongest claim to the Oval Office .
But her rival â€ “ and the male minions who laud him as a â€œgeniusâ€ � for evading taxes
â€ “ fail to appreciate even that obvious point .
Is this the president we want for our sons ?
As election day approaches , the larger question is how much sense of self - preservation will be manifested by the nationâ€ ™ s adult females .
Will American women â€ “ and the men who actually care about their welfare
â€ “ support the leadership of a man who feels entitled to kiss strangers on the mouth and brag about grabbing crotches , simply because he is rich and famous and male ?
Will voters agree that a man should view and rank all women according to their physical attributes and fire those he doesnâ€ ™ t find sexually desirable , because he thinks a womanâ€ ™ s value is measured by her looks ?
Will voters approve the double standards of a man who publicly humiliates women for their sexual conduct even as he laughs off his own far more lurid transgressions ?
Will the electorate agree that males donâ€ ™ t have to play by the rules â€ “ that men donâ€ ™ t need to do whatâ€ ™ s best for their families ( like refraining from dumping the mothers of their children in tabloid sex scandals ) or for the economy ( like paying contractors who provided services instead of cheating them ) or for their country ( like paying taxes ) ?
The Clinton campaign has been running a commercial featuring some of Trumpâ€ ™ s denigrating comments about women , superimposed over pictures of uncertain young girls scrutinizing themselves in the mirror as they struggle to decide whether their bodies define their value in the world .
â€œIs
this the president we want for our daughters?â€
� the ad asks .
That leaves out an equally critical question : is this the president we want for our sons ?
A vote for Trump is a vote for the continuation of male entitlement â€ “ for the arrogance and inequity of unearned privilege , for the acceptance of irresponsibility in personal , familial and civic behaviors , and for the perpetuation of all the hateful biases that oppress women solely because of their gender .
Is this the world we want to keep on living in , or is it finally time for us to demand a better one ?"
2016-10-16,"For two and a half years they waited , with hopes kept alive by rumours of negotiations , an international campaign and their own deep faith .
On Sunday a group of Nigerian families were finally reunited with 21 girls released last week by Boko Haram , the Islamic militant movement .
The abduction of nearly 300 female students from a government secondary school in the remote town of Chibok , in the north - east Nigeria in April 2014 prompted a global outcry , and an international campaign to # BringBackOurGirls , backed by celebrities including Michelle Obama .
The girls were released very early on Thursday morning and flown to the capital , Abuja , where they received medical attention and trauma counselling .
Tsambido Abana , a Chibok community leader in the city , said some are â€œemaciatedâ€ � from hunger .
However , their families , travelling from Chibok , faced 500 miles of driving over potholed roads , with the trip slowed by military checkpoints and the danger of attacks by insurgents .
They embraced their children in emotional scenes amid singing and dancing at a church service in the capital on Sunday morning .
The release has been celebrated throughout Nigeria , and will boost Muhammadu Buhari , the beleaguered president .
Abana , the father of one of the released girls , said he was worried that their release would be exploited for political gain .
â€œPeopleâ€ ™ s children arenâ€ ™ t money , peopleâ€ ™ s children are not clothes you wear to campaign , peopleâ€ ™ s children are their pride , â€ � he said .
Few details have emerged of the ordeal of the abducted girls , many of whom are believed to have been taken as wives by extremists and systematically raped .
Others have reportedly been forced to carry out demanding physical tasks .
As Christians , all are believed to have been forced to convert to Islam .
Over the weekend , commanders from Boko Haram , which has waged a bloody seven - year insurgency against the government , displacing millions and causing a humanitarian disaster , said that the girls were freed to prove good faith and more will be released if demands for cash and an exchange of prisoners are met .
â€œThese 21 released girls are supposed to be tale bearers to tell the Nigerian government that this faction of Boko Haram has 83 more Chibok girls , â€ �
Garba Shehu , spokesman for Buhari , told Reuters .
â€œThe faction said it is ready to negotiate if the government is willing to sit down with them.â€ � Senior Nigerian officials said last week they would â€œrule nothing outâ€ � in talks with the militants .
Dozens of the girls escaped in the first few hours after their abduction , one was found wandering in a remote area in May , and Boko Haram is believed to be still holding about 190 .
Boko Haram , which is theoretically an affiliate of Islamic State , has split in recent months after its erratic leader , Abubakr Shekau , was replaced as leader .
Shekau , who is short of manpower and weapons , is thought to be holding the girls .
The group of 21 were released following a deal brokered by the Red Cross and the Swiss government .
There are conflicting reports about why the girls were freed , with military officers saying they were exchanged for four detained Boko Haram commanders .
The statements were later denied by civilian officials .
There are also reports that a significant ransom was paid ."
2016-10-17,"The White House will roll out the red carpet for the Italian prime minister , Matteo Renzi , and his wife , Agnese , on Tuesday , marking the last formal dinner of Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s presidency and an important gesture in support of an embattled US ally .
Many details of the state dinner â€ “ such as whether Michelle Obama will stay true to her habit of wearing relatively unknown designers for such occasions or opt for an Italian classic such as Giorgio Armani or Valentino â€ “ are still under wraps .
What is known is that the food will be prepared by Mario Batali , an American chef known for refashioning Italian classics , and the entertainment will be provided by the singer Gwen Stefani .
In the US capital the glamorous affair is keenly anticipated , with Renzi labelled the â€œJustin Trudeau of Italyâ€ � by the style section of the Washington Post .
But it is the substance of Renziâ€ ™ s time in office that has endeared him to the White House .
Following the UKâ€ ™ s vote to leave the European Union and tensions between Angela Merkel and Obama over US spying allegations and trade , Renzi has emerged as the most important and vocal champion of the US - European relationship .
The Italian prime minister is working closely with the US on supporting the UN - backed unity government in Libya , and has allowed the US to use American bases in Sicily to conduct drone strikes against Islamic State .
While the US president may be feeling confident that his fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton will be elected as his successor on 8 November , Renzi is facing tougher odds in a contest that will make or break his own political career .
The US has suggested that it supports Renzi and a yes vote in the 4 December referendum on constitutional reform in Italy , but polls are looking tough for the prime minister , who has staked his career on the outcome and promised to resign from politics if he loses .
Among other advisers , Renzi has hired Jim Messina , Obamaâ€ ™ s former campaign manager .
The Italian prime minister was also an early supporter of Clintonâ€ ™ s bid for the presidency , even while she was locked in a nomination battle with Bernie Sanders .
Giovanni Orsina , professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome , said the decision to invite Renzi to the state dinner in Washington signalled a clear belief that the Italian referendum would have consequences beyond Italyâ€ ™ s borders .
The US ambassador to Italy , John Phillis , recently warned that a victory for the no camp would lead to political instability , and would be seen from abroad as weakening European cohesion .
â€œItalians , like others in the west , are becoming increasingly negative about other institutions meddling in Italian affairs .
If voters feel pressed , they may end up doing the opposite , â€ � Orsina said .
The trip to Washington will include a joint press conference with Obama â€ “ raising speculation that the pair could make a statement about Russia , a speech at Johns Hopkins University , a visit to Arlington national cemetery and a lunch arranged by the Center for American Progress , a Democratic thinktank .
The Italian entourage accompanying Renzi will include Armani himself â€ “ apparently there are no hard feelings after the designer criticised Renziâ€ ™ s sense of style in 2014 .
Anti - corruption tsar Raffaele Cantone , Oscar winners actor Roberto Benigni and director Paolo Sorrentino , the mayor of the Italian island of Lampedusa , Giusi Nicolini , and Paralympic champion Bebe Vio , who won gold in fencing at the Rio Games , will also be there ."
2016-10-19,"Every day it becomes clearer that Hillary Clinton is going to make history and win the presidential election .
Itâ€ ™ s hard to feel excited or even relieved , though , when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of Donald Trump .
Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and woman after woman coming forward to claim he did just that , itâ€ ™ s hard to stave off that sick - to - your - stomach feeling Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week .
For those of us who have endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches , this last leg of the campaign has been painful .
And as Trump surrogates and supporters â€ “ even his wife â€ “ continue to shrug off the offenses as â€œlocker room
talkâ€ � or outright lies
, weâ€ ™ re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved .
There is one thing , though , thatâ€ ™ s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness : the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior .
Too often , discussions about sexual assault center only on women â€ “ our victimization and perceived culpability .
Since the tapeâ€ ™ s release , though , the national conversation has shifted : men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that â€œreal
menâ€
� talk about abusing women â€ “ that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else .
A group of male high school athletes in Oregon posed in feminist shirts with the pictureâ€ ™ s caption reading , â€œsexual assault is not locker room banterâ€ � ; pro athletes across the country weighed in on social media , decrying the idea that this is just what men are like ; a player for Amherst Collegeâ€ ™ s menâ€ ™ s soccer team criticized Trumpâ€ ™ s comments , writing : â€œAs a sports team , we have found success by valuing the ideal of doing the right thing even when no one is watching.â€ �
These men and others are quelling that nauseated feeling Iâ€ ™ ve had the last week or so .
Yes , it should go without saying that men donâ€ ™ t support groping or vile comments about women and their bodies .
But as long as we live in a culture where a former mayor of New York City can claim on national television that all men talk about sexually assaulting women , we will need men to actively push back .
Thankfully , the past decade of feminism has laid the groundwork for this very moment .
The rise of â€œyes means yesâ€ � as a standard for consent , and the increased understanding of rape culture especially , have given men and women the ammunition they need to fight back against the insulting vision of masculinity that Trumpâ€ ™
s supporters would have us accept .
That the Access Hollywood tapes were almost immediately and universally described by the media â€ “ which often gets things wrong on this front â€ “ as predatory and as describing sexual assault is also because of feminismâ€ ™ s work .
â€œBoys
will be boysâ€
�
doesnâ€ ™ t fly â€ “ not anymore .
Iâ€ ™ m heartbroken that this will be how the first woman president is elected â€ “ running against a ridiculously unworthy opponent , in the midst of a scandal that dehumanizes women .
But the fact that it will be feminism , with the support of outraged men , that finally brings down Trump â€ “ well
, I think that should take the edge off ."
2016-10-21,"Across bone dry Arizona , voters and pollsters have begun to ask openly about a change that seemed nearly impossible not so long ago : could Democrats take the American west ?
Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s allies charged across the region this week , led by Michelle Obama , who spoke on Thursday of hope , joy and possibility in this , the greatest country on earth .
She told the screaming supporters packed into the Phoenix Convention Center that Clinton knows â€œour country is powerful and vibrant and strong , big enough to have a place for all of us.â€ �
Then she got down to business .
Arizona business .
The kind that has political experts eyeing the Copper State and many of its neighbors and thinking that maybe 2016 could be different .
Four years ago , Obama said : â€œBarack lost Arizona , this state , by 200,008 votes ,
â€ � as the sheepish crowd rumbled .
â€œWhen
you break that number down , the difference between winning and losing this state is only about 63 votes per precinct .
Yeah .
Just take that in .
63 â€
¦
This year , we know itâ€
™ s much closer here.â€
�
The last time Arizona voted for the Democratic presidential candidate , it was 1996 , the time before that , 1948 .
But an Arizona Republic poll released on Wednesday showed Clinton up by five percentage points , the first survey taken during the general election in which she was ahead of Trump by more than the margin of error .
The most recent poll in Nevada , another toss - up state , showed Clinton ahead by seven .
She has an apparent lock on Colorado and New Mexico , and the entire west coast in her column .
There are even questions about Trumpâ€ ™ s strength in bright red Utah , where he has alienated Mormon voters with his comments about women , accusations of sexual harassment , three marriages and admitted affair .
â€œI could see Clinton sweeping the west , â€ � said Samara Klar , an assistant professor of political science at the University of Arizona .
â€œI donâ€
™ t think thatâ€ ™ s out of the question .
Up until two days ago , I was , â€˜Clinton is never going to get Arizona.â€ ™ â€ �
But with less than three weeks until election day , the Clinton campaign has sent some of its biggest names to energize Arizona voters .
On Tuesday , Bernie Sanders stumped in Flagstaff .
Chelsea Clinton talked up her motherâ€ ™ s education policies on debate day at Arizona State University in Tempe .
And less than 24 hours after Trump dismissed Clinton as â€œsuch a nasty womanâ€ � during their final debate , Obama urged turned 7,000 Arizonans to ignore the Republicanâ€ ™ s â€œvision that is grounded in hopelessness and despairâ€ � and get to work .
She was introduced by the granddaughter of Arizonaâ€ ™ s most famous Republican : the late Senator Barry Goldwater , who ran for president against Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and lost .
â€œMy grandfather lived by some very basic values , â€ � said Carolyn Goldwater Ross , â€œto respect others and to stand up for those who need a champion .
There may be two candidates , but thereâ€ ™ s only one choice .
Thereâ€ ™ s only one candidate who will live up to my grandfatherâ€ ™ s values.â€ �
She closed with Clintonâ€ ™ s slogan : â€œIâ€ ™ m with her.â€ �
So was another lifelong Republican , Nicole Phillips , a 44-year - old advertising executive from Phoenix who brought her 14-year - old daughter Lauren to the Clinton rally .
â€œSweeping the west for Hillary is pretty plausible , â€ � she said .
â€œI crossed party lines , â€ � she added .
â€œI feel like the Republican party
truly hasnâ€ ™ t addressed me in 12 years .
Donald Trump is perpetuating the myth that all African Americans are poor , living in inner city neighborhoods , looking for a hand out .
â€œSome of us , â€ � she said , â€œare gainfully employed , live in the suburbs and drive fancy cars.â€
�
Democrats are outspending Trump on advertising in Arizona , and Clintonâ€ ™ s running mate , Tim Kaine , recently campaigned in Phoenix , noted political strategist David Waid .
â€œWeâ€ ™ ve really had everybody
but Hillary Clinton ,
â€ � he said .
â€œThis would be a 1,000 % increase in the number of important Democratic surrogates that Arizona has gotten in a presidential election year .
This is unheard of and unprecedented in Arizona , and itâ€ ™ s a sign of where weâ€ ™ re headed.â€
�
The westâ€ ™ s turn blue , if not its full Democratic conversion , owes a great deal to demographics .
Much of the region is growing , Klar said , and Arizona is attracting transplants from liberal enclaves who are slowly helping shift the political landscape .
A rapidly increasing Latino population is another part of the equation : since 2012 , the number of eligible Latino voters has increased by four million nationwide , according to the Pew Research Center , accounting for 37 % of the growth in eligible voters .
Arizona has 992,000 eligible Latino voters , 22 % of all eligible voters in the state , according to Pew .
Nevada has 328,000 , or 17 % .
â€œI am writing a book about the 1988 election , and one striking feature about that race is that [ Republican George HW ]
Bush swept the west , except for Washington and Oregon , â€ � said John J Pitney Jr , a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College .
â€œSince then , the map has gained a lot more blue .
One major reason is the growth of the Hispanic vote.â€ �
Not everyone is so willing to accept a blue tide across the west , that bastion of proud and ornery independence , and dissenters included men and women who gathered at the Arizona Republican Party headquarters on Wednesday to watch the final debate .
Many at the low - slung office , which was evacuated a day earlier because of a bomb threat , believe that the polls showing Democratic gains are rigged .
â€œHillary is not going to win Arizona , â€ � said Paul Gorman , a 61-year - old computer technician .
â€œEvery four years they trot out a poll saying the Democrats are gon na take Arizona , itâ€ ™ s going to turn blue .
Not gon na happen .
Arizona is gon na go for Trump .
I can guarantee that.â€ � Dan Watts was doing everything he could to make Gormanâ€ ™ s prediction come through .
Huddled in a conference room before the debate , he called a long list of registered Republicans to remind them to vote .
Over and over again , the 64 year old read from the same script : â€œHi , my name is Dan Watts .
Iâ€ ™ m calling from the Republican party to remind you that youâ€ ™ ll soon get your sample ballot.â€
�
And then he got bored .
â€œHey
, â€ � he said to his fellow volunteers , â€œcan we do a limerick?â€ � Something snappy ,
Trump inspired , maybe taking a poke at party defectors like Arizona senator John McCain , who withdrew his support from the Republican standard bearer in early October .
â€œThere once was a candidate named Trump , â€ � Watts wrote , â€œWho some said would never get over the hump .
â€œHe wanted to make America great â€œIn spite of Republicans who decided to skate .
â€œIn the end , Trump was nobodyâ€ ™ s chump.â€ �"
2016-10-23,"As the Chicago Cubs contemplate their first World Series appearance since 1945 â€ “ and the possibility of their first title since 108 years â€ “ the teamâ€ ™
s fans have started to celebrate .
Two of the most influential women in the US â€ “ Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama â€ “ are Cubs fans , and expressed their joy after Chicago beat the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday night to secure the National League Championship Series .
â€œWay to go Cubs ! ! , tweeted Obama .
â€œMy
Dad is the reason Iâ€ ™ m a true Cubs fans .
Heâ€
™ d be so proud!â€ � Clinton , who grew up in a suburb of Chicago , was on her campaign jet as the action unfolded on Saturday , but she kept up to date with a livestream on her phone .
ABC News tweeted a picture of the presidential candidate at the moment the Cubs clinched their place in the World Series : Bill Murray , who took over a White House press briefing to talk about the Cubs earlier this week , appeared to be in tears as he celebrated , while fellow actor John Cusack tweeted â€œItâ€ ™ s .
Done.â€
�
The Cubsâ€ ™ crosstown rivals , the White Sox , broke their own title drought in 2005 , when they won the World Series for the first time since 1917 , and they offered their congratulations :
But perhaps the bluntest assessment came from 90 year - old fan Dorothy Farrell , who was 19 the last time the Cubs won the pennant .
Asked how she would celebrate she said : â€œIâ€ ™ ll probably have a Jagermeister.â€ � â€œI just wished wish my brothers were alive to see this ...
They loved the Cubs .
And my father did too ,
â€ � she added .
â€œBut theyâ€ ™ re all dead now .
This old ladyâ€ ™ s still living.â€ �"
2016-10-27,"Hillary Clinton deployed the star power of Michelle Obama in North Carolina on Thursday , laying out the stakes in the presidential election and then turning the stage over to the popular first lady .
Appearing together for the first time on the campaign trail , Clinton and Obama shared a platform at a packed arena .
Both warned sharply against voter apathy .
â€œHillary doesnâ€ ™ t play , â€ � Obama said , after ticking off the Democratic nomineeâ€ ™ s professional accomplishments , a line that drew wild cheers from the 11,000 who came to see the joint appearance at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum .
â€œShe has more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime â€ “ yes , more than Barack , more than Bill â€ “
so she is absolutely ready to be commander in chief on Day 1 .
And yes , â€ � Obama paused for dramatic effect , â€œshe happens to be a woman.â€ �
In a speech that switched between the soaring rhetoric that has become her trademark and playful asides , Obama said the choice facing American voters was a moral one , between two competing visions .
Trumpâ€ ™ s vision , she said , was â€œof hopelessness and despair , a vision of a country that is weak and divided , a country in chaos , where other citizens are a threatâ€ � .
â€œAnd then
thereâ€ ™ s
Hillaryâ€ ™ s vision , â€ �
she said , calling Clinton â€œmy girlâ€ � as she spoke of â€œa vision of a nation that is powerful and vibrant and strong , big enough to have a place for all of usâ€ � .
Clinton , who spoke first , heaped praise on â€œour most amazingâ€ � first lady .
She praised Obamaâ€ ™ s accomplishments in the role â€ “ including her White House vegetable garden â€ “ and expressed sympathy over how tough the role can be .
She also expressed admiration for the first coupleâ€ ™ s dance moves and said Obama had â€œdazzled the worldâ€ � with her memorable speech at the Democratic national convention in July .
â€œSeriously , is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle
Obama?â€ � she said , in closing .
The women clasped each other .
Taking the microphone , Obama said she was somewhat overwhelmed by Clintonâ€ ™ s
â€œmini - tributeâ€ � .
â€œI know that there are some folks out there who have commented that itâ€ ™ s unprecedented for a sitting first lady to be so actively engaged in a campaign , â€ �
Obama said of her own forays into the campaign against Donald Trump .
â€œThat may be true .
But this is truly an unprecedented election.â€
�
The first lady has emerged as one of Clintonâ€ ™ s most potent surrogates in battleground states , delivering stirring speeches that have served both as cogent rebukes of Trump and powerful endorsements of Clinton , all in an optimistic tone counter to the vulgar tenor of this election cycle .
In terms of popularity , the first lady outshines either presidential nominee and even her husband .
In August a Gallup poll found Michelle Obama to have a 64 % approval rating , notably higher than either of her potential successors : Bill Clinton earned 49 % and Melania Trump 38 % .
Obamaâ€ ™ s approval rating rose six points after her convention speech .
Earlier this month , Obama used a speech in New Hampshire to denounce Trumpâ€ ™ s treatment of women , after the release of 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted about grabbing and kissing women without their consent .
Since the emergence of the Access Hollywood tape , 12 women have accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behaviour .
North Carolina , which Clinton running mate Tim Kaine this week called the â€œcheckmate stateâ€ � , is among a handful of closely contested states that could blunt Trumpâ€ ™ s path to the presidency and decide control of the Senate .
Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 and lost it in 2012 .
Polling has shown a competitive race for the stateâ€ ™ s 15 electoral votes , though Clinton has maintained an edge since the first debate .
She leads by two points , according to the RealClearPolitics.com polling average .
Obama pointed to her husbandâ€ ™ s slim margin of victory in the state in 2008 .
â€œBarack won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes ,
â€ �
she said .
â€œNow that may sound like a lot
â€
¦
but the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two votes per precinct.â€ �
Several people in the audience gasped .
In 2012 , she said , Obama lost the state by an average of 17 votes per precinct .
â€œNow Hillary has done her job ,
â€ �
she said in closing .
â€œNow we need to do our job and get her elected .
Because hereâ€ ™ s where I want to get real .
If Hillary Clinton does not get elected , it will be on us .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s get this done.â€ �"
2016-10-27,"Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared together on the campaign trail in a show of sisterhood that not so long ago might have seemed far - fetched .
â€œIf people want to know , â€ � said Obama , â€œyes , sheâ€ ™ s my friend.â€ � â€˜Hillary doesnâ€ ™ t playâ€ ™
Hillary has done her job .
Now we need to do our job and get her elected .

Trump twice tweeted a recording of leftie film - maker Michael Moore explaining his appeal with some working - class voters .
â€œTrumpâ€ ™ s election is going to be the biggest fuck you ever recorded in human history , â€ � Moore said .

Melania Trump"
2016-10-28,"In 2010 , Michelle Obama attended a state department event recognizing women around the world .
When it was the first ladyâ€ ™ s turn to speak , she began by thanking the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
â€œMy dear friend , Senator â€ “
I mean Secretary Clinton ,
â€ �
Obama said , correcting herself .
She paused , then continued : â€œI almost said President Clinton.â€ �
The audience burst into laughter and applause .
Clinton , too , tossed her head back and gave a hearty laugh .
Obama is not joking now as she travels the country on a deeply personal mission to help elect her East Wing predecessor , a one - time adversary who she now calls â€œmy girlâ€ � .
In a storyline that would have been unimaginable eight years ago , Obama has thrown herself into the role of Clintonâ€ ™ s champion and chief defender against Donald Trump , the Republican nominee .
The rise of Trump has entwined the first ladiesâ€ ™ fates .
Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s legislative accomplishments
â€ “ his legacy â€ “ rests crucially on a Clinton victory .
The alternative would be painful for the first family ; Trumpâ€ ™ s political beginnings are rooted in an effort to deny the legitimacy of Obamaâ€ ™ s presidency .
For the last several weeks , Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign has deployed Michelle Obama to competitive states , where she has delivered versions of the compelling speech she gave at the Democratic national convention in July .
Clinton and her allies have weaponized a line from that speech â€ “ â€œwhen they go low , we go
highâ€
�
â€ “ into a blistering critique of Trump and the Republicans who have not disavowed him .
Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign views Obama as a singular force on the trail .
Her distance from politics and carefully cultivated everywoman appeal , lends a note of authenticity and credibility to a candidate who is historically unpopular â€ “ although not quite as unpopular as her opponent â€ “ and ruthlessly stage - managed .
In Winston - Salem , North Carolina , on Thursday , 11,000 people filled a gymnasium to witness the two share a stage .
Clinton spoke first , and delivered an effusive speech in praise of â€œour most amazing first ladyâ€ � .
The Democratic nominee hailed Obamaâ€ ™ s eloquence and the grace with which she confronted the challenges of being the first African American first lady .
She applauded Obamaâ€ ™ s accomplishments in combatting childhood obesity and promised to tend to the vegetable garden Obama has planted during her years in the White House .
She even made mention of Obamaâ€ ™ s appearance on Carpool Karaoke and called it a â€œprivilegeâ€ � to watch the first couple dance , eliciting a little groove from Obama .
The crowd thrilled to their playful rapport .
â€œYou go , girls , â€ � a woman shouted above the wild applause .
East Wing sisterhood
The contrast between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama is sharp .
But they will for ever have in common the shared experience of living two terms as Americaâ€ ™ s first lady .
As both Clinton and Obama have expressed publicly , the role of first lady is complicated , constrained by the weight of social and cultural traditions and devoid of any real power .
â€œIâ€
™ m going to state the obvious , â€ � Clinton said of the role .
â€œItâ€ ™ s not easy .
Youâ€ ™ ve got so many people counting on you , youâ€ ™
ve got the eyes of the world on you .
â€œAnd
letâ€ ™ s be real , as our nationâ€ ™ s first African American first lady , sheâ€ ™ s faced pressures I never did , and sheâ€ ™ s
handled them with pure grace.â€
�
The women , both Ivy - League educated lawyers , charted very different paths after reaching the White House .
As the joke goes , one canâ€ ™ t wait to return to the White House
while the other canâ€ ™ t wait to leave .
Clinton followed the path of her role model , Eleanor Roosevelt .
She pushed the boundaries of tradition â€ “ and shocked some in her husbandâ€ ™ s administration â€ “ when she set up her desk in the West Wing , as opposed to the East Wing where first ladies traditionally worked .
She delved into policy and led a failed effort to pass universal healthcare .
By contrast , Obama has all but avoided policy battles .
She has focused on combatting childhood obesity , improving girlsâ€ ™ access to education around the world and , especially lately , fighting racial and economic inequality .
Obama has animated the role by using social media and public appearances to reach new audiences .
America has seen the first lady hula hoop on the White House lawn , rap about college and shop with Ellen Degeneres .
She is also known the world over for her impeccable and symbolic sartorial decisions .
( She wore a Versace dress made of rose gold chain mail to the Obamasâ€ ™ final state dinner with the Italian prime minister last week . )
As the Obamas prepare to leave the White House , many Democrats are holding out the unlikely hope that Michelle will overcome her distaste for politics and run for office .
Asked at a January town hall if his wife might consider running for president , Obama replied : â€œThere are three things that are certain in life : death , taxes and Michelle is not running for president.â€ �
Campaign trail rivals turned allies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama began as adversaries in 2008 , pitted against one another in an grueling and at turns acrimonious primary that left deep political wounds on the Democratic party .
Obama resented the fact that Clinton had attacked her husband as inexperienced and unprepared , and Clinton was stung by criticism of stirring racial tensions .
Obama extended an olive branch to Clinton during her 2008 speech at the Democratic national convention , when , quoting from Clintonâ€ ™ s concession speech , she praised â€œpeople like Hillary Clinton , who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling , so that our daughters â€ “ and our sons â€ “ can dream a little bigger and aim a little higherâ€ � .
Their bitterness softened when Clinton accepted the job as secretary of state but the nature of their relationship has remained a source of speculation .
During one of this yearâ€ ™ s presidential debates , Trump tried to undercut their relationship , recalling an oblique comment Obama made during the 2008 primary about keeping oneâ€ ™ s house in order , which some had interpreted as a swipe at the Clintonsâ€ ™ marital tribulations .
In context , Obama was explaining the importance of putting family first despite the rigors of a contested primary campaign .
But it was a clear sign that Obamaâ€ ™ s wide appeal and increasing presence on the trail was a threat to Trumpâ€ ™
s struggling campaign .
Last week , the first lady delivered a devastating riposte to Trump , in response to the release of a 2005 tape that showed the Republican nominee boasting that his fame enabled him to grab and kiss women without their consent .
â€œI
canâ€
™ t believe Iâ€ ™ m saying that â€ “ a candidate for President of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women , â€ � Obama said at an event in New Hampshire , her voice trembling and her hand placed over heart .
â€œI have to tell you that I canâ€
™ t stop thinking about this â€ “
it has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldnâ€ ™ t have predicted.â€
�
On the trail , Obama doesnâ€ ™ t only counter Trump , whose name she has not uttered once .
She also makes what many political observers argue is the most effective and clear case for Clinton , offering herself as a character witness .
In Winston - Salem on Thursday , any remnants of an old rivalry was overshadowed by their public show of mutual respect and admiration .
â€œIt takes a level of generosity of spirit to do what Hillary has done in her career and in her life for our family , for this nation , â€ � Obama said .
â€œIf people wonder , yes , Hillary Clinton is my friend.â€ �"

2016-11-01,"Barack and Michelle Obama gave local trick - or - treaters an upgrade on Monday , treating kids to a rendition of Thriller while passing out candy at the White House .
More than 4,000 people were expected to visit the White House for Halloween this year , including students from 15 schools in the Washington metropolitan area .
The president and the first lady danced along to Michael Jackson before handing out candy and baseball cards adorned with first dogs Bo and Sunny .
â€œWe hope , parents , that on this day at least , you donâ€ ™ t have to pay attention to Michelle and healthy eating , â€ � Obama told his guests .
The first lady agreed .
â€œCandy for everybody , â€ �
she said , to cheers from kids in the audience .
Obama didnâ€ ™ t stop singing with Thriller ; he crooned a few bars of Purple Rain after spotting a candy - seeker dressed as Prince .
Also in attendance this year :
Superman and a miniature President Obama .
Nothing , however , matched the moment last year when Obama spotted the adorable and topical costume of Pope Francis .

2016-11-08,"Standing in front of the building where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence , the nationâ€ ™ s
first black president urged American citizens to send the first woman to the White House in their 240-year history .
â€œIâ€ ™ m asking you to vote for this woman , this mother , this grandmother , to be the next president of the United States ,
â€ � Barack Obama said , introducing Hillary Clinton to tens of thousands of people who braved a chilly Monday night in Philadelphia .
Joining him were the first lady , Michelle Obama , former president Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton , a formidable show of force for one of Clintonâ€ ™ s final acts as Democratic candidate .
Music legends Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi served as warmup acts .
It was the largest event of Clintonâ€ ™ s 18-month campaign , drawing 33,000 people to the square .
The cityâ€ ™ s legacy , and the hope of creating history once more , dominated the eveningâ€ ™ s remarks .
â€œPhiladelphia , in this place where our founders forged the documents of freedom , in this place where they gave us the tools to perfect our union
, if you share my faith then I ask you to vote , â€ � Obama said .
His voice reverberated to the surrounding streets from speakers positioned for the thousands who could not gain entry but looked on from outside .
All told , an estimated 40,000 had descended upon the area hoping to bear witness to the climax of a gruelling election cycle .
The mood fluctuated from euphoric to meditative , at times urgent and emotional at the next turn .
Springsteen , whose music has long been inspired by the working class , soothed the crowd with performances of Thunder Road and Dancing in the Dark .
Between songs , the singer declared that the choice before them â€œcouldnâ€ ™ t be more clearâ€ � .
â€œLetâ€ ™ s all do our part so we can look back on 2016 and say we stood with Hillary Clinton on the right side of history , â€ � Springsteen said .
Characterising Trump as â€œa man whose vision is limited to little beyond himselfâ€ � , Springsteen said the Republican nominee held a â€œprofound lack of decency that would allow him to prioritise his own interests and ego before American democracy itselfâ€
�
. â€œTomorrow those ideas and that campaign are going down.â€ �
But it was the Obamas who captivated the audience with a pair of soaring speeches , delivered before the American electorate on what was likely their final national stage .
Michelle Obama , who emerged unexpectedly as Clintonâ€ ™ s most powerful surrogate , implored voters to grasp that presidential elections were â€œbreathtakingly closeâ€ � . â€œTomorrow , with your vote , you can stand up to those who seek to divide us , make us afraid ,
â€ � the first lady said .
â€œTomorrow , with your vote , you can say that this country has always been great , that it is the greatest nation on Earth.â€ �
Mounting the podium after his wife , Barack Obama echoed the unwavering optimism that twice propelled him to the highest office in the land .
â€œIn 2008 , you gave me a chance â€ “ a skinny guy with a funny name ,
â€ � the president said .
â€œYou bet on me all those years ago , and I will always be grateful for the privilege you gave me to serve.â€ �
â€œBut Iâ€ ™ ll be honest with you , â€ � he added .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve always had the better odds because Iâ€ ™ ve always bet on you .
And America , Iâ€ ™ m betting on you one more time.â€
�
It was a tough act for Clinton to follow , but such has often been the case for a candidate held to standards that were never imposed upon her male predecessors .
For much of her public life , Clinton has faced criticisms ranging from her smile to the cadence in her voice .
But it was unmistakably Clintonâ€ ™ s night .
Mounting the podium , she threw up her arms and looked to the skies .
She had one final rally to attend , 400 miles away in the battleground of North Carolina .
Clinton would be joined there by Lady Gaga , and Jon Bon Jovi once more , capping off the campaign that launched in April of 2015 with one last salvo .
But as Clinton stepped on stage in Philadelphia , she had inched one step closer to cementing her place in history .
To the jubilant supporters savouring the moment , she cautioned them that her fate remained in their hands .
â€œNone of us , none of us , â€ � Clinton said , â€œwant to wake up on Wednesday morning and wish we had done more.â€ �"
2016-11-08,"Candidates sign off on 2016 election campaigns The long , bitter presidential campaign is finally over and the two historically unpopular candidates have handed off to the nationâ€ ™ s 225,788,000 eligible voters .
At a monumental , final rally at Independence Hall in Philadelphia , Hillary Clinton , flanked by her husband , President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama promised a better future for the country and vowed to â€œbridge the dividesâ€ � that emerged during the campaign .
Obama , passing the torch to Clinton , echoed the themes of 2008 as he urged voters to â€œreject fear and embrace hopeâ€ � .
The party was joined on stage by Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi .
Meanwhile in Michigan , Republican candidate Donald Trump ended his campaign with a show of relative restraint : â€œWeâ€ ™ re hours away from a once - in - a - lifetime change , â€ �
Trump told thousands of supporters who waited until 12.30am to see him .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to have real change , not Obama change.â€

Trumpâ€

legacy : GOP civil war
â€œItâ€ ™ s a movement , not a campaign.â€ � Of all the outlandish assertions to emerge from Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s mouth , this one is by far the most credible .
Win or lose , Trump has catalyzed a movement that has destroyed the conventional wisdom â€ “ and the establishment â€ “ that has led the Republican party for a generation , writes Richard Wolffe .
Whether he built the movement or simply rode its wave , Trump has profoundly reshaped the politics of the Grand Old Party .

â€œI donâ€ ™ t want to have a say in government , â€ � said Frank Archambault , a 45-year - old member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe .

After local Democratic parties in six battleground states filed lawsuits against Trump adviser Roger Stoneâ€ ™ s voter fraud monitoring project , the Republican operative released new rules for volunteer monitors and pledged to a Nevada judge that he â€œwill not target voters based on their raceâ€ � .
But election monitors remain concerned that voter intimidation could still occur .
Stone , an informal Trump adviser , said he was concerned that the Republican party in Ohio would try to manipulate votes to undermine Trump , and said that the Stop the Steal fraud prevention project was a â€œneutral processâ€ � .

2016-11-10,"Melania Trump Trumpâ€ ™ s wife of 11 years has been the subject of great scrutiny and even ridicule during her husbandâ€ ™ s divisive campaign .
The former model , 46 , stood by Trump after a video of him bragging about groping women â€ “ recorded the year they were married â€ “ surfaced , and 13 women accused him of unwanted sexual advances .
She made headlines during the Republican national convention when she was accused of plagiarizing a section of her speech from Michelle Obama .
Towards the end of the campaign , she called for less bullying online , which puzzled many onlookers given her husbandâ€ ™ s use of inflammatory language on Twitter .
Ivanka Trump Trumpâ€
™ s
daughter , a vice - president at his company , was placed in one of the most difficult positions of all the Trump family members during this campaign .
The former model who owns a number of businesses , including a clothing line and a jewelry line , has long positioned herself as an advocate for womenâ€ ™ s rights , and converted to Judaism when she married Jared Kushner .
Yet her fatherâ€ ™ s campaign became mired in charges of misogyny , and dog - whistle antisemitism .
Trump , 35 , is a close friend of Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s daughter Chelsea and donated to Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign in 2007 .
But she was steadfast in her support for her father and rarely criticized his comments about groping women on a leaked Access Hollywood tape , nor his stance on abortion .
Vitriol for her father spilled over to her when a call to boycott her clothes gained some steam in the last weeks of the election .
Eric Trump Eric Trump has been a regular feature throughout his fatherâ€ ™ s campaign , appearing on television and at campaign stops .
Like his siblings , he holds an executive role at the Trump Organization .
His charity , the Eric Trump Foundation , was caught up in an extensive investigation into Trumpâ€ ™ s charitable donations by the Washington Post when Trump , 32 , said his father had donated to it but then backtracked when asked for details .
He and his brother Donald Trump Jr have been criticized for hunting big animals such as leopards and crocodiles .
He was also accused of breaking New York State law on election day by tweeting a picture of his ballot .
He married Lara Yunaska two years ago .
Donald Trump Jr
One of three children from Trumpâ€ ™ s first marriage with Ivana , Donald Trump Jr , 38 , has been extremely active on the campaign trail for his father .
Like his siblings , he works in the family business , The Trump Organization , and has appeared on The Apprentice .
He drew criticism during the campaign when he tweeted a picture comparing Syrian refugees to deadly Skittles ; he was also on the big game hunting trip with his brother .
He is married to model Vanessa Kay Haydon , with whom he has five children .
Tiffany Trump Tiffany Trump has been the least visible of his older children during this campaign .
She is the daughter of Trumpâ€ ™ s second wife Marla Maples .
She recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania , maintains a popular Instagram account , and has tried her hand at pop music .
She is perceived as being less close to her father than his other adult children .
Jared Kushner Kushner is married to Trumpâ€ ™ s daughter Ivanka .
He is CEO of his familyâ€ ™ s real estate company and owner of the New York Observer .
His vocal support for his father - in - law throughout this campaign put his ownership of the Observer in the spotlight .
One of the paperâ€ ™ s reporters wrote a piece calling out Kushner for his role in the campaign , after Trump was accused of antisemitism for tweeting a picture of the Star of David in an attack of Hillary Clinton .
Kushner , who is Jewish , used the paper to defend Trump .
He became a close adviser to the now president - elect over the course of the campaign .
Lara Yunaska Eric Trumpâ€ ™
s
wife of two years has kept a low - profile during the presidential campaign .
She works as a producer at Inside Edition and was formerly a personal trainer .
She is on the board of directors of the Eric Trump Foundation and is an active animal welfare advocate with groups such as the North Shore Animal League of America , the largest no - kill animal rescue and adoption organization in the world â€ “ a position which arguably conflicts with her husbandâ€ ™ s love of hunting .
Barron Trump Trump reportedly calls his 10-year old son , the only child of his marriage to Melania , â€œLittle Donaldâ€ � , and the two enjoy playing golf together ."
2016-11-11,"When Michelle Obama took the Democratic national convention by storm this year â€ “ and again when she gave a barnstorming speech attacking Donald Trump last month
â€ “ the impact she had came as no surprise to Neil Sroka .
As multimedia director for Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s nascent presidential campaign , Sroka witnessed firsthand the future first ladyâ€ ™ s power of oratory in Orangeburg , South Carolina .
â€œIt was directed to African American women , â€ �
he recalled of the speech she made in November 2007 .
â€œThey thought if heâ€ ™ s elected , he would be shot and killed .
She said , â€˜Weâ€ ™ ve talked about this as a family and we want to do it.â€
™
It was an incredibly important speech.â€ � Nine years later , Michelle Obama again inspired voters on the trail , this time in an attempt to defend her husbandâ€ ™ s legacy .
Many hailed her as the standout performer in Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s crowded field of surrogates .
Indeed , she had a popularity rating that the defeated Clinton would envy and , it might be argued , eclipsed the candidate she was championing .
So , what happens in the next act ?
Obama will turn 53 on 17 January 2017 and leave the White House three days later .
She and her husband will remain in Washington , in the upmarket neighbourhood of Kalorama , while their younger daughter , Sasha , finishes high school .
They will also spend time in Chicago working on the Obama Foundation , whose website pictures them arm in arm and quotes her as saying : â€œThere are still so many causes worth sacrificing for .
There is still so much history yet to be made.â€ �
But the rest is open to conjecture .
Obamaâ€ ™ s heartfelt speeches embodied anti -
Trump sentiment and left audiences in tears .
One Trump aide reportedly opined that only she could match the Republican nomineeâ€
™ s ability to viscerally connect with voters .
With Clinton having gained significantly fewer votes than Barack Obama and the Democrats seeking a new standard bearer , there may now be some wishful thinking for Michelle Obama to launch a political career of her own .
Yet the notion has been debunked time and again .
The president told TV host Jimmy Kimmel last month : â€œMichelle was never wild about politics .
Michelle once explained to me , â€˜I try to organise my life not to have a lot of mess around , and politics is just a big mess.â€ ™ â€ �
David Axelrod , the Obama campaign mastermind , told conservative talk radio that he â€œwould bet everything I ownâ€
� against the prospect of her running for office .
And one family friend , who did not wish to be named , told the Guardian : â€œShe hates this.â€
�
Sroka agrees .
Now communications director for the liberal campaign group Democracy for America , he said : â€œI would be incredibly shocked if the first lady ended up in politics herself .
There is a tendency to believe the past is prologue because former first lady Hillary Clinton has been such a big political figure , but
I donâ€ ™ t think thatâ€ ™ s
the case.â€ �
Obama has become adept at using media appearances â€ “ most memorably James Cordenâ€ ™ s carpool karaoke â€ “ to promote worthy causes to mass audiences .
She is unique in spanning politics , popular culture and social change , Sroka added .
â€œPart of the reason that sheâ€ ™
s
such a powerful public figure is that she sits outside politics .
She lives outside the bubble of the presidency as much as you can in that position.â€
�
â€œAs
soon as she became a politician , she would lose a lot of that power , â€ � Sroka said .
â€œThere are a lot of ways to become a moral leader of a country without running for office .
From everything Iâ€ ™ ve read , I think she sees that too.â€ � Historian Joshua Kendall , author of First Dads , a study of presidents and their families , takes a similar view .
â€œRight now she transcends politics
even though sheâ€ ™ s campaigning for Hillary Clinton , â€ �
he said in a pre - election interview .
â€œSheâ€ ™ s the moral centre of America .
Sheâ€ ™ s campaigning on moral grounds , not political grounds .
It looks like when she leaves the office sheâ€ ™ s going to have some kind of moral capital .
â€œSheâ€
™ s going to want to take the moral high ground and do something with it .
The Hillary Clinton model of senator and president is off the table .
Sheâ€ ™ s been saying , and Clinton has been quoting ,
â€˜When they go low , we go high.â€ ™
I think she feels politics is very dirty and
she doesnâ€ ™ t want to be in the gutter.â€ �
Certain threads running through Obamaâ€ ™ s career offer a clue as to her potential future causes .
In her Orangeburg remarks nine years ago , she talked about her father working hard in a blue - collar job and her grandfather who never went to college but â€œfilled my brother and me with big dreams about the lives we could leadâ€ � .
She went on : â€œSo these were the voices I was hearing growing up .
And they gave me the strength and courage to overcome the doubt and fear I was hearing in other corners of my community .
From classmates who thought a black girl with a book was acting white .
From teachers who told me not to reach too high because my test scores were too low .
And from well - meaning but misguided folks who said , â€˜No , you canâ€ ™ t , â€ ™ â€˜Youâ€ ™ re not smart enough , â€ ™ and â€˜Youâ€ ™ re not readyâ€ ™ .
Who said , â€˜Success isnâ€ ™ t meant for little black girls from the South Side of Chicago.â€ ™
â€œAnd you know what ?
When I listened to my own voice and cast the cynics aside , when I forged ahead and overcame the doubts and fears of others about who I was and what I could become , I found that their doubts and fears were misplaced.â€ �
This subject â€ “ extending opportunity and self - belief to inner cities , resisting the soft bigotry of low expectations â€ “ has been a recurring theme of Obamaâ€ ™
s eight years in the White House .
In a commencement address on the South Side of Chicago last year , she told students how she felt overwhelmed and out of place when she started at Princeton University while others brimmed with self - confidence .
Sroka said : â€œShe can speak with real clarity about the opportunities available to children now and , frankly , the opportunities that are not open any more due to inequality and the shrinking social safety net .
That gives her the ability to help others to reach for big things.â€ �
Kendall added : â€œShe seems very concerned about the next generation .
She knows the huge difference an Ivy League education made in her life and has the sense that minorities should make use of those pathways and they shouldnâ€ ™ t be considered out of reach for people in inner cities.â€ �
The Obama Foundation is likely to take a lower profile than its Clinton counterpart , Kendall believes .
â€œBill Clintonâ€ ™ s megabucks nonprofit path may be off the table because of all the grief the Clintons have got .
The [ Jimmy ] Carter Center might be more of a model for the Obamas .
It is extremely above board in its donors , and there hasnâ€ ™ t been a shred of scandal around them.â€ � Obama might study the route taken by first ladies who have gone before .
Eleanor Roosevelt served as a US delegate to the UN .
â€œLady
Birdâ€ � Johnson became a prominent environmentalist .
Betty Ford helped establish centres for treatment of alcohol and drug addiction .
Obamaâ€ ™ s predecessor , Laura Bush , served as an honorary ambassador for the UN literacy decade , promotes health issues and serves on multiple boards .
Anita McBride , who was chief of staff to Bush from 2005 to 2009 , noted that Obama had led initiatives to improve childrenâ€ ™ s diets and promote education for girls around the world and is likely to continue with both .
â€œClearly sheâ€ ™ s created a national movement on childhood obesity and is likely to stay engaged in some way.â€ � A UN ambassadorial role , perhaps with the childrenâ€ ™ s agency Unicef , might be a good fit .
And inevitably there is the prospect of public speaking and a memoir .
McBride , now at American University in Washington , said : â€œMost presidents and first ladies also focus on writing a book .
They owe it to themselves and they owe it to history to do that .
Everyone else has written about her , so itâ€ ™ s a chance to give her version.â€ �
Obamaâ€ ™ s
favourite word in recent months has been â€œbittersweetâ€ � as she cycles through the calendar of events for the last time .
She has also made clear there are things she will not miss as a private citizen , such as a permanent security detail .
Her style is likely to contrast with Melania Trump , the first foreign - born first lady since Louisa Adams in the 1820s , who is a former model with little known interest in humanitarian or feminist causes and seems likely to play a more traditional role .
The pair met for tea at the White House on Thursday ahead of a potentially awkward transition .
McBride noted that Laura and George W Bush were realists and always knew they would be leaving after eight years .
â€œYou can logistically and physically prepare yourself .
It was unlike her father - in - law George HW Bush , who only served one term ; that departure was a lot more abrupt.â€ �
Last month Obama bade farewell to staff at her beloved White House vegetable garden .
â€œI
didnâ€
™ t just take on this issue as first lady , I took it on because Iâ€ ™ m a mother who cares deeply about the health and well - being of my daughters , â€ �
she said .
â€œI took it on because Iâ€ ™ m a citizen who loves this country and cares deeply about the future of all of our kids .
â€œSo I intend to keep working on this issue for the rest of my life.â€ �"
2016-11-13,"For most of the presidential campaign , Melania Trump was notable more for what she didnâ€ ™ t say than what she did .
When she finally took center stage , at the Republican convention in July , her words turned out to be borrowed in part from the woman she will now follow into the White House , Michelle Obama .
Trump was reportedly mortified by the error , which brought forth Broadway star Laura Benantiâ€ ™ s first impersonation on late - night TV .
For much of the campaigning that followed , Melania preferred to stay in the marbled confines of Trump Tower , rather than canvass the country her husband is now preparing to lead .
Less than a week before election day , she emerged to speak in Berwyn , in Chester County , Pennsylvania .
â€œI am a full - time mother to our son Barron , an incredible boy , â€ �
she said .
â€œAs his father travels around the country running for president , I am with our son .
â€œWe talk a little bit about politics and a lot about life , homework and sports .
Barron has many privileges and advantages .
We know how fortunate we are.â€ �
In light of the release in early October of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which he was heard to brag about groping women , and numerous subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct and assault , pre - election polling gave Trump dismal approval ratings with women .
Melania Trumpâ€ ™ s speech in Berwyn was billed as an attempt to soften her husbandâ€ ™ s coarse image with white suburban women .
On Tuesday , he lost Chester County .
But he won Pennsylvania , a state that had voted Democratic since 1992 .
Nationwide , a majority of white women voted for him .
Who is Melania Trump ?
Melania Trump was born to a textile worker and a car spares trader in Sevnica , Slovenia , on 26 April 1970 .
She has described an idyllic childhood , surrounded by forests and rivers .
More weighty details are scarce : in September , many residents of Sevnica told the Guardian they remembered nothing of the young Melania .
â€œIn the socialist days we were all the same , â€ � said one woman , of around the same age as Trump .
In her speech in Berwyn , Melania recalled waking one morning as a 10-year - old girl to learn that Ronald Reagan â€ “ whose slogan â€œLetâ€ ™ s Make America Great Againâ€
�
Trump adapted for his own campaign â€ “ had won the American presidency .
â€œPresident
Reaganâ€ ™
s
Morning in America was not just something in the United States , â€ � she said .
â€œIt began to feel like morning around the world , even in my small country .
It was a true inspiration to me.â€
�
She became a model , and her career whisked her from Ljubljana to Milan and Paris and , in 1996 , New York .
â€œFashion is a business of glamour but it is also hard work , â€ �
she said in the Berwyn speech .
â€œThere are ups and downs , high highs and ridicule and rejection too .
I loved my work and as a young entrepreneur I wanted to follow my dreams to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance .
So of course I came here.â€
�
Two years later , she met Trump at a party at the Kit Kat Club in Manhattan .
In her telling she initially rebuffed the businessman , 24 years her elder , because he had arrived with another woman and had recently separated from his second wife , Marla Maples .
Trump persisted .
They broke up briefly in 2000 , around the time Trump considered running for president as a candidate for the Reform party .
Asked at the time what kind of first lady she would be , Melania replied : â€œI would be very traditional â€ “ like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy .
I would support him.â€
�
They married in 2005 , at his own Mar - a - Lago Club resort in Palm Beach , Florida , inviting 450 guests including Bill and Hillary Clinton and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , now a close Trump surrogate and adviser .
Barron , who is 10 , is their only child .
In her Pennsylvania speech , Melania described the grueling 10-year process to obtain her US citizenship , which she called the â€œgreatest privilege in the worldâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ m an immigrant , and let me tell you that nobody values the freedom and opportunity of America more than me , â€ � she said .
Her husband launched his campaign with a call to arms against illegal immigration , and has repeatedly called for the deportation of people who violate the terms of their immigration status .
A week before the election , the Associated Press reported that Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the US , worth $ 20,056 , which were fulfilled in the seven weeks before she obtained legal permission to work in the country .
Trumpâ€
™ s lawyer flatly rejected the report .
In September , lawyers for Melania sued the Daily Mail for $ 150 m over similar reports about her past .
â€˜Spill the beansâ€ ™
As stories about her immigration status illustrated , though she attempted to remain behind the scenes , Melania has failed to escape the spotlight in one of the most caustic campaigns in history .
In August , after nude photographs resurfaced online , her husband wrongly accused his primary opponent Ted Cruz of involvement in the leak , and in retaliation threatened to â€œspill the beansâ€ � on Cruzâ€ ™ s own wife .
Melania Trump was also forced to release a statement that said she had accepted her husbandâ€ ™ s apology after the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape , which was recorded just after their marriage .
In an interview with CNN , Melania Trump called subsequent allegations against her husband â€œliesâ€ � , part of a coordinated campaign to smear him .
She also dismissed his language on the tape as â€œboy talkâ€ � , and said he had been â€œled onâ€
� by the Access Hollywood host , Billy Bush .
An opinion poll taken in August , after the Republican convention , found that Melania Trump was much less popular than Michelle Obama or her counterpart in the 2016 race , Bill Clinton : 38 % of Americans viewed her favorably and 42 % viewed her unfavorably while 20 % said they had either never heard of her or had no opinion .
The Gallup poll found that Trumpâ€ ™ s popularity rose 10 points after her primetime convention address , but so did her unfavorables once controversy over her speech flared up .
In her Berwyn speech , without a hint of irony , Melania Trump said that as first lady she would work to combat online bullying and harassment .
Throughout the campaign , her husband used Twitter to antagonize , attack and harass political opponents , critics , women , minorities and anyone at all who provoked him .
Regardless , Melania Trump said : â€œOur culture has gotten too mean and too rough , especially to children and teenagers .
It is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet.â€ �
In October , she told CNNâ€ ™ s Anderson Cooper
she was not shy in giving her husband further advice , such as to â€œgive up the tweetingâ€ � .
In Pennsylvania , in closing , she said : â€œI will be there to support my husbandâ€ ™ s efforts to help all Americans when he is president .
Donald Trump will make America fair .
He will make America safe .
â€œHe will make America prosperous .
He will make America proud .
And , yes , this man I know so well , Donald Trump , with your help and Godâ€ ™ s grace , will make America great again.â€ �"
2016-11-15,"A West Virginia county worker was fired after penning a racist Facebook post calling first lady Michelle Obama an â€œape in heelsâ€ � .
â€œIt will be refreshing to have a classy , beautiful , dignified First Lady in the White House .
Iâ€ ™ m tired of seeing a Ape in heels , â€ �
posted Clay County Development Corporationâ€ ™ s then director Pamela Ramsey Taylor to Facebook
following Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidential win last week .
Underneath Taylorâ€ ™ s post , Clayâ€ ™ s mayor , Beverly Whaling , voiced her approval : â€œJust made my day Pam.â€ � Whaling resigned from her post on Tuesday following a backlash , including a petition calling for her termination that had garnered more than 121,000 signatures as of midday Tuesday after she posted her response to the racist comment , now deleted , about the first lady .
The Clay town council accepted Mayor Whalingâ€ ™ s resignation in a meeting late on Tuesday afternoon and said it would act quickly to name a replacement for the remaining three years of her term .
Council member Jason Hubbard issued a brief statement condemning the â€œhorrificâ€ � post and said â€œracial intolerance isnâ€ ™ t what this community is aboutâ€
� .
He apologized on behalf of the town to anyone who was offended , including Michelle Obama .
In a statement to the Washington Post , Whaling said : â€œMy comment was not intended to be racist at all .
I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House !
I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused !
Those who know me know that Iâ€ ™ m not of any way racist !
Again , I would like to apologize for this getting out of hand!â€ � Taylor apologized on Facebook , but both women have now deleted their accounts .
Taylor told local news station WSAZ-3 that the response â€ “ including death threats â€ “ to her racist comments have become a â€œhate crime against meâ€ �
and she is looking to sue people who she says have slandered her .
Neither Taylor nor Whaling could be contacted for comment .

2016-11-30,"The launch of Cefinn , a new fashion brand by Samantha Cameron , confirms that first lady chic is the defining look of our era .
They say that the mood of a decade crystallises halfway through and , as this one comes into focus , the preeminent style icons are variations on the theme of soft power .
From the Duchess of Cambridgeâ€ ™ s globally documented royal wardrobe to Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s three Vogue covers , the consort in the corridors of power is the supermodel of our time .
That our focus has drifted away from policy and toward the more glamorous , ephemeral elements of public life is so 2016 .
That Samantha Cameron is the first first lady to embark on the spousal equivalent of the after - dinner speech circuit by monetising the modern obsession with her wardrobe is a mark of Cameronâ€ ™ s instinctive grasp of fashion , business and the modern world .
( Those who quibble that Samantha Cameron was never , technically , a first lady might want to consider whether they are guilty of the kind of pedantic establishment mindset that the global electorate has summarily rejected this year . )
In her pre - Downing - Street life , Cameron was creative director of Smythson , where she was credited with being instrumental in turning a highly traditional stationery brand into a fashion force to be reckoned with .
Smythsonâ€ ™ s
most successful luxury piece was the 2007 Nancy bag , which Cameron named after her daughter ; after she reduced her involvement following the 2010 election , the brand struggled to remain in the limelight .
During her tenure in Downing Street , Cameron strengthened her links to the fashion industry as a dedicated ambassador for British designers , working closely with the British Fashion Council .
She has made no secret of her intention to remain in the industry , attending Theresa Mayâ€ ™ s first London Fashion Week reception earlier this autumn .
Her fashionable connections â€ “ her sister Emily Sheffield is deputy editor of Vogue â€
“ made her a natural fit for the front row .
Cameron also proved herself adept at using fashion as a messaging tool .
When she wore Zaraâ€ ™ s bright orange trousers and Â£29.99 grey suede heels to the Conservative Party conference in 2011 , the image of a Prime Ministerâ€ ™ s wife who â€ “ despite being the daugher of a baronet
â€ “ was both modern and â€œnormalâ€ � was highly impactful .
Cefinn will go on sale on Net - a - Porter and Selfridges early in 2017 , around the same time that Jackie â€ “ a biopic of the most iconic of first ladies , starring Natalie Portman â€ “ arrives in cinemas .
Few details have as yet been released , but prices are likely to sit in the low - three - figure middle ground between high street and luxury .
It is thought that the name is drawn from the first and last letters of the Cameron name , bookending the initials of coupleâ€ ™ s four children Elwen , Florence , Ivan and Nancy .
The images so far released by the Cefinn brand feature the same outfit , in two colourways .
A mid - calf length skirt is worn with a matching sleeveless shell top ; the â€œcoordâ€ � , in fashion parlance , comes in grey with a windowpane cream check , or fashionâ€ ™ s favourite , solid black .
Both versions have an orange stripe at the shoulder .
The hemline is key here , because a long skirt is on trend , demure enough for professional life and wearable by an older demographic â€ “ but the sleeveless top is equally important , representing a generation of women over-40 who remain fitness - conscious and youthful in outlook , and who are not ready to be fobbed off with dresses designed to hide bingo wings .
The pop of orange , and the subtle dip of the skirtâ€ ™ s asymmetric hemline are the kind of details that make clothes special and give the modern consumer that all - important reason to buy .
Influences from some of the many London fashion week shows that Cameron has attended â€ “ from Roksanda to Whistles â€ “ can be felt here ."
2016-12-03,"At school , I was a prefect .
I am a goody two - shoes , so I relished the job .
I took it seriously , sometimes tracing the little green prefectâ€ ™ s badge on my collar with pride .
Yes , it was a figurehead position , but it meant something to me .
I reckon Michelle Obama feels a version of this ( to the power of 1,000 ) .
The office of the first lady of the US is a weird , elevated mantle to uphold , a semi - archaic symbol with limited power , but , gosh ,
sheâ€ ™ s worn it so well .
Like so many accomplished women before her , Michelle Obama , 52 , first came to wider attention as a political spouse .
After that , the magazine profiles started : raised in Chicago , studied at Princeton and then Harvard law school , mother to two girls .
Every article noted her brainpower and then mentioned how it would have to take the back seat to her husbandâ€ ™ s career .
I try to think of it
â€ “ shelving a promising career for your much - loved spouseâ€ ™ s ambitions â€ “
and I get a little sad .
But Michelle Obama never looks sad about it .
Itâ€ ™ s worth noting her grace in all this : smiling for the cameras , making incendiary speeches , promoting childrenâ€ ™ s healthy living , raising her daughters , and even the indignity of Carpool Karaoke .
And to be doing it under a cloud of disrespect , resentment and overt racism
â€ “
well , what a dame .
And not that it matters , but she looks amazing ( hello , three Vogue covers ) .
At the Democratic convention in July , I watched an arena of people lose their cool and swoon over her .
It was difficult not to join them .
Is she perfect ?
No one is .
But Iâ€ ™ m not ready to say goodbye .
Good luck to her successor , because , man , those boots will take some filling ."
2016-12-03,"Number 10 Downing Street took delivery of its Christmas tree yesterday , just a few days after Michelle Obama unveiled her last - ever festive decorations for the White House .
Meanwhile , radio and TV adverts implore us to pop down to our local garden centre this weekend as the eight million firs and spruces that Brits will buy this season are lined up for the first major rush .
But is buying a tree on 3 December too early â€ “ and also a tad vulgar ?
If you think they appear to have arrived early this year , youâ€ ™ re right .
Normally the second and third weekends of December are the major selling points .
But as Christmas falls on a weekend , major retailers reckon that families will be buying this weekend , or on the weekend of the 10th , rather than waiting until the 17th .
Bah humbug ?
Lots of people may think so .
â€œFlogging Christmas trees in November , or the first few days of December , is just another example of tinsel - coated crass consumerism , â€ � says Simon Birch , a writer for Ethical Consumer magazine .
â€œThe truth is that corporate - fuelled pressure on shoppers to buy , buy , buy is both driving people into debt and putting the environment under unsustainable pressure.â€ �
Others will say 3 December is too early because the needles will start dropping well before Christmas Day .
Retailers â€ “ and maybe itâ€ ™ s not surprising
that they would say this â€ “ are spinning a different line : according to Wyevale Garden Centresâ€ ™ tree buyer , David Mitchell , who has sourced more than 100,000 trees for the chain this year , buying in the first week of December is actually better than leaving it until later .
â€œAll the trees are cut in the fields at roughly the same time , in the last two weeks of November.â€ �
His argument is that the sooner you buy your tree and put it into some water at home , the better .
Otherwise they are just sat in stores drying out .
By his logic , trees bought in early December are less likely to shed their needles by Christmas Day than ones bought later .
So what should you be buying , where , and at what price ?
Aim to pay the same or less than last year The British Christmas Tree Growers Association ( BCTGA ) says prices should be roughly the same as last year .
Wyevale has held its prices for the third year , with the average 5ft-6 ft tree costing around Â£35 .
But on Sunday 4 December , Aldi launches its 5ft-6 ft Nordmann fir for Â£19.99 , while Ikea is again selling its trees for Â£25 , but you also get a Â£20 voucher redeemable in - store if you return between 16 January and 12 February , making the tree effectively just Â£5 .
Taller trees , meanwhile , go for tall prices : upmarket Clifton Nursery in Maida Vale , London , is selling a 10 ft Nordmann fir for Â£235 , while John Lewis is offering a free in - store â€œtreetorialâ€ � for those aiming to make their tree a â€œshowstopperâ€ � .
For another Â£200 you can buy its â€œfull festive worksâ€ � tree decorating service .
Someone evidently forgot the memo about austerity Britain .
Brexit means British trees this year Oslo famously donates the big tree in Trafalgar Square as a grateful thank you for British support to Norway during the second world war .
But according to the BCTGA , around 75 % of Christmas trees are now home grown .
Cheap imports from Scandinavian countries ( Denmark is actually a much bigger supplier than Norway ) have been hit by the falling pound , it says .
Wyevaleâ€ ™ s
Mitchell says it gets the majority of its trees from Ireland , but claims to have seen Brexit coming , so did some hedging .
We donâ€
™ t think he was joking .
Others , however , say that massive planting of trees six to eight years ago in Denmark means it will be flooding the UK this year with cheap trees , irrespective of sterlingâ€ ™ s decline .
Recent early frosts have been a bonus
Last autumn was wet and mild .
This year has been ideal , say growers , with early frosts in Scotland helping to send trees into semi - hibernation .
This is a good thing , experts say , as it means the trees last longer after being cut down .
Frosts bring out a waxy resin on the needles that helps keep the moisture in .
Spindly tops are a rip - off Most buyers want something between 5 ft and 6 ft high .
A four - foot - sixer can be passed off as 6 ft if it has grown a long spindle , but thatâ€ ™ s unfair on buyers , says Mitchell , who talks darkly of rival chainsâ€ ™ behaviour .
Itâ€ ™ s a viciously competitive market out there .
Nordmann firs remain the favourite , but look out for new - style Swedes Nordmanns have conquered the market with their non - drop needles .
They make up 80 % of trees bought by British households , says Harry Brightwell of the BCTGA .
Norway spruces , once the most popular , account for just 15 % of sales .
The â€œnew - style Swedesâ€ � are Nordmann firs that have been specially cultivated to have thinned - out branches and a lighter frame , making them easier to carry home and with more space for gifts .
Other varieties such as the Fraser fir are a little pricier , but growers claim they have better â€œneedle retentionâ€ � .
The Korean fir is also catching on , noted for its two - tone green and silver needles and â€œrefreshing aromaâ€ � .
The fragrance of a real tree is why many people say they prefer them , but keep an eye out for that hardy annual tabloid headline , â€œCould YOU be allergic to your Christmas tree?â€ � .
Moulds that grow on trees
can , it seems , trigger asthma attacks , sneezing and a runny nose , say researchers , some of whom are not even sponsored by manufacturers of hay fever remedies .
It even has a name : Christmas Tree Syndrome .
Saw a half - inch off when you get home
Experts say that cutting half an inch off the base of your tree is a good trick to keep it looking healthy for longer .
Brightwell at the BCTGA says you should ideally leave it outdoors in a large bucket filled with water for a day or two before bringing it inside .
Once inside , keep it watered and place it away from radiators and open fires , which somewhat destroys the Christmas card look many try to achieve .
Recycle it
Most councils now offer free collection in early January so that trees are recycled .
But are real Christmas trees simply a decadent waste of resources that are bad for the environment ?
The Guardian wrestled with this question in 2008 pointing out that most trees are intensively farmed on an industrial scale and are typically sprayed with potent fertilisers and herbicides .
As such they are hardly a haven for biodiversity .
But we also pointed out that artificial trees arenâ€ ™ t necessarily an eco - alternative , and are usually plastic tat produced thousands of miles away and shipped around the planet for our seasonal gratification .
They will , of course , last longer , but when thrown out are not biodegradable .
Our advice was to find a tree that has been farmed sustainably â€ “ look at the Soil Association and Forest Stewardship Council sites for guidance .
And try to find a tree grown close to home rather than imported from overseas ."
2016-12-08,"Should the hypothesised invitation to Buckingham Palace arrive , Melania Trump will not be able to do as Michelle Obama did and have Tom Ford run up a gown for the occasion .
Neither will Marc Jacobs , Phillip Lim or Sophie Theallet
â€ “ labels of choice for the current first lady
â€ “ be taking her calls .
All of these designers have taken a stand against the incoming administration by making it clear that , as of the inauguration in January , dressing the first lady will cease to be an honour they choose to accept .
This makes no material difference whatsoever .
Melania Trump will continue to wear designer clothes of her choice , simply by paying for them .
She bought both the white Roksanda â€œMargotâ€ � dress she wore for her Republican convention speech and the Balmain camel coat in which she cast her vote on Net - A - Porter , paying around Â£1,000 and Â£2,500 respectively .
Fashion industry website Womenâ€ ™
s
Wear Daily reported that the Ralph Lauren jumpsuit she wore for her husbandâ€ ™ s victory speech , which retails for around Â£3,000 , was purchased at full price at Laurenâ€ ™ s Madison Avenue boutique .
So it is fascinating that Ford , Jacobs and co seem to believe that by not dressing Melania Trump they can curb her powers .
That by withholding their tailoring skills and their blessing from the first lady , the fashion establishment can somehow keep in check the powers of the Trump administration .
As if New York fashion week could stop the Trumps from overstepping the mark , should Congress and the supreme court fail to do so .
Perhaps they can .
The link between fashion and politics is stronger now than at any time since Jackie Kennedy .
Last week it emerged that Samantha Cameron had repurposed the family dining room as a dressmaking studio during her husbandâ€ ™ s time in office , in preparation for the launch of her new fashion brand , Cefinn .
That a fashion house born out of Downing Street has been accepted as a natural extension of a power coupleâ€ ™ s
brand speaks volumes about the extent to which style has infiltrated political discourse .
Jackie , the soon - to - be - released Hollywood biopic starring Natalie Portman as JFKâ€ ™ s widow , takes place over the three days following the assassination of the president in November 1963 .
But it is the first ladyâ€ ™ s wardrobe that is at the heart of this film : the pink Chanel tweed spattered with blood ; the black widowâ€ ™ s veil against the stark backdrop of a White House .
Glamour and fashion are foregrounded , while the nuts and bolts of political grind are lost in the shadows .
A film about politics as theatre and about the dynamic of male - female relationships amplified by power itself , Jackie will arrive in cinemas , with uncanny timing , around the time of the inauguration .
When the young widow insists that the public mourning of her husband â€œhas to be beautiful â€ ¦ a big , beautiful funeral everyone will rememberâ€
�
, her instinctive grasp of how aesthetics can shape history feels very modern .
The hostility towards Melania Trump runs against the grain of the fault line that has dominated recent debate about women in political life .
From Cherie Blair in her nightie to Hillary Clintonâ€
™ s scrunchie , most flashpoints have been around women refusing to expend the effort required to conform to celebrity levels of glamour .
Trump , by contrast , is too gaudy for some .
â€œShe looks like something out of The Only Way is Essex in those tight - fitting , mono - coloured dresses , â€ � sneered a Spectator blog .
That she is reviled for being too glamorous , while Clinton was criticised for being too dowdy , pinpoints the impossibly narrow standards to which women are held .
In the iconography of first lady style , it is Jackie Kennedy or bust .
Passing judgment on clothes is a coded way to upbraid women in political life for stepping outside the slender parameters of what is deemed acceptable .
Theresa May came under fire this week for a pair of leather trousers she was pictured wearing for a newspaper interview .
The ostensible objection to the price tag of Â£995 was nonsensical :
David Cameron wore suits costing more , while Samantha Cameron was routinely admired in dresses by Peter Pilotto or Emilia Wickstead , which cost around the same .
Mayâ€ ™ s real fashion crime was to choose leather trousers
â€ “ still a mark of rebellion , on a woman .
Like leopard print and over - the - knee boots , both of which May is also fond of , leather trousers suggest a level of insubordination .
An independently minded woman â€ “ or as Ken Clarke might have it , a bloody difficult one .
Such crass assessments reflect that how a woman looks is often conflated with the person she is .
This does not happen to men .
A man is not defined by his hair , his suit or tie , because the world takes it as read that such things are just part of an identity that is allowed to be
â€ “ expected to be ,
even â€ “ complex and subtle .
As Jackie Kennedy grasped over half a century ago as she planned her husbandâ€ ™ s televised funeral , an ever - more - visual culture changes how politics works .
Fashion is part of the political picture now .
A little more sophistication in the debate about what women in politics wear would be , as we say in fashion , a good look ."
2016-12-16,"She did not mention the election or Donald Trump once .
But Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s message about diversity and inclusiveness was clear .
The first African American first lady addressed a gathering of students â€ “ many of them young black women â€ “ at the White House on Thursday after a screening of Hidden Figures , a new biopic of three black female mathematicians who helped launch Americans into space .
The 16-minute speech was a far cry from the recent election campaign , where she made rousing interventions on behalf of Hillary Clinton , but Obamaâ€ ™ s remarks about race and gender were shot through with the new political reality .
â€œLook at this eight years
, â€ � she said .
â€œWe were supposed to be hidden .
People didnâ€ ™ t even want to believe we were real .
But here we are , eight years later.â€ �
The audience applauded and whooped .
Obama , wearing black , added somewhat somberly :
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s up to all of you , our young people , to continue that legacy .
Itâ€ ™ s your turn now .
All right?â€ �
It has been a year of bittersweet farewells for Obama .
But since the brutal surprise of Trumpâ€ ™ s election win , there was now a subdued , steely tone as she described some lessons from the film , directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Taraji P Henson , Janelle MonÃ¡e , Octavia Spencer and Kevin Costner .
Outlining the racial and gender discrimination that faced â€œhuman computersâ€ �
Katherine Johnson , Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson
, Obama said : â€œBut they didnâ€ ™ t listen to those doubters .
You understand ?
They did not listen to the haters â€ “ because theyâ€ ™ re always out there
â€
“ theyâ€ ™ re out there even today.â€
�
And at a time when Trump is drawing up a cabinet dominated by older white men , the first lady continued :
â€œAs we move forward in life and we get access to these seats of power ,
these tables of power , I want you to look around and make sure thereâ€ ™ s diversity at the table .
â€œBecause you donâ€
™ t come up with the right answer if everyone at the table looks the same and thinks the same and has the same experience â€
“
you never come up with the best answer .
So when you get these seats at these tables of power , your obligation is to make sure the conversation is diverse.â€ �
She added : â€œBecause what we saw in this film is that when we pull together men and women , people of every background and colour and faith , immigrants whoâ€ ™ ve come here from across the globe to make America their home

2016-12-16,"America is now a country without hope , Michelle Obama has said .
Asked by Oprah Winfrey if her husbandâ€ ™ s administration had lived up to its promise of hope , the first lady said yes , adding : â€œBecause we feel the difference now .
Now weâ€ ™ re feeling what not having hope feels like .
Hope is necessary.â€ �
She added : â€œAnd Barack didnâ€ ™ t talk about hope because he thought it was a nice slogan to get votes .
He and I and so many believe â€˜what else do you have if you donâ€ ™ t have hope ?
What do you give your kids if you canâ€ ™ t give them hope?â€ ™ â€ �
In what is likely to be Obamaâ€ ™ s last interview of the year , she suggested that Americans would miss â€œhaving a grown - up in the White Houseâ€ � , drawing a clear contrast between her husband and the man who will replace him on 20 January , Donald Trump .
And she compared the nation to a toddler who falls over and looks to their parent to know if they should cry or not .
â€œI feel that Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate ,
â€ � she said .
â€œHaving a grown - up in the White House who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil â€˜hey
itâ€
™ s going to be OK ,
letâ€ ™ s remember the good things that we have ,
letâ€ ™ s look at the future ,
letâ€ ™ s look at all the things that weâ€ ™ re buildingâ€ ™
.â€ �
On Thursday , the first lady played that role herself to a group of students , many of them young black women , who had gathered at the White House for a screening of the film Hidden Figures , which documents the role of black female mathematicians in the space race .
â€œLook at this eight years
, â€ � she said .
â€œWe were supposed to be hidden .
People didnâ€ ™ t even want to believe we were real .
But here we are , eight years later .
â€œBut itâ€ ™ s up to all of you , our young people , to continue that legacy .
Itâ€ ™ s your turn now .
All right?â€ � she said .
In that interview she also gave a message about diversity and inclusiveness that could be read as a criticism of Trump .
At a time when the Republican president - elect is drawing up a cabinet dominated by older white men , the first lady said : â€œAs we move forward in life
and we get access to these seats of power , these tables of power , I want you to look around and make sure thereâ€ ™ s diversity at the table .
â€œBecause you donâ€
™ t come up with the right answer if everyone at the table looks the same and thinks the same and has the same experience â€
“
you never come up with the best answer .
So when you get these seats at these tables of power , your obligation is to make sure the conversation is diverse.â€ �
She added : â€œBecause what we saw in this film is that when we pull together men and women , people of every background and colour and faith , immigrants whoâ€ ™ ve come here from across the globe to make America their home
â€ “ when we bring all of that brainpower to the table , anything is possible , even going to the moon , right?â€ �

The Oprah Winfrey interview with the first lady airs Monday night on CBS at 8 pm ET ."
2016-12-20,"Michelle Obama has relied on Sarah Hurwitz for every speech she has given since her husband won the nomination in 2008 , up to her eloquent riposte to Donald Trump at Julyâ€ ™ s Democratic National Convention , in which she talked about raising her two young daughters in a â€œhouse built by slavesâ€ � and her repudiation in October of the Trump campaignâ€
™ s
misogyny â€ “ speeches that electrified the election .
â€œWhat never fails to move and inspire me is her unshakable sense of right and wrong , â€ � speechwriter Hurwitz says of her boss .
â€œShe has such a strong moral core and such a clear set of values , and sheâ€ ™ s expressed that in pretty much every speech sheâ€ ™ s given.â€ � For eight years , Hurwitz , a Harvard law graduate from Massachusetts , and Michelle Obama have traded drafts and honed a singular voice that broke through the bigotry of 2016 .
â€œI start by talking with her , and sheâ€ ™ ll lay out the points she wants to make .
We work together during the editing process until itâ€ ™ s precisely what she wants to say , â€ � she says .
Hurwitz has written speeches for every 21st - century Democratic presidential nominee .
She started her career in 1998 as an intern for then - vice president Al Gore .
She worked on John Kerryâ€ ™ s failed 2004 presidential campaign , and then in 2007 , Hurwitz started the election cycle as the chief speechwriter for Hillary Clintonâ€ ™ s campaign .
Hurwitz was behind Clintonâ€ ™ s famous 2008 concession speech , where she thanked her supporters for putting â€œ18 m cracksâ€
� in the â€œhighest
, hardest glass ceilingâ€ � .
Days later , she was courted by the Obama administration .
Despite a bitter primary , Hurwitz said the Obamas were incredibly welcoming and gracious .
â€œAfter I wrote my first speech for him , then - Senator Obama called to welcome me to the campaign .
And a week or so after that , I was sitting with Mrs Obama
and she was telling me what she wanted to say in her Democratic National Convention speech.â€
�
Several lines from that speech were re - used by Melania Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention .
Hurwitz will not discuss the incident , and Obama has addressed it only once , briefly , on Stephen Colbertâ€ ™ s late - night show .
â€œThat was tough ,
â€ �
she said with a sly smile .
As the Obama era draws to a close , Hurwitz is reminded of her late grandmother .
â€œShe was a proud Roosevelt Democrat , and as a young woman , she dreamed of going to law school and having a career in politics â€ “ but women didnâ€ ™ t really have those kinds of opportunities back then , â€ � she says .
â€œIt never ceases to amaze me that just two generations later , I have walked through the Northwest Gate of the White House every day for the past eight years to get to work.â€ �"
2016-12-23,"The co - chair of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s
New York state presidential campaign has denied that comments he made about Michelle Obama â€œbeing a maleâ€ � who should be â€œlet loose in the outback of Zimbabweâ€ � to live â€œin a cave with Maxie , the gorillaâ€ � were racist .
Carl Paladino , a 70-year - old entrepreneur who ran for New York governor in 2010 , made the inflammatory comments to Artvoice , an alternative paper in Buffalo .
In response , Governor Andrew Cuomo condemned what he said were Paladinoâ€ ™ s â€œracist , ugly , reprehensible remarks about the president and first ladyâ€ � .
Paladino visited Trump Tower earlier this month , telling the Buffalo News he spent an hour with the president - elect .
Among key figures he met were the vice - president - elect Mike Pence , chief of staff nominee Reince Priebus , senior counsel nominee Stephen Bannon ,
Trumpâ€ ™ s son - in - law Jared Kushner and nominated national security adviser Michael Flynn .
â€œIt was a wide - ranging conversation about all the people across the state who were on my team , â€ � the newspaper reported Paladino as saying .
â€œWe talked about New Yorkers who might have a role , how we might structure appointments and who would get input .
I think I will have an ongoing ability to make recommendations.â€ � Artvoice included Paladino among a number of people asked what they wanted to see happen in 2017 .
â€œ[Barack
] Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Her[e]ford ,
â€ � he said .
â€œHe dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to [ senior Obama adviser ] Valerie Jarret[t ] , who died weeks prior , after being convicted of sedition and treason , when a Jihady [ sic ] cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her.â€ �
About Michelle Obama , he said :
â€œIâ€ ™ d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie ,
the gorilla.â€ � Cuomo said Paladino had a â€œlong history of racist and incendiary commentsâ€ � and most New Yorkers knew not to take him seriously , as â€œhis erratic behavior defies any rational analysis and he has no credibilityâ€ � .
But , the governor added , â€œhis words are still jarringâ€ � .
Amidst furious condemnation on social media and in the press , Paladino released an open letter in which he said his comments to Artvoice had â€œnothing to do with raceâ€ � .
â€œThatâ€
™ s the typical stance of the press when they canâ€ ™ t otherwise defend the acts of the person being attacked , â€ � he wrote , accusing the first lady of having hated America before her husband won office in 2008 .
He also accused Barack Obama of being â€œa yellow - belied coward who left thousands to die in Syriaâ€ � .
Paladino confirmed to the Buffalo News that he made the original comments .
â€œOf
course I did , â€ �
he said on Friday morning .
â€œTell them all to go fuck themselves.â€
�
During the presidential campaign , Paladino described Trump supporters as people frustrated with government who â€œwant the raccoons out of the basementâ€ � .
He later spoke of ridding the US of â€œthe Washington elite monstersâ€ � .
At a political rally in 2015 , he spoke about â€œdamn Asiansâ€ � and other â€œforeignersâ€ � attending university in Buffalo .
This week , Paladino was criticized for introducing a resolution to mandate all Buffalo public schools display a picture of Trump .
In his condemnation of Paladinoâ€ ™ s remarks , Governor Cuomo said his latest outburst did not reflect â€œthe sentiments or opinions of any real New Yorkerâ€ � .
â€œHe has embarrassed the good people of the state with his latest hate - filled rage , â€ � Cuomo said ."

The great pop songs , rather than the merely good ones , are the ones that make you want to smile or dance or cry .
Likewise the great style icons â€ “ the ones who will be remembered beyond their red carpet moment
â€ “ are the ones who make you feel something .
Marilyn Monroe does this .
Beyonce does this .
And Michelle Obama did this , all year .
The first lady takes immense care over what she wears , but she never lets what she wears overwhelm her personality .
I look at Versace on the red carpet or the catwalk
and I think : thatâ€ ™ s a nice dress , that actress / model looks hot .
But I look at Michelle Obama in the bespoke Versace dress
she wore to an Italy state dinner â€ “
her last â€ “
and I see more than that .
I see strength in the chainmail and joy in the dazzle and inspiration in the goddess silhouette .
Michelle Obama has created an image which is the jumping - off point for a huge personality .
Will I miss her ?
Doesnâ€
™ t begin to cover it , dudes .
Georgia Oâ€ ™ Keeffe Speak of a masculine aesthetic and Georgia Oâ€ ™
Keeffe is likely to come up .
This year was no different , thanks to a Tate retrospective and â€œinspired byâ€ � collection at Jigsaw , which introduced a new group of fourth - wave feminists to her work .
It also reminded us why her look is one of the most referenced in fashion , particularly in this post - CÃ © line age of genderless flavours on the catwalk and high street .
It certainly reminded me why I like a black suit , loose T - shirt , tennis shoes and dropped waistline .
Her approach to monochrome is a lesson to us all , but equally , the green of the stem in Dark Iris
No 1 is Pantoneâ€ ™ s colour of 2017 and mine .
I also like her work and , with a lateral perspective , I looked to that , too â€ “ giant florals at Topshop or Michael Kors , who namechecked her earlier for his spring / summer collection â€ “ when I got dressed .
There are additional elements â€ “ the loose , unbuttoned shirts ( very sexy for the 1920s ) and the flourish of colour ( a nod to her love of Mexico ) and her hair , loosely scraped back and short .
If that feels reductive , itâ€ ™ s worth thinking about the context ( 1920s feminism ) and then applauding her for wearing trousers .
Morwenna Ferrier Earnest ( Donald Glover ) in Atlanta
In every episode of Atlanta , Donald Gloverâ€ ™ s character , Earnest , is close to collapsing under the weight of a world conspiring against him .
His clothes match the in - betweenness of his life ( his job , attempting to make it as a manager / PR , his stop / start relationship with his girlfriend ) .
We see Earnest in ill - fitting suits , duo colour weather beaten T - shirts , plaid shirts , Vans and a backpack .
His style may say â€˜Iâ€ ™ m prepared for anything .
Iâ€ ™ m prepared for nothing ,
â€ ™ but Glover pulls the look ( post - normcore with a bit of Basquiat thrown in for good measure ) with an effortlessness that is infectious .
So perhaps itâ€ ™ s not about what you wear , but how you wear it .
Priya Elan Barb from Stranger Things
Her screen time might have been over before it began , but Barb from Stranger Things cast a longstyle shadow across my style in 2016 .
It wasnâ€ ™ t difficult â€ “
she had me at the bottletop glasses , frilled blouse and slightly tatty quilted jacket .
The John Hughes heroine - worthy gormless expression , strawberry blonde hair and Clearasil concealer habit only added to her case .
I am a sucker for an 80s misunderstood teen and Barb hit the spot .
She also fitted into the thrift store look done so well by Alessandro Michele at Gucci , and prompted a much deserved social media campaign and even a mural in LA .
I like to think sheâ€ ™ s living on through the likes of me .
I am now the proud owner of several frilled blouses and a questionable blue vintage ski jacket that bears a resemblance to the one Barb wears to , um , the bitter end .
Just saying .

2016-12-29,"The Trump presidential campaign New York co - chair who made inflammatory and racist statements about Barack and Michelle Obama says he will not resign from the Buffalo school board , which on Thursday voted to remove him .
Millionaire developer Carl Paladino last week told a Buffalo alternative newspaper he wanted to see the president dead of mad cow disease and the first lady living with a gorilla in Zimbabwe .
Having first said the comments had â€œnothing to do with raceâ€ � , he also said they were examples of â€œold - style humourâ€ � intended â€œto wake people up â€ ¦ to get peopleâ€
™ s
attentionâ€ � .
The newspaper , Artvoice , included Paladino , 70 , among a number of people asked what they wanted to see happen in 2017 .
â€œ[Barack
] Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Her[e]ford ,

About Michelle Obama , he said :
â€œIâ€ ™ d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie ,
the gorilla.â€ �
In a statement , Paladino said he had spoken â€œabout two progressive elitist ingrates who have hated their country so badly and destroyed its fabric in so many respects in eight yearsâ€ � .
He subsequently said his words were not meant for publication but were nevertheless â€œinappropriateâ€
� .
At a special meeting on Thursday , the Buffalo school board voted 6 - 2 for a resolution asking the state education commissioner to remove Paladino , the ninth member , if he did not resign within 24 hours .
More than 70 % of the district is non - white , according to the resolution .
The meeting was broadcast online .
Some board members accused Paladino of acting like a bully and making remarks they would not tolerate from students .
â€œThis level of hatred for African Americans can not and should not set policy for the education of African American children , â€ � said board member Paulette Woods .
Members of the audience stood up and cheered when the resolution was approved .
Paladino , who did not attend , has said he will not resign .
On Wednesday he told a local radio station : â€œIâ€ ™ m the agent of change .
Iâ€ ™ m
the guy that exposed the underbelly of their corrupt and dysfunctional school system , and they want me gone from the scene.â€ �
The state education commissioner , MaryEllen Elia , is monitoring the situation and will review any removal request as quickly as possible , a spokeswoman said .
Paladinoâ€ ™ s comments about the Obamas were condemned by figures including New York governor , Andrew Cuomo , who beat Paladino in the 2010 election .
A Trump spokesperson said the comments were â€œabsolutely reprehensible , and they serve no place in our public discourseâ€ � .
Paladino visited Trump Tower earlier this month , telling the Buffalo News he spent an hour with the president - elect and key members of his inner circle .
Among those Paladino said he met were vice - president - elect Mike Pence , chief of staff Reince Priebus , senior counsel Stephen Bannon , Trumpâ€ ™ s son - in - law Jared Kushner and nominated national security adviser Michael Flynn .

2017-01-06,"With tears in her eyes and her voice cracking with emotion , the self - declared â€œmom - in - chiefâ€ � stepped off the public stage on Friday with her final speech as first lady , urging young Americans to believe in the â€œpower of hopeâ€ � .
Michelle Obama , who began her White House years pursuing the typically soft subjects that have often limited the wives of presidents , ended with a clarion call for diversity and vowing to make it her lifeâ€ ™ s work to help disadvantaged children get to college , a personal mission that has its roots in her own Chicago childhood .
In a deeply emotional reflection on what lies ahead for the US in the era of President Donald Trump , she sent a clear message to young people to rise above division , anger and bigotry , no matter what they look like , their background or religion .
â€œMy final message to young people as first lady is simple .
I want our young people to know that they matter , that they belong ...
Donâ€ ™ t be afraid , be focused .
Be determined .
Be hopeful .
Be empowered .
Empower yourself with a good education ... then build a country worthy of your boundless promise.â€
�
The sign - off in the East Room of the White House ended with her being engulfed in hugs from school counsellors from across the US whom she celebrated for the crucial support they give to students in their darkest moments .
It was also a moment to mark the eight - year journey she has made to become an impassioned political figure in her own right .
She has never stood for office , but there were times in the final weeks of the US election campaign when it seemed possible that she could run for president and win .
She had taken the fight to Donald Trump , telling a Hillary Clinton rally in New Hampshire that his boasts about sexually assaulting women had shaken her to her core .
â€œThis is not normal .
This is not politics as usual .
This is disgraceful .
It is intolerable , â€ �
she said in a speech which revealed a toughness and an ability to connect with an audience to rival her own husbandâ€ ™ s gifts .
Speaking in Philadelphia from the same platform as Bill Clinton , Barack Obama , Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton , she emerged as the true star of the Democratic convention , moving the audience to tears as she spoke about the possibility of the first female president , and her own familyâ€ ™ s journey from slavery to the White House .
Drawing powerfully on her own family history â€ “ her great - great - grandfather lived as a slave â€
“
she spoke of â€œthe story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage , the shame of servitude , the sting of segregation , but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves .
â€œAnd I watch my daughters , two beautiful , intelligent , black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.â€ �
Ever since Martha Washington complained that she felt like a state prisoner , the role of the first lady has traditionally been seen as a confining one , where elegance comes first and controversy is best avoided .
And Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s
White House years began typically â€ “ as a self - styled mom - in - chief , with two daughters aged 10 and seven , advocating a healthy - living agenda .
She turned a far corner of the White House grounds into a vegetable garden and brought children from some of Washingtonâ€ ™ s poorest schools to help her plant broccoli .
She also delightful with her irreverent willingness to drop convention â€ “ joining in with an Evolution of Mom Dancing routine on the talkshow Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , to promote her Letâ€ ™ s Move fitness push and later , getting in the passenger seat for Carpool Karaoke with James Corden to promote her
Let Girls Learn global education campaign .
If some felt disappointed by the gentle subjects she adopted initially , it became clear there was a golden thread running through her efforts as she began to focus on more substantial issues that reflected her own childhood growing up in Chicago .
She joined the debate on gun violence after the death in 2013 of Hadiya Pendleton , the Chicago teenager who was killed by a stray bullet days after she returned home from taking part in the presidentâ€ ™ s inauguration celebrations with her high school marching band .
Speaking later that year in Chicago , Obama said her mission and her passion lay in â€œensuring the health and development and success of young people in this cityâ€ � .
Describing her own childhood , she said : â€œBack then , our parents knew that if they loved and encouraged us , if they kept us off the streets and out of trouble , then weâ€ ™ d be OK .
They knew that if they did everything right , weâ€ ™ d have a chance .
â€œBut today , for too many families and children in this city , thatâ€ ™ s simply no longer the case .
Today , too many kids in this city are living just a few stops , sometimes even just a few blocks , from shiny skyscrapers and leafy parks and world - class museums and universities , yet all of that might as well be in a different state , even in a different continent .
â€œBecause instead of spending their days enjoying the abundance of riches this city has to offer , they are consumed with watching their backs .
Theyâ€ ™ re afraid to walk alone , because they might get jumped .
Theyâ€ ™ re afraid to walk in groups , because that might identify them as part of a gang and put them at risk.â€ �
She said : â€œHadiyaâ€ ™ s family did everything right , but she still didnâ€ ™ t have a chance .
And that story â€ “ the story of Hadiyaâ€ ™ s
life and death â€ “ we read that story day after day , month after month , year after year in this city and around this country.â€
�
The Reach Higher initiative she has championed aims to inspire every student to carry on past high school â€ “ building on the healthy start she promoted , by creating conditions for teenagers to get to college , and then find support on campus to help them succeed .
She was still Michelle Robinson , daughter of a secretary and a pump worker at a Chicago water company , when her teachers told her that she was aiming too high by setting her sights on Princeton , the Ivy League university .
But she made it , and went to Harvard Law School too , although as she said decades later
: â€œI still hear that doubt ringing in my head.â€ �
The commencement addresses she has delivered each year at college graduation ceremonies during her time at the White House have seen her turn to her own personal struggles , including the death of her father , to force home the message that education is the single biggest driver of success for young people .
She told Virginia Tech students : â€œI came to realize that the best way for me to honor my dadâ€ ™ s life was by how I lived my own life .
I realized that the best way to fill the hole he had left was to do for other young people what he had done for me .
So I left that fancy law firm , and I wound up ultimately running a nonprofit organization that trained young people for careers in public service.â€ �
She has taken her aspirational message to young girls across the world â€ “ including pupils from an inner - city school in London , some of whom went with her on a fact - finding mission to Oxford University and were later invited to the White House .
â€œWe are counting on you , we are counting on every single one of you to be the best that you can be ,
â€ �
she told their school assembly .
If Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s presidential legacy hangs in the balance with the start of the Trump administration , it is possible that as a family , the Obamas have achieved something of lasting significance which can not be erased .
They have shown young African Americans that they too can have ambition and success .
Rictor Craig was a school principal at Friendship Woodbridge elementary and middle school in one of the poorest wards of Washington when some of his scholars were invited to help Michelle Obama plant her White House kitchen garden in 2014 .
Now director of academics at the nine schools of Friendship Woodbridge , he said the visit â€ “ and the simple fact that the Obamas made it to the White House
â€ “ had a transformative effect on pupils .
â€œUltimately it allowed my kids to see that they have a possibility , that people who look like them , that they are able to relate to , can one day aspire to get into the White House .
â€œSeeing Michelle Obama and the first family in the White House really motivated our scholars because they know that both the parents are college educated , they know that Malia and Sasha are going to college and these are things that they get to see on a daily basis , that they can then equate to their own story .
Itâ€ ™ s huge.â€
�
Michelle Obama it seems , never will run for office .
â€œIf I were interested in it , Iâ€ ™
d say it ,
â€ �
she told Oprah Winfrey in her big exit interview last month .
â€œPeople donâ€ ™ t really understand how hard this is .
And itâ€ ™ s not something that you cavalierly just sort of ask a family to do again.â€ �
But as she tried in vain to wave away her tears at the end of her last speech , she made clear that the struggle to get children a better start and a great education will remain her lifeâ€ ™ s work .
â€œI will be with you , rooting for you for the rest of my life.â€ �"
2017-01-14,"Isha Sesay A presenter and correspondent for CNN International .
She travelled with Michelle Obama in Liberia and Morocco last year for the making of the CNN documentary
We Will Rise :
Michelle Obamaâ€ ™ s Mission to Educate Girls Around the World
It will be a strange and sad moment for me , a woman of colour , when Michelle Obama leaves the White House .
To lose the imagery of a black first family and all that Michelle Obama has bought to the table , all she has actively and routinely worked for .
Iâ€ ™ ve been in the States now for 11 years now but every time they stepped out as the first family it got me .
It never lost its potency .
She is such an active and participatory first lady .
No one knows what kind of first lady Melania Trump will be .
No one is saying she wonâ€ ™ t carve her own path , but Michelle Obama was very special .
I first met her in 2014 when I was invited to the White House to attend a formal dinner for a US / Africa summit .
All the heads of state from Africa came to DC along with their first ladies and I was asked to moderate a panel for Mrs Obama and Mrs Bush at the Kennedy Centre .
Later an invite came to the formal dinner , which was thrilling .
At the White House you wait in line to be introduced and when I got to Mrs Obama
she said â€œI almost wore that same dress tonight!â€
�
And I say â€œNo!â€
�
and she says â€œYes!â€ �
and she gave me the biggest hug .
She was just amazing , very tall , very warm , she just scooped me up into this big hug the very first time I met her .
The Obamas celebrate people of colour , they want to include them .
Both she and the president are skilled at knowing what they can achieve by aligning themselves with other successful people of colour ,
how it amplifies the message of what is possible .
I think they almost do it as a public service .
They understand that every time they have BeyoncÃ © with them , or John Legend or Jay Z , the message goes further and it opens the minds of kids in the inner cities to the possibilities and I think thatâ€ ™ s smart .
CNN discussed various projects with the White House and then settled on the first lady going to Africa , for her last overseas trip .
[ In the documentary Michelle Obama , along with Sesay and actors Freida Pinto and Meryl Streep , meets and speaks with young north African women who describe their struggles to get an education . ]
I got an email asking how I would feel about travelling to Africa with the first lady and practically had to pick myself up off the floor .
When we were in Liberia
I kept watching how she was trying to connect with the girls who spoke , really watching them and willing them on as they struggled in some cases .
It was very moving because she really wanted them to feel safe and able to share .
Before we arrived I asked the White House about the protocol for the girls who would meet her .
How should they address her ?
Could they touch her?â€ ™
I was able to tell them that from the White House point of view , once youâ€ ™ re in the bubble so to speak [ through security ] , once you are in the room with her , youâ€ ™ re good .
So the girls could touch her , refer to her freely , there were no restrictions placed on interactions with her at all .
We went to hear her talk at the Peace Corps [ the US governmentâ€ ™ s volunteer programme ] in Monrovia
and she just walked into that space and practically blew the roof off with her energy levels .
I will say , and Iâ€ ™ m 41 , that whenever Iâ€ ™ m with her
and I listen to her
speak you walk out and you are charged by being in her presence , by hearing her words of motivation .
Itâ€ ™ s not just the words she utters , itâ€ ™ s her conviction and itâ€ ™ s her life story that backs them up .
In Morocco I saw how willing she was to share her own insecurities , her own challenges with the girls .
She said to them : â€œWeâ€ ™ re all girls here together .
Weâ€ ™ re all going to share.â€
�
How many first ladies in the world can you imagine just busting in and saying : â€œThis is girl - talk timeâ€
� ?
And it resonates authentically .
I think maybe thatâ€ ™ s the difference .
Other people say it but she means it .
I last saw her for a special screening of the film at the White House .
She was really mischievous .
I told her that in Morocco I had been in the souk late at night and as I was wandering around a guy asked me : â€œAre you an Obama?â€ ™ and I looked left and I looked right
and I said :
â€œYes , I am!â€
�
and she roared with laughter .
And then she walked into the east room and was doing her intro for everyone , welcoming Meryl Streep and Andra Day who did the song
[ Rise Up ] and then it got to me
and she said : â€œAnd by the way , Isha here has been passing herself off as ...
â€ �
I almost died .
I am not surprised by her popularity at all .
Not now that Iâ€ ™ ve met her on a couple of occasions .
I understand it
and I think if more people had the opportunity to spend one - on - one time with her there would be more people clamouring for her to run , because she is that amazing .
I mean when she gave that speech during campaigning , when she just laid out her heart and said how offended she was by the Trump video , and the speech she gave during the conventions .
I think those speeches really elevated her .
I wouldnâ€
™ t want her to stand though .
I think sheâ€ ™ ll be far more effective outside the machinery of government .
Look at what Hillary Clinton went through and the double standards that were forced upon her .
Now imagine what would happen to a black woman â€ “ the intersection between gender and race is just a whole other ballgame .
I asked her while we were working in Liberia : â€œWhat will your post - White House years look like?â€ �
and she said : â€œThis.â€
�
This is what sheâ€ ™ s committed to doing â€ “ lifting up girls and ripping off the roof and removing all the limitations girls feel and others impose on them and expanding their horizons .
I hope thatâ€ ™ s what sheâ€ ™ s able to do .
Itâ€ ™ s
what sheâ€ ™ s good at
and she can make such a difference .

Tamanna Islam A 15-year - old student at Mulberry school in east London .
After visiting the school in June 2015 , Michelle Obama later invited a group of students , including Tamanna , to the White House in November that year Before she came , there was such a buzz .
I was in the main school hall with 300 other students .
Everyone was quiet , everyone eagerly awaiting her arrival .
When she walked on to the stage , we jumped to our feet â€ “ clapping , shouting , crying .
She brought this incredible vibe and the atmosphere was just electric .
Throughout her speech she made eye contact with everyone , and gave these little smiles .
It made it feel so personal , like she was just talking to you .
And then , at the end , she hugged every pupil in the front row , including me !
She pulled me close , looked me in the eye and told me : â€œIâ€ ™ m so proud of you.â€ �
I was one of the 20 students selected by my teachers to travel to the White House in Washington DC .
When we met her again , she recollected every single detail from her visit : how special it was to see us waving the American flag , how moved she was by our performance of Still I Rise [ the Maya Angelou poem ] .
It was nerve - racking going through all of the security , but once we were inside , Michelle made us feel like we were visiting a friend .
In addition to meeting her , we were introduced to lots of senior women working at the White House , such as in the justice and crime department .
It was so inspiring and enlightening to see so many women and people from ethnic - minority backgrounds in positions of power .
Michelle Obama understands what it is like to be a young Muslim woman in Tower Hamlets .
â€œYour story is my story , â€ �
she told our school .
Growing up in a working - class environment in Chicago , she faced her own sort of unfairness , but she worked hard and showed the world that she could do anything .
And if girls like us can raise our aspirations , it shows the rest of Britain , the rest of the world , that we can do anything .
Since meeting her , Iâ€ ™ ve started to seek out what I can do to make a positive change in my community .
She taught me I have a responsibility to use my voice to break down negative stereotypes of Muslim women , and make change for the next generation after that .
Her charisma , her energy â€
“
it makes you feel like you can take on the entire world .
Dr Vanessa Ogden Headteacher , Mulberry school
We had been approached by the American embassy a couple of months prior about the possibility of helping to launch a project on girls and education , but had no idea that Michelle Obama was involved in any way .
Over about a two - month period , it became apparent that we were one of the top two institutions they were looking at â€
“
and I still had no idea who was fronting the launch .
We eventually found out about the visit in May 2015 , and had just three weeks to get ready for her arrival in June !
I learned a lot in those weeks about how to manage high - level security .
One of my favourite , and most surreal , moments was standing in a school conference room , debating with special ops and secret service officers about how to manage the security in a working school environment .
Of course I was nervous â€ “
I had a responsibility to make things as good as they could be , and it was a very high - adrenaline time .
But more than anything I just felt hugely appreciative , so grateful for what this could bring to the school .
For me , the most important aspect of the first ladyâ€ ™ s visit was making sure that every girl at Mulberry should have some kind of interaction with her , whether it was watching her speech , presenting gifts or performing a song .
The whole thing , from start to finish , was for the girls .
It wasnâ€ ™ t about Mrs Obama , it wasnâ€ ™ t about the other important people there , it was absolutely for the girls .
Thatâ€ ™ s the thing about the first lady â€ “
she has no ego .
These visits for her are completely non - hierarchical . Theyâ€ ™ re about the person sheâ€ ™ s meeting , the people sheâ€ ™ s addressing .
She connects with people because of who they are â€
“ not because of who she is .
For example : one of the things that made the planning so complex was that we arranged to live - stream Michelleâ€ ™ s speech into the sports hall , so that every girl who couldnâ€ ™ t fit in the main hall could experience it at the same time .
It was Michelleâ€ ™ s idea to go and surprise all the girls gathered in the sports hall at the end of the speech .
Thatâ€ ™ s what makes her so special â€ “
she thinks so carefully and prepares so well for each visit .
They had no idea she was coming , and when they saw her , they went absolutely wild .
We visited the White House in November , as part of a 10-day cultural trip to the US .
Students underwent a rigorous selection process to take part , which involved attending an after - school civil rights programme , a written application , making a speech in front of a panel of teachers and finally being interviewed by myself and the governors .
After a tour of the west wing and a cuddle ( and a selfie ) with Bo [ the Obamasâ€ ™ pet dog ] , the girls sat down and asked Michelle questions , all of them quite serious .
At the end , Michelle leaned forward and said , eyeâ€ ™ s glittering : â€œNow come on .
Letâ€ ™ s talk about the things you want to know.â€
�
For 15 minutes the girls and Mrs Obama chatted on a personal level , as girls and women do every day .
Iâ€ ™ m afraid we made a pact to keep our discussion secret , so I canâ€ ™ t reveal if Barack Obama does the chores .
Myesha Haque A 17-year - old student and aspiring lawyer , who hosted the first lady when she visited Mulberry school
I couldnâ€
™ t believe she was there at first .
I had to keep blinking and blinking .
Out of all the schools in the UK , all the schools in London , she chose to come to Mulberry , our school !
As deputy head prefect , I had been given the responsibility to host the first lady .
Because of this , I found out about her visit earlier than any of the other students , which was so hard to keep secret .
After taking photos next to the American flag , we began our tour of the school .
Even just walking beside her , I was star - struck by her charisma and charm .
Walking into the main Mulberry courtyard with her was an absolutely awe - inspiring moment .
The flags were waving , there was cheering , there was clapping .
Four hundred students all trying to get a glimpse of her .
As she met people , her eyes lit up .
Her face , her body language was so uplifting â€ “
you could just see how happy she was .
We walked on to our Year 9 project area , where our choir , conducted by a Year 9 pupil , sang â€˜Something Inside So Strongâ€ ™ and another student read the poem â€˜Still I Riseâ€ ™ by Maya Angelou .
While the girls were performing the First Lady hugged me to her side and murmured to me , â€œI can not believe this .
This is amazing.â€ �
I was nervous , but that warmth really comforted me .
She felt like a friend , even though sheâ€ ™ s in high power .
That hug was an experience Iâ€ ™ ll never forget , one Iâ€ ™ ll cherish for a lifetime .
Her story , of growing up in a working - class environment in Chicago , has made me realise I can all overcome all barriers and challenges in my life , that I can achieve anything .
Weâ€ ™ ve been inspired as Mulberry students to carry on her
Let Girls Learn campaign , even after she stops being first lady .
Mulberry and Michelle
â€ “ weâ€ ™ re besties now .
Weâ€
™ re linked for life .
Ronald Ligon A 19-year - old graduate of Harper high school , Chicago , and a member of the US military .
He met Michelle Obama when she visited his school in April 2013 , and was invited to the White House in June that year
All I said was that my favourite food was french fries .
But that was enough to make her face split into a big smile and laugh :
â€œThatâ€
™ s my favourite
too!â€
�
She got up and hugged me just because I get the same satisfaction from french fries .
It was too funny .
I just felt like awh ,
oh my God , this is wonderful .
The first lady came to my school nearly four years ago .
She sat down with a group of about 20 of us and asked us questions about our lives , about what itâ€ ™ s like to grow up in the south side [ of Chicago ] .
For someone that has so much power , she cancelled all of that out .
She told us to relax , slouch if we wanted to , make ourselves at home .
â€œIâ€ ™ m a regular person trying to make a change , just like you are ,
â€ �
she said .
We didnâ€ ™ t have to use big words or act proper to get through to her , we could just be ourselves .
For about three hours we talked to her about the violence in our communities .
She wasnâ€ ™ t surprised â€ “
she grew up in Englewood [ Chicago ] and lived through a bunch of shootings around her house â€
“
but she was hurt that we have to go through it every single day .
Honestly , If I hadnâ€ ™ t met Michelle Obama , I might not be where I am today .
Pretty much two weeks after I returned after visiting the first lady in the White House , my family got into a big fight with other people in my community .
We ended up losing our home , and for about four to five months we were homeless .
The first couple of months I was really low .
I didnâ€ ™ t want to go to school , I didnâ€ ™ t want to do anything .
I had no hope .
But then one day I came back to find my mom on the couch crying , saying that she couldnâ€ ™ t provide for us , that she had failed our family .
It hurt so bad to see her so sad .
I remembered , then , how Michelle had told me that no matter what hardships you have , thereâ€ ™ s always a strong possibility you can overcome them .
Looking at my mom sitting there crying , I decided to step up .
I got back into school and I got a job working eight hours a day , seven days a week .
I got enough money to fix things for my mom and get the house weâ€ ™ re living in now .
I graduated from school and I enrolled in the military .
I got back on track because of the first ladyâ€ ™ s words , because of the honesty and trust that she put in me .
I try not to remind myself too much about those times , but whenever Iâ€ ™ m in a deep situation I always look back on that moment .
Iâ€ ™ m still not over how Donald Trump won and how weâ€ ™ re going to lose both the first lady and Barack Obama as well .
Iâ€ ™ m so happy
I got to meet her in person , twice , but Iâ€ ™
m really going to miss them .
Fouzya Toukart
She met Michelle Obama in Morocco in June 2016 as part of her
Let Girls Learn initiative and the CNN film We Will Rise Iâ€ ™ m the first girl in the family to get a baccalaureate and the first girl in the village to get a BA .
I come from an illiterate family : my parents are farmers in the village , they are poor people .
Getting an education was like a war for me
â€
“
it felt like everyone was against me .
The mentalities in my village are all the same : girls have to marry and have kids and stay home and cook , like machines , and thatâ€ ™ s it .
In primary school I was top of my class but my family decided I would not go to secondary school .
It was really hard for me , but I went on a hunger strike when I was 12
and I convinced them to let me go .
The secondary school was very far , seven kilometres each way , and I was the only girl .
In the beginning my parents were not convinced , but after I kept getting the highest grades , I could see in their faces that they were satisfied and proud .
I got a BA in English in Marrakesh , and my goal is to get a doctorate and be a translator and linguist â€
“
I speak Amazigh , Arabic , French , English and Japanese .
I met Michelle Obama in Marrakech in June , just when I was doing my final exam , and meeting her was like a push for continuing .
The thing I remember most is that she saw me and said :
â€œYes , I read a lot about you
and I remember
youâ€ �
â€ “ that was really awesome .
I also met Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , and they were very kind - hearted and friendly too .
Later I had a week in Washington
DC â€ “
it was my first time flying anywhere â€ “ and met Michelle Obama again there .
They say Washington gets busy and loud , but it was super fun .
Michelle Obama has helped so many people , and sheâ€ ™ s always been the person who fights for something which is very good for our society .
With education weâ€ ™ re going to find solutions for so many problems in life .
My message for all the girls around the world who donâ€ ™ t have the opportunity to go and study , I just want to tell them that if I can do it , they can do it too , whatever the boundaries they can be overcome .
Cindy Sanders A counsellor at King college prep in Chicago .
Fifteenâ€‘year - old schoolgirl Hadiya Pendleton , who attended King , was shot and killed in 2013 I met Michelle Obama during Hadiyaâ€ ™ s funeral .
She felt compelled to come to Chicago and pay her respects to Cleopatra and Nate
[ Pendleton , Hadiyaâ€ ™ s parents ] , not necessarily as the first lady but as a mom , to support another mother who had lost her child .
It was very moving that she would put all of her stuff on hold for the funeral .
Two years later she spoke at the graduation of the class that Hadiya would have graduated in .
It was a bittersweet graduation because of this , but everybody was excited , because weâ€ ™ ve never had a speaker of this calibre .
The students will remember that for ever , that Michelle Obama was the graduation speaker for their class .
She talked about how she came from just this community , and how the students have so many options , and that anything is possible with an education .
We all got to take photos with her and talk to her .
She congratulated us , and thanked us for doing a great job with the students .
Having a first lady from the south side of Chicago means everything .
Sheâ€ ™ s like the peopleâ€ ™ s first lady , and sheâ€ ™ s definitely Chicagoâ€ ™ s first lady .
She was very personable : she was giving hugs , she was giving motivation .
And not just surface motivation ; it was because she had been in a Chicago public school .
And to see what she accomplished , having a similar background and a similar upbringing â€ “ it was powerful .
Itâ€ ™ s very inspiring to see that with hard work and determination you can be anything .
In Chicago the whole issue of gun control is so polarised : people are getting killed by guns , and we need to do something about this .
We donâ€
™ t want parents losing their teenage children .
I have a teenager too in the city of Chicago and so we definitely need to speak up on that .
And when you have the first lady championing causes it definitely puts some weight with it .
Iâ€ ™ ll miss her being in that office , but the good thing is sheâ€ ™ s still going to champion those causes â€ “
sheâ€
™ s still going to care about helping children reach higher , and having counsellors support them .
Sheâ€
™ s tough but sheâ€ ™ s also down to earth .
And weâ€ ™ ll miss her putting on her jeans and being on Ellen and challenging her to dance - offs .
Kyra Caldwell
A 19-year - old former student at King college prep and friend of Hadiya Pendleton
When my friend Hadiya passed , Michelle Obama ended up coming to the funeral .
They had a few people in a separate room before the funeral started , and she came in went around and shook our hands .
I was with a friend and we were so nervous â€ “
we were about to shake hands with Michelle Obama , the first African American to be first lady in the White House .
She came over and gave us both hugs , and gave us words of encouragement .
The fact that she hugged me was just crazy to me .
Usually youâ€ ™ d think people who are famous would act fake , but she was the complete opposite â€ “ when I spoke to her
it was very calm and normal , very natural .
She also came to speak at our graduation and gave a really motivational speech , which was really exciting .
Our school had done this FAFSA challenge [ a video for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ] : it was Scandal - themed [ after the US TV political drama series ] and we sent it in to Michelle Obama .
She then sent it to the cast of Scandal and got them to make a video telling us how good our video was .
So you had [ characters ]
Olivia Pope and Huck and Abby saying we did a good FAFSA challenge â€ “
thatâ€ ™ s
something Iâ€ ™ ll always remember .
Itâ€ ™ s very reassuring that sheâ€
™ s another woman of colour from the south side of Chicago .
I feel like once youâ€ ™ re born and raised here you always have a connection to it , wherever you go .
She went to the same high school as my mother , so it makes it seem more real : anybody can go anywhere , no matter where youâ€ ™ re from .
I also attended Tuskegee University in Alabama , and I found out that she had also spoken at a graduation there , so I was thinking : â€œIs this a sign that Iâ€ ™ m going to be the first lady next time?â€ �
When I think of Michelle Obama , â€œreassuringâ€ � is the word I think of .
Sheâ€ ™ s brilliant â€ “ she went to two Ivy League schools [ Princeton and Harvard Law School ] and has done all these great things .
Itâ€ ™ s definitely something to look up to .
Iâ€ ™ m now studying occupational therapy , and after this the plan is to go to a really good physical therapy school
so I can get my doctorate .
Michelle said we can do anything , so I believe it ."
2017-01-20,"With barely a flicker to betray the emotions of the day , Barack and Michelle Obama stepped out of the White House at 10.50am on Friday for the last time as president and first lady of the United States .
After eight historic years as Americaâ€ ™ s first black president , Obama departed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and prepared to hand over the keys not to Americaâ€ ™ s first female president in Hillary Clinton , as he hoped and expected , but to Donald Trump .
The Obamas and the Trumps , Donald and Melania , had just spent 45 minutes inside over tea and coffee , a tradition .
The public greetings were measured and diplomatically warm â€ “ Melania Trump handing over a blue Tiffany gift box under the North Portico .
The Obamas seemed like stiffer , more formal versions of their true selves .
Within the hour they were off , travelling together to Capitol Hill â€ “ the women in one limousine and the men in the car behind .
Perhaps conscious that once the Trumps arrived everything would become something of a blur , Obama had used his presidential Twitter account , @POTUS ( President of the United States ) to communicate some thoughts .
â€œItâ€
™ s been the honor of my life to serve you , â€ � he wrote just after 9 am .
â€œYou made me a better leader and a better man.â€ �
Then : â€œI wonâ€ ™ t stop ; Iâ€ ™ ll be right there with you as a citizen , inspired by your voices of truth and justice , good humor and love.â€ �
And : â€œIâ€ ™ m still asking you to believe â€ “ not in my ability to bring about change , but in yours .
I believe in change because I believe in you.â€ �
At 9.14am , Obama was filmed through the glass door of the Oval Office as he completed his final act there , leaving a letter of welcome to his successor , as tradition allows .
He shared the space with a man halfway up a step ladder , who appeared to be removing the last traces of the 44th president in time for the imminent arrival of the 45th .
Asked if he felt nostalgic , Obama replied :
â€œOf
course.â€
�
With those two words and his last presidential words immortalised on the web , he was out .
Arriving at the Capitol to witness the official passing of power on a mild , cloudy day with dampness in the air , he and Michelle took their places on the West Front of the Capitol .
Earlier in the morning , a US Marine Corps helicopter had been spotted on the east side , waiting to take the Obamas away .
Obama sat next to the outgoing vice - president , Joe Biden .
Michelle Obama sat behind him .
Behind her were the Clintons .
As President Trump delivered an astonishing , dark , almost dystopian inaugural speech , staggeringly more raw than the norm , Obama attempted to maintain an inscrutable expression .
But he appeared grim .
However , after Trump wound up his speech and pumped his fists in the air like a prizefighter , Obama shook his hand and clapped him on the arm and could be seen mouthing â€œgood jobâ€ � .
The Obamas followed the Trumps up the carpeted stairs back into the Capitol , each stopping at the top to greet Bob Dole , the 1996 Republican candidate for president , and his wife Elizabeth .
Once inside , Obama and Trump strode across the Rotunda together , their wives behind with Vice - President Mike Pence and his wife , Karen .
The House speaker , Paul Ryan , and leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were among the politicians gathered , alongside military guardsmen on the steps of the East Front of the Capitol as the Obamas and Trumps emerged back into the outdoors .
Known as Marine One when a sitting president is aboard , for the immediate - ex president Obama and first lady the waiting helicopter would be known as Executive One .
Obama descended the steps shoulder to shoulder with Trump , chatting and sharing a joke .
At the bottom , Obama smiled broadly .
His wife could not hide an expression akin to melancholy .
He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it , giving her a reassuring smile .
Then the Trumps walked the Obamas the few short steps across the rain - soaked paving to the helicopter .
Moments after , Biden and his wife Jill got into a limousine to take them to Union station so they could return to Delaware .
Barack Obama kissed Melania Trump on the cheek and Donald Trump kissed Michelle Obama , and murmured something in her ear .
Then Michelle climbed into the helicopter with Barack Obama behind her .
He stopped briefly at the top of the steps to wave twice , smiling , then ducked inside and the door was shut .
The Trumps retreated halfway up the steps of the Capitol to stand with the Pences as the helicopter , seconds after 12.45pm , lifted into grey skies and flew towards Joint Base Andrews , where the former president and first lady would be reunited with their daughters , Malia and Sasha .
At Andrews , Obama gave a short speech to staff that was in complete contrast to Trumpâ€ ™ s gloomy inaugural address .
While Trump spoke of inner - city â€œcarnageâ€ � , of closed factories and crumbling infrastructure , Obama returned to his abiding theme of hope .
â€œYou decided to believe and you knocked on doors and made phone calls , â€ � he said .
â€œYou didnâ€
™ t know how to pronounce Barack Obama , but we got to know each other and throughout it was infused with hope.â€ �
As staff members became tearful , he added that he and Michelle had simply been â€œthe front menâ€ � .
â€œItâ€
™ s always been about you , â€ � he said .
â€œAll the amazing things that have happened over these last 10 years are really just a testament to you.â€ �
The Obamas spent a good 35 minutes saying and hugging their goodbyes .
Then they strode across the rain - soaked apron and held hands to walk along a red carpet leading to the steps up into the presidential 747 .
Familiar the world over as Air Force One , the jet is only called that when a sitting president is aboard .
With the Obamas aboard it was simply the presidential plane .
They paused to wave and then disappeared inside .
The now - former first family have planned a sunshine holiday in Palm Springs , California .
No doubt , the golf course will feature .
The presidential plane set its nose to the west , with a chance for the Obamas to sit back and relax .
No more pre - dawn briefings to come .
In a farewell interview on CBS , Obama had said : â€œWell , hereâ€ ™ s one thing is , Iâ€ ™ m not setting my alarm .
That , Iâ€ ™ m certain of .
That I am absolutely positive of .
Iâ€ ™ m going to spend time with Michelle .
â€œAnd , you know , we got some catching up to do .
Weâ€ ™ ve both been busy.â€ �"
2017-01-26,"Valerie Juneâ€ ™ s
acclaimed 2013 debut , Pushinâ€ ™ Against a Stone , was a crucial stage in a meteoric rise from selling home recordings from a car to supporting the Rolling Stones and winning a fan in Michelle Obama .
Her second album finds the Tennessean again blending genres â€ “ folk , classic pop , soul and Appalachian bluegrass â€ “ into a cohesive whole , thanks to her top - notch songwriting and sublime musicianship .
With her sultry ache of a voice , she could presumably sing the phone book and make it quake with feeling .
These are further tales of long lonely roads and men who done wrong , and this set adds African rhythms , spacey soundscapes and guest vocals from Norah Jones .
The songs run the gamut from Love
You
Once Madeâ€ ™ s organ - blasting bluesy soul and With Youâ€ ™ s Nick Drakeish strings to Shakedown , which is like a country Can .
Itâ€ ™ s an album bursting with standouts , none more so than Astral Plane , which finds June full of childlike wonderment amid a gloriously ethereal atmosphere reminiscent of Van Morrisonâ€ ™ s Astral Weeks .
Fantastic stuff ."
2017-01-28,"Desert Island Discs has welcomed hundreds of guests in its 75 years on the airwaves and celebrates the anniversary with the casting away of David Beckham on Sunday .
We asked readers who they would like to hear on the BBC Radio 4 show and received hundreds of suggestions , from household names such as Michelle Obama and the Queen to lesser known figures who are leaders in their field , such as the statistician Julian Peto and physicist Helen Czerski .
There were calls for those youâ€ ™ d imagine the programme has long had on its radar , with the world of music providing many of your prospective castaways .
Bob Dylan , Kate Bush and Bruce Springsteen ( the latter has already been on the programme ) received a number of votes , but there was interest too in the world of literature and politics â€ “ even journalism , with colleagues at the Guardian and Observer not forgotten .
So who would you like to see and why ?
Here are some of your suggestions so far â€ “
and you can add further ideas in the comments below .
Michelle Obama Lawyer , writer , campaigner , former US first lady â€œShe was such an inspirational first lady and is such a positive and forceful role model for women everywhere , radiating charm , compassion and charisma in these dark and troubled times , â€ � says Catherine Bardrick , one of several to mention Obama .
â€œPlus
, having seen her on James Cordenâ€ ™ s
carpool karaoke
she would be totally up for it ...
not only worthy but a thoroughly entertaining guest to boot!â€ �

John Rentoul Journalist Nominated by Sophie Hedwig Zander , who positively pleads :
â€œHeâ€ ™ s a prominent journalist and author ( and biographer of Tony Blair ) and has had ( I think ) a very interesting life , growing up in India until he was about 11 and then working for a variety of news publications , as well as on an oil rig .
He has wonderful taste in music , particularly modern music
â€
“
you would get an eclectic mix of punk and everything else .
Heâ€ ™ s also my favourite political commentator and ( as he once put it ) highly opinionated .
I would like to hear more about his early life and influences , even if he describes his cultural hinterland as being â€˜the size of a window boxâ€ ™ ( itâ€ ™ s not!).â€ � Britney Spears Musician Seb Darke from London says : â€œThe Kylie episode [ in 2015 ] provided a brilliant opportunity for her to talk candidly in a way stars this big are not often encouraged to do .
Britney has a lot to say that she hasnâ€ ™ t been ready â€ “ or allowed to â€ “ for years , particularly concerning her rapid rise to fame and brutal attacks on her by the media less than a decade later , culminating in her controversial conservatorship .
Her interview with Jonathan Ross late last year proved she is no glassy - eyed blonde with nothing to say , and it would also showcase her rather eclectic music taste.â€ � Mark E Smith Musician Reader Bob Taylor says he â€œcannot think of a single reason why he would not be a fascinating â€ “ albeit scary â€ “ castaway .
Obtuse , contrary , sweary and only mainly intelligible , but it would be very funny if slightly car - crashy .
What more do you want?â€ �
Helen Czerski Physicist , broadcaster Sarah , from Staffordshire , notes : â€œI recently read Czerskiâ€ ™ s book , Storm in a Teacup .
It was a fascinating and accessible read .
She seems to have had a very interesting life so far as a bubble physicist , TV presenter and science communicator .
I have no idea about her taste in music , but after reading about her experience on Scrapheap Challenge , I am sure she would be able to come up with interesting contraptions to make life easier on the desert island.â€ � Prof Julian Peto Epidemiologist , statistician A reader who worked with Julian for a number of years says he inspired her : â€œEntertaining , charming , humble , witty , super - intelligent and worldly wise are not qualities always found in statisticians .
He has been working on HPV and mesothelioma for years , making real strides in helping advice the understanding of these conditions .
His brother , Sir Richard Peto , and fellow epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll are great influences , as well as his lifelong friend , the late Howard Marks ( Mr Nice ) .
An original hippy and believer in the greater good â€ “ he has fascinating theories and insights and mad cap tales to tell.â€ �
Caroline Lucas Politician Peter Lihou in Plymouth nominates the Green party MP .
â€œShe has campaigned for our environment and a different approach to politics for years .
Someone who is passionate about the environment shouldnâ€ ™ t be that â€˜fringeâ€ ™ but the reality is that , in 2017 , we still donâ€ ™ t grasp the significance of the damage we are doing to our planet and our legacy for future generations .
Caroline is also an interesting person and it will be entertaining to learn more about the woman behind the politician.â€ �
Lin - Manuel Miranda Actor , playwright A reader notes : â€œMr Miranda shaped Broadway musicals in an extraordinary way with Hamilton .
The mainstream success of his rap - based musical makes him , in my opinion , one of the most important artists in at least this century .
Also , he is an incredibly interesting person .
And funny.â€ �
Hideo Kojima Video game designer Mannu , in Preston , describes why heâ€ ™ d like to see the Japanese video game designer : â€œHe has an obsession with movies and gives the impression that heâ€ ™ d rather be a film director rather than a video game auteur .
He grew up in a country that was getting to grips with the trauma of the second world war ; this clearly influenced his anti - war message in the Metal Gear series of games .
The success of these has made Hideo the most famous game designer in the world , but he is well known for his love of music , particularly British artists of the 1980s including Bowie and New Order , so I think heâ€
™ d make a very interesting guest.â€ �
Nigel Owens MBE Rugby union referee A rugby fan from London describes Nigel Owens , a rugby union referee , as â€œone of the most prominent openly gay men in sport .
His journey has been a difficult but fascinating one ultimately culminating in his current success and I believe happiness .
I think his story is one that should be shared.â€ � Ariane Mnouchkine Stage director James Eden , from Wakefield , says : â€œAriane has led the ThÃ © Ã¢tre Du Soleil in Vincennes , Paris , for 50 years and is collaboratively responsible for producing the most exciting , innovative theatre in the 20th and 21st centuries .
She rarely tours to the UK (
her last visit was to Edinburgh three years ago ) , so when she does it is headline news .
Bringing Les Atrides to Bradford in 1994 was the highlight of the Year of Culture and saw the transformation of Salts Mill into a functioning theatre for the presentation of four Greek tragedies ( performed in French , without an interval ) and some of the most exciting theatre Iâ€ ™ ve ever seen .
Assimilating theatre traditions from eastern cultures , Mnouchkine has gained a worldwide reputation as one of the most influential theatre directors in the world today.â€ �
Courtney Love Musician , actor â€œChaotic , interesting , furiously intelligent ,
â€ � is how Lucy in Brighton describes Love .
â€œHer record collection is probably brilliant and Live Through This is arguably the best rock album of the 1990s â€ “
appreciated
but I think underrated .
She survived a level of public humiliation , cruelty and hostility that is unimaginable to most of us , but she always called sexism when it happened , and she is polarising in the way all the best people are .
She was a pioneer , simple as that .
Sheâ€ ™ s often very funny and often unlikable and annoying , but that is the point â€ “ her rules
, no one elseâ€
™ s .
She certainly is not peerless , and not even as talented as some of her musical peers , but she was the loudest and the most unapologetic and it counted for a lot .
She changed my life and I can not help but love her and want to hear more from her.â€ �
Bob Dylan Musician â€œHe remains an enigmatic but always fascinating character whose contribution to the arts is almost unequalled in his chosen field â€ “ a fact most recently acknowledged by the Nobel committee , â€ � says reader John McGowan , one of several to nominate Dylan .
â€œHis influence is omnipresent but we still know so little about him .
Nobody knows more about the music traditions of America than Bob .
All of this would make him the perfect guest.â€ � Jackie Malton Former police officer , now TV script consultant and psychotherapist â€œJackie is the former Metropolitan police detective chief inspector who was the model for Lynda La Planteâ€ ™ s TV Series Prime Suspect , â€ � says our reader .

2017-01-28,"The crowd was small , the weather was bad and the speech , that described â€œAmerican
carnageâ€ � , was dire .
For the tens of millions who voted against him and countless concerned others , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s inauguration as president of the United States felt ominous , no matter how widely Barack Obama smiled and no matter how gracefully he and Michelle Obama made the transition from hosts to departing guests .
The feeling of foreboding did not last .
It was overtaken within hours by the realization , at the arrival of the first of the new presidentâ€ ™ s executive actions , that the most outrageous campaign promises Trump had made to the smallest core of his supporters were now official US policy , or about to be .
Within a week , the rally chant â€œbuild the wall!â€ � had morphed into a phrase published on White House stationery : â€œimpassable physical barrierâ€ � .
A proposed ban on Muslim immigrants took shape as a suspension of visa programs from countries that , as Trump put it , â€œhave tremendous terrorâ€ � .
Grumbling about excessive government regulation had become , in one document , an exhortation to bureaucrats to help an oil company skip the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s delivering the goods to his core constituency in a really visible way , â€ � said John T Woolley , head of the American presidency project at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
â€œBut there are a lot of things that heâ€
™ s raising that may be above what he truly has the ability to do.â€ � Seven days into his presidency , the accumulation of Trumpâ€ ™ s official actions , at the rate of as many as five a day , has created a new national reality on central policy concerns from the environment to voting rights to international commitments to immigration , healthcare and trade .
â€œYou have to consider this a pretty aggressive use of executive power early on , â€ � said Julian E Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University .
â€œUsing it not only on one marquee issue , which presidents often do , but on a series of major campaign issues , all within just a few days .
â€œSo
itâ€ ™ s rapid - fire , but more importantly
, each one is a pretty significant decision.â€ �
More difficult to assess than the new presidentâ€ ™ s official actions , but for many Americans just as significant , has been the impact on the public of Trumpâ€ ™ s simple presence in office â€ “ the finally inescapable fact , as it were , of Donald Trump as president .
During the campaign , Trumpâ€ ™ s lies about the fake scourge of voter fraud , his vain obsession with the size of his crowds ( and his hands ) , and his explosions of bile and irrelevance on Twitter could be semi - ignored as the faults of a mercurial political figure who was quite likely , at least , to lose .
Now Trump is in the Oval Office and his lies are voiced by a press secretary standing behind the White House seal in the Brady briefing room .
It was there that Trumpâ€ ™ s spokesman , Sean Spicer , falsely declared on the day after the swearing - in that â€œthis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration , periodâ€
� .
Trumpâ€ ™ s audience was in fact significantly smaller than Obamaâ€ ™ s 2009 crowd , but members of the media who tried to brandish evidence of the fact were shouted down .
Spicer rolled out another whopper days later , informing the country that the president still ( wrongly ) believed millions of votes had been illegally cast in November .
As supporting evidence , he pointed to a 2012 research report on voter fraud , prompting the author of the report to categorically deny that the report said any such thing .
â€œOf
those votes cast , none of them come to me ,
â€ �
Trump told ABC News a day later , embroidering his fantasy .
â€œThey would all be for the other side .
None of them come to me.â€ �
For Americans who doubt his leadership , just as disturbing as Trumpâ€ ™ s new freedom to spout untruths with significantly inflated authority were early reports on his conduct behind the scenes , as he made his first decisions as the most powerful individual on Earth .
Repeatedly , Trump threw thunderbolts from his Twitter account â€ “ threatening to â€œsend in the Feds!â€ � to stop violence in Chicago and impugning Chelsea Manning â€ “ immediately following negative coverage of those topics on Fox News , which Trump told the New York Times he watches morning and night .
It was TV coverage of his small inauguration crowd that prompted Trump to trot out Spicer .
The bad press had not allowed the president to â€œenjoyâ€ � his first weekend in the White House as he felt he deserved , the Associated Press quoted â€œone person who has spoken with himâ€ � as saying .
Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to act on voter fraud was inspired , Trump told members of Congress , by a conversation with a German golfer .
If Trumpâ€ ™ s character is immutable , however , his executive actions may not be .
His orders have the power to guide the conduct of federal agencies and officials , but can not contravene existing law .
Woolley said : â€œThe question always is â€ “ and this is a real question for Trump â€ “ whether the president is going beyond the scope of the law , whether heâ€ ™ s infringing on congressional power , and whether heâ€ ™ s infringing on the divides between national , state and local power .
â€œThereâ€ ™ s going to be a festival of lawsuits about almost every controversial action that he takes.â€ �
Next week , Trump is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress and announce a nominee to fill the vacancy on the supreme court .
Hereâ€ ™ s what he got done on week one .
Immigration
The most famous promise of Trumpâ€ ™ s campaign was that he would build a wall on the 2,000-mile southern border and make Mexico pay for it .
The policy represents a sharp break with the view of Obamaâ€ ™ s top homeland security official , who often said : â€œYou show me a 50 ft wall , and Iâ€ ™ ll show you a 51 ft ladder.â€ �
Nevertheless , Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday calling for â€œthe immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border , monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration , drug and human trafficking , and acts of terrorismâ€ � .
Initially , the project will draw on previously appropriated funds .
But for the project to be completed , Trump will need to retain the support of Republican congressional leaders who have said they are willing to put up the money .
One Senate leader estimated the border wall would cost between $ 12bn and $ 15bn
â€œupfrontâ€ �
â€ “ a possible sticking point among soi - disant fiscal conservatives .
Trumpâ€ ™ s own estimate of the costs of the wall is significantly smaller .
â€œThat wall will cost us nothing , â€ � he said this week , on the same day the Mexican president vowed that the wall would also cost Mexico nothing .
Trump also moved to deny federal funds to â€œsanctuary citiesâ€
�
â€ “ the more than 400 cities and counties in the US that offer some form of safe haven to Americaâ€ ™ s 11 million undocumented migrants .
On Friday , Trump signed an executive order implementing what he called â€œnew vetting measures , to keep radical Islamic terrorists outâ€ � .
The order included a 120-day suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Program ; the indefinite suspension of the admission of any refugees from Syria ; the capping of refugee numbers admitted in 2017 at 50,000 ; and to severely limit immigration from Iraq , Iran , Sudan , Syria , Libya , Somalia and Yemen , all Muslim - majority countries .
According to draft policies leaked to the media , Trump is also preparing executive actions to limit legal immigration and to judge immigration applications on the likelihood that a prospective immigrant would draw in any way on US social welfare programs .
In a final draft immigration policy , Trump would strip immigrants who arrived in the US as children , known as Dreamers , of protections against deportation extended to them by Obama .
The reversal could directly affect 1.2 million American residents who may have little or no knowledge of their origin country .
â€œI do have a big heart ,
â€ �
Trump said of the policy .
â€œWeâ€ ™ re going to take care of everybody.â€ �
Style of government Trump has brought to the job the same leadership style he applied to his campaign : aggressive , reactive and , most of all , improvisatory .
His slew of executive actions has been unleashed before the agency heads and deputies essential to carrying them out are in place
â€ “ a majority have yet to be named .
His justice department has yet to install a head of the office of legal counsel , which past presidents have relied on to protect their unilateral actions from court challenges .
He reportedly did not bother to run his revised torture policy past his CIA and defense department appointees .
It remains to be seen whether Trump is a coalition - builder , in the style of Ronald Reagan , or whether he will keep his distance from Congress , physically and emotionally , in the style of Obama .
Trumpâ€ ™
s
paranoid streak , obsession with leaks and penchant for conspiracy make another president , Richard Nixon , his most natural style touchstone .
Trumpâ€ ™
s style is sufficiently original as to render quaint a series of conversations during the Obama years about presidential â€œfirstsâ€
� : the first president to participate in a Reddit AMA ( â€œask me anythingâ€ � ) , the first president to sit for an interview with YouTube stars .
Trump is the first president to threaten martial law in a major American city on Twitter .
In further contrast with Obama , Trump tweeted his threat to â€œsend in the Feds!â€ � from an account whose wallpaper photo features him signing a document surrounded by seven top advisers â€ “ all white men .
Whatever Trumpâ€ ™ s leadership style is , it is not inclusive across lines of race and gender .
The attention - seeking side of Trumpâ€ ™ s style has made him relatively accessible to the media , so far .
He sat for television and print interviews in his first week and held his first press conference , alongside UK prime minister Theresa May.
Environment
In one of his first meetings as president , Trump told executives from the countryâ€ ™ s biggest automakers he would loosen environmental standards , regulations and taxes if they would help him bring back â€œMade in the USAâ€ � .
Trumpâ€ ™
s promise was quickly ratified in multiple executive orders pertaining to oil pipelines and other infrastructure projects .
The main thrust of Trumpâ€ ™ s environmental policy â€ “ or anti - environmental policy â€ “ may be carried out by his pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , Scott Pruitt , a scathing critic of environmental regulations .
As Oklahomaâ€ ™ s attorney general , Pruitt repeatedly sued the EPA and coordinated his selection of cases with fossil fuel interests .
If confirmed by the Senate , Pruittâ€ ™ s oversight may be exceptionally lax .
Trumpâ€ ™ s executive actions contained two major and symbolically important moves against the cause of renewable energy .
He reopened construction of two oil pipelines , one held up by a federal permit denial and another rejected by Obama .
The Keystone XL pipeline would carry tar sand oil from Alberta , Canada , to the Gulf coast , while the Dakota Access pipeline would carry crude oil from a field in North Dakota to a processing hub in the midwest .
The Dakota project foundered after months of protests by Native American groups , who said the pipeline crossed sacred ground and threatened their drinking water supply .
Trump has also imposed a freeze on new federal regulations , including environmental regulations .
National security Trumpâ€ ™ s first sallies in national security policy have been highly controversial .
He has spoken about and is expected to issue an executive order that would create a pathway to restoring the detention of terrorism suspects at facilities known as â€œblack sitesâ€ � .
Such an order would reverse Obamaâ€ ™ s 2009 order to close the US military prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay and open the way to a resumed use of torture techniques by US operatives on terrorism suspects .
In an interview with ABC News , Trump repeated his belief that torture works , â€œabsolutelyâ€ � , and he said that the US should â€œfight fire with fireâ€ � .
â€œIâ€ ™ ve spoken in recent days with people at the highest level of intelligence , and Iâ€ ™ ve asked them : â€˜Does torture work?â€ ™
And the answer was â€˜Yes , absolutely , â€ ™ â€ �
Trump said .
On Friday he backtracked , not on his own belief in the efficacy of torture but in saying , at his press conference with May , that he would defer to his new defense secretary , James Mattis , who has said torture does not work .
A majority of private and public scholarship and Trumpâ€ ™ s pick to run the CIA also say torture does not work .
US law bans security agencies from using so - called enhanced interrogation techniques .
Manufacturing and trade
â€œThe hour of justice for the American worker has arrived , â€ �
Trump said in a speech to Republican members of Congress on Thursday .
His recipe for making it so includes withdrawing from trade agreements , loosening environmental regulations and other regulations on manufacturers , and taking smaller steps such as requiring that new oil pipelines use US steel .
In one of his first presidential memoranda , Trump directed the US trade representative ( who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate ) to â€œwithdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans - Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations , and to begin pursuing , wherever possible , bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry , protect American workers , and raise American wagesâ€ � .
The memo was followed by an offhand description by Trump of how US trade deals would work from now on .
â€œTheyâ€ ™ ll be one - on - one , they wonâ€
™ t be a whole big mashpot , â€ � he said .
If a US partner reneges on any deal , Trump said , the US would send out 30-day notices of impending trade deal termination .
A separate presidential memorandum directed all heads of government departments and agencies to expedite â€œreviews of and approvals for proposals to construct or expand manufacturing facilities and through reductions in regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturingâ€ � .
Officials are directed to solicit comments from the public for 60 days about how to streamline the permitting process for domestic manufacturers .
Healthcare and abortion One of the first pieces of paper Trump signed as president was an executive order that began to dismantle Obamaâ€ ™ s signature domestic achievement , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .
A full dismantling of the act , which conservative analysts estimate has provided health insurance for more than 10 million people who otherwise would not have it , would require action by Congress , which the Republican leadership has expressed eagerness to deliver .
Trump has ordered agencies and officials to avoid imposing penalties on individuals and others who do not obtain health insurance , a crucial plank in the law known as the â€œindividual mandateâ€ � .
Without it , participants in health insurance markets may decline in number and skew less healthy , driving up costs for insurers and potentially derailing the system .
In a separate memo , Trump restricted funds for global health assistance groups that provide abortion services .
The memo reversed a directive that Obama signed upon taking office , which in turn reversed a memo signed by George W Bush .
Trumpâ€ ™ s memo directs the secretary of state to â€œensure that US taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilizationâ€ � ."
2017-03-07,"Chance the Rapper has announced a donation of $ 1 m to fund public schools in Chicago , a move that prompted Michelle Obama to say to him : â€œYou are an example of the power of arts education.â€ �
Chanceâ€ ™ s
donation came days after he met the Republican governor of Illinois , Bruce Rauner , to discuss the financial problems facing the third - largest school district in the US .
The city is facing a shortfall in its school budget after Rauner vetoed a bill delegating $ 215 m in pension relief to Chicago Public Schools ( CPS ) , insisting it had to be tied to pension reform instead .
At a press conference at Westcott Elementary School in the West Chatham neighbourhood of Chicago , where Chance grew up , the rapper said of his meeting : â€œThe governor gave me a lot of vague answers and since has called me over the weekend.â€ �
He said : â€œOur talks were unsuccessful .
Governor Rauner still wonâ€ ™ t commit to giving Chicagoâ€ ™ s kids a chance without caveats or ultimatums.â€ �
He said the governorâ€ ™ s veto was causing children to suffer and insisted : â€œOur kids should not be held hostage because of political positioning.â€
�
The results of the veto on the funding could be staff layoffs or , Chance said , cutting the school year short by 13 days .
â€œThis means over 380,000 kids will not have adult - supervised activities in June and could possibly be put in harmâ€ ™ s way , â€ � he said .
Chance said his donation was made possible thanks to ticket sales for his forthcoming US tour , and efforts by promoters across the country , who he said â€œwere able to band together to use funds from ticket sales to donate to CPSâ€ � .
He said : â€œThis isnâ€ ™ t about politics .
This isnâ€ ™ t about posturing .
Everybody and [ their ] momma knows about whatâ€ ™ s going on in Chicago .
Itâ€ ™ s constantly talked about .
But weâ€ ™ re about to enhance the conversation .
As a private citizen , as a parent and as a product of CPS , Iâ€ ™ m asking that you guys join and fight with me , organise with me , mobilise with me , for the interest of the children of Chicago .
This is the very beginning.â€ � Michelle Obama tweeted her support for Chanceâ€ ™ s move .
Chanceâ€ ™ s pledge followed Rauner announcing two options to fill the $ 215 m hole , one allowing the cityâ€ ™ s mayor , Rahm Emanuel , to take money from the cityâ€ ™ s tax increment financing funds , the other tying the money to reform of the stateâ€ ™ s pension programme .
Both proposals were rejected by both city and CPS officials .
CPS spokeswoman Emily Bittner sad the plan was â€œracially discriminatoryâ€ � because it â€œactually demands that Chicago students do more to get the same funding that every other student in the state of Illinois is entitled to receiveâ€ � .
Or , as Chance put it : â€œâ€œGovernor Rauner still wonâ€
™ t commit to giving Chicagoâ€ ™ s kids a chance without caveats or ultimatums .
Governor Rauner , do your job!â€ �"

2017-05-01,"At least the vegetable garden is safe .
For now .
The Trump administration is doing away with two marquee programs advanced by the former first lady Michelle Obama .
One program promoted access to education for underserved girls in dozens of countries around the world .
The second promoted healthier lunches in US schools .
The cancelled programs were administered by unrelated federal agencies and their cancellations did not appear to have been coordinated .
In February , the current first lady , Melania Trump , announced her intention of preserving the White House vegetable garden , a signature part of Obamaâ€ ™ s campaign to promote healthy eating and childhood fitness .
But Mondayâ€ ™ s news appeared to leave that legacy , as well as the former first ladyâ€ ™ s work on expanding education for girls , in doubt .
Let Girls Learn , a program to open up educational opportunities for girls around the world started by Michelle and Barack Obama in 2015 , is no longer a standalone program administered by the Peace Corps , according to an internal memo obtained by CNN .
â€œMoving forward , we will not continue to use the â€˜Let Girls Learnâ€ ™ brand or maintain a standalone program , â€ � an email from the acting director of the agency , Sheila Crowley , was quoted as saying .
Let Girls Learn was administered by the Peace Corps in 44 countries .
Last October , to mark the International Day of the Girl , the program announced more than $ 5 m in new private sector commitments â€œto help address the barriers that prevent adolescent girls from attaining an educationâ€ � .
â€œLet
Girls Learn had several years of funding already baked , â€ �
Tina Tchen , a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama , told CNN .
â€œWe were hopeful that given that , it could continue .
But obviously elections have consequences , and nobody knows that better than we.â€ � The Peace Corps produced multiple promotional videos for the program , including this one : â€œIâ€ ™ m extremely disappointed to learn that the Trump administration is discontinuing the landmark
Let Girls Learn initiative , which brought much - needed attention to the unique obstacles that adolescent girls face in getting an education around the world , â€ � said the Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen , of New Hampshire , who proposed new legislation to take up the discontinued programâ€ ™ s mission .
Separately , Trumpâ€ ™ s secretary of agriculture , Sonny Perdue , announced the agency was scrapping certain health standards for school lunches that were part of the former first ladyâ€ ™ s healthy eating initiative .
The standards pertained to sodium levels , whole grain content in foods and milkfat content .
Perdue said the program was not effective because kids would not eat the healthier food .
â€œIf kids arenâ€ ™ t eating the food and itâ€ ™ s ending up in the trash , they arenâ€ ™ t getting any nutrition , thus undermining the intent of the program , â€ � Perdue said at a school in Leesburg , Virginia .
A health advocate quoted by the Tampa Bay Times warned that repealing the health standards was dangerous .
â€œBy forgoing the next phase of sodium reduction , the Trump administration will be locking in dangerously high sodium levels in school lunch , â€ �
Margo Wootan , a lobbyist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest , told the paper .
The state department denied the program was being mothballed .
â€œThere have been no changes to the Let Girls Learn program , â€ � it said in a statement .
It did not reply to requests for comment on the reported Peace Corps memo or the standalone status of Let Girls Learn .
USAid , one of the agencies that administers the program , declined comment and referred the Guardian to the state department statement .
The Peace Corps did not respond to multiple emailed requests for comment , and neither the agencyâ€ ™ s press department nor Crowley nor other top executives returned calls over two days ."
2017-05-12,"Michelle Obama has made her strongest political intervention since leaving the White House , stating bluntly at a health conference : â€œThink about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap.â€ �
One of the former first ladyâ€ ™ s signature legacies was an effort to reduce childhood obesity .
Earlier this month , Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s administration froze regulations that would cut sodium and increase whole grains served in school meals .
â€œWe have a lot more work to do , for sure , but weâ€ ™ ve got to make sure we donâ€ ™ t
let anybody take us back because the question is , where are we going back
to?â€
�
Obama told a Partnership for a Healthier America summit in Washington .
â€œThis is where you really have to look at motives , you know .
You have to stop and think : why donâ€ ™ t you want our kids to have good food at school ?
What is wrong with you?â€ �
The remarks prompted cheers and applause from a packed hotel ballroom .
Seemingly liberated from her official role , Obama was by turns combative , exasperated , feisty , incredulous , passionate , peeved and sardonic .
Obama demanded : â€œAnd why is that a partisan issue ?
Why would that be political ?
What is going on ?
You know , now
thatâ€ ™ s up to moms .
Moms , think about this .
I donâ€ ™ t care what state you live in .
Take me out of the equation .
Like me , donâ€ ™ t like me , but think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap .
Why would you celebrate that ?
Why would you sit idly and be OK with that ?
â€œBecause hereâ€ ™ s the secret : if somebody is doing that , they donâ€ ™ t care about your kid , and we need to demand everyone to care deeply about kids .
Thatâ€ ™ s all we have .
So we should be driving this and
every elected official on this planet should understand :
donâ€ ™ t play with our children .
Donâ€ ™ t do it.â€

Along with the delay in nutrition standards for school lunches announced by the US agriculture secretary , Sonny Perdue , the Trump administration has also postponed rules instructing restaurants , grocery stores and other outlets to put calories counts on their menus .
Evidently riled , Obama continued :
â€œâ€˜You shouldnâ€ ™ t know what youâ€ ™ re eating.â€ ™ Think about that .
Stop there , think about that .
â€˜You shouldnâ€ ™ t know what youâ€ ™ re eating.â€ ™ Youâ€ ™ re OK with that ?
Do you know people who are OK with that ?
I mean , I just find myself thinking ,
this isnâ€ ™ t
my fight , you know , this is where youâ€ ™ ve got to look yourself in the eye .
â€œWe need to look our neighbours in the eye and kind of go : â€˜What is going on?â€ ™ Because this just isnâ€ ™ t that complicated , you know .
Just tell me whatâ€ ™ s in my food .
Why is that a problem ?
So you have to ask yourself , whatâ€ ™ s going on , because I donâ€ ™ t get it .
I donâ€
™ t understand
it.â€
� Sam Kass , a former White House chef and senior policy adviser for nutrition who was interviewing Obama , noted suggestions that an update on nutrition facts labels on food packages could also be slowed .
Obama interjected , with sarcasm : â€œâ€˜Keep families ignorant.â€ ™ Thatâ€ ™ s all Iâ€ ™ m hearing .
â€˜You donâ€
™ t need to know whatâ€ ™ s in your food .
You canâ€
™ t handle that
, Mom .
Just buy this , be quiet , spend your money , you buy this , donâ€ ™ t ask us about whatâ€ ™ s in your food , you know.â€ ™
How does that feel ?
How does that feel ?
â€˜This
isnâ€ ™ t information that you should know .
We shouldnâ€ ™ t change a label to make it clearer and easier for you to just break down what youâ€ ™ re buying.â€ ™ â€œSo consumers out there
â€ “ again , I donâ€ ™ t care where youâ€ ™ re from ,
what your party is â€ “
I would be highly insulted by that thought .
â€˜You want to talk about nanny state and government intervention ?
Well , you just buy the food and be quiet .
You donâ€
™ t need to know whatâ€ ™ s in it.â€ ™ Thatâ€ ™ s essentially what a move like this is saying to you , mom .
They think you donâ€ ™ t care because what they hear from are the people who want their kids to eat whatever they want to eat.â€ �
With Trump seemingly eager to reverse Obamaâ€ ™ s work , advocates are increasingly pinning hopes on the private sector .
This week , companies including Mars and Cumberland Farms announced initiatives with Partnership for a Healthier America , the foundation Obama helped create alongside her â€œLetâ€ ™ s Move!â€ � initiative to combat childhood obesity .
She did not mention Trump or other administration officials by name on Friday but , in warning how bad diets can lead to children being affected by diabetes , she remarked pointedly :
â€œAnd I hope you have healthcare.â€
�
Obama began the session on a lighter note , reflecting on her life since leaving the White House .
â€œEverything is really great , â€ � she said .
â€œBeing â€˜formerâ€ ™ is all right â€ ¦
The presidentâ€ ™ s good .
Heâ€ ™ s running around out there in the world with his shirt unbuttoned.â€ �"
2017-06-25,"People stopped , stared and posed for photos .
A colourful mural on the side of Benâ€ ™ s Chili Bowl restaurant , a lynchpin of African American life in Washington , included Barack and Michelle Obama , Muhammad Ali , Prince and Harriet Tubman .
It included actor Taraji P Henson and rapper Wale .
But one prominent local figure was missing .
â€œIs this where Bill Cosby used to be?â€
� asked Vivian Staine , 30 , a nurse and studio owner , as she beheld the artwork for the first time .
â€œItâ€
™ s kind of shocking to see Bill Cosby is down after heâ€ ™ s been here so long.â€
�
The entertainerâ€ ™ s fall from grace has posed difficult questions for many in the black community and for Benâ€ ™ s Chili Bowl in particular .
Cosby has been a regular customer since his navy days in the 1950s .
He befriended its owners , Ben Ali , an immigrant from Trinidad who died in 2009 , and his wife Virginia , who now runs the restaurant with their three sons .
A historical information sign outside states : â€œThanks in part to the patronage of entertainer Bill Cosby , Benâ€ ™ s has become a national landmark.â€ �
It was no surprise that when artist Aniekan Udofia painted a mural on the restaurantâ€ ™ s exterior wall in 2012 , it featured Cosby along with Obama , local radio DJ Donnie Simpson and godfather of go - go Chuck Brown .
But then came allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted dozens of women and court documents showing that he admitted intending to drug women he wanted to have sex with .
Last Saturday , in Pennsylvania , a judge in the sexual assault trial of 79-year - old Cosby declared a mistrial after jurors reported a hopeless deadlock after six days of deliberation .
On Wednesday , in a ceremony featuring comedian Dave Chappelle and others , Udofia unveiled a new mural expanded to 16 luminaries â€ “ but minus Cosby .
Virginia Ali , 83 , explains that the restaurant ran an online poll to ask the public who should be included : Barack Obama came first , Michelle Obama was second and Cosby did not place in the top 16 .
Referring to the allegations against him , she said : â€œThatâ€ ™ s not
the man I knew .
Itâ€ ™ s one of those â€˜he said , she saidâ€ ™ things and thereâ€ ™ s no point
getting into it because I wasnâ€ ™ t there .
I feel badly for everyone involved.â€ � Cosbyâ€ ™ s face is still visible in two photo montages inside the restaurant , which is famous for its signature
half - smoke â€ “ a sausage with mustard , chopped onions and homemade chili on a hotdog bun .
Ali said : â€œEverybodyâ€ ™ s welcome to Benâ€ ™ s .
When you walk in the door , what youâ€ ™ ve done is left outside and we treat you as family , as a guest .
We treat everyone with the same dignity and warmth .
We donâ€ ™ t judge people here.â€ �
As newlyweds in 1958 , Ben and Virginia Ali used their $ 5,000 savings to renovate and open the restaurant on U Street in what had been a silent film cinema .
They had spotted a gap in the market .
â€œThere were a lot of hamburger places in this town but there were no hot dog and no chili places , â€ � Virginia Ali recalled .
â€œIt was a little scary for me : I didnâ€ ™ t know anything about the restaurant business.â€ �
Washington was , she said , still a racially segregated city .
U Street , known as Black Broadway , was at the heart of African American life .
Subject to Jim Crow laws elsewhere , between 1895 and 1920 the number of black - owned businesses in the area mushroomed from about 15 to more than 300 .
They included thriving bars , clubs and theatres : Duke Ellington grew up and played his first jazz here .
But after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 , riots erupted along the U Street corridor .
At the request of the civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael , the Alis kept the restaurant open past curfew to serve police officers , firefighters and black activists .
Sitting at the original bar as staff feverishly prepared half - smokes and burgers , Virginia nodded towards the now bustling street .
â€œThere was a lot of tension , â€ � she said .
â€œThe national guard were out there with big guns .
Young people were walking down the street with Molotov cocktails .
I could smell the tear gas .
I got a little tear gas in my eye .
It was a very frightening time.â€ �
In subsequent years U Street suffered decay and disinvestment as the middle class took flight , drug trafficking took hold and storefronts became shells .
But Benâ€ ™ s Chili Bowl stood firm , even during the construction of an underground railway line .
Its roll call of famous customers includes Ellington , King , Harry Belafonte , Miles Davis , Ella Fitzgerald , Jimmy Fallon , Jesse Jackson , George Lopez , Chris Rock , Usher , Bono , Hillary Clinton and then president - elect Obama .
The restaurant also appeared in movies : The Pelican Brief with Denzel Washington and State of Play with Russell Crowe .
Today , U Street is gentrifying and diversifying , attracting a new generation of affluent urban dwellers and the usual dilemmas around changing character and spiralling prices .
Benâ€ ™ s
Chili Bowlâ€ ™ s neighbours include banks , bars , dry cleaners , an Italian market , a tarot card reader , a barre and cycling studio , a yoga studio , an Ethiopian restaurant and the historic Lincoln Theatre .
The African American Civil War Memorial and Museum is a short walk away .
On Thursday , Tanesha Willis , 36 , came for her first look at the mural .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s epic , itâ€ ™ s gorgeous actually
, â€ � she said .
â€œItâ€
™ s got people and colours that embody DC.â€
�
The sight of the Obamas made her wistful in the age of Donald Trump , a president accused of reigniting forces of white nationalism .
This week the Congressional Black Caucus declined an invitation to meet him .
â€œItâ€
™ s sad that as Americans weâ€ ™ ve come so far yet overnight weâ€ ™ ve gone backwards ,
â€ �
Willis said .
â€œPeople fought for our freedom and we could lose that .
A hundred years later people harbor the same hate because of skin colour.â€ �
Bridget Eguakun , 58 , a retired staff assistant at the Internal Revenue Service , took photos of the new mural and cited the Obamas , Prince and Muhammad Ali as her favourites .
â€œI think itâ€ ™ s awesome ,
â€ � she said .
â€œItâ€ ™ s an African American restaurant and theyâ€ ™ re depicting the parts played by African American people.â€ �
She shared the ambivalence of many regarding the exclusion of Cosby .
â€œHe did some wrong but
you canâ€
™ t take away everything he contributed to African American culture , â€ � she said about Cosby .
â€œHeâ€ ™ s still a great guy .
The University of Missouri just took away his honorary degree but they didnâ€ ™ t give his money back.â€ �
Several onlookers commented that The Cosby Show gave a positive portrayal of a black middle class family in the 1980s , a time when U Street was in disarray and most media portrayals of African Americans focused on crime , drugs and poverty .
But Cosbyâ€ ™ s legacy has been tarnished by the recent scandal .
Brandi Summers , assistant professor of African American Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University , said : â€œThereâ€ ™ s a lot of tension between people in the black community who think Bill Cosbyâ€ ™ s been set up because his wealth and power are threatening to white people and theyâ€ ™ re trying to take him down , and others who think the women are telling the truth and heâ€ ™ s a predator.â€
�
She added : â€œSometimes the burden of black figures is to represent most or all black people and we forget all individuals have their own stories .
We invented Bill Cosby as a figure ; we donâ€ ™ t know the man .
The Cosby Showâ€ ™ s legacy can live on but him as a figure is whatâ€ ™ s transformed.â€ �"
2017-06-26,"Michelle Obama has recently spoken about the â€œunfairâ€ � fashion standards in the White House .
What did she mean ?
Tania , by email
Oh , the Obamas .
A family in the White House who were actually smart , classy , admirable , mature .
One who inspired the best of humanity and made you feel like you were in safe hands â€ “ feels like something from another century now , doesnâ€
™ t it ?
Sorry , Iâ€ ™ m going to need a moment .
OK !
Iâ€ ™ m a pro
, I can do this â€ “
just ignore me if I occasionally burst into sobs , theyâ€ ™ ll pass .
So Michelle Obama was interviewed earlier this month and she spoke about the disparity between her and her husbandâ€ ™ s experience at red - carpet events : â€œNow , people take pictures of the shoes I wear , the bracelets , the necklace .
They didnâ€ ™ t comment that for eight years he wore the same tux and same shoes , â€ � she said .
â€œHe was proud of it , too !
He was like : â€˜Mmm !
Iâ€ ™ m ready .
Iâ€ ™ m ready in 10 minutes , mm hmm .
How long did it take you?â€ ™ Iâ€ ™ m like :
â€˜Get outta here ...
â€ ™ â€ �
Can we all just admit that the Obamas are the ultimate # Relationshipgoals ?
And of course , as always , Michelle is right .
The overwhelming disparity between what is expected of women and men when they dress up for events is never more obvious than when it involves a woman whose previous professional success was never in any way dependent on their looks , as was the case with superstar lawyer Michelle Obama .
Defenders of this system â€ “ and , as a fashion columnist , I suppose I should be among them
â€ “ will say this works in womenâ€ ™ s favour , as they get the fun of dressing up and can stand out more .
Poor men , wearing the same boring suit all the time and not being judged by the worldâ€ ™ s press and able to wear comfortable shoes and not feeling all trussed up like a Barbie and , and , and â€ “ sorry , Iâ€ ™ ve lost my train of thought .
Why am I feeling sorry for men again ?
We all know that women go through this because itâ€ ™ s another means of reducing , hobbling and infantalising them .
You canâ€ ™ t get much thinking done if youâ€ ™ re worried about how your dress will look on camera and your shoes are breaking your feet .
Because as much as I love Barry Obama , I think he and I both know that if his wife hadnâ€ ™ t had to spend about 60 % of her time in the White House dealing with her hair and wardrobe , she could have run the country twice as well as him in half the time .
God , itâ€ ™ s hot .
Whatâ€ ™ s the one thing to avoid , style - wise , in this heat ?
Charlie , by email Rub .
Rub is enemy numero uno in the hot weather .
Now , nobody wants to be the dick who complains about the bad weather in this country 10 months of the year , only to then immediately start griping about the good weather when the sun finally comes out .
But it has to be said , the rub factor has been off the charts for the past two weeks .
â€œWhat is â€˜the rub factorâ€ ™ ?â€ � you ask , wiping the sweat away from your wide - eyed innocent expression .
Ah , Iâ€
™ m sorry .
I forgot I wasnâ€ ™ t talking to experts like myself who had been schooled in official fashion terminology at the Hubert de Givenchy College for Kids
Who Canâ€ ™ t Read Good .
The rub factor measures how much your clothes are chafing against various parts of your body : your inner thighs , your groin and your armpits , most commonly .
Yes , weâ€ ™ re really maintaining this columnâ€ ™ s reputation for aspirational glamour this week .
As I was saying , there has been serious rub in Britain of late , to no oneâ€ ™ s benefit .
And the real problem with rub , aside from the physical discomfort and , in the case of ladies , having occasionally to unpick your clothes out of intimate crevices , is the smell .
Nothing makes clothes smell worse than rub .
It is a strange but undeniable fact that the sweat you build up from , say , exercise smells literally a tenth as bad as sweat from rub .
Seriously , have you been on a train in the past week ?
Iâ€ ™ d rather spend a month breathing only the fragrance from the Wimbledon menâ€ ™
s changing room than spend two minutes on Londonâ€ ™ s District line at rush hour .
And how fast rub arises !
It happens even faster than hairs can sprout on a ladyâ€ ™ s face : totally bare - faced at breakfast , full on whisker by dinner time ( like I said , itâ€ ™ s all about aspirational glamour this week ) .
So what to do ?
Well , the most obvious is to wear loose clothing .
It is an annual amazement how many people wear shirts and dresses that jam up tight into their pits .
Have these people all had botox injections into their armpits to stop them from sweating , as someone totally unreliable once told me Sharon Stone had done ?
Or have they never lived through a summer before ?
Loose armholes , people : loose armholes are you best friends in the summer .
And same with legs and crotches ( truly one of the loveliest words in the English language ) .
This is why I never understood how some people can find high - waisted and tight hotpants so sexy : sure , everyone can see the shape of your bum , but do you know how much those shorts must reek of grade - A rub ?
Get away from me , Daisy Duke , and sort out your personal hygiene .
Just get some slim - but - breathable shorts , slim - but - breathable T - shirts , a couple of loose dresses with low - cut armholes ( this is where the peasant dress really comes into its own ) , and youâ€ ™ re set for a minimal - rub summer .
Disregard my advice at your own peril , and please donâ€ ™ t sit anywhere near me on the train ."
2017-07-27,"Michelle Obama has spoken about the racism she faced as first lady , as she encouraged women to strive to succeed despite setbacks .
During an armchair conversation in front of 8,500 people in Denver , Colorado , Obama was commended for breaking the glass ceiling by becoming the first black first lady .
Asked which of the falling glass shards cut the deepest , she said : â€œThe ones that intended to cut , â€ � referencing an incident in which a West Virginia county employee called her an â€œape in heelsâ€ � , as well as people not taking her seriously because of her colour .
â€œKnowing that after eight years of working really hard for this country , there are still people who wonâ€ ™ t see me for what I am because of my skin colour
, â€ � she told the crowd .
In the speech , made on Tuesday at the Pepsi Centre in Denver as part of the Womenâ€ ™ s Foundation of Coloradoâ€ ™ s 30th anniversary fundraising celebration , Obama said she couldnâ€ ™ t pretend the experiences didnâ€ ™ t hurt because that would let the perpetrators off the hook .
â€œWomen , we endure those cuts in so many ways that we donâ€
™ t even know weâ€ ™ re cut ,
â€ � she said , according to a report in the Denver Post .
â€œWe are living with small tiny cuts , and we are bleeding every single day .
And weâ€ ™ re still getting up.â€
�
She said the wounds of failure hurt deeply but healed with time , and if women acknowledged their scars they could encourage younger girls to strive and succeed .
The Post reported that while Obama largely stayed away from politics , she received cheers from the crowd when she took a few thinly veiled shots at the Trump administration , and boos when she reiterated that she would not be seeking public office .
â€œPublic service and engagement will be a part of my life and my husbandâ€ ™ s life for ever , â€ �
she added .
Both Michelle and Barack Obama have signed book deals with Penguin Random House .
The former lawyer warned against the notion of a nation falling apart , saying that America was a young country that would learn from its mistakes and successes .
â€œThe people in this country are universally good and kind and honest and decent .
Donâ€ ™ t be afraid of the country you live in .
The folks here are good , â€ �
she said , adding that instead of relying on national policies , women needed to take charge in their own lives and communities .
She also talked on a range of topics she advocated for as first lady , including education for girls and health and nutrition for schoolchildren .
â€œIf we want girls in Stem ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) , we need to rethink how we deliver education .
Teachers , a kind word can mean the world to a young girl , â€ �
she said .
As first lady , Obama launched several campaigns around education , including Reach Higher , which inspires students to complete education past high school , and Let Girls Learn , which helps facilitate educational opportunities for young girls in developing countries .
In May , she made her strongest political intervention by attacking the Trump administrationâ€ ™ s reversal of regulations to help improve school lunches .
Addressing the crowd in Denver , she mentioned Barack Obamaâ€ ™ s campaign slogan .
â€œIt was never â€˜yes
he canâ€ ™ ; it was â€˜yes we canâ€ ™ ,â€ � she said .
â€œWhen we put so much on a person , on a leader , we absolve ourselves of doing anything else .
Weâ€ ™ re all on a journey together
â€
¦
We all want someone who will fix things , but weâ€ ™ re going to have to fix it together.â€ �
She advised people to surround themselves with other powerful figures and never be afraid to fail and to protect what they love .
â€œWhat is going on within us [ women ] that we donâ€ ™ t feel worthy enough to protect the things we value?â€ � she asked ."
2017-09-13,"After staying out of the fray for much of Donald Trumpâ€ ™ s presidency , Barack Obama is going back to where it all began .
The former president announced plans on Wednesday to host a summit of young leaders in Chicago , designed to boost civic engagement and expand opportunities for young people both in the US and abroad .
Obama unveiled the two - day Obama Foundation Summit , which will also feature Michelle Obama , in a video message that drew upon familiar themes of enacting change from the outside .
â€œWe want to lift up the amazing work that organizers , inventors , artists , entrepreneurs , journalists and others are doing , â€ � Obama said , speaking directly to the camera .
â€œAnd if we do it right , together weâ€ ™ ll show the world that each of us has a role to play in our civic life.â€ � The summit will be hosted in Obamaâ€ ™ s hometown at the end of October .
The foundation also announced a two - year fellowship program focused on training and development for â€œcivic innovatorsâ€ � .
Although there was no mention of Trump , consistent with Obamaâ€ ™ s reluctance since leaving office in January to criticize him by name , Obama gave a nod to the political climate in a written statement .
â€œDemocracy is a job for all of us .
What are you going to do about it?â€
� Obama wrote in an email to the foundationâ€ ™ s supporters .
â€œIâ€ ™
ve never been more certain that weâ€ ™ ll rise to the occasion â€ “ together .
â€œWhen
I left office in January
, I asked of you the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me back in 2008 .
I asked you to believe â€ “ not in my ability to bring about change , but in yours.â€ � Obama has kept a low profile since handing Trump the keys to the White House , choosing to weigh in on only a handful of issues .
He issued statements on Trumpâ€ ™ s travel ban , Americaâ€ ™ s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and , most recently , Trumpâ€ ™ s decision to tear up protections for roughly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers .
Obamaâ€ ™ s most political comments so far came as Republicans attempted to dismantle the Affordable Care Act , his signature legislative accomplishment that has expanded access to healthcare to nearly 22 million Americans .
While accepting the John F Kennedy Library Foundationâ€ ™ s Profile in Courage award in May , Obama implored lawmakers to show the â€œcourage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirmâ€ � .
David Simas , the CEO of the Obama Foundation , said :
â€œFrom leaders who are already making an impact , to people who are interested in becoming more involved , but donâ€ ™ t know where to start , our goal is to make our programs accessible to anyone , anywhere , with any background or level of experience .
â€œThis is only the beginning â€ “ our programs will grow as we continue to listen and learn.â€ �"
2017-09-25,"What have Richard Branson , Steve Jobs , Mark Zuckerberg , Sheryl Sandberg and Michelle Obama all got in common ?
They all say that having a mentor has been crucial to their success .
Mentoring is one of the key components of the Princeâ€ ™ s Trust Enterprise programme , which is supported by NatWest and has worked with more than 80,000 budding young entrepreneurs since it began in 1983 .
â€œOne of the challenges young people face when starting a business is that they donâ€ ™ t have the life experience or social networks , â€ � explains Emma Howard , national programme manager , Enterprise , at the Princeâ€ ™ s Trust .
â€œOur mentors help bridge that gap by introducing the young people to their own network , keeping them focused with regular catch - ups and being on the end of the phone to offer support and advice.â€ � Ridhi Kalaria went through the Princeâ€ ™ s Trust Enterprise programme in 2011 .
She and her business partner , artist Josephine Reichert , met while studying at Birmingham University and came up with their business idea soon after graduating .
â€œJosephine wanted to find a space to display her work , but every gallery she tried charged .
Our peers were opening spaces in London and we wanted to do the same in Birmingham , but knew that , as it was the beginning of the recession , getting full - time funding for an art gallery was going to be difficult.â€ �
The pair came up with the idea of creating a cafe which could bring in some income and also have the space to display artwork .
They found their perfect spot in an old printing factory , asked for donations of furniture , crockery and cutlery and , with the help of 30 volunteers renovating , painting and decorating , turned the space into the Ort Cafe .
One of the volunteers recommended the Princeâ€ ™ s Trust Enterprise programme as it had helped him start his mobile bike mechanic business .
â€œWeâ€ ™ d used whatever free advice was available , but going on the Enterprise programme four - day course cemented all the bits of information weâ€ ™ d gathered , â€ � says Ridhi .
â€œThe best part , however , was being assigned our mentor , Jennie.â€ � Jennie Koo , risk performance oversight manager at NatWest in Birmingham , had learnt mentoring skills while studying for her degree in sociology and psychology .
She applied for a mentorâ€ ™ s role at the Princeâ€ ™ s Trust and went through a rigorous three - day interview process .
â€œIt really tested our abilities .
We looked at a selection of young peopleâ€ ™ s stories , as many come from difficult backgrounds and have been abandoned and abused .
We had to be able to cope with that emotional baggage and also understand that their entrepreneurial skills would be pretty basic .
And we learnt how to mentor â€ “ to understand that itâ€ ™ s not your business , youâ€ ™ re just there to guide , and to help them get the most out of their ambition and make some money.â€ � Jennie met with Ridhi and Josephine regularly and the three clicked from the start .
â€œI remember feeling incredibly comfortable with Jennie at our first meeting , â€ � says Ridhi .
â€œWe knew immediately that she was on our side , a critical friend to help us solve any problems we faced.â€
� Issues they covered at their monthly catch - ups ranged from staff issues and legal matters to cashflow and cost analysis .
â€œJennie had this huge network of contacts in the business world she could draw on for support and specialist expertise , so suddenly we had access to all these brains , â€ � says Ridhi .
â€œWe had a temporary tenancy contract while we were getting the cafe off the ground and when the renewal came up Jennie consulted a property law colleague and worked through the clauses with us .
She also helped us with business strategy , health and safety and , often , our confidence .
When youâ€ ™ re starting up you just see the things that are going wrong .
Jennie would say : â€˜Remember that event last week where you brought in 100 people ?
Celebrate that instead of worrying that the dishwasher flooded!â€ ™ â€
�
The mentoring relationship came to a natural end after 18 months , but the three are still in touch ; the Ort Cafe was sold and Josephine and Ridhi opened the Ort Gallery in October 2016 .
As Jennie says , though , the success of the mentoring relationship was as much down to Ridhi and Josephineâ€ ™ s engagement as her support .
â€œRidhi and Josephine took on board everything I recommended â€
“
they went along to courses and workshops I suggested and took me up on my offer to phone whenever they needed me .
Seeing them develop the cafe from nothing to a phenomenal business â€ “ and now the gallery â€ “ is wonderful and phenomenally rewarding.â€ �
