Joe Meek 8 pm , UK Arena
Another showing for this beguiling profile of the maverick British record producer who pioneered multi - track recording in the early 1960s , on hits like Johnny Remember Me and Telstar .
Like his US counterpart , Phil Spector , Meek 's personal life was often as dramatic as his music : persecuted for his homosexuality , furtively working with major stars in his home - built studio , gradually succumbing to paranoia , and dying in a double shooting aged 37 - though his name , appropriately enough , lives on in a respected brand of audio gear .
Shine ( Scott Hicks , 1996 ) 8 pm , FilmFour Virtuoso Oscar - winning performance from Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott , the classical pianist who broke down while playing Rachmaninov 's gruelling third concerto , and remained stuck in a twittering , twilight world until redeemed by the love of a woman ( Lynn Redgrave ) .
While much of the emotional wallop comes from the elemental music , performed by Helfgott himself , there are other moving acts : John Gielgud 's music tutor , and Armin Mueller - Stahl as the Polish - born father whose oppression of the young Helfgott ( Noah Taylor ) sets up the pianist 's collapse .

11.50pm ,
FilmFour A young Dutch couple holidaying in France stop at a service station where the woman ( Johanna Ter Steege ) goes missing : an unexceptional start to no ordinary thriller .
For the next three years the man , Gene Bervoets , is taunted by postcards from the kidnapper ( Bernard - Pierre Donnadieu ) , until finally he is invited to meet his tormentor .
A real nightmare , this : a breathtaking study in the banality of evil by Donnadieu , and a shuddering conclusion ."
1999-12-16,"In 1965 Tom Wolfe famously declared Phil Spector the first tycoon of teen .
Almost 35 years on , we can look back on Spector 's startling but brief reign as a hit - maker and see that he was also pop 's first auteur .
The word "" producer "" is simply not big enough to describe the process he created , controlled and orchestrated on a string of pop songs that began in 1958 with the Teddy Bears '
To Know Him is to Love Him , and ended , more or less , in 1966 with Ike and Tina Turner 's River Deep , Mountain High .
Spector 's name is synonymous with the pre - psychedelic golden age of pop .
Spectorsound was pop 's first sonic signature , instantly recognisable and utterly unique . ""
His records were dirty great explosions , guerrilla grenades , "" wrote Nik Cohn .
"" They were the loudest pop records ever made .
He 'd take one good song and add one good group and then he 'd blow it all sky high into a huge mock symphony , bloated and bombasted into Wagnerian proportions .
He 'd import maybe three pianos , five percussions , entire battalions of strings .
Drums and bass underneath like volcanoes exploding .
"" It was n't the song that counted , only the sound .
By the age of 22 , Spector had made $ 2 m and a series of 45rpm masterpieces , including Spanish Harlem by Ben E King , Da Doo Ron Ron and
Then He Kissed Me by the Crystals , Be My Baby by the Ronettes and You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' by the Righteous Brothers .
Ultimately , though , he refined and amplified his signature to such epic proportions there was nowhere left to go .
When River Deep failed commercially , Spector , seemingly unable to reinvent himself , retreated from the public eye .
There were only scattered hits afterwards , as well as much - publicised contretemps with artists as varied as the Beatles , Leonard Cohen and the Ramones .
Spector 's quest for the perfect production was , in the end , his undoing .
Somewhere along the way his obsessiveness toppled into paranoia : he lived in a mansion ringed with razor wire and guarded by dogs ; he worked in an almost perpetual darkness , conducting farcical business meetings in an unlit office , his falsetto voice emerging ghostlike from the gloom .
He remains a reclusive , eccentric figure with a stormy temper .
He allegedly once pulled a gun on Joey Ramone , after refusing to surrender some finished master tapes .
Spector 's fall coincided with the emergence of another young and obsessive American producer .
Brian Wilson , who already had shaped his own sun - drenched , windswept Californian surf sound for his group , the Beach Boys , heard the Beatles ' Rubber Soul in 1965 and , both intimidated and inspired , told his wife , "" I 'm going to make the greatest rock and roll album ever made .
"" The result of this uncharacteristic boast was the album Pet Sounds , produced , written and arranged by Wilson while the rest of the band were on tour .
It finally buried the Beach Boys ' surfing - and - hot - rods image , but also signalled the beginning of its creator 's dramatic decline .
Made while Wilson was on a diet of shrimp cocktail and steak , followed by copious amounts of hash brownies , the album highlighted not only its creator 's genius as a producer , but his mental fragility and child - like innocence .
Alongside the well nigh perfect beauty of Would n't It Be Nice and God Only Knows
, I Just Was n't Made for These Times mines a deep seam of melancholy and almost adolescent introversion .
It is the sound of a man trying in vain to make sense of the world .
Despite being made relatively quickly , Pet Sounds cost a then unprecedented $ 70,000 .
The single that followed was only three minutes and 35 seconds long , but took six months to make and cost $ 50,000 .
The complex , multi - tracked Good Vibrations was meant to be the bridge between Pet Sounds and Smile , Wilson 's famous lost masterpiece .
The stories surrounding the making and subsequent destruction of Smile are legion .
Fuelled by LSD , marijuana and prescribed amphetamines , Wilson first created his dream house high in the Hollywood hills .
A piano was placed in a huge sand pit built inside the den so Wilson could feel the sand under his feet as he worked ; a tent was erected inside the front room , complete with velvet floors , cushions and an assortment of hookahs , but no ventilation system .
It was used once and once only .
For the recording sessions , Wilson bought $ 2,000 worth of hash and , subsequently , most of the group 's vocals were delivered from a horizontal position , the microphones dangling from the ceiling .
Songs like Heroes and Villains and Surf 's Up were as complex as Good Vibrations , but the recording sessions dragged on and on , eating up unheard - of amounts of money .
Wilson 's behaviour , too , progressed from the surreal to the psychotic .
At one point he became obsessed with the idea that Spector was trying to control his mind : he bought countless copies of the single Be My Baby and wore out the grooves searching for hidden meanings .
For a track called Vegetables he filled the studio with fresh produce .
Recording a track called Fire , Wilson started an actual fire in a bucket in the corner and instructed the musicians to wear fireman 's helmets while they played .
With smoke billowing around , they recorded 24 takes before the producer was satisfied .
That night , the television news reported that a series of fires had broken out across Los Angeles .
Wilson decided they had been caused by the "" vibrations "" sent out by his music .
He tried unsuccessfully to burn the tapes , then locked them in a vault where , legend has it , they remain .
Like Spector , Wilson has remained a reclusive figure ever since , first confining himself to his bedroom for several years , then only emerging into the public eye after treatment from the controversial psychotherapist Eugene Landy .
Both Spector and Wilson made their finest music in the shadow of their absent but dominant fathers and saw the pursuit of perfection as a way of coping with their otherness .
Spector was haunted by the death of his father , Ben , who committed suicide when his son was nine ; the title of his first hit ,
To Know Him Is To Love Him , was taken from Ben 's gravestone .
Wilson was deeply marked by the bullying and taunts of his father Murray , whose beatings may have cost him the hearing in his right ear .
Spector 's records have been described as acts of revenge , but Wilson was more interested in transcendence .
It hovered over his best songs , palpably close but just out of reach .
By turns bullied and indulged by his brothers and his ever - changing retinue of hangers - on , he was pushed into a breakdown by the pressure to create one masterpiece after another .
Pop 's first and arguably finest auteurs touched perfection and were debilitated beyond repair by the experience .
Yet their best music stands as testimony to the power of obsessive self - belief .
Even now , as the white light of technology blurs and diminishes our sense of awe , we can but listen and wonder ."

2000-03-12,"There 's something special about the idea of a dark , sprawling house in Los Angeles , filled with the ghosts of a glorious past , the sun shining relentless outside , but a firmly shuttered murk within .
Think of Sunset Boulevard , or Phil Spector and Brian Wilson .
These are the images conjured up by reports of an apparently increasingly reclusive Quentin Tarantino , lurking in his vast house in the Hollywood Hills and battling with script after script that does n't work .
One is about his father , a strikingly personal choice for a man accused of making movies about movies .
Tarantino , they say , does n't leave his grounds much .
He does n't have to : he has his own screening room , with a proper 35 mm projector .
What more could he need ?
The question of what has happened to Tarantino started to crop up when lists of the best films of the Nineties appeared at the end of last year .
Working on The Observer 's Top 10 , I was almost surprised when I remembered Tarantino .
It is only two years since Jackie Brown was released here , but he seemed to have been gone for much longer .
He just disappeared .
Not only because he did n't seem to be doing anything , but because no one talked about him any more .
Somehow , he had gone from being the biggest thing since the movie brats of the Seventies , to the guy whose last film was the second best Elmore Leonard adaptation of 1998 , utterly eclipsed by Steven Soderbergh 's Out Of Sight .
He wrote the introduction to a book about blaxploitation , he put his name to the re - release of a couple of terrible Seventies films and broke up with Mira Sorvino .
The rather romantic vision of Tarantino going mad in his mansion is deflated when you learn the one bit of work he has finished recently is playing a blind preacher in Little Nicky , Adam Sandler 's latest .
That 's right , in two years the most famous director of his generation has done a bit part in an Adam Sandler movie .
It starts you thinking : what was all the fuss about in the first place ?
It was all an accident , anyway .
Reservoir Dogs was originally planned as a tiny $ 35,000 film until Harvey Keitel got involved .
You can see that it was designed to be a micro - budget film : most of it takes place in a big bare warehouse , and you never get to see the heist .
In the end , it still only cost $ 1.5 million .
But it did n't look cheap , it was n't arty ; it was clever but not weird , clearly aimed at people who never have considered watching a Jim Jarmusch or even David Lynch film .
Consciously or not , Tarantino had created a third way between the Hollywood of the high concept Top Gun years and its arthouse polar opposite .
Strangely , Reservoir Dogs flopped at the US box office , although it did well here .
But it made an impact regardless .
The slow - motion walking sequence became instantly famous , as did the ear - slicing scene .
The film helped put the Sundance festival on the map .
It brought John Woo to the attention of Western audiences .
The soundtrack was perfect for a time when exploring record piles in charity shops suddenly seemed like a good idea .
And it was a man 's film , three years before Loaded and all that followed .
Quentin Tarantino was 29 .
Everything snowballed .
Old scripts he had written were dusted down for True Romance , and Natural Born Killers .
He directed a quarter of the vilified Four Rooms .
His co - writer Roger Avary directed the widely disliked Killing Zoe .
Tarantino was invited to inflict his acting on other people 's films , and did some dialogue about Silver Surfer comics for Tony Scott 's submarine movie Crimson Tide .
And when Pulp Fiction emerged , the hype seemed instantly justified .
Here 's Time magazine at Cannes in 1995 : ' Then BLAM !
, the Wild Bunch hit town .
On the festival 's final Saturday , John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Samuel L. Jackson , Uma Thurman and other performers from the American thriller Pulp Fiction brought some big - time , macho - and - mayhem , Uzi - in - your - gut star quality to Cannes . '
And the Washington Post on the film : ' Pulp Fiction is everything it 's said to be : brilliant and brutal , funny and exhilarating , jaw - droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet .
Quentin Tarantino , the postmodern Boy Wonder of American crass culture , for whom the only thing to fear is boredom itself , has produced a work of mesmerising entertainment .
To watch this movie ( whose 2 hours speed by unnoticed ) is to experience a near - assault of creativity . '
Pulp Fiction cost $ 8 m to make .
It won the Palme d'Or and made more than $ 200 m .
It was hip and mass market .
It brought back Travolta and made Jackson a star .
Aging surf guitar hero Dick Dale was suddenly playing Europe to big crowds .
And Tarantino was on the verge of being the most famous director since Hitchcock .
What followed was n't a spectacular self - destruction ; there was no act of ego - driven madness like Dennis Hopper 's The Last Movie , or
Peter Bogdanovich 's At Long Last Love or Michael Cimino 's Heaven 's Gate .
People just got tired of films in which hitmen talked about old TV shows .
From Things
To Do In Denver
When You 're Dead down to 8 Heads
In A Duffel Bag , the schtick grew wearier and wearier .
Kevin Williamson picked up the postmodern / pop cult riffs and used them for Scream .
That has exhausted itself too , as anyone who has had the misfortune of seeing Williamson 's directorial debut Teaching Mrs Tingle knows .
The gang discussing Madonna over breakfast at the start of Reservoir Dogs had seemed so fresh , but staleness set in alarmingly .
I remember seeing Heat and appreciating the lack of ostentatious cleverness in the dialogue .
Tarantino 's insistence on appearing on screen did n't help either : he 's an immensely gifted writer , a pretty fair director and one of the worst actors the world has ever seen .
Only a year after the impossible heights of Pulp Fiction , From Dusk
Till Dawn , scripted by and starring Tarantino , was described by one critic as ' indefensible trash ' .
So Tarantino made Jackie Brown : cutting down on the violence , concentrating on a middle - aged love story .
And the world shrugged and walked on by .
In theory , the film was a step in the right direction , Tarantino 's shot at growing up .
In practice , nobody cared .
Two years on from Jackie Brown , there is no Tarantino - shaped hole at the heart of Hollywood .
Guy Ritchie nicked the whole Tarantino bag of tricks for Lock , Stock And Two Smoking Barrels , and ended up on Madonna 's arm .
Others have raced ahead .
Some mistook Paul Thomas Anderson for the new Tarantino when Boogie Nights first came out - ah , the Seventies ! , they shouted .
Burt Reynolds !
Tacky songs on the soundtrack !
But the scope and depth of Anderson 's Magnolia is far beyond anything Tarantino has even hinted at .
Tarantino has talked a lot about making a men - on - a - mission movie , his Dirty Dozen .
But why wait when you can see Three Kings , which has all the elements you can imagine in Tarantino 's film - the deliberate juxtaposition of violence and humour - plus a political complexity that would surely elude Quentin .
Why miss him when you can have a hip - hop soundtracked hitman movie paying homage to both Kurosawa and Tarantino 's beloved Jean - Pierre Melville like Jim Jarmusch 's fabulous Ghost Dog :
The Way Of The Samurai , due out here in April ?
Or a hitman movie that stars Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda , exploiting every Sixties resonance they possess , like Soderbergh 's The Limey ?
In fact , the way Soderbergh overcame the albatross of Sex , Lies and Videotape via a retreat into impenetrable artiness to a commercial resurrection as George Clooney 's favourite collaborator could be a lesson to Tarantino .
Meanwhile , one of the stalled Tarantino scripts focuses on World War II , written by another burnt - out one - time wonderboy , Peter Bogdanovich .
Bogdanovich , like Tarantino , is a feverish film buff , a man who went to Hollywood to worship at the feet of the great directors .
Like Tarantino , he 's an intensely geeky character who struck gold early :
The Last Picture Show was his second movie .
Like Tarantino , there was a period when he seemed unable to do any wrong : What 's Up Doc ?
starred Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand and still managed to be a good film .
There is one lesson Bogdanovich can give Tarantino : do n't grow up to be like me .
Whether he has the humility to say it is another matter .
There 's a strange story that appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer recently .
The paper reported that Tarantino has made another film , in secret .
It 's a nice idea , but an impossible one .
Unless , of course , Tarantino has turned the camera on himself , and made a harrowing film about a once dominant director adrift in his vast estate above LA .
In which case , he really was smarter than us all along ."
2000-08-21,"The Toes say their influences range from the Rolling Stones to Phil Spector .
It 's certainly reflected in the five - piece 's sound : swaggering , bluesy rock'n'roll mixed with a freakish soul , as exemplified on their debut EP , Lung Oyster Blues .
Arguably , such retro - flavoured rawness helped win them their deal with Cornershop 's label Meccico Records : early Cornershop were themselves a bundle of punky energy .
But , at this show , the Toes prove they also possess great catchy melodies and fantastic assurance .
Wearing oversized shades , nonchalantly smoking and shaking orange maracas , frontman Ritchie is impossible to ignore .
They open with a louche , funky instrumental , Captain Nemo , and , from then on , every number builds into a mental wig - out , with Ritchie at the helm , strutting around the tiny stage like a weird hybrid of Jagger and Jarvis Cocker .
When he sings about "" sippin ' lemonade "" , you feel pretty sure Ritchie favours mouthwash of a more rock'n'roll variety .
He is a frontman with plenty of front .
This is an engaging , occasionally shambolic affair : honky - tonk tunes are coaxed from a synth balanced on orange crates , there are smashed up beats and rasping guitar riffs .
But if the Toes ' performance revels in rock'n'roll cliches , they also boast a commendable lack of self - consciousness and an irresistible sense of enjoyment .
Their glammy encore even takes inspiration from the TV show , Gladiators .
Doused in sweat and beer and adrenalin , their message rings ear - splittingly loud and clear : excess is best ."
2000-08-31,"The name of Jack Nitzsche first came to the attention of the sort of pop fans who scrutinise the small print on record labels when , in the early 1960s , he helped build Phil Spector 's "" wall of sound "" , as featured on hits by the Crystals , the Ronettes and Ike and Tina Turner .
His subsequent work as an arranger , composer and pianist took him into significant collaborations with the Rolling Stones , Sonny and Cher , Neil Young and many others , and eventually into the world of film scoring , where he produced the soundtracks for Performance ,
One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest , The Exorcist , An Officer and a Gentleman , and 9&amp;1/2 Weeks .
Having started life as a musical hack in an age of comparative innocence , Nitzsche ended it in the Queen of Angels Hospital , Hollywood .
He died from cardiac arrest brought on by a recurrent bronchial infection , aged 63 - as one of pop 's most influential backroom figures , a pioneer who found a way of exploiting what was , for the time , an unusually eclectic musical taste .
Born in Chicago but raised on a farm outside Newaygo , Michigan , Nitzsche moved to Los Angeles in 1955 , aged 18 , with the ambition of becoming a jazz saxophonist .
But the burgeoning Hollywood pop scene soon attracted his attention , and Sonny Bono , then an A&amp;R man for the Specialty label , gave him his first job , as a music copyist .
Nitzsche soon exceeded his initial brief by writing a novelty hit , Bongo Bongo Bongo , for Preston Epps , a session percussionist .
Nitzsche encountered Phil Spector in 1961 while working in the Hollywood office of Lee Hazlewood , the producer of Duane Eddy 's twangy guitar hits ( and later Nancy Sinatra 's musical partner ) .
The following summer , Spector , still barely 20 years old , invited Nitzsche to create the orchestration for a Gene Pitney song called He 's a Rebel , to be recorded by the Crystals .
With the session singer Darlene Love taking the place of the Crystals ' own lead singer , Barbara Alston , the session provided the template for Spector 's much imitated sound .
Not particularly keen to share the credit for his creations , Spector was dismissive of the contribution of his arrangers .
"" I know how to arrange , "" he once told me , "" but it 's much easier to have someone to write it out than to have to sit down and do it yourself . ""
Yet the orchestrations were the key to what Spector called his "" little symphonies for the kids "" , and Nitzsche 's skill was important to the success of songs such as the Crystals ' Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me , and the Ronettes 's Be My Baby , Baby
I Love You and Walking in the Rain , for which the producer habitually assembled an instrumental line - up including platoons of guitarists , pianists , bassists and drummers , and then drilled his jazz - trained musicians on simple three - chord patterns until their fingers bled .
Spector was willing to concede Nitzsche 's competence . ""
He was really good and co - operative and I always used him , "" he said .
But when Spector signed up the Righteous Brothers in 1964 and prepared to record a song called You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' , Nitzsche was busy with another project , and the job of creating the arrangement for the 60s ' greatest example of orchestral pop went instead to Gene Page .
"" I guess Jack felt really unimportant when he saw that we could do it without him , that it could be any arranger , "" Spector said .
"" It was his own fault , because he was gone . ""
He was back , however , in time to participate in River Deep , Mountain High , featuring the voice of Tina Turner , which gave Spector a big hit in Britain , but failed dismally in the United States , sending the temperamental producer into resentful seclusion .
Nitzsche had already moved on .
Under his own name , a charming if ephemeral instrumental titled The Lonely Surfer became a hit .
He hung out with the Rolling Stones , and played piano on a number of their hits , including 19th Nervous Breakdown and Paint It Black .
With Sonny Bono , he wrote Needles and Pins , a worldwide hit for the Searchers .
In 1966 he arranged Bob Lind 's Elusive Butterfly and Buffalo Springfield 's Expecting
To Fly , the latter inaugurating a long collaboration with Neil Young which included studio work on the Canadian 's first solo album and , as a pianist , on tour with Young 's band , Crazy Horse .
And in 1970 , for Donald Cammell and Nic Roeg , he created the music for Performance , featuring Mick Jagger , Ry Cooder and Randy Newman , after which his expertise with soundtracks was much in demand , culminating in the daring and successful teaming of John Lee Hooker and Miles Davis for The Hot Spot , Dennis Hopper 's noir thriller , in 1991 .
Nitzsche was first married to a session singer , Gracia Ann May , but it was with his second wife , the folk singer Buffy Sainte Marie , and the jobbing lyricist Will Jennings that he co - authored Up
Where We Belong , the theme song to Taylor Hackford 's An Officer and a Gentleman , a worldwide hit for Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes , and the winner of an Academy Award for best song in 1982 .
Nitzsche 's life was not a smooth one .
He developed an enthusiastic drug habit , for which he periodically received treatment , and his other relationships included one with the actress Carrie Snodgress , which ended when she had him arrested and charged with rape , although the charge was dropped when he agreed to plead guilty to threatening behaviour .
Although this account can barely scratch the surface of his achievements , he left behind little of what might be called his own music .
Apart from The Lonely Surfer , and the soundtracks , there is only a neglected orchestral album from 1973 , titled St Giles Cripplegate , after the City of London church in which it was recorded .
But his work in all idioms was invariably marked by imagination and intelligence , and at a time when pop music was a hot rod moving up through the gears , he was one of those who kept its axles greased .

Bernard Alfred ( Jack ) Nitzsche , musician , born April 22 1937 ; died August 25 2000"
2000-12-21,"Whenever he made records under his own name , Bobby Sheen , who has died aged 57 , was out of luck .
But as Bob B Soxx , the ostensible leader of a group called the Blue Jeans , he briefly became one of the figures identified with the Wall of Sound , the style of pop music devised in the early 60s by the record producer Phil Spector , whose musical innovations and eccentric behaviour also established the archetype of the brilliant and autocratic Svengali of early rock and roll .
Born in St Louis , Missouri , Sheen 's family moved to southern California and , like Spector , he grew up in West Hollywood , then a mixed district .
His early showbusiness experience came as a member of various touring versions of the Robins and the Coasters , two of the most popular Los Angeles vocal groups of the late 50s .
A tall young man who dressed his hair in a fashionable pompadour , he sang in a high voice heavily influenced by Clyde McPhatter , who was the Drifters ' first important lead singer in the early 50s before he embarked on a successful solo career .
In 1962 Sheen hooked up with Spector through a recommendation from Lester Sill , a prominent Hollywood music business figure who had just gone into partnership with the 21-year - old pro ducer to form the Philles label .
Spector was also briefly employed as head of A&amp;R for Liberty Records , and his first venture with Sheen was a single for that label titled How Many Days , a competent copy of McPhatter 's solo records , recorded in New York .
A few months later Spector moved his recording operation to Los Angeles , where he booked time at a studio , Gold Star , located at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine Street .
The site of many hit recordings , Gold Star was noted for its exceptionally resonant echo chamber , located in the bathroom .
It also employed a young engineer , Larry Levine , who was eager to collaborate in Spector 's more unorthodox notions .
Their first session together produced He 's A Rebel , released under the name of the Crystals , even though all the singing was done by session singers - one of whom was Sheen .
It was at a second Gold Star session , in the autumn of 1962 , that Sheen found himself singing the lead part on a version of Zip - A - Dee - Doo - Dah , a children 's song from a 1940 Walt Disney film , Song Of The South , which Spector had reimagined as a mini - epic of avant - garde rhythm and blues .
At the session , Spector had assembled three guitarists , three bass players , at least two pianists , four saxophonists , a drummer and a percussionist .
Levine spent almost three hours trying vainly to capture the correct sound balance on the studio 's primitive three - track desk .
In frustration , he turned off all the microphones .
One by one he turned them back on , until Spector shouted : "" That 's it !
That 's the sound ! ""
But one microphone had been inadvertently left off , and the distant , metallic sound of Billy Strange 's electric guitar solo leaking into the microphones of the other musicians became the signature of a record also distinguished by the disembodied clanging of its weirdly ponderous rhythm track - a sound unlike anything heard before .
A top 10 hit over the Christmas of 1962 , it helped prepare the way for the records by the Crystals and the Ronettes which established Philles as the last great phenomenon before the arrival of the Beatles ended pop 's age of innocence .
With Darlene Love and Fanita James , two session singers who did duty as the Blue Jeans , Sheen released two more Bob B Soxx singles in 1963 , the charming
Why Do Lovers Break Each Other 's Heart ?
and the rowdy Not
Too Young
To Get Married , on both of which Love sang the lead part - as she had , uncredited , on He 's A Rebel and the Crystals ' next hit , He 's Sure
The Boy I Love .
When neither Bob B Soxx follow - up matched the success of Zip - A - Dee - Doo - Dah , Spector turned his interest elsewhere .
But the group 's final appearance , as contributors to the producer 's legendary Christmas Album , also permitted Sheen his finest hour , delivering a soaring lead vocal on a magnificently thunderous arrangement of The Bells Of St Mary 's .
An unlikely vehicle for one of Spector 's "" little symphonies for the kids "" , it now seems fully the equal of Be My Baby or River Deep - Mountain High , the acknowledged classics of Spector 's Wagnerian style .
Sheen signed a contract with Capitol , and in 1966 released an excellent single called Dr Love , which failed to make the pop charts but nevertheless found - and continues to find - favour with the dancers of Britain 's northern soul scene ( an original UK promo copy is currently available on an internet site for £ 60 ) .
Later , he resumed his earlier career as a member of one of several groups trading under the name of the Coasters , and for a while ran a label of his own , Salsa Picante .
In later years he continued to take late - night phone calls from Spector in which the First Tycoon of Teen - who , incidentally , celebrates his 60th birthday on Boxing Day - outlined grand plans to revive the splendours of the past .

2001-11-15,"Phil Spector , one of the world 's most successful record producers , has been ordered to pay $ 3 m to the Ronettes , the all - woman 60s group which sang many of his hits .
An appeal court in Manhattan told him this week to pay them the money they claimed he owed them for the use of their records in films , advertising and videos .
The decision upheld a lower court ruling that Mr Spector , 57 , had broken his 1963 contract with the trio , which included his ex - wife , Ronnie Spector Greenfield .
Mr Spector kept the rights to the Ronettes ' recordings , but the court ruled that he should have paid them half the royalties earned when their music was used for commercial purposes , such as Be my Baby in the film Dirty Dancing .
The ruling requires Mr Spector to pay his ex - wife , her sister Estelle Bennett , and their cousin Nedra Talley Ross , $ 2.97 m plus interest .
The Spectors divorced in 1974 after a six - year marriage .
The Ronettes , whom Mr Spector discovered and master - minded , were one of his most successful creations in a career which has made him one of the key figures in popular music ."

*
* * £ 14.99
At the end of last year , the press was filled with articles protesting the awfulness of Christmas records .
As ever , Phil Spector 's classic 1964 album A Christmas Gift to You was held up as evidence that not all festive pop had to be dreadful .
While lavishing their praise , however , writers chose to ignore the album 's final track , a genuinely chilling version of Silent Night on which Spector made the ill - advised decision to leave his production desk and take to the vocal booth .
He has the sort of creepy voice parents adopt in order to scare their children .
Spector broke one of popular music 's unwritten by - laws : producers should never be allowed anywhere near a microphone .
It 's easy to see why the impulse strikes them : they spend hours twiddling knobs in semi - obscurity , while the artists get the girls , drugs and video shoots in exotic climes .
But like Gremlins and water , producers and microphones must be kept apart .
Rock history is littered with cautionary tales .
Norman "" Hurricane "" Smith , who helped Pink Floyd realise their most lurid psychedelic albums , then became a nasal early-1970s MOR crooner .
Alan Parsons , another Pink Floyd associate , formed antiseptic prog rockers the Alan Parsons Project , a band every bit as thrilling as their name suggests .
Trevor Horn was the architect of Frankie
Goes to Hollwood 's immense sound , but also the vocalist on the Buggles ' deathless Video Killed the Radio Star , a record only the most cloth - eared , ironically mulleted fashion victim could pretend to like .
Today , Virginia 's Tim "" Timbaland "" Mosley may well be the most exciting record producer in the world .
He was behind last year 's two best singles , Aaliyah 's We Need a Resolution and Missy "" Misdemeanour "" Elliott 's Get
Ur Freak On , perfect examples of his ability to balance commercial appeal with head - spinning innovation .
Both records sold vast quantities while sounding utterly unlike anything else in the charts .
That 's largely because other hip - hop and R&amp;B singles sound like tracks Mosley was making five years ago with Elliott and Destiny 's Child .
Everyone else is simply struggling to keep up , using the stuttering beats Timbaland patented in the late 1990s , then left behind .
Presumably flushed with success , however , Mosley has insisted on breaking the golden producers - and - microphones rule .
He has pursued a parallel career as a rapper , apparently unabashed at the fact that his vocal style is as undistinguished as his production techniques are inimitable .
He has progressed from making unremarkable guest appearances on his protegees ' records to releasing his own albums in partnership with fellow Virginian Magoo .
Their third effort , Indecent Proposal , manages to be simultaneously enthralling and underwhelming .
It 's as if Alfred Hitchcock had abandoned cameo appearances in his films and instead taken the lead in North by Northwest .
The direction and cinematography would still be gripping , but the film would lose a certain je ne sais quoi if a fat , bald , sour - faced Englishman , instead of Cary Grant , was huffing and puffing his way across a cornfield .
Indecent Proposal is packed with original ideas and sounds .
It boasts fantastic production touches that could only be Mosley 's work .
People Like Myself and All Y'All weave naggingly insistent choruses around sinuous oriental flute samples .
Drop shifts seamlessly from breakbeats into a grinding house rhythm .
Roll Out has a rolling , skipping beat , off the wall even by Mosley 's standards .
It 's more compelling than a simple rhythm track has any business to be .
But as usual , the problem comes when Mosley opens his mouth .
In marked contrast to the artists he has produced , he is incapable of matching the aural splendour of his backgrounds with his vocals .
They are strangely emotionless and awkward , as if someone were forcing him to rap at gunpoint .
Even when indulging the traditional hip - hop sport of self - aggrandising , he sounds uncomfortable . ""
In London they say Tim , we love ya , "" he rhymes on All Y'All , before dropping into a faux - cockney accent so lamentable
even Dick Van Dyke would scoff . ""
They call me things like wicked and the effin ' guv'nor . ""
As Magoo is no great shakes on the microphone either , the listener is left waiting for the guest - appearance cavalry to turn up .
The late Aaliyah , who always seemed to inspire Mosley 's greatest work , is predictably fine on the closing I Am Music , a nursery - rhyme melody undercut by sinister hissing and buzzing .
New discovery Petey Pablo turns in a frantic , edgy performance on Baby Bubba .
Too often , however , the listener is left wishing Mosley had cut out the vocals altogether and left the album instrumental instead .
In America , the release of Indecent Proposal was marked by controversy .
Mosley complained his record company had delayed its release - the album was completed almost two years ago .
He then announced he was quitting his rap career altogether to concentrate on production , claiming he was sick of being propositioned by young female fans .
It 's certainly a unique reason : rapper quits because of excessive attention from "" shorties "" .
Perhaps even Timbaland has realised where his true strengths lie ."
2002-08-15,"It is as bizarre a musical collaboration as David Bowie 's pairing with Bing Crosby .
On one side is Phil Spector , the legendary but reclusive American producer who invented the Wall of Sound , hit number one with his very first single and was a millionaire by 21 .
On the other are Starsailor , a critically acclaimed indie band from Chorley , whose biggest hit so far reached number 10 in the UK charts .
The quartet lured the infamously eccentric Spector out of two decades of retirement to record two tracks with them .
He is now discussing producing their next album , the follow up to last year 's Love is Here .
Oddly , the producer initiated the venture when he turned up at a Starsailor show in Los Angeles , declaring himself to be a huge fan .
He spent a week working with them last month , although he is so wary of attention that even the band did not know which studio would be used until the first day of the sessions .
Despite his notorious passion for detail - John Lennon claimed that Spector pulled a gun on him - the two sides seem to have got on well .
Spector inspired the Beach Boys and the Beatles with his early 60s hits such as Then He Kissed Me , Be My Baby
, You 've Lost That Loving Feeling and Da Doo Ron Ron .
He described his music as "" a Wagnerian approach to rock'n'roll : little symphonies for the kids "" and created the overwhelming , sumptuous orchestration dubbed the Wall of Sound by layering instrument after instrument , many played by himself .
But many of his songs had a darker side and he ran into controversy when he forced The Crystals to record
He Hit Me (
And It Felt Like A Kiss ) .
Several countries banned the record because of its lyrics .
Spector retreated to his Los Angeles mansion after the Ike and Tina Turner track River Deep and Mountain High , which he considered to be his masterpiece , flopped in the US .
He later worked with the Beatles on their last group and early solo releases but last produced an album , The Ramones ' End Of The Century , in 1980 .
Despite recording odd tracks with Yoko Ono and Eric Clapton he has largely vanished from the public eye .
After a failed attempt to collaborate with Celine Dion , he wrote : "" You do n't tell Shakespeare what plays to write , or how to write them .
You do n't tell Mozart what operas to write , or how to write them .
And you certainly do n't tell Phil Spector what songs to write , or how to write them ; or what records to produce , or how to produce them . """
2002-09-13,"What do Nuclear Pussy , as Harry Enfield 's Gary Bloke character calls this bland girl act , see when they look in the mirror ?
Three pert pop stars giving it some sass in the Phil Spector chick - pop tradition ?
Or a gang of Barbies reciting bought - in songs with the verve of tax accountants ?
The former , obviously : how else could they bring themselves to simper through The Tide
Is High , knowing they were pitting themselves against the much - loved Blondie version ?
The rest of the album is mush of a mushness , weighted in favour of system - built uptempo tunes such as the title track , written for them by an apparently listless Kylie Minogue .
At least these are marginally better than the ballads , sour little semi - acoustic snippets such as Love Does n't Have to Hurt that sound like Westlife on oestrogen .
What this album is crying out for is a kick in the tush from an avenging Kelly Osbourne ."
2003-02-04,"The man responsible for some of the world 's best - known pop songs , record producer Phil Spector , was charged with murder yesterday in connection with the death of a woman found shot at his home in a Los Angeles suburb .
Police had been called to the scene after neighbours heard gunshots in the early hours of the morning .
The dead woman was reported by a local radio station to be in her 20s but police would not confirm this .
Bail for Spector was set at $ 1 m as investigations continued at his mansion in Alhambra in the San Gabriel Valley , near Pasadena .
Police were withholding the identity of the woman until her family had been informed .
Spector , 62 , one of the biggest names in the recording industry and one of the richest , was questioned at the Alhambra police station .
Best known for his spectacular productions of pop songs in the 60s and 70s , Spector has suffered over the years from depression and has a reputation for erratic behaviour inside and outside the studio .
In 1980 , during a recording session for the album
End of the Century with the Ramones , he pulled a gun on the band , according to the late Dee Dee Ramone .
Credited with inventing the so - called Wall of Sound that distinguished many of his early recordings , Spector had started his career as a musician with a band called the Teddy Bears before embarking on a songwriting and production career that made him a millionaire by the age of 21 .
He had had an unhappy childhood and his father had committed suicide when he was eight .
The epitaph on his father 's grave ,
To Know Him is to Love Him , was to provide Spector with the title for one of his earliest hits .
Work with the Ronettes , the Righteous Brothers , the Crystals and the Beatles , most notably on their Let
It Be album , secured his place in pop history .
He was responsible for such hits as Be My Baby , Da Doo Ron Ron and Walking in the Rain .
In 1989 , he was given a lifetime achievement award by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
Spector was married to Ronnie Bennett , one of the Ronettes , but they divorced in 1974 .
She later sued him for $ 2 m ( £ 1.2 m ) over royalty payments .
He has five children ."
2003-02-04,"The first man to lend glamour to the profession of record producer , Phil Spector is noted for his volatility in and out of the recording studio .
Stories of his propensity for pulling guns on his artists have been in circulation since the early 1970s .
His relationships with singers whose careers he created had a habit of being resolved in the law courts .
In a celebrated essay written in 1964 , Tom Wolfe called him "" the first tycoon of teen "" .
But he was also pop 's Citizen Kane , given to shutting himself away in his mansion high in the Hollywood hills , brooding on the fickleness of teenage taste and the declining demand for his particular genius .
His strange existence supplied the inspiration for the character of Ronnie "" Z - Man "" Barzell , the crazed impresario in Russ Meyer 's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls .
After more than a decade of virtual inactivity , Spector emerged from reclusion last month when he arrived in London to produce a new album by the British group Starsailor .
In his prime he was responsible for the some of the most powerful , influential and enduring records in the history of pop music , notably the Ronettes ' Be My Baby ,
the Righteous Brothers '
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' and Ike and Tina Turner 's River Deep - Mountain High .
On these records , which he called "" little symphonies for the kids "" , Spector deployed entire squadrons of guitarists , pianists , bassists and drummers to create the Wall of Sound , an effect which expanded the scope of the idiom and launched thousands of imitations .
To John Lennon and Brian Wilson , the leader of the Beach Boys he was an idol .
Wilson has listened to Be My Baby virtually every day for 40 years and emulated Spector 's ambitious orchestrations in his own work .
When the Beatles fell apart in 1969 , Lennon invited Spector to produce his solo records , including Imagine , Instant Karma and Happy Xmas .
Spector supervised George Harrison 's album
All Things Must Pass , and its worldwide hit single , My Sweet Lord .
But he earned the undying enmity of Paul McCartney when , after Lennon and Harrison had invited him to prepare the Let It Be sessions for release as an album , he added a lavish orchestration to The Long and Winding Road ,
McCartney 's ballad .
Born in the Bronx on Christmas Day , 1940 , he was brought up by his mother in Los Angeles after his father committed suicide in a fit of depression .
From his father 's tombstone he took the title of his first record , To Know Him Is To Love Him , a number one hit in the US in 1958 under the name of the Teddy Bears , a trio he had formed with two high school classmates .
Discovering that he had received only a fraction of the money owed to him from that record , he determined to form his own label in order to safeguard his financial interests .
He took the plunge in 1961 and released a single by the Crystals which became the first of two dozen hits over the next five years - an extraordinary achievement for a single producer .
But in building his status as pop 's first auteur he also gathered about him a reputation for wilfully autocratic behaviour .
After a divorce from his first wife , Annette Merar , he married Veronica Bennett , the lead singer with the Ronettes , in 1968 .
They separated in the 1970s , after which - under the name Ronnie Spector - she wrote a book in which she described him as a husband so jealous that he insisted that a dummy of himself be placed in the passenger seat of her car whenever she left the mansion to do the shopping .
He was married for a third time in the 1980s .
His career came to a sudden halt in 1967 when he retired after the commercial failure of River Deep - Mountain High , said to be the industry 's revenge against his refusal to bribe disc jockeys to play his records on the radio .
A close friend of the comedian Lenny Bruce , he played the part of a drug dealer in the 1969 hippie road movie Easy Rider .
Although his work with the Beatles brought him back into the public eye , it was apparent that a unbridgeable distance had opened up between Phil Spector and the teenage world he once ruled ."
2003-02-04,"The woman veteran record producer Phil Spector has been charged with murdering was named today as Lana Clarkson , an actress who gained a cult following from starring in Hollywood B - movies .
Ms Clarkson , 40 , was found shot dead yesterday at Spector 's Californian mansion , her body sprawled in the marble foyer of the castle - like hilltop home in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra .
Spector , 62 , was reported to have only met the actress on the Sunday night , just hours before her body was discovered .
Police were alerted to the mansion after a chauffeur , who had driven Ms Clarkson and Spector there earlier , called police in the early hours yesterday to say he had heard gunshots , sources told the Los Angeles Times .
After arriving at the mansion , officers arrested Spector almost immediately and recovered a gun from the home .
Ms Clarkson appeared as a dancer in Brian De Palma 's 1983 film Scarface , starring Al Pacino , but was best known for her "" sword and sorcery "" roles in films such as Deathstalker , Barbarian Queen and Barbarian Queen II :
The Empress Strikes Back .
She had also appeared in numerous American TV shows , and her most recent film credit was in 2001 as Dr Ellen Taylor in March , James Mercurio 's film about an insurance salesman trying to save his marriage .
Spector was expected to appear in court within days to be formally charged with first - degree murder , the American charge for a pre - meditated killing .
The producer and Ms Clarkson were believed to be the only people in the 33-room house at the time of the shooting , investigators told the Los Angeles Times , adding that no confession had been made .
Spector was taken into custody at Alhambra police department for questioning as part of a murder investigation and later charged .
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles county sheriff 's department said : "" Mr Spector has been booked and charged with murder . ""
No one else is being sought in connection with the murder , and bail for Spector was set at $ 1 m ( £ 600,000 ) .
He could appear in court for arraignment as early as tomorrow .
A neighbour , who was not named , said she heard three or four shots ring out from the home , which Spector bought in 1991 for a reported $ 1.1 m .
Forensic teams were today continuing to search the house , where Spector had lived an increasingly reclusive lifestyle .
Spector 's friends tell of shock at arrest
Spector produced such music greats as Elvis Presley , the Beatles , Tina Turner , the Ramones , the Righteous Brothers and the Crystals , but he was probably best known for his string of memorable 60s hits , including the Crystals ' Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me , and the Ronettes ' Be My Baby .
Spector also created the "" Wall of Sound "" effect which involved overdubbing lavish orchestration , percussion and dense echo to produce a multi - layered sound , which changed the way pop records were produced .
He produced the last Beatles album
Let It Be , worked with John Lennon on Imagine and helped Yoko Ono produce Lennon 's work after he was killed in 1980 .
He had spoken of his fears that his reputation for drinking and violence - he allegedly pulled a gun on the Ramones during a recording session - would overshadow his long career .
Friends said they believed he had put his wild years behind him .
Guitarist Dave Kessel told the Los Angeles Times : "" He has been in great spirits and great shape , and feeling so good about everything .
This does n't fit into what I know about him and where he is . ""
A father of five , Spector was once married to Ronnie Bennett , a member of the Ronettes .
She was his second wife , and the couple divorced in 1974 .
Spector 's father , Benjamin , committed suicide in 1949 .
Spector used the inscription on his grave ,
To Know Him Was To Love Him , as the basis for one of his best known hit songs .
His last major album was End of the Century , a 1980 collaboration with the Ramones .
During the session , the late bassist Dee Dee Ramone said Spector pulled a gun on the band .
Speaking on America 's Fox News Network yesterday , the band 's drummer Marky Ramone confirmed the incident took place but said Spector would never hurt anyone .
He told the channel : "" He is one of the greatest American producers and I had a lot of fun with him .
He was very confident , very passionate about his music and I do n't think he would hurt a fly . """
2003-02-05,"The record producer Phil Spector was freed on $ 1 m ( £ 600,000 ) bail yesterday after being arrested in connection with the killing of an actress he had reportedly met only the night before .
The victim of the shooting , which took place at Spector 's baroque mansion in a LA suburb , was 41-year - old Lana Clarkson , who had appeared in a number of films and television shows and worked as a volunteer for an HIV charity .
Spector and Clarkson were the only people in the 10-bedroom house , known locally as the Pyrenees Castle , when the shooting took place .
Initially , police were unable to identify the victim and told reporters at the scene that she was "" in her early to mid twenties "" .
Clarkson was a 6 ft blonde who was born in southern California and grew up in Napa Valley .
She had appeared in a number of lesser - known films in the 80s , most notably for the legendary horror director , Roger Corman .
In his movie Barbarian Queen , she was the sword - wielding heroine ; Corman claimed this was the inspiration for the successful television series Xena : Warrior Princess .
Her other films included Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Scarface , Amazon Women on the Moon , Blind Date and Death Stalker .
She appeared in such television shows as Happy Days and had recently done commercials for Mercedes Benz , Nike and Playtex .
She also worked on a weekly basis as a volunteer for Project Angel Food , which delivers meals to people with HIV .
Her website , www.livingdollproductions.com , yesterday paid tribute to her .
The words "" you were a star on earth and now shine bright heaven [ sic ] "" and "" a tragic and senseless murder took you from us "" have been posted on the site .
"" There has not been a confession by Mr Spector , "" police said yesterday , indicating that the suspect had been questioned before his release on bail .
He will appear in court later this week .
Robert Shapiro , the lawyer who successfully represented OJ Simpson in his murder trial , has been hired by Spector for a case which is likely to attract a similar amount of speculation and coverage .
Yesterday he said : "" It 's of no benefit to my client or any client to make public statements . ""
The shooting took place in the foyer of Spector 's mansion , where he lives alone .
A black Mercedes , its front door still hanging open , was also part of the police investigation and has been taken away by police .
The house , built in 1926 by a rancher , has 33 rooms and has been the record producer 's home since 1998 .
Security is tight : potential intruders are warned that the fences are high - voltage and there are 24-hour surveillance cameras .
Neighbours reported seeing him driving by in his white Rolls Royce .
"" I 'm hoping this is not something he 's guilty of , "" Spector 's sound engineer and friend , Lawrence Levine , told the Hollywood Reporter .
"" In the old days , I could have seen it as accidental , waving a gun around .
But he has n't been that way for a long time .
He was in a really good place . ""
Spector had recently started re - visiting Hollywood music clubs to look at bands and was hoping to embark on fresh recording projects .
He was also one of the many celebrity fans who attended LA Lakers basketball games at the Staples Centre .
No motive has been advanced for the killing of Clarkson and the police are declining to speculate on the relationship between her and Spector .
He had recently been associated with the singer Nancy Sinatra , with whom he was seen at a Bruce Springsteen concert ."
2003-02-05,"The man who occasionally pulled guns on his artists , who retreated to his hilltop chateau for years on end and who is currently out on $ 1 m bail on a charge of murdering a minor Hollywood actress is what , in the days of seven - inch 45rpm singles , we would have called the B - side of Phil Spector .
Flip the disc and you get the A - side , which is the man John Lennon invited me to meet in the autumn of 1971 , when the two of them were recording a new single during the former Beatle 's first week of residence in New York .
The Spector known to Lennon was an affectionate , convivial , witty , sometimes sentimental friend .
Yes , a bit crazy .
Sometimes quite a lot crazy , and hardly bearable .
But he also possessed a quality on which Lennon placed a particularly high value : an unparalled understanding of how to construct three - minute pop records in the classic manner .
Back in the early 60s , no one could match Spector 's ability to trap the vertiginous emotional melodramas of teenage life within the fragile spiral of a vinyl groove .
Lennon worshipped him for his genius and enjoyed his company because Spector was one of the few who really knew what it was like to have been there , to have shared that moment at the pinnacle of the 60s when drab reality took flight and everything seemed possible .
They had met on the Beatles ' first tour of America , in 1964 , when Spector 's records , along with those of the Beach Boys and Berry Gordy 's Motown artists , were holding the British Invasion at bay .
They quickly discovered a mutual interest in artificial means of escape from the madness of those days .
But above all they recognised each other as peers within the hierarchy of rock and roll . ""
He is and always will be one of the great originals of rock music , "" Lennon wrote in a blurb for my biography of Spector .
More significantly , he added : "" It seems that talented people must always be in a great pain - their sensitivity is what makes them great artists - but what a price to pay . ""
The former Beatle was in the process of moving to New York when I wrote to tell him that I was intending to write a book about Spector and to ask if he could help me get an interview .
Typically of Lennon , a handwritten note arrived by return .
He was scheduled to record with Spector in New York the following week .
There would be a return ticket waiting at Heathrow and a room for me at the St Regis Hotel , where John and Yoko Ono were staying while they looked for a house to rent in Greenwich Village .
There is a black limousine in every Spector story , including yesterday 's despatches from the crime scene , and it was one such that pulled up at the front door of the Record Plant studio on West 44th Street a few days later .
Spector , a spindly figure no more than 5 ft 6 in tall , emerged , wearing aviator shades and a neatly pressed denim jacket with a "" Back to Mono "" button on the lapel .
John and Yoko were already waiting inside , along with the drummer Jim Keltner , the bassist Klaus Voorman , the pianist Nicky Hopkins and a handful of guitarists .
The Plastic Ono Band were about to record a song called Happy Xmas ( War is Over ) , which Lennon had played to Spector in the hotel a couple of nights earlier .
Straight away the producer spotted its debt to
I Love
How You Love Me , a wispy teenage ballad Spector had produced for the Paris Sisters in 1961 .
Lennon was happy , even proud , to own up .
The man who opened Come Together with lines borrowed from Chuck Berry - ""
Here come ol' Flat Top /
He come groovin ' up slowly "" - sincerely believed that pop music had evolved by a process of imitation and transmutation .
"" I want five rhythm guitarists , "" Spector had demanded when told that the Plastic Ono Band consisted of only four musicians plus Yoko .
And he thought back to his own Christmas album , a monstrous confection of pounding drums and tintinnabulating bells , recorded in 1963 but a seasonal staple 40 years later .
"" Get me some percussion !
Bells !
Celeste !
Chimes ! ""
His high voice had taken on a light scouse inflection , slightly camp .
Earlier I had asked a few of Spector 's colleagues from the golden years how he went about constructing the Wall of Sound .
Among them was Jeff Barry , the co - writer of Da Doo Ron Ron , Then He Kissed Me and Be My Baby , who outlined the modus operandi .
"" It was basically a formula , "" Barry told me .
"" You 're going to have four or five guitars lined up , gut - string guitars , and they 're going to follow the chords , nothing tricky .
You 're going to use two basses in fifths , with the same type of line , and strings .
There would be six or seven horns , adding the little punches , and there would be the formula percussion instruments - the little bells , the shakers , the tambourines .
Then Phil used his own formula for echo , and some overtone effects with the strings .
But by and large there was a formula arrangement to create a formula sound . ""
But now it was five years since Spector 's last big hit , five years since the formula lost its novelty , five years since he retired in disgust after the American record industry took revenge on his refusal to play the payola game and kept Ike and Tina Turner 's River Deep , Mountain High , one of his great masterpieces , off the radio , ensuring that it failed to make the charts .
He was 26 years old then , already a multi - millionaire , already with the Rolls - Royce and the Beverly Hills mansion , and he walked away .
So it was big news when the Beatles brought him back .
To Lennon and George Harrison , working with Spector was like washing themselves in the stream of pure pop music .
The urbane George Martin may have broadened the range of four untutored pop musicians from Liverpool , adding the piccolo trumpet to Penny Lane and the string quartet to Yesterday , but he never really belonged to their world .
Like Lennon and Harrison , Spector had grown up with his ears full of Eddie Cochran and the Del - Vikings .
He was one of them .
Watching Lennon and Spector work together , it was fascinating to see how readily the Beatle ceded control to pop music 's ultimate control freak .
The recording studio was Spector 's instrument , and Lennon let him play it .
And Jeff Barry was right .
Spector started by getting the five guitarists to lay down the simple chord sequence on acoustic instruments .
"" Play the basic rhythm , "" he told them . ""
Do n't play anything else , nothing across the beat .
Just keep it simple and play together . ""
His mind running at a different speed from that of anyone else in the room , Spector took roughly one minute to transform the happy hootenanny - style strumming into a brilliant wash of colour .
As the engineers played it back , Lennon and Spector danced round the control room , arms around each other 's shoulders .
Already Spector was thinking not just of sound but of arrangement and drama .
Inside his head , he was taking those guitar chords and moulding , blending and transforming them into the subliminal basis of the record , as a painter lays down a ground colour .
This was his thing , his gift .
He called his records "" little symphonies for the kids "" , and he was ready to fight any square who belittled them , as the disc jockey
William B Williams did one night on US television , reading out the lyric of Da Doo Ron Ron as though it were a nursery rhyme , not understanding that it was designed to come to life only when propelled by those drums , basses , pianos and guitars , all given depth and density by Spector 's use of echo .
"" Making something good was always more important than success , "" he told me . ""
The fact that it was successful was just the icing on the cake .
It was n't the main purpose at all .
It was always to try and make something that was good and moving and important .
Because if I did n't make anything that was better , I might as well have left it to Fats Domino . ""
Over the next couple of days he added the other rhythm instruments , the chimes , the glockenspiel and the sleigh bells , the strings , and the voices of the Lennons and the Harlem Community Choir , about 30 children aged between four and 12 , plus four teenage girls whom Lennon christened "" the Supremes "" .
Spector 's authority was absolute and his precision unyielding .
When he heard something he liked , his enthusiasm blazed . ""
More echo on the piano , "" he would shout to the engineer , leaping to his feet , his arms windmilling and his reflection creating a triptych in the glass partition separating the control room from the musicians ' space . ""
More echo .
More ... more ... more !
More echo !
C'mon !
That 's it .
Beautiful .
"" There were plenty of bathroom breaks , after which he and the Lennons emerged refreshed .
But Spector and Lennon also spent time chatting about music and their mutual friends , and mourning the loss of King Curtis , the great rhythm and blues tenor saxophonist , murdered on his doorstep a few weeks earlier , only a month after playing on the Imagine album .
At the very end of the sessions , Spector called everyone into the studio - musicians , singers , engineers , secretaries , his chauffeur , his bodyguard , a stray journalist - and arranged us around a microphone before conducting the mass shout of "" Happy Christmas ! "" with which the record ends .
Then we had our photograph taken .
My own brick in the Wall of Sound , and no one can take it away .
Weeks later , in London , there were glimpses of a different Spector .
Here , on a couple of long evenings in his hotel suite , as darkness fell over Park Lane , an outrageous fantasist emerged .
This was the mask of a lonely and insecure man for whom no degree of acclaim and material success could quite override the tragedy of his father 's suicide or the mental scars of humiliations at the hands of bigger and stronger boys during his schooldays .
Spector 's finest records - those huge , tumultuous epics that attracted comparisons with Wagner - gave a generation of adolescents an ineradicable soundtrack to their lives .
They were like Roy Lichtenstein 's renderings of frames from romantic comic books , except that whereas Lichtenstein 's work was made to be seen in art galleries , Spector sold his vignettes of first kisses and first heartbreaks back to the kids who were actually experiencing them .
And what the grandeur of his records told them - yes , even Da Doo Ron Ron - was that their feelings had a place and a value in the world .
For him they were art , no question .
But also the best revenge .

2003-02-06,"The arrest of Phil Spector - who produced Starsailor 's forthcoming second album - might have provoked a flurry of industry gossip , but no one ( on stage , at least ) is saying anything about it tonight .
The omission is all the more obvious since the once - puppyish singer James Walsh has grown into a voluble , cocky performer .
Often , it is easy to forget there are three other musicians behind him , let alone concerns further afield .
First , though , proving the magical chemistry of the rock three - piece , the unassuming but marvellous Nada Surf steal the show .
College rock has rarely been this elegant or eloquent : imagine if Coldplay had chosen purpose over that grating pose of nebulous melancholy , poetry over banality .
Muscular lullabies such as Blonde on Blonde mix nostalgia and pin - sharp observation to potent effect .
Weightless melodies swoop and soar , coloured by delicate but forceful three - part harmonies .
It is a dizzying thing to hear the punchy stomp of High Speed Soul lift into an apparently effortless chorus .
Starsailor may have their sights on the heavens , but they still have feet of clay .
They are almost extraordinary , yet fall frustratingly short .
Walsh has a wonderful voice and he is gradually growing into it , teasing out its subtleties .
He also has an impressive gift for melody .
Keyboard player Barry Westhead provides occasional flourishes of baroque piano worthy of Bowie mainstay Mike Garson , but the band are thuddingly pedestrian .
When Walsh emerges alone to play an exquisitely restrained version of Neil Young 's junkie lament
The Needle and the Damage Done , segueing into his own Lullaby and then into U2 's Where the Streets Have No Name , there is a glimpse of what Starsailor could be .
But the U2 cover is a warning signal , too : many of these songs are dressed up like 1980s stadium rock , and oddly platitudinous .
Walsh is too fond of the transatlantic rock messiah 's lexicon : there is a "" burning wheel "" , there is a "" freeway "" ; there are moments of genuine pathos obscured .
Of five new songs , Telling Them is the nearest to a surprise , a rolling bucolic delight that suddenly takes flight and disappears into the blue .
Walsh has learned how to please a crowd , but is he brave enough to take them somewhere unexpected ?"
2003-02-13,"The record producer Phil Spector , who faces a murder charge , will claim that the gun which killed an actress at his home earlier this month went off by accident , according to a close friend .
Marvin Mitchelson , a Los Angeles , lawyer said : "" I believe his defence will be that this was a tragic accident .
"" I 've spoken with various individuals connected with the case and I 'm 100 % certain it 's not a homicide . ""
Mr Mitchelson 's remarks represent the first indications of what Spector might run as a defence on the charge of the murder of Lana Clarkson at his mansion on February 3 .
Contempt of court laws are not as strict in the US as in Britain and both the defence and prosecution routinely float claims and theories through the press before a trial .
Spector 's lawyer , Robert Shapiro , has declined to discuss the case .
Mr Shapiro , who also represented OJ Simpson in LA 's last major celebrity murder trial , said that he had no intention of discussing the case before it went to court .
The district attorney 's office also declined to comment on the claims .
Spector , 62 , who has been released on $ 1 m ( £ 600,000 ) bail , will appear in court on March 3 to answer charges .
He is alleged to have shot Ms Clarkson in the face in the early hours of the morning .
The couple had earlier left the House of Blues in Hollywood where Clarkson , 40 , worked as a hostess while she pursued her acting career .
They were driven to Spector 's home by his chauffeur and the shooting occurred shortly afterwards .
The driver called the police .
Spector had been drinking heavily on the night of the shooting after many years of abstaining because of the problems it has caused him .
He had carried on drinking at the House of Blues before leaving with Clarkson in the early hours of the morning .
Reports now suggest he had met her before the night of her death but this was the first time they had gone out together ."
2003-02-16,"Once the undisputed doyen of America 's music scene , wooed by film producers eager to immortalise his glittering career and controversial life on screen , Phil Spector has spent the last three decades hiding from the world in his sprawling Hollywood mansion .
As his name faded into obscurity amid rumours about his violent and unpredictable behaviour , Spector seemed a figure prematurely but irrevocably relegated to the past .
Until , that is , Lana Clarkson , a B - movie actress and hostess , was found shot dead in his hallway in the early hours of 3 February , after she had met the 62-year - old for the first time a few hours earlier in a local nightclub .
The media declared the gruesome discovery and the record producer 's subsequent arrest for her murder as the final nail in the coffin of Spector 's career .
But now the alleged murder has sparked a race between film producers and television companies eager to tell the bizarre tale of Spector 's life , with some of Hollywood 's hottest stars , including Leonardo DiCaprio , tipped to take the lead .
Tom Cruise spent years in the late Nineties trying unsuccessfully to persuade Spector to back a biographical script written by Cruise and director Cameron Crowe .
There was no further interest in Spector , who became a virtual recluse given to bouts of increasing violence .
Since Clarkson 's death film producers have been clamouring for the rights to his story - or , failing that , to tell the unauthorised version . '
This alleged murder is a major development in Phil 's life , and like any life - changing event it makes his story even more gripping , ' said Marvin Mitchelson , a Los Angeles lawyer and close friend of Spector for 13 years . '
The Crowe and Cruise film did n't have an ending Phil approved of , but we 're now getting a treatment together that Phil feels is much more appropriate , ' he added .
Spector , who has been freed on $ 1 million bail , ann - ounced last week that he will plead not guilty to murder , claiming that the gun went off by accident soon after the couple were driven to Spector 's home by his chauffeur . '
Before this last incident , Spector was an obscure figure , ' said Steven Gaydos , executive editor of Variety magazine , Hollywood 's showbusiness bible . '
Now , though , he is a public figure in the centre of a big , colourful and salacious story- exactly the sort of story film producers rush to tell . '
They have even begun looking at which stars could capture Phil 's spirit , ' he added . '
The word is that Cruise is now a bit old , so other names have entered the field , such as DiCaprio . '
Television is rushing in because , now Spector has become a headline character , they do n't have to pay him for the rights to his life or give him any control over his portrayal , ' said Gaydos .
Another industry insider believes the three main American TV channels are racing to complete a treatment .
According to the contact , ABC , CBS and NBC are all interested in the project , although the channels officially deny the claim . '
ABC are known for making musical movies , such as their one about the Beach Boys , but more interested are CBS and NBC , who specialise in docudramas with big recognisable central characters , ' he added .
There are also rumours that TV and film producers keen to find a different angle on Spector 's life have approached his former wife , Ronnie Spector , who has accused him of mental abuse and told of his violent rages , for permission to tell her story .
Spector , who invented the ' wall of sound ' - a recording effect that involved overdubbing scores of musicians - was known for his fascination with guns .
He would commonly pull a gun in the studio , firing one into the ceiling during a session with John Lennon and putting another to Dee Dee Ramone 's head and prompting Leonard Cohen to describe him as beyond control .
But in the last year Spector had begun to emerge into the outside world .
In an interview given shortly before Clarkson 's death , he said that for six years he had been experimenting with a cocktail of medication that would not obstruct his creativity . '
I consider myself a disturbed human being , but I 'm under control , ' he said .
' I 've been blessed with a genius , but I 've been punished with insomnia and manic depression .
I 've fought the devil for 20 years . '"
2003-02-28,"After the Beach Boys had scored their first couple of hits in the early 1960s , the scope of Brian Wilson 's talents as writer , performer and producer rapidly began to mark him out as a West Coast phenomenon , the man who put the wax on the rock'n'roll surfboard .
For Wilson , the pop business was like a giant toyshop in which he could indulge every sonic whim or pursue his urge to imitate the mighty Phil Spector , and he was childishly eager to lend his skills to a long list of mostly forgotten performers .
Pet Projects : The Brian Wilson Productions ( Ace , *
*
* * ) assembles 23 of Brian 's extra - curricular experiments , travelling from the absurd ( like Surfin ' Down the Swanee River , which Wilson concocted for the Honeys ) to the extra - rare ( Glen Campbell 's long - lost Guess I 'm Dumb ) , with almost everything in between .
Threaded through these grooves is a kind of alternative history of Brian Wilson .
As Rob Finnis 's detailed booklet essay describes , it was Capitol Records 's A&amp;R man Nick Venet who signed the Beach Boys and gave Wilson miles of creative rope , part of which was used to devise a couple of unmemorable solo outings by Brian 's then co - writer Gary Usher ( later a successful producer in his own right ) .
Even before then , Wilson and Usher had co - written The Revo - Lution and Number One for Rachel and the Revolvers , recorded in 1962 , as well as the earliest tracks included here .
The fabled Wilson genius is n't always apparent in such frothy period ephemera as Sharon Marie 's Run - Around Lover or the Survivors ' Pamela Jean , but his involvement with girl - group the Honeys was of far greater artistic and personal significance : Wilson married Honeys singer Marilyn Rovell .
Honeys tracks from various periods are included here , but it is Rovell 's recordings as American Spring in the early 1970s ( with her sister Diane ) that really bear the stamp of Wilson 's mature expertise .
Altogether , Pet Projects amounts to a fascinating set of footnotes to the Brian Wilson story .
Paul Weller describes the time he spent with the Style Council as "" a great pivotal period in my life "" , and to mark the group 's 20th anniversary , their six - year career has been neatly compressed into The Sound of the Style Council ( Polydor , *
* * ) .
The band released their debut single Speak Like a Child in March 1983 , barely six months after Weller had broken up the Jam , and anybody pining for more of the defunct trio 's teeth - gritted crunch must have been dismayed to find Weller veering off into breezy 1970s soul .
Weller claims the plan was that "" every record was going to sound different "" , so the Style Council duly rang the changes with the whirling funk of Money Go Round , the drifting synth - ballad Long Hot Summer , the supper - club smoochiness of You 're the Best Thing , and the George Michael - esque My Ever Changing Moods .
Weller was obviously enjoying himself , and seven top 10 hits suggested that the punters were , too .
But the amorphous nature of the band - Weller and organist Mick Talbot were the only fixed points - meant it suffered from a lack of fixed identity and discernable objectives .
There was a fair amount of social comment in the lyrics , most convincingly in Homebreakers , but some of Weller 's attempts at high seriousness lured him into some disastrous lapses .
A Man of Great Promise was written about his dead friend Dave Waller , but it just sounds like a fairly pleasant pop song .
Far worse was Ghosts of Dachau , Weller 's hair - raisingly mawkish effort at a song about the Holocaust .
A perplexingly mixed bag .
Lest anyone should fear that Rory Gallagher 's legacy had vanished after his death in 1995 , Wheels Within Wheels ( CAPO / RCA , *
*
* * ) has been assembled by his brother Donal with the aim of fulfilling Rory 's long - cherished ambition to make an acoustic album , running the stylistic gamut from blues and folk to Irish traditional music .
Donal has pulled together recordings from as far back as 1974 , the year of his brisk slide - guitar stomp As the Crow Flies , and has thrown his net wide enough to catch Rory in collaboration with Bert Jansch , Martin Carthy , Lonnie Donegan and the Chieftains .
The be - jeaned and check - shirted Gallagher suffered from being typecast as a workaholic journeyman , on tour 366 days a year .
But as this collection demonstrates , his musicianship was impeccable and his taste was n't bad either .
Among many stand - outs , the flamenco - tinted Flight to Paradise catches Gallagher 's picking at its most delicate and precise in company with David Lindley , Richard Thompson and Juan Martin .
The Chieftains lend an air of bucolic bonhomie to Barley and Grape Rag , and Gallagher apparently invented his 1994 live version of Blue Moon of Kentucky on the hoof .
The Irish revere Gallagher so much that they 've put him on a set of stamps , and maybe they 're on to something .
Janis Joplin would have been 60 in January , and to kick off a campaign of celebrations of this somewhat theoretical milestone , Columbia / Legacy have compiled the two - disc collection , The Essential Janis Joplin
( * * * ) .
Apparently there is still a heap of unissued Joplin recordings in the vaults , and here a couple of previously unreleased live tracks have been included : Kozmic Blues and the Bee Gees '
To Love Somebody , from the 1969 Woodstock festival .
Both are serviceable specimens of the bawling R&amp;B for which Joplin is best remembered , but do n't throw any light on the more nuanced aspects of her artistry that were beginning to emerge at the time of her death in 1970 .
Throughout her brief and erratic and career , Joplin suffered from an inability to find backing musicians skilful or sympathetic enough to bring the best out of her , and no amount of reshuffling of the catalogue can alter the fact .
Still , those occasions when it all fell into place - her shattering versions of Piece of My Heart or Ball and Chain , for instance - can still blow your loudspeakers to matchwood .
But Me and Bobby McGee and Get It
While You Can , from the posthumously released Pearl , suggest that the best of Joplin was yet to come ."

An Illustrated Memoir by George Martin Genesis Publications £ 234 , pp327
Despite the recent efforts of Phil Spector to upstage him , George Martin remains the record producer all but the most determined of musical dunces of a certain age might be expected to have heard of .
His thread of genius runs through every one of the 186 songs The Beatles recorded for EMI , from the now legendary ' Love Me Do ' demos in 1962 to the Abbey Road sessions in 1970 that produced the last album made by ' the boys ' ( as readers of this unnecessarily large book will come to know them ) , a body of work that has defined Martin and put him in their shadow ( whether he likes it or not ) for the rest of his life .
Some have wondered , rather fancifully , whether there would have been a Beatles without George Martin .
The reverse , of course , is more likely true .
Certainly it is hard to imagine a Sir George Martin without such vivid talents to make his own sing so brightly .
No one needs reminding of how great The Beatles were , how colossal their contribution to the upheaval of the Sixties , how complete the compass of their influence , a claim that stands 40 years after recording ' Please
Please Me ' , a session famously brought to a close with Martin leaning towards the studio mike and uttering the words : ' Gentlemen , you 've got your first No 1 . '
The compilation CD of all The Beatles ' No 1 singles , released just over a year ago has sold 35 million copies .
One of the surprises of this book ( and you can get through it without being surprised too often ) is that Martin is of humbler stock than his familiar unruffled manner suggests .
Like many of his generation who went on to better things , he escaped the working - class shibboleths of the early chapters - tin baths , gaslight , having to cycle everywhere with your double bass - via the armed forces ( the Navy made him an officer in the Fleet Air Arm ) , followed by a spell at the Guild hall , where he turned a self - taught musical intelligence into a formal one incorporating composition and practical oboe skills ( his tutor was Jane Asher 's mum , the woman destined never to become Paul McCartney 's mother - in - law ) .
It was enough to get our man into the BBC music library and later EMI , where he became head of Parlophone .
The rest is history .
But the problem with being history is that much of George Martin 's story has already been told by others .
Two compendious works alone - Mark Lewisohn 's Complete Beatles Chronicle and Ian MacDonald 's brilliant , forensic account of the recordings - Revolution in the Head - have dealt with the anorak stuff , while numberless other contemporaneous dredgings and monographs , as well as biographies from Epstein , Harrison , McCartney , have mopped up the rest .
Martin himself has written The Making of Sgt Pepper , which presumably explains why he has n't covered it here , although such an omission is no easier to forgive in a book that weighs as much as a small turkey and costs £ 234 .
Devoting three spreads to Sgt Pepper the movie ( speaking of turkeys ) only adds insult to injury .
Indeed Martin seems not to have had the stamina to revisit , with any notable rigour , the making of any of the albums .
Instead there are scenic byways into the string arrangements for ' Yesterday ' and ' Eleanor Rigby ' ; there are one or two teasing asides regarding technical innovations and studio punch - ups ; there 's the early shenanigans with the wily Dick James over publishing rights to the songs ; there 's praise for ( or perhaps defence of )
Ringo 's drumming , and much else in the way of ad hoc recollections .
And we get an agreeable impression of Martin 's adventures with ' the boys ' - the gruelling tour schedule , an enjoyable skiing holiday with the Lennons ( ' John had a sharp sense of humour ' , Martin reveals ) - in the form of anecdotes told over a page or so , brevity being relied upon perhaps too much as the soul of wit , even when regularly aided , as here , with the trusty exclamation mark of jocular intent .
And then there are the millions of other artists on the Martin roster .
There 's Gerry and the Pacemakers , Rolf Harris , Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas , Spike Milligan , Ultravox , Henry Mancini , Jon Pertwee ...
The list ( and I 'm afraid there is a list , alphabeticised and printed in the notes accompanying this limited - edition volume with its previously unseen photographs , hand - bound in quarter black leather with buckram boards and silver tooling , each copy signed by Sir George himself , accompanying CD featuring previously unheard material by The Temperance Seven and Matt Monroe , among others , though not , alas , The Beatles , the whole housed in a custom - made solander box designed to look like ... a loudspeaker ! ) is n't literally endless , but my guess is you wo n't get further than Eamonn Andrews .
That the greater part of this book is n't concerned with The Beatles at all should not come as a shock , given Martin 's long career , though it might come as a disappointment .
I did n't mind the early struggles with scarlet fever and the Luftwaffe ; and the author 's squabbles with the pennypinching EMI over his salary are mildly intriguing .
But I could have done without the Flanders and Swann years , and the many orchestral pieces George has written , and the potted histories of anyone who stuck their head round the door , and the facsimiles of office diaries and letters ( ' Dear Joe , Cilla
thanks you very much for the invitation for 8 November at the Savoy and is delighted to accept ... ' ) .
Given that this sort of book is clearly aimed at diehard fans ( other collector 's editions in this series feature the likes of Bowie and The Who ) , you have to wonder what they would be fans of .
One thing is clear .
Anyone looking for dirt will be out of luck .
This is a gentle , affectionate memoir , written for the most part without rancour or regret .
What hurt most , it seems , was Lennon 's sneaky decision , after The Beatles split , to take the raw
Let it Be recordings to a rival producer and have them swamped with strings and choirs .
Yes , Phil Spector had a lot to answer for even then . ·

2003-07-26,"In July 1963 , the three girls with the tallest hair in showbusiness learnt that the producer Phil Spector had finally found a song for them .
The first Ronettes single , he decreed , would be '
Be My Baby ' , a big , repetitive tune with simple , direct lyrics about love and lust .
Recording time had been booked at Gold Star studios on Santa Monica Boulevard .
Musicians were arriving , and there were an awful lot of them .
Two bassists , two pianists , four guitarists , seven horn players , two drummers and almost anyone passing the entrance who saw themselves as a percussionist .
Then the string section got the call , and started sweating in that little room along with the rest of them .
The arranger handed out some sheets , and the engineer , a man called Larry Levine , began recalibrating the drum microphones for the twentieth time . '
I remember it was very tiring working with Phil , ' Levine said years later . '
I had no idea what Phil was searching for , or if even he knew until he heard it . '
It was four hours before the first recording tape rolled , and 42 run - throughs before Spector was happy .
The girls probably would n't be needed that day .
Spector had met the Ronettes - Veronica ' Ronnie ' Bennett , her sister Estelle and their cousin Nedra Talley - a year or so earlier in New York .
They were not yet 20 .
In one of those stories that one can only pray is true , Ronnie claimed that Spector dialled a wrong number one day and liked the timbre of her voice .
She looked OK too , even without the hair and panda eyeshade that made her irresistible .
Spector , already married , melted before her . '
When I met the Ronettes , I did n't think they were going to be a very good group , ' Levine wrote in the liner notes to their first album . '
Phil had said to me , "" I found this group , they 're good looking , but they do n't sing too well . ""
So I said , "" Well , why bother ? ""
He said , "" I kind of promised their mother . "" ' It took Spector several months to find them the right song .
He had previously worked with some great writers - Gene Pitney , Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller , Gerry Goffin and Carole King - but for something really emotional he turned to the husband - and - wife pairing of Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich .
Spector , the sole composer of his first hit as a producer , ' To Know Him Is To Love Him ' , was welcomed into the sessions . '
It was a hotchpotch , ' Greenwich remembers . '
The three of us were spewing out ideas simultaneously .
I 'd be pounding on a piano , Jeff would be playing a tambourine and Phil would be strumming his guitar , and the three of us singing away like maniacs at the top of our lungs .
Before you knew it , a song emerged . '
The song was just the beginning , of course . '
I was looking for a sound , ' he said the year after ' Be My Baby ' was released , ' a sound so strong that if the material was not the greatest , the sound would carry the record .
It was a case of augmenting , augmenting .
It all fitted together like a jigsaw . '
Spector 's Wall of Sound is not an easy thing to define even now .
For all its technical mastery and slavish devotion to detail , it is still less a technique than a feeling .
Forty years later we can email the world and heat - seek enemies from beneath the sea , but we can not reproduce that flow of joy and passion on either the most expensive or cheapest equipment . '
Be My Baby ' would catch a mood : Kennedy was still in the White House , the Beatles had not yet invaded , and the amount of fun that people poked at the ideals of American high school kids was at an all - time low .
It so happened that a little Jewish guy from the Bronx had found out how to treat a studio in a way that no one had done before - as an instrument in itself .
As if to play down his fanaticism and emphasise his intuition , Spector has rarely spoken specifically of his skills , except to boast . '
In those days if I could n't get a drum sound I 'd go crazy , ' he said .
' I 'd go out of my mind , spend five or six hours trying to get a drum sound . '
The stories of obsession come mostly from his musicians , the Wrecking Crew , so - called by bash-'em - out rivals who believed their willingness to comply with Spector 's demands was ruining the business .
They remember the long hours and cruel demands , and they speak with astonishment of the number of people playing the same music on the same type of instrument at the same time .
But it was not just a numbers game , and the sound was not all bombast : on ' Be My Baby ' Spector punctuated Wagnerian blasts with silences bursting with expectation . '
The things Phil was doing were crazy and exhausting , ' Levine concluded , ' but that 's not the sign of a nut .
That 's genius .
If something was remotely possible , he was going to do it . '
Not everyone could stand the intensity .
Ronnie and Estelle 's mother attended part of the ' Be My Baby ' session but found it ' so bad I never went again ' .
But when her daughters were finally ushered in , their contribution sounded like the most natural thing in the world .
After everything - the frustration and the tedium and the 42 custom - built aural avalanches - the song pretended it had arrived at the pressing plant after just one take .
The bass went bom bom - bom , a bubblegum rhythm with castanets and claps churned in , and the quavering , longing vocals - flat , beautiful , sweet and sad - began what for many remains the most complete pop music of all time . '
The night we met
I knew I needed you so ... '
Would the girl get the boy ?
We played the record as we drove around West Hollywood earlier this month , me , a photographer and a friend in the music business .
This was our ' Spector - nite ' , a new hand - crafted tour in the mould of Hollywood Homes of the Rich and Famous or the Universal Studios adventure .
We began our evening at Dan Tana 's , an old - style Italian restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard , the place 62-year - old Spector dined six months before , on the night the actress Lana Clarkson was found shot dead at his house .
Dan Tana 's is an institution , and it 's hip with both old Hollywood and new .
Fred Astaire and John Wayne used to come here , Johnny Carson and Joni Mitchell still do , and now they 're joined by Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman .
From the outside it looks like a suburban bungalow , and on the inside it 's a red - checked tablecloth and leathery booth affair , with wood panelling , and wine bottles hanging from the ceiling .
Dan Tana is 68 , a former actor , and there are pictures all over of him with his chums , some of whom have also made it on to the menu : Veal Scaloppine Florentine James Woods , Chicken Parmigiana Ted Demme .
The food is the sort Sophia Loren would recognise : pasta with traditional sauces , steaks as big as LPs , and veal in every permutation .
John Belushi ordered food here the night he died .
Spector was a regular here in the Sixties , dropping in after seeing bands at the Troubadour up the road .
As his reclusiveness lifted in recent years he began coming again .
In the first hours of Monday 3 February he arrived with a woman and ordered a salad and a sweet cocktail .
Then he had another .
People who recognised him said he seemed happy : ' It looked like a date , ' Martin DeLuca , a talent manager , remembered . '
They were talking and laughing .
It was a quiet dinner .
There was no arguing . '
The most noticeable thing about the visit was observed only by his waiter , who no doubt shared his glee with his colleagues : a $ 500 tip on a $ 55 bill .
When we left I apologised to our waiter that we could n't compete with Spector . '
That 's fine , ' he said . '
He 'll be here again in a few days . '
The itinerary then took in the House of Blues , a music venue a few blocks away on Sunset Boulevard , where people remember Spector arriving without his dining partner , later reported to have been a waitress and singer .
He went straight to the Foundation Room , a VIP area with membership fees of $ 2,200 a year , where he would have found concentrated mystical weirdness .
The Foundation Room is in fact many rooms , all with an Indian or Thai theme and the whiff of incense about them .
There are many beautiful wood carvings brought over from various temples , and one of them forms the door to the Confessional Room , an area with floor cushions and a Buddha .
The lighting in the Foundation Room is soft on the eyes , but we saw Spike Lee there to watch the rap act Mos Def .
Spector arrived here just before 2.30 on the Monday morning , and got talking to a tall blonde called Lana Clarkson .
She worked there as a hostess , and was coming off shift ; Rob Halford of Judas Priest had finished his act hours ago .
Until clued in by a colleague , she apparently had no idea who Spector was ; she would usually have no business with a much older man in such an obvious wig , unless he could help with her career .
But when she learnt his name she declared herself a fan .
She was born the same year as Spector formed the Ronettes .
We followed the route Spector and Clarkson took from the club to Spector 's house in Alhambra , 30 minutes away at this time of morning .
Lana Clarkson was unknown to most people until she died , a fact that would have pained her .
She was by then a struggling actress , but once she was a ' promising ' actress : her biggest hit was the lead role in Roger Corman 's Barbarian Queen , a 1985 precursor to Xena , Warrior Princess . '
When Roger Corman gave me the opportunity to travel to Argentina and Mexico , ride horses , swing a broadsword and generally wreak havoc on the male population , ' she once said , ' I jumped at the chance . '
She made other films for Corman , and buffs will spot her in walk - ons in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Scarface , but when work dried up she went where she had to in order to pay the bills - classy hotel suites and popular nightclubs .
She had her own car at the House of Blues but that morning she went home with Spector in his brand new chauffeur - driven Mercedes .
Spector 's career was not what it had been , either .
He produced many wonderful songs after ' Be My Baby ' , but three stand out :
the Ronettes ' ' Baby I Love You ' ,
The Righteous Brothers ' '
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' and Ike and Tina Turner 's ' River Deep - Mountain High ' .
His best work was over before the close of 1964 ; I wonder if he knew .
Many factors worked against him as the Sixties drew on .
Guitar groups were in , and many bands wrote their own material with a finished sound already in their heads .
Some sounded as good live as they did in the studio .
With the exception of his 1963 Christmas record , Spector never made a great album : he once said an LP was ' two hits and 10 pieces of junk ' .
Paul McCartney was keen to announce last year that Spector 's work on ' Let It Be ' would soon be excised , strings and all .
Also , Spector was expensive - and nuts ; there were few executives who would take a chance on him .
On the foolish occasions when record companies booked studio time for him with their bands and specified a deadline , there was bound to be trouble .
Levine cites his engineering work with Spector on the Ramones album Rock'n'Roll High School as the cause of his second heart attack .
Joey Ramone remembered mostly fights , walk - outs and 10-minute swearing fits .
Only two songs from Spector 's recent Abbey Road sessions with Starsailor have made it on to their forthcoming album .
James Walsh , the band 's singer , said he enjoyed working with Spector despite his unorthodox timekeeping ( 6pm-4am ) and old - fashioned methods .
Spector did n't seem to like any studio gear that was n't around in the Sixties , and he shunned computer software . '
You could n't really go back over anything and say , "" That could sound better "" . '
Spector 's vast home sits at the dead - end of a quiet street , guarded by a double set of spiked iron gates and menacing signs : No trespassing .
Violators will be prosecuted .
Danger - high voltage .
In the early hours all you can hear is small insects and big dogs .
Built in 1926 for a wealthy French couple who fancied a chateau in suburbia , the turreted house was bought by Spector in the 1990s after many transformations and uses ( it was once a base for Lotus Engi neering ) .
Known locally as The Castle , it is a fine spot for a recluse ; built on a hill , shielded by a grove of Himalayan deodar trees , the last uninvited people to get a good look at the place were in a television news helicopter .
There are security cameras outside , but apparently none within , or it might have made the police 's job easier .
No one can be sure what happened between 2.30am and just after 5 am when the police got the call .
It was like a Roger Corman movie poster :
There were only two people involved , and one of them was dead .
Lana Clarkson was found in the entrance hall with a fatal gunshot to her face .
There was a gun nearby .
Spector was stunned with a Taser gun when the police arrived , and arrested on suspicion of murder .
Often after a terrible incident like this , friends and neighbours emerge to say he was such a quiet , unassuming man , and they 'd never have believed he had it in him .
Not with Spector .
It was mostly bad stuff , and it had a single theme : the things that made him great also made him mad .
Most stories featured guns .
In 1976 Spector appeared on the cover of the NME pointing a gun from a car window .
In the piece inside he quoted from memory the slogan : ' It 's better to have a gun and not need one than to need a gun and not have one . '
Johnny Ramone remembered his group were ' prisoners at his house ' when he lived in Bel Air in the 1980s . '
He would n't let us leave .
Dee Dee [ Ramone ] said something , and he pulled out a gun and started waving it around ...
he kept saying , "" You 're not leaving , nobody 's leaving "" . '
Spector 's family had nothing better to say .
One of his three adopted children called him a ' psycho ' on television .
Dan Kessel , a guitarist who played on Spector records for years , questioned whether Spector 's reputation was n't partly a marketing tool , something of his own creation . '
A wild rock guy ?
Right ,
and do you think Alice Cooper goes to sleep with the snakes ?
A lot of the stuff in the old days was just showbiz , theatre . '
A revealing interview with Spector conducted by Mick Brown of the Daily Telegraph a few weeks before Clarkson 's death was quoted all over : ' I have not been well , ' he said , suggesting he was better now . '
I was crippled inside .
Emotionally .
Insane is a hard word .
I was n't insane , but I was n't well enough to function as a regular part of society ,
so I did n't .
I chose not to . '
Spector said he took medication for schizophrenia , although he denied he was schizophrenic . '
I have a bipolar personality .
I 'm my own worst enemy . '
Different accounts of the shooting emerged from the start .
It was reported that Spector 's chauffeur called the police when he heard a gunshot ; Spector said he called them himself .
He sent friends an email protesting his innocence , and after his release on $ 1 million bail he mounted a vigorous defence in Esquire magazine .
He called the affair an ' Anatomy of a Frame - Up ' , and claimed Clarkson 's wound was self - inflicted . '
I did n't do anything wrong , ' he insisted . '
She kissed the gun .
I have no idea why - I never knew her ...
I have no idea who she was or what her agenda was .
They have the gun [ the police ] - I do n't know where or how she got the gun .
She asked me for a ride home .
Then she wanted to see the castle ...
I was n't drunk at all .
There is no case . '
There is still a case , of course , although nothing appears to be moving . '
If we had come to a conclusion as monumental as suicide , we would have a duty to say so publicly .
We believe a crime occurred , ' said homicide police chief Frank Merriman in March .
( He 's made no public statement since . )
But Spector , whose first proper job as a teenager was as a court stenographer , has not been charged .
The police and the legal teams are only talking to each other .
A wall of silence has descended , although Spector still chats to his friends when he goes to Dan Tana 's .
Om the way back from Alhambra we passed close to where Gold Star studios used to be , before it was dismantled in the 1980s .
The main studio was spacious enough when Eddie Cochran and Dick Dale first used it , but ridiculous when Spector crammed 20-odd musicians in there .
That was a trick few grasped : the bodies in themselves baffled the sound .
The Gold Star echo chambers added something too , as did Spector 's love of mono , the sound he grew up with .
He dismissed the possibilities of eight- or 16-track recording for just three - the rhythm ( guitars , drums and percussion , horns and piano ) on one , strings on another , vocals on the third .
Some of his records were later split that way into stereo ( with the vocals down the middle ) , but they were originally burnt down to just one full - on assault .
Small AM radios thanked him for it ; one of the engineers at Gold Star rigged up a transmitter direct to car radios to see how things sounded on the move .
It still sounds fantastic , and it can quite alter your mood .
Like all the best songs , ' Be My Baby ' has enjoyed a long afterlife .
Brian Wilson likes recalling how he had to pull over his car when he first heard the song , and he claims no greater influence on the Beach Boys ' hits .
It 's also hard to listen to Bruce Springsteen 's ' Born To Run ' without imagining the Wrecking Crew thundering away behind it all .
John Lennon recorded a nasty version of ' Be My Baby ' when working with Spector in 1975 , a version which must be heard to be believed .
Ronnie Spector said a few years ago that nothing makes her prouder than that song , and she recalled meeting Bill Clinton after performing for world leaders at the G8 summit .
They met up after the concert . '
He just opened his arms and gave me the biggest grin and he started singing ""
Be My Baby "" to me . ' '
Ronnie sings as if the honour and bravery in speaking up were all , '
Stephanie Zacharek wrote of the song in the online magazine Salon last year . '
In fact , she sings as if she knows that the boy 's returning her love is secondary to her own assuredness .
She 's jumping off a cliff , and she 's got your hand -
wherever she goes , you 're going , too - which is maybe why so many people feel so passionately about ' Be My Baby ' .
Every time I hear it , I 'm almost painfully aware of the leap this girl takes . '
Years after the recording session , someone at the studio let it be known that of the three Ronettes only Ronnie was singing on the record , the other two judged too flat and replaced by session singers .
Too flat to record , but too saleable to dismiss : Spector knew almost as much about the marketing of pop as the recording of it ; Pop Idol could have taught him nothing .
Phil and Ronnie were married in 1968 and divorced five years later .
Most of the years since have been spent in the law courts , battling first over the custody of their adopted children and then over money .
Living with Phil ' was like being in the dark all the time ' , she has said . '
Phil went out annually , so that meant I did n't go out either ... '
In her autobiography she wrote that if she did go out alone in the car , Spector liked it if she had a blow - up man in the seat beside her .
In 1987 ' Be My Baby ' was featured in the movie Dirty Dancing and it became a special song again - for a new generation and to those who had forgotten how great it was .
The soundtrack yielded millions , but little of it found its way to the Ronettes .
Ronnie issued a writ for a share of the royalties , and the case took 15 years to crawl through the New York courts .
At one stage the Ronettes claimed that ' Be My Baby ' had made them only $ 15,000 .
But towards the end of last year a judge ruled that the Ronettes had signed away all their rights in perpetuity in 1963 , and Spector legally owned everything .
So the girl never got the boy , because it was the other way around all along ."
2003-09-12,"Phil Spector , originally contracted to produce Starsailor 's second album , was , apparently , just too weird for the boys from Lancashire , who sent him home after two songs .
What a dilemma , choosing between persevering with the troubled legend because his melodramatic pop sensibility mirrored theirs , or trying to follow up a million - selling debut on their own .
But they 've done a creditable job of the latter , producing an emotionally and musically literate 39 minutes .
As with 2001 's Love Is Here , their brand of emo - rock makes much of the lavish arrangement ( Spectorean strings and bells are just the start ) and the pregnant pause , all weighted for maximum tremulousness .
Sturdier souls will be irritated by nearly everything except the stompy Music Was Saved and the disco pastiche Four to the Floor ( though even this will provoke with its sentimental references to Walsh 's infant daughter ) , and the reliance on stately balladry can be yawnsome .
But this is attractive listening , and it 's hard not to be moved by its tenderness ."

2003-09-23,"The death of B - movie actor
Lana Clarkson at the home of music producer Phil Spector last February was yesterday ruled a homicide by the Los Angeles coroner 's office .
The announcement that "" the manner of death was homicide and the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck "" contradicts Phil Spector 's claim that Clarkson committed suicide .
So far , Spector is the only other person known to be present at the time of Clarkson 's death .
Prosecutors are expected to make a decision this week about what charges are to be brought against Spector .
Clarkson 's credits had included the 1985 B - movie Barbarian Queen and its 1989 sequel , as well as Amazon Women on the Moon .
She also popped up in episodes of Knight Rider and The A - Team .
At the time of her death she was working as a hostess in an LA nightclub called the Foundation Room where she met Spector ."
2003-09-23,"They may have been propelled by hype , but Starsailor have been rather muffled by the hot air that surrounds them .
The Wigan fourpiece had an NME cover before they had released a record , and news that Phil Spector had worked on their second album , Silence Is Easy , led some commentators to spend more time talking about the producer 's eccentricity than the record 's content .
On this tour , thanks perhaps to Spector 's "" wall of sound "" recording techniques , the band have taken on an extra guitarist , Mark Collins from the Charlatans .
It does n't always work - when Collins plays the same notes as Barry Westhead , he drowns out the keyboard player 's endeavours - but Collins does make Starsailor a denser proposition .
If it 's substance that the band 's lead singer , James Walsh , is after , the gig 's opening minutes offer it in spades .
Music Was Saved is muscular and rousing , while Poor Misguided Fool brings on the night 's first burst of pogoing .
Walsh is not one for holding back .
Emotions are not so much worn on sleeves as broadcast in block capitals .
"" It 's great to be in Scotland , "" he declares a few songs in .
"" That 's the best I 've ever heard it sung , "" he shouts after a roof - raising singalong to Lullaby .
And : "" T in the Park is the best music festival on earth , "" which leaves the less fervent members of the audience wondering just how many music festivals Walsh has attended .
Rock gestures are fine , as long as you can back them up .
Walsh prefaces Four to the Floor with the claim : "" This is our attempt at an indie disco anthem , "" citing The Only One I Know and I Am the Resurrection as benchmarks .
In such company , the song rather sinks .
A cover of U2 's Where the Streets Have
No Name is entertaining enough , but drives home a similar point : Starsailor are neither as big , nor quite as good , as Walsh would like them to be .
Thankfully , they have tunes enough for a fine finale .
Silence Is Easy is pounding and euphoric , Good Souls a pugnacious epic that should serve to remind the doubters that Starsailor are a very decent rock band .
But however keenly Walsh may flap his wings , they 're not ready to part the clouds and soar just yet . ·

2003-10-01,"There has been a lot of noise about Martin O'Neill and Celtic over the past week .
None of it , however , can compare with the volume here last night .
Celtic were literally roared back into contention in Group A on a wall of sound , the scale of which would have impressed Phil Spector . ""
Even the players said it was as loud as they could remember , "" said a delighted O'Neill .
Goals from the young substitute Liam Miller and Chris Sutton in the space of eight second - half minutes secured the points in an excellent Celtic performance .
Henrik Larsson once again stood out .
He supplied the crosses for both goals , the first being the 23rd pass of an impressively patient sequence .
The second was floated with the outside of the Swede 's right foot .
"" It was a big performance from Henrik , "" said O'Neill , "" but I thought there were others who were immense .
I thought our second - half performance was absolutely immense . ""
The draw in Brussels between Anderlecht and Bayern Munich means that Celtic are meaningful contenders not just to qualify but to win the group .
And this victory was achieved without major defenders like Joos Valgaeren and Johan Mjallby , who should be back to face Anderlecht in three weeks .
In the context of the triumph and the atmosphere surrounding it , talk of O'Neill leaving Celtic imminently seems like so much flannel .
There are very few clubs able to match this sort of evening .
Yet in the opening half - hour when Lyon passed and moved sweetly , Celtic glory looked an unlikely outcome .
Lyon have fine individuals in Juninho and Vikash Dhorasoo and there was a dangerous fluency to their movement .
As it turned out , however , Giovane Elber 's 22nd - minute header which forced Magnus Hedman to scramble across his line was the Frenchmen 's most dangerous attack .
Still , Celtic were not to know that , nor could they relax in the presence of such conspicuous skill .
Along with Larsson , Alan Thompson had a telling match , especially after missing a penalty four minutes before the interval .
Larsson had already tested the Lyon keeper Gregory Coupet with a shot and his all - round game was producing a real response from Edmilson .
But the Brazilian 's colleague at the back , Anthony Reveillere , was less at ease and it was his trip on Larsson that led to the penalty .
More than a minute passed between its award and Thompson 's driven effort
and that may have contributed to the miss .
Coupet 's premature dash off his line was also a factor .
Undeterred , Celtic started the second half at full pelt .
Thompson was at the hub of one prolonged spell of passing on the left which ended with John Hartson flashing a powerful shot across goal which Coupet did well to touch away .
Moments later Coupet was brought into action again , this time flying to his left to push out a Larsson volley .
Hartson then made way for Miller after 64 minutes .
The 22-year - old has seen his bright career prospects blighted by a series of injuries .
But he has talent and O'Neill has obvious faith in him .
The substitution proved masterly .
Six minutes after his introduction Miller surged into the box as the passes reached 22 and Larsson undid his marker on the left wing .
Larsson then delivered a brilliant centre and Miller squeezed between defenders and met it with a brave downward header on the run to put Celtic ahead .
Eight minutes later Sutton took a throw - in to Larsson , who again threw in a trick and dribbled into the area .
There he looked up , waited for Sutton to charge and played an exquisite centre on to his forehead .
It was a fantastic finish to a fantastic night .
"" One certainly to remember , "" said O'Neill .
· Bayern Munich hit back for a 1 - 1 draw against Anderlecht in Brussels despite the 35th - minute sending off of the Peruvian forward Claudio Pizarro .
Ivica Mornar put Anderlecht ahead after half - time but this was cancelled out by the Paraguayan Roque Santa Cruz after 73 minutes ."
2003-10-24,"While fans of the Wall of Sound wait to hear whether Phil Spector will be charged in connection with the death of Lana Clarkson last February ( his $ 1 m bail has been extended until November 3 ) , they can pass the time with this excellent compilation of records bearing the imprint of the great producer 's influence .
There are no retrospective homages here ( no Born to Run or Roy Wood 's Wizzard , for example ) , just music that attempted to use his innovations as a route to success at the time Spector himself was dominating the charts .
The Walker Brothers ' magnificent Love Her and Jackie DeShannon 's original version of When You Walk in the Room are well - known ; so is the Righteous Brothers ( You 're My ) Soul and Inspiration , produced by Bill Medley as an anything - you - can - do gesture after he and Bobby Hatfield had left Spector 's Philles label .
The remaining 21 tracks will probably be unknown to most listeners , but there are some idiomatic beauties from the likes of PJ Proby , Sonny and Cher , Alder Ray , Nino Tempo and April Stevens , the Dolls and Clydie King , plus an obscure B - side called Please Phil Spector , on which a group of New York studio hacks , calling themselves the Attack , amusingly solicit his services .
Needless to say , almost everything here is better value than the current Starsailor single ."
2003-11-07,"The dramatic You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling , produced by Phil Spector and sung by the Righteous Brothers , was one of the most recognisable songs of the 1960s , with more than 8 m plays to date on US radio alone .
Bobby Hatfield , who has died aged 63 , was responsible for the falsetto part on the track .
Hatfield was born in Beaver Dam , Wisconsin , and moved a few years later to Anaheim , California , with his parents , who owned a dry - cleaning business .
He excelled in music and sport at California State University , Long Beach , where he sang with the Variations .
They played college fraternity dances and proms , as did a rival band , the Paramours .
In 1962 , Hatfield joined forces with Bill Medley , the vocalist of the Paramours .
The unusual combination of a snub - nosed , blond - haired high tenor and a dark - haired , narrow - faced , deep baritone performing rhythm and blues hits in the style of black singers Don and Dewey soon made them favourites in local clubs .
It was at one of these , the Black Derby , in Santa Ana , that the duo found their new name , as Hatfield told an interviewer in 1996 : "" Several black marines were there , and when Bill and I finished doing a duet one of them yelled out '
That 's righteous , brothers ! '
""
The Righteous Brothers ' first recordings were made in 1963 for the small Moonglow label .
Medley 's composition
Little Latin Lupe Lu became a minor hit , and the following year they opened the show for the Beatles at the Cow Palace , San Francisco .
An appearance on the television show Shindig !
caught the attention of Phil Spector , who signed the duo to his Philles label .
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling was issued in late 1964 .
The song had been written by Spector with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil , authors of hits for the Crystals , one of Spector 's successful girl groups .
As Medley 's deep voice chased Hatfield 's pleading falsetto to the denouement , Spector surrounded them with his wall of sound , created by over - dubbing more and more instrumental sounds on to the master tape .
The jazz guitarist Barney Kessel was brought in to play six - string bass guitar , alongside a double bass player and a Fender bass guitarist .
He later described Spector in the studio as , "" All the time working on a strategy , like he was going to invade Moscow "" .
The finished record lasted 3min 50secs , much longer than the three minutes ' maximum demanded by radio station programmers .
Spector refused to compromise and had the running time listed on the record as 3min 5secs .
The song was an instant hit in the United States .
In Britain , it survived being voted a miss on the television show Juke Box Jury , and soon vanquished a competing version by Cilla Black , reaching No 1 in January 1965 .
Later that year , Hatfield 's solo version of the 1950s song Unchained Melody was a further hit for the Brothers , although their next oldie , Ebb Tide , was less successful .
By now , Spector was concentrating on a new project , Ike and Tina Turner , and agreed to sell the duo 's contract to the music arm of MGM .
He later said : "" I loved them .
I thought they were a great expression for myself .
I think they resented being an expression . ""
The MGM era began well as another Mann and Weil song ( You 're My ) Soul And Inspiration
brought a second US No 1 hit .
Further records made little impact , however , and , in 1967 , Medley left to follow a solo career .
Hatfield retained the group name and replaced Medley with Jimmy Walker , formerly of the beat group , the Knickerbockers .
But the Righteous Brothers ' blue - eyed soul seemed dated in the psychedelic era and , in 1970 , the duo separated .
Hatfield went into temporary retirement , though he was persuaded to reunite with Medley in 1974 to record the successful but maudlin Rock ' n ' Roll Heaven , a tribute to deceased rock stars .
Further brief reunions followed in 1982 , when Hatfield and Medley appeared together on the 30th anniversary edition of the television show American Bandstand , and in 1986 , when You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling was included on the soundtrack of the film Top Gun .
The final revival began in 1990 with a re - recording of Unchained Melody after the original version had been featured in the hit film Ghost .
Subsequently , the duo returned to performing together , this time on the oldies circuit of clubs , fairs and colleges .
Through his Bobby Hatfield annual golf classic , Hatfield raised money for charities associated with the Lupus disease from which his wife Linda suffered .
The Righteous Brothers were twice nominated for Grammies , and earlier this year they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
Hatfield is survived by his wife and two children .

2003-11-14,"When Let It Be appeared as ( ostensibly ) the final Beatles album in May 1970 , even though it had been recorded before 1969 's Abbey Road , it was widely dismissed as a dog 's dinner , criminally unworthy of the Moptop legacy .
Blame was heaped on eccentric producer Phil Spector , who had been invited by John Lennon to pore over the tapes after the Beatles had rejected two test pressings assembled by Glyn Johns .
Spector , given only a few weeks to produce a finished product to tie in with the release of a documentary film provisionally entitled Get Back ( eventually also called
Let It Be ) , responded by submerging the material in a treacly swamp of sound , with I Me Mine , The Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe bearing the brunt of his odious Mantovani - isation .
Lennon , disillusioned with the band and insulated by Yoko and a heroin habit , seemed indifferent .
McCartney hated the results so much that he claimed Let It Be was one of his chief motivations for wanting to dissolve the Beatles .
After 30 years of feeling irked by this discordant stain on their legacy , the surviving Fabs set about creating a version of Let It Be that was closer to their original intentions ( George Harrison gave the project the nod before his death ) .
Back in early 1969 , the plan had been for the Beatles to throw out all the psychedelia and studio trickery and , if you will , "" get back "" to being the live four - piece band of their earliest days .
The boffins at their old haunt , Abbey Road studios , were commissioned
to re - examine the Let It Be tapes in the light of the latest audio technology , and to try to reignite the original spirit of the project .
Technically , they 've done a fine job , though there 's no overcoming the fact that the material falls far short of the group 's best .
For instance , it may be intriguing to hear a version of Across the Universe featuring only Lennon and some echo effects , but the new mix merely emphasises the song 's droning vapidity .
The Long and Winding Road is indubitably improved by the removal of Spector 's wall of schmaltz , but it 's still teeth - clenchingly mawkish .
For You Blue is skiffle , and therefore belongs in Room 101 .
However , there are several pleasant surprises , not least the startling clarity and room - filling presence the engineers have extracted from the tapes .
Get Back pumps along on a resonant thrum of drums and chiming rhythm guitar .
One
After 909 is cheerfully loose and raucous , and the warm , buoyant sound works wonders on the raw gospel funkiness of I 've Got a Feeling .
It was also a smart move to rescue
Do n't Let Me Down ( heard here in its rousing live - on - the - Apple - rooftop version ) from B - side limbo , since it 's one of the strongest tracks .
I could live without the extra disc of rehearsal fragments and disconnected between - band mutterings , which panders to the worst kind of Beatle - anorak nerditude , but you can believe that this is how Let It Be should have been ."

Out of his Head Richard Williams Omnibus Press £ 7.95 , pp226
The revised edition of Phil Spector 's biography , which comes not long after his arrest for murder in murky circumstances , makes no apology for its timing .
Williams 's account of Spector 's rise as the ' first tycoon of teen ' retains relevance 30 odd years on , when pop producers have become more powerful but preserve little of Spector 's interest in the quality and durability of individual records or artists .
Williams offers an incisive examination of Spector 's two career peaks - the first in the early Sixties , with the Ronettes and Darlene Love ; the second in the early Seventies with Lennon , Harrison and others - portraying him as a creative figure who , by and large , used pop artists constructively as part of his musical vision .
The book contains useful appendices and potted biographies of many figures he worked with .
There is also a general fascination with Spector 's behavioural oddities and excesses , especially his obsession with security - something which Williams traces to an incident where four men cornered him and urinated on him in a bar toilet .

Sceptical and consistently well - written pieces from a healthy spectrum of contributors cover all aspects of the British and US roles both over the Iraq war and in the so - called ' war on terror ' ( the relationship between the two being exposed as ten uous at best ) .

There are also entertaining sections on sport and the arts .
Still , it is Blair , Bush and their two wars that loom large over the collection .
The volume is dedicated to Hugo Young , whose two pieces - on Blair and the 45-minute claim , and Brown 's handling of the European question - brilliantly and succinctly illustrate the startling inconsistencies of the Government 's handling of the country 's short - term foreign policy and its longer term geopolitical future ."

They worked together extremely well and played at local pubs while they were doing their courses .
He was very into rhythmic , instrumental stuff and composed the music for a performance our dance students did . """
2004-03-06,"With the frocks returned to their makers and the Oscar statuettes back under dust sheets for another year , the capital of the entertainment industry needs something new to entertain it .
Fortunately it can turn its attention fully to the city 's other long - running entertainment show : justice . ""
A court trial is a show , it 's a Broadway show , "" said Harvey Levin , lawyer - turned - producer of TV 's Celebrity Justice .
Consider the shows about to open or already running : Michael Jackson is preparing his car - top moon walk for an encore in Santa Barbara ( his lawyer is preparing to reprise his unheeded car - side cry of "" get the fuck down "" ) , Phil Spector is amassing a wall of evidence for his trial on a murder charge in the autumn , actor Robert Blake has changed the cast in his murder trial yet again , drafting in his fourth defence lawyer , and basketball superstar Kobe Bryant spins and is spun against in his forthcoming trial for rape .
But these are just the cases we know about .
The entertainment division of the LA County bar has 2,000 members .
They must be doing something .
"" You do n't hear about a lot of people coming into the court that the media would be interested in because it is easy for lawyers to sidestep the media , "" said Judge Charles G Rubin , a serving judge who was master of ceremonies at the recent high - profile trials of George Michael , Zsa Zsa Gabor and Halle Berry .
While something as simple as changing a court date can be enough to keep a client out of the media gaze , donning disguises and wearing dark glasses does not always help .
But a changed name is probably the best strategy .
"" I once had the film director Roger Vadim in my court on a minor charge , "" said Judge Rubin , "" and nobody knew he was there because he used his original name , some Polish name .
"" But in this town that lives and breathes Robert Altman 's 1992 film The Player , where everyone wants to be something in the movies , celebrity trials often slip under the media radar because the lives of the rich and famous are just so damn ordinary . ""
Celebrities ' lives mirror normal peoples ' lives , "" said Levin .
"" There 's one Hollywood star going through a divorce and he is broke , he ca n't afford what is happening to him ; J - Lo is in the middle of a court case with a contractor who was working on a house she was having built in Hollywood when she was with P Diddy .
These are ordinary things that happen to ordinary people . ""
And sometimes the ordinary people just ca n't resist grabbing their moment in the limelight and playing it for all its worth .
"" I heard the plaintive wail of a dog , "" declaimed a neighbour during the most notorious of LA celebrity trials , the 1995 OJ Simpson murder trial .
""
Who talks that way ?
"" asked Levin .
"" Nobody talks that way , especially not someone who was watching Dynasty Reunion on TV .
In my head he was thinking , how do I get on the six o'clock news bulletin ?
"" Even judges are not immune to the lure of celebrity . ""
There was one judge who had to consider the whole issue of where to put the cameras , "" said Judge Rubin .
"" He decided that they could go only on his good side .
The problem was that the jury was on the other side . ""
"" The line between the courts and the entertainment industry has become very blurred , "" said Linda Deutsch , a veteran reporter of celebrity trials in Los Angeles for the Associated Press .
"" It seems to me like the court has become the entertainment industry . ""
The judge had a pithier description : "" Jerry Springer in robes . """
2004-05-07,"An actor shot dead at music producer Phil Spector 's home may have pulled the trigger herself , according to medical experts consulted by his defence .
Mr Spector 's lawyers say that their experts ' conclusions contradict the findings in the Los Angeles county coroner 's report .
The coroner 's office concluded that the Lana Clarkson 's death was murder .
But defence lawyers say that they consulted forensic scientists who say the evidence shows that she shot herself . ""
The physical evidence is not consistent with homicide , "" Marcia Morrissey of Mr Spector 's defence team said in an interview .
"" The coroner rejected the obvious implication of the evidence : that this was a single , self - inflicted gunshot wound .
"" The defence say the report shows that Clarkson was killed with the gun in her mouth , and that it confirms earlier reports that gunshot residue was found on Clarkson 's hands and that "" the decedent may have discharged a firearm "" .
Clarkson also had a broken thumbnail , which the defence say supports their argument that she fired the gun .
Toxicology records show that Clarkson 's body tested positive for alcohol and hydrocodone , an addictive painkiller .
Clarkson died on February 3 2003 from a single gunshot wound from a handgun which was found under her leg .
Mr Spector was charged with her murder the following November .
Prosecutors allege that Mr Spector , famed for his "" wall of sound "" production technique in the 1960s , killed Clarkson at his Los Angeles mansion after meeting her at the House of Blues nightclub that night .
He is free on $ 1 m bail and faces a life sentence if convicted .
Traces of gunshot residue on Clarkson 's hands is not regarded by the prosecution as evidence of suicide ; any gunshot would , they say , generate a cloud of residue that would have dusted her hands even if they were in her lap .
They also say that police investigating the killing found the victim 's blood and gunshot residue on Mr Spector as well as evidence that he wiped and moved the murder weapon .
Mr Spector 's driver , Adriano Desouza , told investigators he was waiting outside after he dropped the two off at the mansion when he heard a single gunshot .
Mr Spector came outside with a gun in his hand , according to allegations in court files , and told Mr Desouza that he thought he had killed someone .
The claim that Clarkson had taken her own life is one already made by Mr Spector himself in an interview last year .
He told Esquire magazine that Clarkson had "" kissed the gun "" in a bizarre suicide carried out in front of him ."
2004-06-28,"We first heard of the Concretes through our manager who 's a big fan .
He got us a copy of the album and we were immediately struck by the production ; it 's really warm and full of life .
They 've got that kind of Phil Spector sound , soft vocals with lots of harmonies .
They 've got very beautiful voices .
The most striking thing about their performance was how well they were able to translate their recorded sound to the stage .
There 's any number of band members on the album - there 's horns , chimes and all sorts .
With that number there was a real possibility that things could go wrong , but it worked .
We could n't be sure , but we think there were three singers .
The lead vocalist was ice cool , and she had that Scandinavian attitude , like Björk , which seemed removed but was at the same time alluring , enticing .
As a young band we 're always looking for aspects of other bands ' performances that impress , and we came away from watching the Concretes with a lot .
The staging was impressive .
Musicians stacked in rows almost like buildings raised above one another .
And while the performance was really well rehearsed it also had a feeling of spontaneity , a jangling pop element that made it carefree ."
2004-09-28,"Record producer Phil Spector pleaded not guilty to murder yesterday and lambasted prosecutors as "" Hitler - like "" after he was indicted in connection with the death of an actor in his home last year .
Spector showed no emotion in court as he heard the charge over the murder of Lana Clarkson , 40 , who was found shot dead in his home in California .
But outside court afterwards , Spector said : "" The actions of the Hitler - like DA and his storm - trooper henchmen are reprehensible , unconscionable and despicable . ""
He was allowed to remain free on $ 1 m ( £ 550,000 ) bail .
The trial is due to start on December 16 in Los Angeles .
Ms Clarkson was found dead in the foyer of Spector 's 33-room mansion on the night of February 3 2003 .
Spector , 64 , famed for creating the "" wall of sound "" in the 1960s and for his work with the Beatles and other artists , had met the actor that night at the House of Blues restaurant in Los Angeles , where she worked as a hostess .
An autopsy showed that Ms Clarkson died from a single gunshot wound from a weapon put in her mouth .
Spector has claimed that Ms Clarkson killed herself , but police claim they found blood and gunshot residue on Spector , as well as evidence that he had cleaned and moved the gun .
Spector had already been charged with murder by the Los Angeles district attorney 's office .
The move to a grand jury indictment was intended to speed up the process - prosecutors have made no secret of their frustration with Spector 's frequent changes of legal team , which they see as a delaying tactic - and to ensure that evidence accumulated in the investigation can stay secret until the trial .
Spector told reporters outside court : "" No crime was committed in my home . ""
He also insisted that he did not own the gun .
But prosecutors allege that the nature of the injury means it was unlikely to have been self - inflicted .
Officers who arrived at the scene of the shooting found Spector standing in the doorway of the home with his hands in his pockets .
They found the body of Ms Clarkson slumped in a chair , and in another room found a man 's coat with bloodstains on the arm .
They also found evidence that the two had been drinking , contradicting Spector 's assertion that he was not drinking at the time of the incident .
In an interview with Esquire magazine , Spector said Ms Clarkson had come to his house to commit suicide and had "" kissed the gun "" in a bizarre ritual ."

2005-01-08,"The rock music producer Phil Spector initially told police he had mistakenly shot the actor Lana Clarkson , though he has since suggested she committed suicide , according to newly released grand jury transcripts .
Police officer Beatrice Rodriguez testified that Spector told officers at his home : "" What 's wrong with you guys ?

I did n't mean to shoot her .

They came in with weapons drawn , "" he said .
"" It has to be because I live in a castle .
It has to be a frame - up because it 's not based on real evidence . ""
Clarkson 's movie career include the B - movie Barbarian Queen ( 1985 ) and its 1989 sequel , Barbarian Queen : The Empress Strikes Back .
She also worked on more B - movies such as Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II and the horror film The Haunting of Morella .
At the time of her death she was working as a hostess in LA nightclub the Foundation Room , where she met Spector ."
2005-08-06,"Simon Jordan brought a condition to the table and normally such demands trigger concern .
But the owner - chairman of Crystal Palace merely wanted an assurance that Joe Meek would receive a mention .
For the uninitiated , Meek is not some Palace youngster , rather England 's answer to Phil Spector , a tragic genius record producer who ended up killing himself and his landlady in 1967 in a flat on London 's Holloway Road .
Jordan has funded Telstar , a West End play about Meek 's life and career .
"" I 'm a great lover of theatre , music
and I 'm also a great lover of stories that are deep , sometimes tragic and about the underdog , "" Jordan explained .
"" All of those things combined come into play with Joe Meek .
He was charismatic , eccentric , went against the system and did things no one has ever done before or since .
I like the story of a man who was so different . ""
The conversation flowed to The Specials and Jordan 's determination to reform the seminal Coventry ska band . ""
Terry Hall comes to a lot of Palace games now , "" Jordan said of the lead singer , "" and Jerry Dammers thinks I 'm stalking him .
I love The Specials and if I do nothing else with my life I 'm going to have them play at my 40th birthday . ""
Jordan 's fist hit the table .
The obvious passion for these subjects reinforced an impression of a man looking away from football and , by extension , looking away from Crystal Palace .
This after all is a chairman who in half an hour could describe football as "" unpalatable "" "" immature "" "" bullshit "" and full of "" hypocrisy "" .
"" When you see the lies and disingenuousness of people in this business , and when it seems sometimes that the more you lie and cheat the more you get on , you find that difficult as a person that is fundamentally honest . ""
There were other comments that lawyers would run a red pen through , plus a boatload of expletives , but ultimately Jordan insisted that his commitment to Palace should not be in question .
"" I need to diversify , "" he said of his diversions , "" it makes me sharper . ""
Jordan was on sharp form .
He was talking a few hours after Andy Johnson signed a new contract to keep him at Selhurst Park and Jordan was savouring the coup .
Johnson scored 21 goals for Palace last season in the Premiership , including 11 penalties .
The last of these came on the final day at Charlton .
On 71 minutes Johnson put Palace 2 - 1 up ; 11 minutes later Jon Fortune equalised and Palace were relegated , one point behind West Bromwich .
Shortly after , Johnson was called up by England and said he would have to leave Palace .
Jordan erupted .
"" I signed him from Birmingham , "" Jordan , indignant , said of Johnson .
"" I met Andrew then , got on fine with him and any time we 've done a new contract it 's taken five minutes between me and him .
I 've a great rapport with his dad .
But at the end of the season Andrew was given some bad advice and when I sat down with him
I told him that if you perform for Palace
I will tell [ Sven - Goran ] Eriksson every day -
that 's why Eriksson was at the pre - season friendly against West Ham .
When was the last time Eriksson was at a pre - season friendly ? ""
With Johnson 's agent banned from Palace 's training ground , Jordan said negotiations "" took about five minutes .
Andrew said , ' Chairman , let 's get back to the Premiership . '
The contract does not provide any escape clauses for Andrew Johnson . ""
Aged 24 , Johnson has signed for five more years at Selhurst , beginning today at home to Luton Town .
That , however , means Johnson may outstay Jordan .
Having amassed £ 65 m through mobile telephones soon after turning 30 , Jordan bought Palace , then in administration , in 2000 .
Jordan 's father played briefly for the club in the 50s and though Jordan 's attitude is businesslike rather than romantic , he has ploughed in money - "" about £ 34 m of my own personal cash . ""
That can only continue for so long and , 37 soon , having mentioned his 40th birthday , where will he and Palace be then ? ""
Firmly established in the Premiership .
I 'm disappointed that we allowed an opportunity to pass last year , relegated with eight minutes to go .
We did it to ourselves .
But we are an emerging club , people have expectations of us again .
My vision for Palace is that we 'll be established in the Premiership , I will have been able to rebuild the stadium that exists and I will be able to hand it [ the club ] over to someone else .
I 've had a very eventful five years , I 've experienced managers , relegation , promotion , semi - finals , near relegations , anarchy in the club , player revolts , I 've had the lot .
But I do n't want to be a football chairman all my life ; there comes a point where you say : ' I 've done that . '
"" It sounded final until Jordan added : "" But you never know . ""
What he does know is that football fascinates .
But by last summer , even though Palace had just enjoyed a remarkable promotion under Iain Dowie , Jordan was sick of the game .
At a time when he should have been exultant , he was morose , due in no little way to the feeling his professional contact with Dowie had fractured . ""
At that time I was unhappy with my relationship with Iain .
And I told Iain , after promotion , which amazed him .
He thought I 'd be dancing on the moon .
I just think sometimes we were in a pissing competition .
Iain is a tremendous manager , a great leader and now the relationship is very different .
He knows where I come from , I do what I say I 'll do .
Iain knows now I 'm on his side .
I believe in him , I 'm a champion of him and when we are a coherent force , we 're an irresistible force .
I want to kick doors down
and I 've got a manager who can do it . ""
Jordan , Johnson and Dowie begin again today with the chairman "" re - energised "" by events at The Valley on May 15 .
"" There were some incidents with the Charlton guys which I 'm not going to go into , but they were very rude and quite happy we were relegated .
And the Charlton fans were morons .
Their time will come , as it will for their directors for the comments they made .
They enjoyed our demise , but what goes around , comes around .
I 'm steely now , I want to beat the system , prove people wrong .
I 've no one in mind really
but I like to feel that I 'm fighting the establishment .
People like me never reform , we just run out of wind .
I will never be happy . ""

Joe Meek :
Portrait of a Genius
Joe Meek was the Phil Spector of London .
In a DIY studio at his flat on Holloway Road , Meek used everything from foot stomps to pieces of cardboard to convert the sounds in his head into 60s pop songs , most famously with Telstar by the Tornadoes and Johnny Remember Me by John Leyton .
Unfortunately , he also had a temper as incendiary as Spector 's , and ended up killing his landlady and then himself .

What are you doing ?
I did n't mean to shoot her .

Mr Spector 's lawyers said the statements , made by a police officer , should be thrown out because he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms from seven prescription drugs when he talked to the police .

For ever .
As for his experimentation with early computers , soldering irons and keyboards - ' Isolation ' , ' Everything 's Gone Green ' , ' Temptation ' - it forms the foundation of what we call modern music .

Songs For Christmas is a five - disc set that began as a bit of fun .
In 2001 Stevens began recording a Christmas EP for friends and family and he 's done one every year since , 2004 excepted , when he was busy with Illinois , the second in his projected series of albums detailing every one of America 's 50 states .
It 's not as toilsome as you 'd think .
Each disc lasts about 25 minutes and has an appealing assortment of Christmas standards and Stevens originals .
It was recorded ' hastily , off the cuff , ' admits Sufjan , mainly at his Brooklyn home with friends , family and , appropriately , a Presbyterian pastor and his wife .
Stevens is oblique about his Christian faith in interviews , but it is there for all to hear in his potent , spiritual lyricism , most prominently on 2004 's striking , Blakeian Seven Swans This set , though , is motivated not so much by pious beliefs as reasons that are , perhaps , familiar to us all .
Grisly holidays with his hippyish parents and five siblings in rural Michigan left young Stevens with a pathological hatred of Christmas .
These songs are his attempt to rekindle an appreciation of the season .
The result splendidly combines piety with celebration and musical tradition with creative boldness .
When you hear the acid - dipped jig of ' Come on !
Let 's Boogey to the Elf Dance ' and ' That was the Worst Christmas Ever ! '
alongside graceful renditions of ' We Three Kings ' and ' O Come O Come Emmanuel ' , it 's clear that Stevens frequently has his tongue stuck firmly in his cheek .
The songsmith 's tonsils are perfectly suited to Christmas , possessed as they are of a spooky elegance that suits seasonal creations .
His choices of tracks helps , too .
He avoids ersatz cuts such as ' Frosty the Snowman ' on account of their inability to convey the authentic spirit of the occasion and patches each EP together with elegant instrumentals .
Better still , Stevens has a deadly streak of pre - emptive sarcasm .
Can there be a song title that better captures the fractious nature of a family Christmas than Vol III 's catty '
Did I Make You Cry on Christmas ?
( Well , You Deserved it ! ) ' ?
The earliest songs on Vol 1 and II are fun : lo - fi , twangy and sung on occasion by slightly atonal friends .
As each year passes , the tunes become more accomplished , the arrangements more complex .

2006-12-15,"Phil Spector has a lot to answer for .
He made it possible for music - obsessed men lacking a voice , looks or pop - star panache to top the charts .
If Xenomania 's efforts with Girls Aloud drive you crazy , or you quiver at the memory of Kylie 's Stock Aitken and Waterman hit

This 22-track Wall of Sound Retrospective , a twin release with Spector 's sugar - coated Christmas album , shows why : no song was too trivial for him , no lyric too inane to be transformed into a luscious mini - symphony .
There is such giddiness about this music , such euphoria in its firework displays of strings and harmonies and emphatic percussion , that it 's easy to feel overwhelmed : you can almost hear Spector defying listeners not to well up at the marriage proposal in the Crystals '
Then He Kissed Me , or during the Ronettes ' heartfelt Baby I Love You .
The CD ends with an intriguing curio : a demo of Spector himself singing Spanish Harlem , accompanied by an acoustic guitar .
The recording has a trembly beauty - but it would never have made him number one ."

Forty - odd years later , Christmas songs are no longer high - quality fare made by top artists under the aegis of top producers .

But it was as a producer that he really made his name , most famously as the man behind the "" wall of sound "" .
He worked with a string of artists including the Ronettes , the Beatles , the Righteous Brothers and Ike and Tina Turner .
His private life has seldom been without controversy - tales of his unpredictable , eccentric behaviour are legion , from gun - wielding , profanity - ladden outbursts to his later years as a recluse in the suburbs of Los Angeles .

2007-03-16,""" Phil Spector 's Pyrenees Castle "" , as the large hand - painted sign outside proclaims , is quite the rock star mansion .
Perched on a hilltop in the unglamorous Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra , the 33-room home is all turrets , whitewashed walls and terracotta tiles .
Surrounded by palms and pine trees , it commands the neighbourhood , offering an eyrie from which the reclusive rock icon could survey all around him .
For the past four years , the man behind the "" wall of sound "" production technique defined by echoing string and percussion instruments , has stayed within the walls of this 1926 castle on $ 1 m ( £ 510,000 ) bail .
But next week that all changes as the 1960s record producer goes on trial for the February 2003 killing of Lana Clarkson , a 40-year - old actor and waitress who was found dead inside the hall of the Pyrenees Castle .
The prosecution alleges that early on the morning of February 3 2003 Spector 's chauffeur Adriano DeSouza was sitting in the producer 's black Mercedes outside the Pyrenees Castle when he heard what sounded like a shot .
As the driver got out of the car to investigate , Spector apparently emerged from inside wearing a white jacket and carrying a gun .
"" I think I killed somebody , "" he is alleged to have said .
Two hours earlier Mr DeSouza had driven Spector to The House of Blues - the fourth stop of the night .
The Sunday - night tour had taken Spector to some of his regular haunts - exclusive Hollywood spots such as Dan Tana 's and Trader Vic 's - and seen him apparently enjoy a large quantity of alcohol , an allegation that will be key in his trial .
After initially refusing Spector admission to the club 's VIP area , Clarkson was told by the management to treat him "" like gold "" .
When Spector suggested a nightcap at his castle after the club closed , she agreed .
DeSouza drove Spector and Clarkson to the castle .
What happened next is known only to Spector and it is possible that he does not remember .
The chauffeur called the police , who found a lifeless Clarkson sprawled on a chair , her head tilted back .
The bottom of her mouth had been blown off and a 36-calibre Colt revolver was found under her left leg .
Spector appeared dazed , according to police reports , alternately railing against the officers and apologising for the misunderstanding .
His state could have been the result of shock , alcohol , the medication he was on or the 50,000 volts of electricity he received when police fired a Taser gun at him after he failed to remove his hands from his pockets .
In her report police officer Beatrice Rodriguez quoted Spector as saying : "" What 's wrong with you guys ?
I did n't mean to shoot her , it was an accident .
"" Spector was arrested and taken to the police station .
But 12 hours later , he was released on bail in the company of his lawyer , Robert Shapiro , a member of the defence team in the OJ Simpson trial .
He was not charged with murder until November that year .
Since then the case has lurched and stalled .
Spector seems to have taken a leaf from Michael Jackson 's book in preparing for his court appearances , sporting Cuban - heeled boots , blond Afro wigs , tinted glasses , frock coats and jewel - encrusted brooches .
Outside court , it has been difficult for the lawyers to control their client .
Spector , who in an email to friends written shortly after the shooting , had referred to Clarkson 's death as an "" accidental suicide "" , went further in an interview with Esquire magazine , claiming : "" She kissed the gun . ""
In his deposition Spector appeared erratic , with a haphazard memory for names and facts .
"" I found out I owned a lot of weapons , "" he said , when asked about the results of the police search of his castle .
Revealing that he had been taking seven prescription drugs at the time of the murder , he described his mental state as : "" No sleep , depression , mood changes ... hard to live with ... a hard time getting through life . ""
His defence team , now led by flamboyant New York attorney Bruce Cutler , who counts mafia boss John Gotti among his clients , has taken a page from the Simpson defence by trying to shift attention on to the conduct of the investigation .
The defence will suggest that there is little to tie the gun to Spector .
Unlike the other weapons in the house , the gun used to shoot Clarkson was not registered to Spector .
According to legal analysts , Cutler may choose to pursue a mental state defence , arguing that Spector was not responsible for his actions because of the combined effects of alcohol and medication , or a technical defence , asserting that Clarkson 's death resulted from the gun misfiring .
The case is the latest in California 's seemingly relentless stream of celebrity trials : from Simpson to Jackson .
But although Spector 's trial , like Simpson 's , will be televised it could also slip out of focus .
"" It is another celebrity trial , but we 've had so many that have been more notable , "" says Laurie Levenson , a Loyola Law School professor .
"" Spector is definitely on the second tier .
In any other town this would be big news , but this is Hollywood .
There 's no shortage of celebrities that are getting arrested in this town . ""
Born on December 26 1939 , Spector grew up in the Bronx to a seamstress mother and a steelworker father .
When he was nine , his father committed suicide .
The family moved to Los Angeles , and at 17 Spector wrote a song with a title taken from the inscription on his father 's grave .
He formed a band called the Teddy Bears and they recorded To Know Him is to Love Him .
Spector 's career was under way .
For four years in the early 1960s , Spector changed the sound of pop music , producing 20 top 40 hits between 1961 - 1965 , including Da Doo Ron Ron , Then He Kissed Me ,
Be My Baby , Baby ,
I Love You and
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' .
To their producer and occasional composer , the aching anthems to unrequited teen love were "" little symphonies for the kids "" .
As the 1960s ended , Spector got left behind .
As his artistic reputation foundered , so another reputation grew : that of an eccentric , unpredictable control freak , as likely to scream a string of profanities at the person nearest to him as to pull a gun on them .
He took to wearing different guns to match his outfits .
After seeing The Exorcist he wore an enormous crucifix . ""
He was n't taking any chances , "" a friend explained .
But by the time of Clarkson 's murder , according to those who knew him , Spector was going through a relatively level period .
"" I am trying to get my life reasonable , "" he told an interviewer in January 2003 .
"" I 'm not going to ever be happy .
Happiness is n't on ...
But being reasonable is an approach .
And being reasonable with yourself .
It 's very difficult , very difficult to be reasonable . ""
But if he was getting his life back together , the next month it fell apart again ."
2007-03-16,"In December 2002 , I sent the writer Mick Brown to Los Angeles to carry out the first major interview with Phil Spector in 25 years .
The headline on the piece , published on 4 February , 2003 , was ' Found : Pop 's Lost Genius ' .
Not more than 36 hours later , former B - movie actress
Lana Clarkson was shot dead in Spector 's castle .
Next week , jury selection for the Spector murder trial should finally begin ; on 2 April , Bloomsbury will publish Mick 's ' Tearing Down The Wall of Sound : The Rise and Fall of Phil Spector ' , his extraordinary new biography of the singer .
In Mick 's interview , carried out in that same sepulchral residence in the suburb of Alhambra , the legendary producer told him , ' I have devils inside that fight me .
And I 'm my own worst enemy ' , as well as
' To all intents and purposes I would say I 'm probably relatively insane , to an extent ' .
So you can imagine how he and I felt when news broke of the Clarkson murder .
( Shocked .
And : ' what a scoop ! ' , seeing as you ask . )
In fact , the thought entered Mick 's head that Spector had killed his assistant Michelle Blaine as some kind of act of retribution for her help in setting up the interview .
I was working for the Telegraph Magazine at the time ( I edit the Observer Music Monthly magazine now , in which Sean O'Hagan reviews
Tearing Down The Wall of Sound this Sunday ) and had knocked up a kind of interview wish list with Mick , who 's one of the country 's great rock writers .
Who would be the ultimate get ?
The ' Tycoon of Teen ' , in Tom Wolfe 's description , came top .
Mick had always loved Spector 's music - and then there was all that business with the guns , the crazy behaviour , the years as a virtual recluse .
This is where Starsailor will claim their place in history .
Improbably , there was news that Spector was producing a new album by the Britflop rockers .
Through following a chain that started with Starsailor 's pr , we found a route to Michelle Blaine , who to our amazement said she could meet us in London shortly .
At that meeting , I guess she scoped us out .
Shortly afterwards , the email came inviting Mick to Los Angeles .
( Even then , he was not sure the interview would ever take place - but then Spector 's chauffered Rolls turned up at his hotel to ferry him to the castle . )
Even though I was Mick 's editor for the interview ( later called ' one of the most famous interviews in rock journalism ' by Mojo magazine ) , you should believe me when I say that his book is a masterpiece of its kind .
( You can also come and hear him in discussion with me at Daunt Books on Marylebone High Street next Tuesday evening . )
I guess the question should be : who should top that interview wish list now ?
And is there any hope for Spector when his trial begins ?"
2007-03-18,"Tearing Down the Wall of Sound : The Rise and Fall of Phil Spector Mick Brown ( Bloomsbury , £ 16.99 ) 5 stars Even by the extravagant standards of contemporary celebrity gothic , Phil Spector 's fall from grace has been dramatic .
It could yet end with the man who many believe to be the world 's greatest record producer living out the rest of his life behind bars .
Spector is on bail on a murder charge after Lana Clarkson , a little - known actress was found with gunshot wounds to the mouth and head in his home in the early hours of 3 February , 2003 .
Four years on , his trial is only set to start now .
Thus Mick Brown 's riveting new book , Tearing Down the Wall of Sound , is being published without its real denouement .
It hardly matters : the tale Brown tells is so extraordinary , its subject so bizarre , that it grips from start to finish .
The book 's genesis is an odd one .
Brown was originally dispatched to Los Angeles to interview the reclusive Spector in December 2002 .
They spent several hours in conversation , each one marked by the automated voice of Spector 's talking wristwatch . '
I have devils inside me , ' Spector confessed . '
I 'm my own worst enemy ....
To all intents and purposes I would say I am probably relatively insane ... '
Just two days after his feature was published , under the headline , ' Found : Pop 's Lost Genius ' , Brown was sitting in his office when the news broke that a woman had been found dead in Spector 's house . '
For a terrible moment , ' he writes , ' a scene flashed across my mind .
Somehow , Spector had read my piece , disliked it intensely , and , in a moment of madness ... taken revenge on his assistant . '
That Brown considered this dreadful scenario a distinct possibility gives some indication of the impression that Spector made on him .
It was the same one he left on many people , even some of those who thought themselves closest to him .
No one , though , as Brown 's book attests , ever really got that close to Phil Spector .
He was born Harvey Philip Spector in the South Bronx , on 26 December 1939 ( not 1940 , as has been reported ) , a birthday he shared , as Brown dryly notes , with Mao Zedong .
Spector 's childhood was blighted by the sudden and unexplained suicide of his father when he was 10 .
The family moved to California soon afterwards , which exacerbated the boy 's already profound sense of not belonging .
Both pampered and bullied by an over - possessive mother , picked on at school , and suffering from asthma and diabetes , Spector spent an inordinate amount of his teens in his bedroom listening to the raw new music played late at night on the radio .
His first group , the Teddy Bears , in which he played guitar , was named in homage to an Elvis song , but
his real talent , it emerged , was as an architect of sound .
The group raised $ 40 to record their first single in the small Gold Star studios in Los Angeles in 1958 .
Written by the 18-year - old Spector , it was called '
To Know Him is to Love Him ' , the title a slight variation on the epitaph on his father 's gravestone .
In the studio , he meticulously created the song 's structure , the slow beginning moving into a soaring mid - section , the chorus embellished by soft , echoing vocal harmonies .
The result , though hastily assembled , still sounds oddly unearthly nearly 50 years later .
Though released as a B - side , it topped the US charts . '
The small , significant , put - upon boy had proved everyone wrong , ' writes Brown . '
Success now went to his head like helium . '
From that moment , Spector became a control freak , both inside and outside the studio ; a man for whom every ensuing pop hit would be a vindication , and yet for whom nothing - not the acclaim of the public , nor the respect of his peers , nor the amassing of great wealth - would ever banish those deep - rooted feelings of inferiority .
It is one of the great ironies of pop that Spector 's songs , those yearning , overloaded and yet often innocent - sounding , teenage anthems he constructed around the voices of the Crystals , the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers in the Sixties , were , on one deep level , acts of revenge on a world that had wounded him beyond repair as a child .
Nearly every friend and associate that Brown tracks down is willing to acknowledge Spector 's singular artistic genius , while attesting to his dreadfulness as a human being .
Paranoid , megalomaniacal and vindictive , Spector 's often spectacular lack of empathy does seem to suggest that the obsessiveness which underpinned his creativity also undermined his humanity .
His urge to control manifested itself most dramatically in his relationships with women , whom he simultaneously worshipped and utterly distrusted .
He kept his wife , Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes , locked in their mansion for weeks on end , only allowing her out for a drive when he had installed an inflatable life - size model of himself in the passenger seat .
In business , too , Spector was ruthless in the extreme .
He routinely altered the writing credits on songs he had produced to include himself , and seemed to regard the paying of royalties , like so much else , as a personal affront .
And yet , for all that , he was an undisputed genius ; pop 's first studio auteur .
Brown , long one of Britain 's most authoritative and incisive music writers , brilliantly recreates the atmosphere of camaraderie and dogged labour that went into creating Spector 's ' Wall of Sound ' , one of the key signatures of 20th - century pop music . '
Spector did not want displays of virtuosity , ' he writes , ' nor was he interested in the individual sound of the instrument , only its integral value to the sound as a whole . '
In the studio , at least for a short , golden period in the early Sixties , Spector reshaped the contours of the pop song in dramatic fashion .
He created what he called ' teen symphonies for the kids ' , but , in his head , he was competing with Beethoven and Mozart .
The coming of the Beatles signalled the beginning of the end of his reign .
In the space of a few years , the ' Wall of Sound ' had turned into a prison that kept Spector locked firmly in the pop past .
At the end of the decade , though , it was the Beatles who opened the door for his return .
He received a summons from John Lennon , who wanted him to ' rescue ' the Beatles ' flawed swan song , Let it Be .
Lennon 's decision incensed Paul McCartney .
It is hard not to see Spector 's unnecessarily baroque reworking of McCartney 's spartan and plaintive title song as a belated act of revenge .
Lennon , though , remained in awe of Spector , and , for once , the feeling was reciprocated .
The Imagine album is perhaps the one and only time that Spector collaborated with anyone in the true sense of the word .
One one level , it is the coming - together of two damaged and abandoned children who , when they were n't trying to outdo each other in the alcohol stakes , communicated on some deep , unspoken level that Spector would never find with any other artist .
Not even the shock of seeing Spector suddenly pull out a gun and fire it into the studio ceiling dented Lennon 's hero worship .
( Guns were brandished by Spector in subsequent troubled studio sessions with both Leonard Cohen , who described the atmosphere around Spector as ' post - Wagnerian ... Hitlerian ' , and with the Ramones , one of whom , the street - smart , ex - hustler , Joey , simply shrugged and dared Spector to shoot him . )
Those gunshots fired in anger , though , were auguries .
Despite years of psychoanalysis , Spector never managed to assuage his childhood demons .
In decline , like Elvis Presley , he retreated behind the sealed gates of a mansion , surrounded by an ever - changing retinue of minions .
The panoply of prescribed drugs detailed by his lawyers after his arrest is also of Presleyian proportions , but it seems to have been alcohol that really exacerbated his troubles .
Ultimately , the myth of Phil Spector - the tortured artist , the madman genius , the twisted recluse - was played out with dreadful consequences .
And , whatever the outcome of the trial , it is Lana Clarkson - and not , despite what his warped mind might tell him , Phil Spector - who is the ultimate victim of that myth .
Brown 's final chapters make for a sobering read , the clinical language of the pathologist and the police report more shocking in its detail than any of the excesses recounted previously .
In the end , Tearing Down the Wall of Sound is a remarkable book about , among other things , fame , obsession , genius , money and madness .
It paints the fullest picture yet of a man who , whether creating some of the greatest pop music of all time , or destroying the lives of those closest to him , seems to have existed in a continuous state of mental agitation .
The Phil Spector story still awaits its ending .
In the meantime , this is the definitive study of the man , and the myth that engulfed him ."
2007-03-20,"Jury selection began yesterday in the murder trial of the music producer Phil Spector four years after an actor who starred in a cult movie was shot to death in the foyer of his home .
Jurors will be asked to decide if Mr Spector was responsible for the death of Lana Clarkson , who was shot in the face in February 2003 .
They will consider conflicting evidence about what happened before police found Clarkson , 40 , slumped dead in a chair , her teeth blown out by a gunshot to her mouth .
Clarkson was best known as the star of Roger Corman 's cult film Barbarian Queen .
She was working as a hostess at the House of Blues when she went home with Mr Spector that night .
The coroner 's office called it a homicide but also noted that she had gunshot residue on both hands and may have pulled the trigger .
In an email to friends , Mr Spector , 66 , called the death "" an accidental suicide "" .
Mr Spector , who created the "" wall of sound "" that revolutionised the recording of rock music , was present as the first members of a prospective jury pool of 300 people entered the downtown courtroom .
He produced the Beatles '
Let It Be album and George Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh , and has been cited as an influence by Bruce Springsteen and countless other artists .
Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler has ordered that the trial can be televised , but cameras will not be present for jury selection which will continue today .
Most have already been prescreened by a jury commissioner .
After today 's session , lawyers will take a one - month break and the trial is expected to last three months ."
2007-04-04,"Prosecutors in the Phil Spector murder case have asked a judge to allow testimony from a former employee and one - time girlfriend who said the record producer pointed a gun at her head in two separate incidents decades ago .
In court documents filed in Los Angeles yesterday , the deputy district attorney , Alan Jackson , said the testimony demonstrated a "" long history of gun - related violence directed at women "" and should be admitted as evidence during Mr Spector 's upcoming trial on charges of killing the actor Lana Clarkson in February 2003 .
Mr Spector has pleaded not guilty and has been free on $ 1 m ( £ 500,000 ) bail since his arrest .
If convicted , he could face life in prison .
Devra Robitaille , who worked at Warner Spector Records from 1974 to 1977 , told investigators that one night Mr Spector placed a shotgun or rifle against her forehead when she tried to leave the producer 's home after a party . ""
Spector , who was drunk , made some sort of joke and then said : ' Just so you know , I 'll blow your [ expletive ] head off ' or ' If you try to leave , I 'll blow your [ expletive ] brains out , ' "" according to the court documents .
Ms Robitaille told Mr Spector to "" knock that off and put that away "" , and he eventually let her leave .
A similar incident occurred a decade later when , she claims , Mr Spector again put a gun to her head in the foyer of his home after a night of drinking .
At the time , Ms Robitaille had taken a job as Mr Spector 's part - time assistant .
Prosecutors plan to present testimony from four other women who claim the music producer threatened them with a gun .
In a separate motion , prosecutors also asked the court to admit into evidence a conversation Mr Spector reportedly had with a retired New York police officer at a holiday party at the home of the comic Joan Rivers in 1995 or 1996 .
Vince Tannazzo , who was working security at the party , said he was asked to escort Mr Spector out after a commotion .
While they were leaving , Mr Tannazzo said Mr Spector made numerous profane , disparaging and threatening remarks about women , according to the court filing .
"" They all deserve to die .
They all deserve a bullet in their [ expletive ] head , "" Mr Tannazzo quoted Mr Spector as saying .
"" That 's why I got permits for all over .
Wherever I go , I always keep a gun , because these [ expletive ] , they 're all no [ expletive ] good . ""
Mr Tannazzo told authorities a similar episode occurred at the same party the following year .
Prosecutors allege Mr Spector - creator of the "" Wall of Sound "" that revolutionised the recording of rock music - shot Ms Clarkson to death in the foyer of his home .
She was working as a hostess at the House of Blues on Sunset Boulevard , LA , when she went home with Mr Spector that night , authorities said .
Jury selection was scheduled to resume on April 16 ."
2007-04-20,"A jury of nine men and three women have been selected in the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector , but a required panel of six alternates is still to be decided .
The 12 jurors were sworn in yesterday at LA Superior Court , and judge Larry Paul Fidler ordered that proceedings commence Monday .
The jurors were selected from over 100 candidates , many of whom were dismissed because they expressed bias over whether Spector is guilty or not .
One candidate was excused because she admitted she believed Spector guilty and did not think her opinion would change .
"" I understand the rules , I just do n't think I can , "" she told the judge .
The final twelve consist of several county employees , one network TV producer and two engineers .
All completed questionnaires before they were selected and were found to be satisfactorily neutral in their opinions on the trial .
Lana Clarkson , a 40-year - old actress , was found dead by a single guns shot wound at Spector 's LA mansion in February 2003 .
The prosecution allege the music producer shot Clarkson when she tried to leave his house .
Spector denies murder and claims the wounds were self - inflicted .

His fascinating descriptions of the producer at work support the thesis that he is an artist .
He also paints a vivid portrait of a truly unpleasant man .

The term "" record producer "" was largely invented by him , as was a revolutionary approach to working in the studio .
Spector 's self - aggrandising pomposity makes for queasy reading , but his readiness to compare himself to Mozart and Wagner has a glimmer of plausibility .
The steady progress of multi - track and digital recording techniques has lured the pop music industry into ever greater levels of "" perfection "" through the ability to isolate - and thereby correct , replace or doctor - each instrument and voice .
Only classical recording continues to treat the orchestra as a unit , filling the room with a live performance and recording the irrevocably blended results .
Spector used pop chamber orchestras : three pianos , five guitars , two bass players , plus drums and percussion , all moved painstakingly around Gold Star Studios in Hollywood until the right balance and aesthetic placements were achieved .
Modern producers are terrified of the "" leak "" between microphones that built the Wall of Sound , and their records sound small by comparison .
Just as his success was crowned by "" You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling "" , his time was over .
The Brill Building pop of which he was the master was trumped first by the Beatles , then Dylan .
How could he cope in an era of singers who wrote their own songs , made their own arrangements and demanded control over their recordings ?
His brilliant riposte - paying Ike Turner to get lost while he recorded Tina 's monumental "" River Deep , Mountain High "" - failed to dent the US charts .
Bitter and increasingly marginalised , Spector 's career seemed finished .
Enter Allen Klein , the hustling accountant hired on a whim by John Lennon to look after Beatle business in the wake of Brian Epstein 's death .
Klein summoned Spector to rescue the group 's chaotic final recording session .
His work on
Let It Be earned him the undying admiration of Lennon ( for whom he also produced Imagine ) and George Harrison ( ditto "" My Sweet Lord "" ) , while the syrupy strings added to "" The Long and Winding Road "" made an enemy out of Paul McCartney .
The fact that his increasingly bizarre behaviour made it impossible for any artist - barring Lennon - to work with him did n't alter his brilliance .
His few unreleased tracks with Celine Dion are apparently astounding but Spector inevitably clashed with Sony 's modern major - label A&amp;R man and Dion 's manager / husband , who shared the new - fangled notion that a producer is the artist 's employee .
One classic analysis of the creative ( typically male ) personality suggests that emotional blockage in personal relations channels energy into the oeuvre .
Spector certainly had the requisite difficult childhood .
His parents , both Jewish immigrants to New York ( and probably cousins ) , had an unhappy marriage .
In 1949 his father killed himself , a blow from which Phil , his mother and sister never seem to have recovered .
( Brown 's descriptions of "" Mother Bertha 's "" non - stop raging and shouting tempts one with the thought that a carbon monoxide - filled sedan might have seemed a preferable alternative to returning home for dinner . )
Desperate for a fresh start , Mrs Spector took her family to California in 1953 .
Spector was small and weedy , the perfect face for bronzed Californian Supermen to kick sand in .
His discovery of the guitar rescued him from ignominy , but never removed his fear of being belittled , ignored or abandoned .
Soon he was singing and composing , often using popular kids from LA 's Fairfax High School as proxy voices and looks .
Despite a terror of flying , he commuted between New York and Los Angeles , hustling in the former and recording in the latter .
Established music business figures recognised his talent and offered opportunities , partnerships and finance ; he betrayed them almost to a man .
As his success waned , he settled in LA .
There he could imprison wives and girlfriends in mansions in the hills , prowl Sunset Boulevard in chauffeur - driven limos seeking worshippers and girls , and use the desperation of the star - struck to bring a steady stream of visitors and petitioners to his doors .
Brown 's concise descriptions of the bit - players in this sordid drama include his best writing , and the longer passages about the late Lana Clarkson are his most moving .
Clarkson , like Spector , arrived in southern California as a teenager .
Her voluptuous beauty opened doors but her triumphs were small : a cult - heroine status in Roger Corman B - movies , including a final starring role in Vice Girls ( "" three beauteous vice cops go undercover as porno actresses "" ) in which she delivered the immortal line : "" You 're obedient , I like that in a sex slave . ""
Spector may have arrived rapidly at the pinnacle of his chosen field , but still requires huge lifts on his shoes and ridiculous wigs to insulate him from the pain of being the nerdy guy at Fairfax High who never got the girl .
They met by accident as she was finishing a shift as a hostess at the House of Blues .
She was , by all reports , an intelligent , charming and admirable woman , doing volunteer work for an Aids charity and beloved by her many friends .
But the Hollywood dream had never died in her ; she wanted connections in her new career as a stand - up comedian and Spector wanted company . ""
Just one drink "" she said , and , unlike so many other nocturnal visitors to Spector 's Alhambra castle , she apparently meant it .
A bullet from a gun placed in her mouth shattered her skull .
Spector claims she killed herself .
The American dream ends at the California shoreline .
No more Indians to kill , no more land to conquer .
For centuries , Europeans with a problem went west .
Their descendants continue to up stakes and follow the sunset when things get tricky .
Dreams that die on the shores of the Pacific can lead to desperate lives and tragedies as sordid as this one . ·
Joe Boyd 's White Bicycles : Making Music in the 1960s is published by Serpent 's Tail"
2007-04-25,"More than four years after an actress and part - time waitress was found dead of gunshot wounds in the lobby of his palatial home , the legendary 1960s record producer Phil Spector was today described as "" sinister and deadly "" on the first day of his trial in Los Angeles .
The spartan courtroom offered a stark contrast to the opulence of Mr Spector 's own lifestyle .
The latest defendant in the city 's procession of celebrity trials took his place at 10.05am under fluorescent lights on the ninth floor of a nondescript courthouse in downtown Los Angeles .
The click of his heels heralded his arrival in the courtroom .
Taking a lesson from Michael Jackson , Mr Spector , 62 , wore an off - white frock coat over a matching waistcoat and open - necked purple shirt .
In his opening statement , deputy district attorney Alan Jackson addressed the jury , describing Mr Spector as someone "" who , when he 's confronted with the right circumstances , when he 's confronted with the right situations , turns sinister and deadly "" . ""
The evidence is going to paint a picture of a man , who on February 3 2003 , put a loaded pistol in Lana Clarkson 's mouth - inside her mouth - and shot her to death . ""
Mr Spector pleads not guilty .
Mr Spector , standing to face the jury as they took their seats , appeared nervous and grey - faced .
Seated behind the defendant was his 26-year - old wife Rachelle and family members of Lana Clarkson , the woman found dead in his house .
The trial stems from the events on a February morning a little over four years ago .
In the early hours of Monday February 3 2003 , Mr Spector 's fill - in chauffeur Adriano DeSouza was sitting in the producer 's black Mercedes S430 outside Mr Spector 's home , the grandly named Pyrenees Castle , when he heard what sounded like a shot .
As the driver got out of the car to investigate , Mr Spector emerged from inside wearing a white jacket and carrying a gun .
"" I think I killed somebody , "" he said .
What happened next is known only to one person , Mr Spector , and it is quite possible that he does n't really remember .
When police , called by the driver , entered the mansion they found a lifeless Clarkson sprawled on a chair , her head tilted back , the bottom of her mouth blown off and a blue steel 36-calibre Colt revolver under her left leg .
In the gun were five live cartridges ; under the hammer was a spent cartridge .
Mr Spector appeared dazed , according to police reports , alternately railing against the officers and apologising for the misunderstanding .
His state could have been the result of shock , alcohol , the medication he was on or the 50,000 volts of electricity he received when police Tasered him after he allegedly failed to remove his hands from his pockets .
"" What 's wrong with you guys , "" officer Beatrice Rodriguez quoted Mr Spector as saying in her hand - written report , filed later that day .
"" I did n't mean to shoot her , it was an accident . ""
Mr Spector was arrested and taken to the local police station .
But 12 hours later , he was released on bail in the company of his lawyer , Robert Shapiro , a former member of the Simpson defence team .
He was not charged until November that year when he was presented with the charge sheet at the Alhambra courthouse : "" The crime of MURDER ... a felony , was committed by PHILLIP HARVEY SPECTOR , who did unlawfully and with malice aforethought murder
LANA CLARKSON , a human being , "" it read .
Mr Spector and Clarkson had met just a few hours earlier at the House of Blues nightclub , where she had recently started work as a hostess .
The House of Blues was the fourth stop of the night for the 62-year - old Mr Spector , and Clarkson was his third partner of the evening .
After initially refusing Mr Spector admission to the club 's VIP area , Clarkson was told by the management to treat him "" like gold "" .
When Mr Spector suggested a nightcap at his castle after the club closed , she agreed .
The trial , the latest in Los Angeles ' diet of celebrity justice , is expected to last two months .
Judge Larry Fidler , a strong advocate of judicial openness , has allowed cameras into the courtroom , which could serve to increase the level of interest around the case .
But Mr Spector is not OJ , or Michael Jackson .
His fame largely rests with those in the music business and those from another era .
To today 's young music fans , Phil Spector and the Wall of Sound carry little weight .
Nevertheless , the trial promises to generate considerable interest .
Like Jackson , in some respects
Mr Spector remains more popular in Britain than in the US .
As much of his music found a British audience before capturing the ears of Americans , so his legacy has endured in the UK .
Jury selection in the case took a week , with the final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates finally selected on Tuesday .
The nine - man , three - woman jury includes a fair cross - section of Los Angeles life .
Two members of the panel work for a TV company , one of them a producer who has worked for NBC on both the Jackson and OJ trials .
He has also researched the Spector case for the channel , but promised to bring a fair mind to the deliberations .
Another is a senior executive with a film company , a third a clerk at the court where the trial is being held .
The jury will hear from Mr Spector 's defence counsel , Bruce Cutler , who brings a reputation as a brash New Yorker , famous for his work on behalf of alleged mob capo John Gotti .
The trial , in the same courthouse where OJ Simpson was tried , is expected last at least two months ."

Describing the moment when Mr Spector entered the House of Blues , where she worked as a hostess , Mr Jackson said : "" That was the time when Lana Clarkson would meet her killer for the first time . ""
Mr Jackson promised to introduce testimony showing that Mr Spector had a history of threatening women with guns , but Mr Cutler dismissed this suggestion , arguing it involved "" tall tales "" , and that the present charges Mr Spector faced were the product of the record producer 's success . ""
Fame and success comes back to haunt you , "" he told the jury .
The outcome could hinge on the testimony of Mr Spector 's driver on the night , Adriano de Souza .
Mr De Souza says that he heard the shot and saw Mr Spector emerge from the house carrying a gun to declare , "" I think I killed somebody . ""

Mr Cutler suggested that the defence will attempt to discredit Mr de Souza , questioning his immigration status , his command of English and his attitude toward Mr Spector .
But the defence was dealt a serious blow during proceedings when the judge ruled that a key part of its case - statements made by Mr Spector to police officers after his arrest - was inadmissible , because it had not been introduced by the prosecution .
Mr Cutler told the judge : "" I feel like my pants are down

Mr Jackson is to introduce testimony from female witnesses which will seek to show that Mr Spector had a history of threatening women with guns .
Those witnesses will include a personal manager for Joan Rivers , a professional photographer of rock stars , a personal assistant who worked for Spector and a woman Spector dated .
Spector 's lawyers contested the judge 's decision to allow the testimony , claiming it was a "" large hurdle "" for his team to surmount , saying the evidence would be "" very salacious and seductive "" and would distract the jury .

When she met Spector at the House of Blues on Sunset Strip , she had been working as a hostess ."
2007-04-27,"Phil Spector , the legendary 1960s music producer on trial for the murder of actress Lana Clarkson , threatened a former girlfriend with a revolver and a shotgun , the court heard yesterday during the second day of the case .
Dorothy Melvin , a former manager for the television personality Joan Rivers , was the first of what is expected to be a succession of female witnesses who will testify that Mr Spector threatened them with guns .
The court also heard yesterday that hours before her death from a single gunshot wound to the mouth , Clarkson watched a recording of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye , a James Cagney film about a psychopath who corrupts those around him .
The two watched the film as they were driven from the House of Blues , where Clarkson worked as a hostess , to Phil Spector 's Pyrenees castle , his opulent home in Alhambra , near downtown Los Angeles .
Ms Melvin described the 1993 encounter at Mr Spector 's then home in Pasadena , California .
Ms Melvin , who had a "" casual romance "" with Mr Spector over two or three years , said she had felt "" real terror "" . ""
He was pointing the gun at me , "" she said .
"" He took his right hand and smacked me on the side of the head .
At that point I knew I was in real trouble , I was terrified . ""
After ordering her to take off her clothes and accusing her of stealing , Mr Spector told her to leave the house .
But the gate to his property would not open for her car .
She said : "" I looked in my side - view mirror and saw Phil coming down
and then I heard the pump of a shotgun . ""
Ms Melvin returned to the property with police , and agreed not to press charges once her handbag was returned .
In earlier proceedings , the defence completed its opening statements by arguing that it would introduce evidence to show that Clarkson had been holding the gun when the fatal shot was fired .
Mr Spector 's lawyers also said evidence would show that Mr Spector had not loaded the gun , but the cartridge cases retrieved from the weapon bore the DNA of Clarkson and another person .
The implication is that Clarkson loaded the weapon herself .
The defence argues that Clarkson died from a "" classic self - inflicted gunshot wound "" .
Mr Spector 's lead lawyer , Bruce Cutler , told the court on the first day of the trial that Clarkson had been "" playing with guns in a provocative and salacious manner "" on the night of her death .
Defence lawyer Linda Kenney - Baden said forensic evidence showed Mr Spector was not near Clarkson when the shot was fired , countering the prosecution 's contention that bloodstains on his jacket showed he was within three feet of her .
Ms Kenney - Baden said flesh tissue on the cuff buttons of Clarkson 's jacket showed that she had fired the shot .
"" For the tissue to be on the buttons , she had to have her hand in the classic gun - holding position , "" she told the court .
The defence also promised to introduce evidence showing that Clarkson 's body had been moved but not by Mr Spector .
Clarkson was found slumped in a chair in the lobby of Mr Spector 's home , with the gun under her left calf .
The prosecution had been expected to argue that Mr Spector placed the weapon there , but crime scene photographs introduced by the defence show a cable from a Taser used to subdue Mr Spector under Clarkson 's foot , proving that her body was moved after Mr Spector was taken into custody .
Mr Cutler returned to the contention that Clarkson was unstable , and suggested the defence might argue that the .38 calibre revolver that killed Clarkson was mistaken for a starting pistol also found in Mr Spector 's home .
"" Whatever she was doing , however she felt , she took her life .
Unfortunately .
Much too young .
This was a unique incident , an accident , not at the hands of Phil Spector . ""
Mr Cutler denied that Mr Spector 's alleged threatening of women constituted a pattern of behaviour , calling the alleged incidents "" isolated spats over the course of 20 years "" .
He said the women sought out Mr Spector , who Mr Cutler described as a "" true romantic "" , and dismissed the allegations as "" tall tales "" .
When court resumes on Monday , testimony is expected from Stephanie Jennings , a freelance photographer who has alleged that Mr Spector threatened her with a gun at the Carlyle Hotel in New York ."
2007-04-28,"There is something unnerving about being on the receiving end of Phil Spector 's reptilian gaze .
His tiny black pupils stare out at the events unfolding around him in courtroom 9 - 313 .
Occasionally his mouth opens and shuts .
Now and then his tongue flicks out , perhaps a reflex reaction to a passing insect .
All this is normal , the product of medication - like the well - reported handshake - or years of living in seclusion , his tics allowed to develop untamed .
But the gaze is something else .
Cold and unfaltering it hones in on anyone Spector thinks might be talking about him .
Which , given the circumstances , is just about everyone .
At every opportunity , Spector swivels around in his seat at court to face the court of public opinion - ie , the media - seated behind him .
In front of the media sit the family of the woman he is accused of murdering , so Spector has to look through them to find us .
But it is the media Spector wants to stare and scare .
Is it the gaze of a killer ?
Is this the dark side of crazy Phil ?
Or is it the gaze of the bewildered victim ,
the image Spector presents most of the time during his public moments .
In this , Spector has learned well from Michael Jackson .
Both celebrity defendants perfected the medicated shuffle , the nonplussed "" What - am - I doing - here ? "" body language - although Jackson , it should be remembered , avoided eye contact with everyone .
Spector , like Jackson , is escorted by bulky bodyguards as he makes his way into court .
Where Jackson lent on the arm of his mother , his father , his sister and , failing that , his lawyer , Spector is borne on the arm of his improbable wife , 26-year - old Rachelle .
Spector has also borrowed from Jackson 's wardrobe , possibly quite literally .
The frock coat look is obviously the celebrity defendant mode du jour , although Spector has thankfully been free of the baubles and pilfered medals Jackson pinned to himself .
There is one difference in their dress : the diminutive Spector , unlike the surprisingly lanky Jackson , has click - clacked his way into court each day in low - heeled booties .
Jacko preferred his slippers .
Which brings us to the hair .
Or lack of it .
The truth of what exactly was on top of Michael Jackson 's head was never fully revealed .
But several weeks of staring at the back of his head in court convinced me that , whatever it was , it was not human , at least not as we know it .
Spector , in what could be a rare moment of sanity , has gone for the blonde - streaked pageboy bob look .
Whatever , as long as he sticks to blonde , he 's safe .
It may look like a crazy hairdo to the casual viewer , but there are some seriously frazzled blonde hairdos in that courtroom , notably defence attorney Linda Kenney - Baden 's multi - stage peroxide trauma .
( Her husband 's big in forensics , so he can sort it out . )
So , Phil Spector - crazy hair , crazy stare , crazy guy , you may say .
But crazy Phil is n't the craziest guy in the courtroom .
Oh no .
That honour , at least on the showing of the first two days , goes to lead defence attorney Bruce Cutler .
Imagine Brando playing Perry Mason reciting Shakespeare and you are some way to appreciating the unmitigated hamminess of Cutler 's delivery . ""
God save the Queen !
"" he declares to the British press as he enters the court each morning , in one of his more restrained moments .
Delivering his opening statement to the jury , he was the model of dramatic insincerity . ""
Murder on their mind !
"" he hollered several times , shaking his hands in the air like a man possessed .
He grips his head in both hands , massages his scalp in little circles , delivers points with one hand perched daintily on his hip , bends at the waist for emphasis , his tight - fitting mob lawyer 's suit straining to contain his bulldog frame .
No rhetorical flourish is left unturned .
Will it work ?
On the basis of his opening statement , Cutler - a New Yorker and proud of it - looks like a liability .
His lack of familiarity with California law left him stripped of much of his opening statement - "" I feel like my pants are down
and I 'm naked before the court "" - and his apparent , or perhaps assumed , lack of sympathy for the state must surely leave him at a disadvantage with the jury of 12 Californians .
"" Out here , "" he told the jury , "" the insatiable appetite for news about famous people "" often means that "" fiction becomes fact "" .
Moments later he noted that , "" If we were in another place ... we would n't be here , "" which has a semantic logic all its own .
Cutler ended his oration by thanking the court , the jury , the judge , the court staff , the police - in fact everyone but the media - for welcoming him , "" a stranger "" , to this "" new and different place "" .
Whether California is ready for his trademark Brucifications , we will find out next week ."
2007-04-28,"Along with swinging by for a nightcap at Phil Spector 's pad , or being a paparazzo near Hugh Grant , I could n't think of anything more painful : would I stand in the district elections ?
Double - glazing salesmen have met more encouragement .
But then I made the mistake of asking why they wanted me to stand . '
Because other than labradors and Polish au - pairs , you are the only non - Tory between Sevenoaks and Tonbridge .
We 've tried everybody . '
Crushing , but galvanising .
On Thursday , many will be denied a competitive election .
At least my patch could be hard fought .
Well , fought .
So here I stand - still , just - in one of the safest Tory wards , in one of the safest Tory seats .
I 'm running - staggering ?
- as a Lib Dem .
My Kentish parish of Penshurst , Chiddingstone and Fordcombe is famed for its beauty , not its radicalism .
Still , I 'm guaranteed second place .
For even if my wife carries out her threat not to vote for me , I shall have one vote ( mine ) , one more than Labour , which is n't standing .
This has been my most excruciating experience , up there with my daughter making me sit through The Jungle Book with a raging hangover and interviewing Mel C.
It has also been my most educational .
As I earn a living giving MPs of all hues a hearty kicking , I feel chastened .
The public snipes at MPs , but maybe real politicos should sometimes give both barrels back .
Why not shout at the door - slammers : ' How do you contribute to our politics ? '
An MP emailed : ' Councillor Gerard : let 's lunch when it 's over , so I can ask you one question : do you still believe in democracy ? '
Hah !
Of course I do .
Then I went canvassing and met the great British public .
Or , rather , its dogs .
Several should be in zoos .
And they are welcoming compared to some owners .
Mention
Lib Demery and they back off in case
it 's contagious . '
Look , ' I want to holler , ' this is n't how I get my jollies .
Do you like your dodgy council ?
I 've already [ foolishly ] pledged not to claim expenses if elected .
I 'm doing this for you , you ... grrrr ! '
Instead , I compliment them on their begonias and this stuns them into politeness .
I left one bridge - playing lady , who had called me a Bolshevik , two sherries to the good and with the hint of a vote .
But I 've seen the unthinkingness of privilege - and it is n't pretty .
There is a breed of Tory that is so superior - with so little to be superior about .
Brave resistance fighters sidle up : ' Do n't worry , you have my vote : we are n't all Tories . '
But they do so furtively , as if the Lib Dems were a proscribed organisation .
People state that the Tory is ' taking over ' from the last one , ignoring the pesky matter of an election .
Still , my helper , Chris , was greeted by an attractive woman in lingerie .
Further , she was an intelligent Observer reader , and even that did n't put her off . '
Yep , ' she purred , ' Jasper has my vote . '
Chris ran to break the news that I actually had a pledge , but I was tied up with an old boy demanding : ' And how will you rid us of UFOS ? '
Er , take it up with the refuse department ?
And there has been friendliness .
I called on Sandy Gall , war reporter and champion of the Kalahari bushmen . '
Ah , Jasper , ' smiled his wife , Eleanor . '
Wine ? '
My kind of constituents .
It felt impertinent to ask a journalistic hero for his vote , but I weaved home hopefully .
If only elections were determined by the intelligence of voters , not their number .
Do I still believe in democracy ?
When a Penelope Keith manque almost set dogs on me , I wavered .
Then I visited an ex - council estate and met pensioners terrified the cottage hospital might close .

The visit restored my faith and my fire - I 'm going to lose , for them .
Sorry side of celebrity apologies Tony Blair introduced us to the art of tactical apologies for things he could n't help , like the Irish potato famine and his general inability to run the country .
Everything , really , but the disaster he could have helped : Iraq .
Now celebrities are catching the tactical mea culpa bug : Richard Gere and Alec Baldwin have both grovelled for their bad behaviour .
But surely the entire point of being famous is you are expected to be so wrapped up in your finger - clicking , lip - curling , arse - kicking cussedness
you do n't do sorry .
If you hurl your Jimmy Choos in the face of your Filipino maid , you sack the maid for hurting your shoes .
The more monstrous you are , the more fans simper : '
Oh gee , you are sooo great . '
Take Iggy Pop : he spits on his fans and they thank him .
Work that out .
So why are Gere and Baldwin letting the side down ?
Gere is a Hollywood star who kissed Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty who cavorts on screen in revealing clothes .
Gere 's main crime , to Indian protesters , seems to be being white .
Why say sorry to racists ?
Baldwin will win no father - of - the - year prize after calling his daughter a ' thoughtless little pig ' , but did he need to tell her he is sorry on national television ?
Would n't a phone call have sufficed ?
Sorry seems the easiest word , particularly when it is n't meant .
Take a leaf out of that book , Dave David Cameron 's spinners are almost too good .
When the Tory leader posed on a tube train , helpfully fumigated of state - school - educated people , he was shown ' reading ' On Chesil Beach , the new novel by Ian McEwan .
One wonders whether the novel made Dave ponder : the story of a great seduction , beautiful and exciting , but ending in premature ejaculation , rejection and years in the wilderness .
But the most striking aspect of McEwan 's story is the reminder that in the early Sixties , earnest peace campaigning was so ubiquitous among thoughtful people .
With 750,000 Iraqis dead , will it prompt Dave to wonder where all the peaceniks went ?
For it is ironic that there were so many when they were wrong and now they are right
, you rarely see them .
But then , when the leader of the opposition 's only objection to the war was that we did n't bomb soon enough , quelle surprise ?
Mind the gap - in the political debate .
Spare us the avocado bravado

Yep , the union that represents my fine and upstanding trade has decided to order its members to boycott all goods from that country .

Meanwhile , NUJ stewards mooch around at safe London seminars engaged in GCSE group think .
Anyone who disagrees will probably be taken out and pelted with guacamole .
Dear reader , I abhor Israel 's treatment of Palestinians , but how can we trust the words of hacks that concur with a union that seeks to silence the dissenting voice ?
We must hope other countries do n't fall below the standards demanded by my upstanding trade or hacks could be asked to boycott French wine and Colombian marching powder .

2007-05-03,"The murder trial of Phil Spector took a potentially significant twist last night after a surprise witness told the court that a lawyer representing the legendary producer had removed evidence from the crime scene .
Greg Diamond , a clerk who worked for Spector 's original defence lawyer Robert Shapiro , testified in a special hearing held without the jury that , one day after actress
Lana Clarkson was shot to death at Spector 's mansion in 2003 , he watched another lawyer , Sarah Kaplan , retrieve a small piece of tooth or fingernail that had been overlooked by police from Spector 's foyer .
However , a former member of the Spector defence who Diamond alleges held the evidence that day , forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden , denied Diamond 's account when it was his turn on the witness stand .
The prosecution has levelled charges of withholding evidence at Spector 's defence team in the past , but the allegedly missing evidence has never turned up .
Spector has changed legal teams twice since his arrest , and Diamond 's testimony was given without a jury after the trial proper was suspended due to the ill health of the current lead defense attorney , Bruce Cutler .
Judge Larry Paul Fidler convened the special hearing because Diamond had come forward to authorities in the past few weeks with his account .
Diamond was reluctant to testify , repeatedly trying to assert his rights against self - incrimination and asking for a postponement of the hearing .
Ordered to take the stand by Fidler , Diamond told the court that he went to the crime scene with Shapiro , Baden , Kaplan , famed forensic scientist Henry Lee and other members of Spector 's defence team .
There , Diamond said , he saw Kaplan find a small white object and hand it to Baden .
He said the object was then passed around to the rest of the defence team . ""
Dr. Baden did make mention of what the item was , "" Diamond said .
"" He said it was a fragment of a tooth ...
Everyone had seen the item in some capacity . ""
Baden , called to the stand by Spector 's lawyers , denied that Kaplan ever found anything at the crime scene or handed him any potential item of evidence .
In 2004 , prosecutors filed a motion demanding that Spector 's lawyers turn over a piece of Clarkson 's fingernail that they believed had been found by the defense at the crime scene .
Spector 's attorneys responded at the time that no such evidence existed .
Diamond is expected to resume his testimony today , followed by additional witnesses .
It was not immediately clear when Fidler would make findings in the matter ."
2007-05-05,"Tearing Down the Wall of Sound : The Rise and Fall of Phil Spector by Mick Brown .
Bloomsbury £ 18.99 , pp502 Phil Spector broke a 25-year silence to talk to journalist Mick Brown about his stunning career , his mercurial rise as founding member of the original teen band , the Teddy Bears , to being the most successful record producer of the Sixties .
Justly celebrated as the creator of the ' Wall of Sound ' , his famously unstable relationships with stars like George Harrison and John Lennon often overshadowed his achievements . '
I 've been a very tortured soul , ' said Spector . '
I have not been happy .
I have devils that fight me . '
A few months after the interview , Spector was arrested for the murder of Lana Clarkson , for which he is standing trial .
A teetotaller for much of his life , Spector 's descent into drugs and drink led an increasingly imbalanced talent to withdraw from the mainstream until he became a virtual recluse .
As he repeated to Brown throughout his dramatic interview : ' I only wanted to be a reasonable man . '
The simplicity of his deepest desire is at odds with Brown 's fascinating portrait of a man possessed ."
2007-05-08,"The murder trial of Phil Spector heard yesterday from a second woman who alleged that the veteran music producer once held her at gunpoint at his home .
Diane Ogden , a music industry talent coordinator , said that Spector , who was usually "" funny and a gentleman "" , had said he was going to "" blow her brains out "" one night in 1989 after a party at his Pasadena home . ""
He was screaming at me , the F - word , "" she said .
"" He was n't my Phil , not the man I loved .
It was n't him .
He was demonic .
It scared the hell out of me .
He said he was going to blow my brains out .
That was n't romantic to me . ""
Ms Ogden told how Spector had used a remote control to lock the doors to his mansion to prevent her leaving , then picked up a rifle , followed by a pistol , which he pressed into her face . ""
He did n't have a rifle anymore , "" she told the jury between sips of water . ""
He had a gun , a pistol , pointed into my face . ""
She showed the jury how he had pressed the barrel of the gun into her cheek , forehead and her nose .
"" I said , ' Phillip , please let me go .
Put the gun down ' , "" she said .
He then forced her at gunpoint to go upstairs to his bedroom , where , in the words of prosecutors , he tried to be "" intimate "" with her . ""
He did it by gunpoint , "" Ms Ogden said , "" he wanted to rape me . ""
The next morning Spector was singing in the shower as if nothing had happened , she told the court .
She said she had not reported Spector to the authorities , and was only testifying at the trial because she had been subpoenaed .
"" I still cared about him .
I thought if he was n't drinking that would n't have happened .
I forgave him , "" she said .
An earlier witness in the trial , Dorothy Melvin , told a similar story , with Spector allegedly pulling a gun on her and ordering her to remove her clothing .
The court yesterday heard phone messages left by Spector on Melvin 's voicemail shortly after the incident occurred , in which he appeared to threaten her . ""
Be careful what you say to me because nothing you say is worth your life , "" he said .
Spector is on trial for the second degree murder of Lana Clarkson , who was found dead in his home of a single gunshot wound to the head in February 2003 ."
2007-05-10,"Two more women have testified at the trial of Phil Spector that he threatened them with guns , characterising the music producer as a dual personality who could quickly switch from being charming to threatening .
Their testimony in the murder trial yesterday brought to four the number of women called by the prosecution to describe a pattern of threats with guns before the 2003 death of the actress Lana Clarkson .
She was killed by a shot fired from a gun in her mouth after she went home with Spector from her job at a nightclub . ""
He walked up , held the gun to my face between my eyes and said , ' If you try to leave I 'm going to kill you , "" ' Melissa Grosvenor told a court in Los Angeles .
Ms Grosvenor said she met Spector in New York in 1991 when she was a waitress .
She said she found him "" very charming , quick - witted "" and had a platonic relationship with him for a year and a half .
After a dinner in Beverly Hills
she said she went back to Spector 's house .
When she told him around 2 am that she was tired and wanted to go home , he left the room and returned with a gun .
"" I was afraid .
There was no doubt in my mind if I tried to leave he was going to kill me , "" Ms Grosvenor said .
She said he put the gun in a holster and "" started walking back and forth , cursing and talking crazy "" .
Ms Grosvenor said that after the confrontation she fell asleep and the next day Spector did not talk about it .
After returning to New York he started asking her out , but when she declined , he left messages , such as , "" I 've got machine guns and I know where you live "" .
On cross - examination , Ms Grosvenor acknowledged she was convicted of embezzlement in Georgia and later lied on an employment application when asked about a criminal history .
Earlier , the music industry photographer Stephanie Jennings testified that Spector threatened her with a gun and held her hostage in a hotel room , forcing her to make an emergency call to the police .
Ms Jennings said she and Spector developed a long - distance relationship in 1994 , and the following year she joined him for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions in New York , where Spector got her a room on his floor of the Carlyle hotel .
She confirmed under questioning that she knew the hotel reserved the suite for Spector or for Princess Diana .
She described being at a party where , after playing the piano and singing with such luminaries as Stevie Wonder , Spector became "" extremely drunk , obnoxious "" .
She said she went back to her room and slept until a bodyguard knocked on the door and told her Spector wanted her in his room .
When she refused , Spector showed up drunk , she said , and in a growing argument he slapped or pushed her , causing her to fall on the toilet .
She said she grabbed Spector , who fell into the bathtub .
Spector left , returned with a gun , put a chair in front of the door "" and said I was n't going anywhere "" , she said .
Officers responding to an emergency call treated her "" as if I was a call girl "" , said Ms Jennings , who did not press charges .
On cross - examination , the defence lawyer Roger Rosen suggested Ms Jennings was not as scared as she contended and confronted her with statements she made to detectives in 2004 .
Spector , 67 , rose to fame in the 1960s and 70s , changing rock music with what became known as the "" wall of sound "" recording technique .
Clarkson , who was a hostess at the House of Blues when she met Spector , was best known for a 1980s role in Roger Corman 's Barbarian Queen ."
2007-05-11,"A friend of the veteran music producer Phil Spector testified that he "" was not his usual self "" during a dinner date hours before the actress Lana Clarkson was shot dead at his mansion .
Rommie Davis told Mr Spector 's murder trial yesterday that she was concerned about his behaviour during the dinner because he was drinking and taking medication , which she described as a "" lethal combination "" .
After the dinner , Mr Spector met Ms Clarkson , a hostess , at a nightclub and asked her to go home with him .
She was found dead with a gunshot wound to her mouth early on February 3 2003 .
The defence says she shot herself .
Ms Davis said she and Mr Spector , who were school friends , ate out all three nights of the weekend leading up to Ms Clarkson 's death and Mr Spector 's behaviour concerned her .
He ordered drinks at each restaurant they visited on Friday , Saturday and Sunday , and it was the first time in five months she had seen him drink alcohol , she said .
On February 2 2003 she told Mr Spector he should not be drinking , but he ordered two daiquiris before dinner .
"" I was very concerned about him , "" she said .
"" He was not his usual self .
He was not interested in what I had to say ...
In all the time I went out with him
he was great fun to be with ...
This weekend the behaviour was totally different . ""
She said she never saw Mr Spector with a gun but recalled he once told her "" politely "" that he carried one in the boot of his car .
He never mentioned it again .
Under cross - examination , Ms Davis said she did not remember whether Mr Spector finished both drinks and she did not know whether he was drunk .
She had never seen him with a gun or been threatened by him .
The court then heard a detailed account of events in the hours before Mr Spector arrived at the House of Blues nightclub where he met Ms Clarkson .
After dropping off Ms Davis at her home at 11.15pm he continued his evening with Kathy Sullivan , a waitress .
Ms Sullivan testified that by the time they reached the House of Blues it was nearly 2 am and she wanted to go home .
She ordered a bottle of water and Mr Spector became annoyed , saying if she wanted to drink water she could go home .
He had Ms Clarkson escort her out and his driver took her home .
On cross - examination , Ms Sullivan testified that Mr Spector was not drunk , may not have consumed all the drinks he ordered and had no trouble walking or talking .
Before Ms Davis and Ms Sullivan took the stand the defence sought to undermine the credibility of one of four women who have told of being threatened with guns by Mr Spector in the years before Ms Clarkson 's death .
Melissa Grosvenor told a story similar to the others - initially finding Mr Spector to be charming before suddenly being terrorised with a gun when she sought to leave his presence .
But defence attorney Roger Rosen suggested one of her sisters had heard a different account from her .
Ms Grosvenor said the sister was a drug addict whom she believed Mr Spector was giving money .
Under cross - examination , Ms Grosvenor acknowledged she did not know whether the gun she claimed Mr Spector pointed between her eyes was loaded .
Mr Rosen said the gun was not fired .
She replied : "" I would n't be sitting here if it was . ""
Prosecutors followed up on previous testimony by Stephanie Jennings , a music industry photographer who said a gun - wielding Mr Spector held her hostage at a New York hotel and later threatened her when she stood him up for a date .
The court heard an expletive - filled message left on Ms Jennings 's answer machine in which Mr Spector berated her and threatened to make sure she would not work again .
Mr Spector , 67 , rose to fame in the 1960s and 70s , changing rock music with what became known as the "" wall of sound "" recording technique .
Clarkson was best known for a 1980s role in Roger Corman 's cult film Barbarian Queen ."
2007-05-22,"Defence lawyers have increased the pressure on one of the key witnesses in the Phil Spector murder trial , seeking to demonstrate that the English spoken by Spector 's Brazilian chauffeur was so poor that he wrongly implicated the music producer .
Driver Adriano De Souza , a key prosecution witness , testified last week that he saw Spector come out of his home about 5 am on February 3 , 2003 , with a gun in his hand and heard him say , "" I think I killed somebody . ""
De Souza said he looked into the home 's foyer and saw actress Lana Clarkson 's body slumped in a chair .
But defense lawyer Bradley Brunon , during a cross - examination that lasted almost all day , said De Souza originally told officers who arrived at Spector 's home that morning that Spector had told him , "" I think I shot somebody . ""
Then he asked him , "" Do you think you might have heard , ' I think somebody was killed ' ? ""
"" No , "" De Souza replied .
"" The words I heard were clear . ""
De Souza could not explain why he had changed his statement from "" shot "" to "" killed "" , but the prosecution later showed the jury transcripts showing the chauffeur was responding to a question from a police officer who used the word "" shot "" and that De Souza had used the word "" killed "" numerous times before and after he spoke to the officer .
De Souza did concede that he was tired and hungry , as well as frightened after hearing what he thought was a gunshot and then seeing Clarkson 's body with blood on her face .
"" It 's hard to see and hear exactly when something is so frightening , is n't it ? ""
Brunon asked . ""
Yes , a little bit , "" De Souza replied .
Brunon also sought to point out inconsistencies in what De Souza told various authorities about Spector holding a gun when he emerged from the mansion .
The attorney displayed a picture of Clarkson 's body , with a gun at her feet .
Brunon also questioned whether De Souza was fluent enough in English to understand everything Spector told him that night .
"" When you dream , do you dream in the Portuguese language or in the English language , "" he asked at one point .
Prosecutor Alan Jackson objected , calling the question irrelevant .
But Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler put the question again to De Souza , who answered : "" Portuguese and English . ""
De Souza also testified that he had been awake for 23 hours by the time Clarkson was killed and had been working most of that time .
After chauffeuring people throughout the morning , De Souza said , he 'd taken a three - hour nap before picking up Spector in the late afternoon .
After that he spent the next 10 hours taking the producer on a night of restaurant- and bar - hopping across Los Angeles .
During all those hours , De Souza said , he had had nothing to eat or drink but potato crisps and water .
De Souza also acknowledged that he faced possible deportation because he did n't fulfill all the requirements of his student visa , and that prosecutors had asked immigration authorities to defer deportation proceedings .
Brunon asked if that caused him to favour the prosecution . ""
No sir , I 'm here because of the right thing to do , "" De Souza said .
The defence claims Clarkson shot herself .
Spector , who sat without expression during De Souza 's testimony , chatted amiably with his bodyguards and lawyers during a break in the trial ."
2007-05-30,"The Phil Spector trial took another twist last night after a coroner testified that the injuries sustained by actress
Lana Clarkson were consistent with homicide .
Dr Louis Pena told the court that the barrel of a gun may have been forced into Clarkson 's mouth , which would undermine claims made by Spector 's lawyers that her death in his house in February 2003 was suicide . ""
The bruise is very unique and is consistent with blunt - force trauma .
Something struck the tongue , "" said Dr Pena who also testified that there were bruises on Clarkson 's right arm and wrist .
Pena called Clarkson 's death a homicide , and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts .
Spector , 67 , is accused of shooting Clarkson , 40 , after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues nightclub in Los Angeles .
The defense claims that Clarkson committed suicide by placing the gun in her own mouth and pulling the trigger .
Pena said there was no evidence that Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide .
The coroner said Clarkson had been taking two drugs generally given for depression , but her neurologist had prescribed them for her chronic headaches .
"" I found her to be a hopeful person from the notes I read , "" Pena said .
He said she died with a purse on one shoulder in a stranger 's home , which is not typical of someone taking her own life .
Jurors were shown graphic photos of the damage done to Clarkson 's face and the inside of her mouth .
At least one juror looked away from the large display on a movie screen , and for the first time , Clarkson 's mother and sister were not present in the courtroom .
Pena said the recoil from the shot shattered Clarkson 's top front teeth , blowing them out of her mouth .
He said that the shot went through her head , severed her spine and death would have been almost instantaneous .
In cross - examination , attorney Christopher Plourd sought to show that Pena relied heavily on the work of others in analyzing the forensic evidence .
Pena conceded he is not an expert in gunshot residue or blood spatter and acknowledged he consulted textbooks including one written by a defense expert , Dr. Werner Spitz , who sat in court .
Several women have testified about their relationships with Spector and violent encounters with him that involved threats with a gun .
The case continues ."
2007-06-14,"A coroner 's criminalist has denied compromising evidence while collecting fibres , hair and debris from the body of Lana Clarkson , the actress Phil Spector stands accused of murdering .
Jaime Lintemoot told the court in Spector 's murder trial that she used "" tape lifts "" to remove fibres from the abdomen of Clarkson 's black - slip dress at the 67-year - old record producer 's mansion .
But during cross - examination , defense attorney Linda Kenney - Baden suggested that by applying the large patch of sticky material to the dress , she had obliterated blood - spatter evidence crucial to the case .
Spector 's defense team suggested such spatter would help indicate Spector was standing too far away from Clarkson to have shot her .
Lintemoot argued that she did not believe she compromised evidence .
She did , however , acknowledge that she was called to a meeting at the coroner 's office a year after the 2003 killing to explain her procedures , and that she never looked at the tape lift to see if there were blood stains on it .
Meanwhile a forensic expert has said that fingerprints are rarely found on guns used in crimes and that none were found on the .38-caliber revolver that killed Clarkson .
"" We only get fingerprints off guns eight to 10 percent of the time , "" said Donna Brandelli , a sheriff 's forensic identification specialist .
She added that prints rarely adhere to the shiny metal surface of a gun or a wooden grip .
"" We were unable to isolate any fingerprints . ""
Brandelli said investigators had better luck finding fingerprints on the bottom of Clarkson 's shoe , on two brandy snifters , a bottle of tequila and a ginger ale bottle on Spector 's coffee table .
Her colleague , Dale Falicon , who tried to match the prints , testified the glasses and bottles had prints from Clarkson and Spector .
The print on the bottom of the shoe could not be matched with anyone .
Clarkson , 40 , star of the movie Barbarian Queen , was killed by a shot fired in her mouth on February 3 , 2003 .
Her body was found slumped in a chair in a foyer , and prosecutors claim Spector shot her .
The defense says she shot herself ."
2007-06-27,"The hostess and actor at the centre of the Phil Spector murder trial committed suicide , lawyers for the legendary music producer claimed yesterday .
On the opening day of the defence 's argument at a Los Angeles court , Spector 's team produced a forensics expert who said he believed B - movie actor Lana Clarkson , 40 , had shot herself .
Dr Vincent DiMaio , a professor of forensic pathology , said : "" She 's got blood on her hands , she 's got gunshot residue - that 's 99 % suicide .
When you stick to the scientific evidence , it 's suicide .
"" Spector , 64 , who invented the Wall of Sound technique and worked with John Lennon and Cher , is accused of having murdered Clarkson at his Los Angeles home in February 2003 .
DiMaio 's statement goes against the prosecution 's case , which argues that Spector was standing directly in front of Clarkson when the Colt Cobra .38 special revolver went off and that the gun may have been wiped after it was fired .
Clarkson , the stars of films such as Barbarian Queen and Amazon Women on the Moon , met Spector at the bar where she was working as a hostess .
They later went back to Spector 's house , where they were alone .
Clarkson died of a gunshot in the mouth and her body was found slumped in a chair in the foyer .
The prosecution argues that Spector shot her , while the defence claims it was a suicide .
It is not yet clear if Spector , who has described himself as battling depression and internal "" devils "" , will take the witness stand in his own defence .
The trial continues ."
2007-06-27,"Phil Spector , the legendary record producer currently on trial for murder in the US , has granted the BBC his first extensive interview in 35 years , for a one - off film .
The BBC2 Arena film , the Agony and Ecstasy of Phil Spector , will be culled from more than 50 hours of interviews conducted by director Vikram Jayanti during the course of the ongoing trial .
The reclusive eccentric , lauded as a musical genius for his Wall of Sound technique that resulted in a string of 1960s hits , was granted bail and is conducting the interviews at his castle - like Los Angeles home .
The film is part of a BBC2 autumn season that includes documentaries from Louis Theroux and Stephen Fry , as well as a major season to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the partition of India .
Mr Jayanti , who has made feature - length documentaries about Muhammad Ali and James Ellroy , said the final shape would depend on the trial 's outcome .
Spector is accused of killing actress Lana Clarkson in a late - night shooting in 2003 .
"" Our interviews have covered an awful lot of ground , including the trial .
The position the defence has taken is that she killed herself .
I 'm sort of trying to stay out of issues of guilt or innocence , "" he said .
"" I 'm more interested in this strange collision between an artistic genius and the criminal justice system . ""
The film explores Spector 's musical legacy , which also included the Beatles album
Let It Be and much of the 70s solo work of John Lennon and George Harrison .
Despite his eccentric behaviour , off - the - wall hairstyle and huge musical influence , he has never given a substantial interview . ""
He has n't let anyone film him for a documentary in 35 years .
But he does n't treat me as a supplicant .
We are talking very frankly , "" said Jayanti .
Producer Anthony Wall said Spector agreed to make the film partly due to the reputation of Arena , which last year hosted Martin Scorsese 's Bob Dylan documentary
No Direction Home .
In the programme Spector also deconstructs his hits , describes his competitiveness with Beach Boys songwriter Brian Wilson , and explains the roots of his unshakable belief that his early 1960s productions would leave a lasting legacy .
"" I want to get past the history of it all because I 'm not terribly interested in archaeology .
I 'm interested in who he is now and what 's going on in his head . ""
Other highlights include Louis Theroux undergoing liposuction in a look at the LA plastic surgery industry , and Fry following up last year 's Secret Life of a Manic Depressive with a personal look at Aids .

2007-07-10,"The one both Spector and spectral : What 's a Girl
To Do , Bat For Lashes
The first thing you 'll notice about Bat For Lashes ' new single is that she 's opted for the same drum intro made famous by the Ronettes with Be My Baby back in 1963 .
Good choice
- it 's quite possible that boom - ba - boom ... chsh , boom - ba - boom ... chsh is the best beat ever beaten ( and one you 've got Phil Spector to thank for , actually ) .
Save for that Wall of Sound intro , What 's a Girl
To Do is ethereal , creepy and forlorn in equal measures as Bat For Lashes ( aka Natasha Kahn ) describes how her lover no longer thrills her "" bat - lightning heart "" .
The spoken word verses are a tad precious and , when she does sing , Kahn sounds an awful lot like Björk , but that 's not to suggest that What 's a Girl ... is n't a personal creation and an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable single .

The one that 's Asbodacious :
Fat Children , Jarvis The former Pulp frontman used to sing about femme fatales and sexually cloistered suburbia , now he sings about the local Asbos .
But fear not , our Jarv has n't quite sold his soul to the chattering classes just yet . ""
Fat children took my life , "" he sings , sounding oddly upbeat .
Jarvis takes on the role of a middle - class voter , abandoned by the local constabulary and left to die at the hands of muggers who "" wobble menacingly "" , muggers who in turn have been abandoned by their morally bankrupt parents to a life of obesity and street crime .
His ultimate promise of vengeance as his spirit wanders the streets of Tottenham is an almost Dickensian twist , both hilarious and tragic all at once .
There 's a fat child in all of us .
Listen to it on his MySpace .
The one like Gary Glitter in the morning : Teenagers , My Chemical Romance
Another week , another MCR single , but this time the band have opted for something a little different .
The fast - slow / scream - whimper formula has been put to one side as the New Jersey four - piece experiment with the glam rock genre , and teenagers are warned not to let the man turn them into "" another cog in the murder machine "" .
It 's difficult not to have a soft spot for Gerard Way , so committed is he to warning the kids not to trust anyone , especially not the government , and he even manages to do it with a certain amount of panache .
It 's just that he always chooses the crudest possible way to deliver his message , meaning Teenagers could be Kurt Cobain meets Marc Bolan , but is actually more like Gary Glitter with a hangover .

Shirley , this one must be a joke : Get the Party Started , Shirley Bassey
Until Shirley Bassey was pictured squelching her way through the mud at Glastonbury , sporting diamante wellies and wearing an "" Is n't this a laugh ? "" expression only survivors of the Blitz can pull off , I was dreading her inclusion in the festival 's lineup as the weekend 's requisite "" kitsch "" performer .
As an exponent of the "" why just sing when you can summon the wrath of the heavens and BELLOW LIKE A WOMAN POSSESSED "" school of entertaining , her voice tends to cut through me like a knife .
Yet , she wowed Glasto and even the likes of me
put that wretched , ear - splitting vibrato
she 's so fond of to one side and got on with enjoying the show .
Alas , she has only gone and ruined it all by releasing her cover of Pink 's Get the Party Started , first massacred on that idiotic M&amp;S advert around Christmas time .
And when you hear a 70-year - old woman cranking up all cylinders on a track about taking Ecstasy , you 've got to wonder who the joke is on .

Rappers , leave ones like this alone : Lock U
Down , Mya ft .
Lil Wayne
We live in postmodern times , where the cultural stock cupboard has been ransacked endlessly , leaving only scant supplies behind .
And so , it seems that 27-year - old Mya ( who , by the way , looks about 14 , but has actually been on the periphery of mega - stardom for about eight years now ) has decided that the only place left to go is imitating Janet Jackson circa 1986 .
And why not ?
Back then , all you needed to call yourself a pop star were some nifty dance moves and a well - sourced bum - bag
and you had yourself a fanbase .
Sadly , Mya 's basic but generally likeable song has fallen foul of the rule that says no R&amp;B track can call itself complete without the presence of some bloke with grillz rapping incoherently about who knows what , probably the contents of his lap .
In this case , that 'll be Lil Wayne .
Still , she 's got the old school dance moves , the simpler - than - thou beat , heck she 's even got the crap cap .
As has happened before , Mya has nearly got it right .

2007-07-12,"Witnesses at the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector yesterday painted a bleak portrait of the actor who was found dead at his Los Angeles mansion .
Lana Clarkson , 40 , was depicted as a fame - hungry performer who had grown depressed over her lack of film roles and had joked about committing suicide .
Spector is charged with the murder of Clarkson , who died from a gunshot wound to the face on February 3 2003 .
His defence attorneys contend that the actor killed herself at the producer 's home .
Clarkson made an auspicious film debut in 1982 's Fast Times at Ridgemont High , appearing opposite such other rising young actors as Sean Penn , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Forest Whitaker .
She later went on to become a protégé of the legendary B - movie producer Roger Corman .
But by the late 1990s the work had dried up .
On the night she met Spector , Clarkson was earning $ 9 ( £ 4.40 ) an hour as a hostess at the House of Blues .
Taking the witness stand , her friend Jennifer Hayes - Riedl said that she felt "" depressed "" and "" humiliated "" by the job . ""
She was pulling out chairs for people she had beaten out in auditions , "" Hayes - Riedl said .
Playwright John Barons , who worked with Clarkson shortly before her death , described her as a fame - hungry performer who was desperate for success . ""
The most important thing for her was her career and becoming famous , "" he said .
Barons recalled that Clarkson once told him , "" If you turn 40 in this town and you have n't made it you might as well find a bridge . ""
However , under cross - examination , Barons said that he had never actually considered Clarkson to have exhibited suicidal tendencies .
Barons had hired Clarkson to impersonate Marilyn Monroe in his play Brentwood Blondes .
He said that he cast her not for her acting talent but because he hoped that her presence might convince Roger Corman to see the show .
"" It was shallow of me , "" he admitted .
However , Barons said that he found Clarkson difficult to work with and fired her before the play opened .
If convicted of murder , Spector faces between 15 years and life in prison .
The case continues ."
2007-08-12,"It was like Through the Keyhole meets America 's Most Wanted .
But in this peculiar episode of celebrity justice , the accused star , arm - in - arm with his glamorous young wife , greeted the snoopers at the door to his palatial home .
Once again , Phil Spector was where he likes to be , at the centre of attention .
The next morning his face and his mansion graced the front pages .
But the occasion was not the sort of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame event that the legendary 1960s record producer used to frequent .
Instead , Spector opened the door of his home to the jury in his trial on charges of second degree murder .
The 12 members of the jury , plus six alternates , prosecution and defence teams , Judge Larry Fidler , numerous officers from various law enforcement agencies and one reporter had come to visit the scene of the death of Lana Clarkson .
The 40-year - old actor was found dead with a single gunshot wound to the mouth in February 2003 , her body slumped in an ornate Louis XIV chair in the vestibule to "" Phil Spector 's Pyrenees Castle "" , as the sign outside the hilltop estate so proudly declares .
Once inside , the jurors wasted little time in experiencing the grandeur of Spector 's home .
They asked to go upstairs - a request denied by the judge - they admired the Picasso etching , and then four of them plonked themselves down in a reproduction of the chair in which Clarkson died and mimicked the late actor 's death pose .
Spector , dressed in long - sleeved T - shirt , sweatpants and sandals , watched the visitors enter his home .
The realisation will once again have dawned that his renown has fallen a long way since the days when Wall of Sound was a universally understood term and he was rock ' n ' roll royalty .
Despite a murder trial featuring a glamorous blonde alleged victim , colourful experts deploying bizarre accents and a parade of witnesses who seem to have been summoned from a noir casting agency , Spector 's trial has failed to take off .
Tragically , in very different ways for both the dead woman and the accused , nobody seems to care .
"" This case has been like the B - movies that Lana Clarkson starred in , "" said Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson .
"" It 's a celebrity case because it 's the only one around right now
but there 's just not that much interest .
Spector ca n't get attention even at the centre of a murder case .
He 's not OJ or Michael Jackson , he 's not even Robert Blake .
"" The nadir in Spector 's trial came in another courtroom in another building in downtown Los Angeles .
That was the incarceration , release and re - incarceration of Paris Hilton .
The media storm surrounding Hilton 's case pushed the already peripheral Spector trial into darkness .
As the early days of the prosecution case , which saw a succession of faded beauties relate how Spector had once threatened them with a gun , gave way to the defence and an obsession with blood spatter evidence , so public interest dwindled .
Court TV stopped broadcasting the trial live , and instead offered streamed video on its website .
Through it all , Spector has sat largely impassive in courtroom 9 - 313 .
A study in eccentric genius , he has been immaculately dressed each day , sporting a variety of frock coats and pocket handkerchiefs , his hands shaking , his lizard gaze observing proceedings .
Like some of the jurors and many of the spectators , Spector has found much of the proceedings tedious , and accordingly has nodded off .
At times the proceedings , once they stray from the key defence thesis that the blood spatter found on Spector 's jacket demonstrates that he was standing too far away from Clarkson to have pulled the trigger , can turn lively .
Take Punkin Pie and Babydoll Gibson , groupie and madam respectively , who came to court at the request of the defence to profess their great friendship for Clarkson while simultaneously sullying her memory by association .
Then there was the great forensic expert Henry Lee , who had his reputation sullied when Judge Fidler agreed with the prosecution that Lee had removed a potentially crucial piece of evidence from the crime scene , and had never disclosed its existence to prosecutors .
Dr Lee , who found fame like so many others in the Los Angeles legal community at the OJ Simpson trial , may now not appear for the defence .
Another player who was expected to help determine the outcome of the trial , defence attorney Bruce Cutler , has also disappeared from sight .
The New York lawyer was sidelined by Spector following a disastrous opening statement that merely served to show his lack of familiarity with both the case and the California legal system .
In the last two weeks , however , things have started to perk up .
The court saw Clarkson 's show reel , Lana Unleashed .
A dispiriting array of impersonations and routines - including a blacked - up Clarkson performing a skit about Little Richard - Lana Unleashed demonstrated not only that Clarkson would never be A - list but also served to articulate the sad optimism of someone who believed in the Hollywood dream .
After Lana Unleashed , the jury met a real slice of A - list Hollywood when Transformers director Michael Bay took the stand for the prosecution to deny an allegation that Clarkson was depressed because he had snubbed her at a party .
He had n't seen her , he said .
Just to remind anyone which town this was , one of the jurors , an executive for a Hollywood production company , was later questioned by Judge Fidler about his friendship with the director .
He was allowed to stay on the panel .
Next week the prosecution promises to end with another former lover and colleague , an Englishwoman named Devra Robitaille , who says Spector once held a gun to her head .
The trial now goes into what are predicted to be its final two weeks .
If found guilty , Spector faces 15 years to life in prison .
Backstory Jurors are being asked to decide if Phil Spector was responsible for the death of Lana Clarkson , 40 , who was found by police slumped dead in a chair , her teeth blown out by a single gunshot to her mouth .
Clarkson , who was best known as the star of Roger Corman 's cult film Barbarian Queen , was working as a hostess at the House of Blues in Los Angeles , when she went home with Mr Spector , 67 , the night she died .
A chauffeur , who drove them to Spector 's mansion , has told of hearing a gunshot and seeing Spector emerge from the house holding a gun and declaring : "" I think I killed somebody . ""
In an email to friends , Spector called the death "" an accidental suicide "" .
It took eight months of investigation before authorities charged him ."
2007-09-18,"The jurors in the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector today told the court they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict .
Los Angeles superior court judge
Larry Fidler said he might instruct the jury to go back and try to reach a verdict on a reduced charge of manslaughter .
The foreman of the jury told the judge that the panel was at an impasse of seven to five , but did not indicate which way it was leaning . ""
At this time I do n't believe that anything else will change the positions of the jurors , "" the foreman said .
The jury has been considering its verdict for seven days after a five - month trial .
Spector , 67 , faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering actor Lana Clarkson .
The 40-year - old actor was found dead with a single gunshot wound to the mouth in February 2003 .
Her body was slumped in a chair in the hallway of Spector 's home in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra ."
2007-09-19,"The jury in the murder trial of Phil Spector declared that it was unable to reach a verdict yesterday after seven days of deliberation .
The jury 's foreman told Judge Larry Fidler that it was hung on a 7 - 5 vote .
It was not revealed which way the majority on the jury was leaning .
In a further development , the judge said that he was considering allowing the jury to consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter .
Spector has been tried on a charge of second degree murder in the death of Lana Clarkson , an actor who was found dead of a single gunshot wound in the lobby of the legendary record producer 's Los Angeles mansion in February 2003 .
If found guilty on that charge , Spector would face at least 15 years in prison .
A charge of involuntary manslaughter is likely to lead to a sentence of three to seven years , should the 67-year - old be found guilty .
A trembling Spector - wearing a charcoal pinstripe suit , red tie and handkerchief - listened as the jurors individually confirmed to the judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision .
Three jurors , including two of the three women on the panel , said that further instruction from the judge might help them in arriving at a different decision .
However the foreman , speaking on behalf of the entire jury , told the judge : "" I do n't believe that anything else will change the positions of the jurors based on the facts . ""
The development came after the jurors sent a note to the judge at lunchtime yesterday . ""
The jury has reached an impasse , "" it read .
"" We do not feel we can reach a unanimous verdict . ""
After calling the jury into the courtroom , Judge Fidler sent them home , to return today .
"" I want you to take a break , "" he said .
"" Just set the case aside for the rest of the day . ""
Spector and Clarkson had met when he visited the House of Blues nightclub where she worked as a hostess in the VIP room .
She agreed to accompany Spector to his home - a "" Pyrenees castle "" in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra - for a nightcap .
According to testimony from Spector 's chauffeur , some hours after they arrived , a shot was fired and Spector emerged from the house holding a gun to declare : "" I think I killed somebody . ""
Clarkson was killed by a bullet fired from a gun inside her mouth .
Spector 's defence contended during the five - month trial that she had many personal problems and killed herself either by accident or suicide .
Spector found fame as producer of hit records decades ago , creating what became known as the "" Wall of Sound "" recording technique .
Clarkson had modest success as the star of Roger Corman 's 1985 cult film Barbarian Queen ."
2007-09-21,"The jury in the Phil Spector trial has still not reached a verdict despite new instructions from the judge aimed at ending the deadlock .
Deliberations resumed yesterday following a two - day hiatus after the panel said it was split 7 - 5 over a verdict , without saying which way it was leaning .
The Los Angeles superior court judge Larry Fidler refused to declare a mistrial after seven days of deliberations in the six - month trial .
The 67-year - old music producer faces a sentence of 15 years to life in jail if he is convicted of murdering the actress Lana Clarkson by shooting her through the mouth at his Los Angeles home in February 2003 .
Judge Fidler withdrew a jury instruction yesterday saying that for them to find Mr Spector guilty the prosecution must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he pointed a gun at Ms Clarkson and that the gun ended up inside her mouth while in his hand .
Instead , he told the jury that they could consider a range of possible scenarios and still find Mr Spector guilty , including one that suggested Ms Clarkson had the gun in her hand at the time of her death .
The defence has argued that the 40-year - old actress , who was working as a nightclub hostess when she met Mr Spector , was depressed over her career and finances and shot herself in the mouth , either deliberately or by accident .
Prosecutors said during the trial that even if the gun went off mistakenly , Mr Spector could be convicted of murder because his actions showed a conscious disregard for human life .
Mr Spector , who did not testify in his defence , is famous for pioneering the "" wall of sound "" recording technique in the 1960s and for his work with The Beatles , The Ronettes , Tina Turner and Cher ."
2007-09-26,"Record producer Phil Spector 's murder trial today ended in a mistrial after the jury declared itself deadlocked .
Each juror told the judge , Larry Paul Fidler , they could not reach a verdict .

At this time , I will find that the jury is unable to arrive at a verdict and declare a mistrial in this matter , "" the judge said .
Lana Clarkson , 40 , died when a gun went off in her mouth as she sat in the foyer of Mr Spector 's mansion early on February 3 , 2003 .
She had met the record producer just a few hours earlier at her job as a nightclub hostess and went home with him for a drink after work .
The mistrial came on the 12th day of deliberations .
The trial itself began six months ago .
The judge issued new instructions last week , following a 7 - 5 split in the jury .
He said the prosecution did not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Spector pointed a gun at Ms Clarkson and that the gun ended up inside her mouth while in his hand .

Phil Spector in happier times .
Photograph :
AP Are Phil Spector 's troubles over ?
To the uninitiated , if today 's news that his murder trial has been declared a mistrial really is the end of the matter ( a retrial is being sought by the Los Angeles district attorney who brought the case ) , it would certainly appear so .
However , given that the man once known as the "" tycoon of teen "" has a track record of , um , ' eccentric ' behaviour , it could go either way .
Is his talent , as some suggest , inextricably linked to his being ( as he has described it ) "" relatively insane "" ?
We do n't have the answer - but what we do have is our highlights from a life that has constantly veered from the sublime to the ridiculous ...
Genius : four great records
1 .
The Crystals - ' There 's No Other ( Like My Baby ) '
Signed to his own Philles Records , Spector produced The Crystals ' first single , There 's No Other ( Like My Baby ) ' , which got No . 20 in the US charts .
2 .
Righteous Brothers - '
You 've Lost That Loving Feeling '
In 1964 , after seeing The Righteous Brothers playing on the same bill as The Ronettes , Spector was impressed enough to buy them out of their contract from Moonglow Records and signed them to Philles .
Major hits followed , including ' Unchained Melody ' - the most played piece of music in the history of popular music .
3 .
The Ronettes - ' Be My Baby '
The Ronettes were arguably the ultimate girl group , and ' Be My Baby ' , written by Spector , Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich , is often held up as the apotheosis of the "" wall of sound "" concept .
4 .
John Lennon - ' Instant Karma '
A good friend of the Beatles , Spector was brought in by Lennon and Harrison to turn the abandoned ' Get Back ' recording sessions into a usable album .
The result was Let It Be .
Impressed by Spector 's methods , Lennon employed him to produce some of his most enduring solo efforts , including ' Instant karma ' .
Madness : four examples of ' eccentricity ' 1 .
Marriage to Ronnie Spector Spector 's marriage to Veronica ' Ronnie ' Bennett lasted from 1968 to 1974 .
One of the many allegations his ex - wife has made about him is that he forbade her from speaking to the Rolling Stones or touring with the Beatles as he feared that she would be unfaithful .
Spector also allegedly threatened to kill Ronnie and display her in a gold , glass - topped coffin if she ever left him .
2 .
Wigs
After a serious car accident in Hollywood in 1974 , Spector reportedly needed 300 stitches to his face , and more than 400 stitches to the back of his head .
While biographer Dave Thompson suggests this as the reason for Spector 's wig wearing , there is no explanation as to why the headgear has become progressively ' eye - catching ' over the years
( click here to see an example of what he has been sporting during the murder trial ) .
3 .
The Ramones Stories of Phil Spector 's love of guns are legendary .
During the seesions for Leonard Cohen 's Death of a Ladies ' Man , Spector apparently placed a loaded pistol against the Canadian legend 's head .
Spector was perhaps even more out of control , however , when in 1980 , recording The Ramones album
End of a Century , he forced Dee Dee Ramone to play bass guitar at gunpoint until he was happy with the results .
The band , reportedly , also had to play the opening chord to the song ' Rock and Roll High School ' for eight hours straight until it was deemed good enough .
4 .
Starsailor
Inexplicably , Spector saw something in the dad - rockers from Wigan that few others did - talent .
He teamed up with the band for their second album
Silence Is Easy , but things apparently went very quickly wrong , and only two tracks from Spector 's sessions made the finished record ."
2007-09-27,"After almost 43 hours of deliberation over 12 days , the 12 jurors in the Phil Spector murder trial told the judge yesterday that they were unable to reach a verdict .
Faced with a 10 - 2 split in favour of conviction , the judge declared a mistrial .
The legendary 1960s pop producer sat motionless , eyes cast down , as Judge Larry Fidler said the trial was being abandoned .
Had he been found guilty of second degree murder , Spector would have faced spending the rest of his life in prison .
Last week the jury had announced they were hung 7 - 5 .
The judge gave them fresh instructions on how to reach a verdict . ""
The defence definitely dodged a bullet , "" said Stanley Goldman , a law professor who has followed the trial .
"" The reinstruction last week was definitely the judge nudging the jury towards finding Spector guilty . ""
He remains on $ 1 m ( £ 500,000 ) bail , while the prosecution and defence will reconvene with the judge on October 3 to decide what happens next .
A spokesman for the Los Angeles district attorney , who brought the case , said they would seek a retrial .
Alan Jackson , the lead prosecutor , has a record of seeking further trials in the case of a hung jury , and it is likely the case will be retried , possibly as early as next month .
The trial arose from the February 2003 death of Lana Clarkson , a 40-year - old actor and waiter , killed by a single gunshot to the mouth .
Her body was found in the entrance hall of Spector 's Los Angeles mansion in the early hours of February 3 .
The alarm was raised when Spector 's chauffeur , Adriano de Souza , heard a gunshot while sitting outside Spector 's house .
As he got out of the car he saw Spector emerge from the house carrying a gun to say : "" I think I killed somebody .
"" His testimony became key to the trial , as Spector 's expensive legal team attempted to discredit the driver 's memory and his English .
But he stood firm under cross - examination .
The defence also emphasised forensic evidence in the trial , declaring at its April opening that science would prevail .
But in a series of setbacks the integrity of its experts was attacked .
The lack of a verdict is a blow to the meticulous preparation by the district attorney 's office .
Led by Mr Jackson , the prosecution was criticised for taking so long to come to trial .
But it was argued that the prosecution , mindful of high - profile cases such as the OJ Simpson trial when celebrities seemed to buy their way out of trouble , was preparing a cast iron case .
Throughout the trial Clarkson 's family sat tense in the front row of the courtroom , within a few feet of Spector .
Her mother and sister stared rigidly ahead throughout often gruelling testimony , averting their gaze from more explicit photos of her and only choosing to leave the courtroom for the detailed discussion of the autopsy .
The trial opened four years after Clarkson 's death .
On the night in 2003 , Spector made one of his customary forays beyond the iron railings ringing his hilltop mansion .
Driven by Mr de Souza , he visited four of his regular Hollywood haunts in the company of three different women .
Unlike on recent excursions , this time Spector was drinking : "" navy grog "" at one spot , tequila at another .
With this taken on top of his medication - Prozac , Neurontin and tetracycline - Spector , the prosecution argued , was out of control .
His night ended at the House of Blues , where he met Clarkson , recently begun there as a hostess .
The two got off to an unfortunate start , with her mistaking him for a woman .
But by the time the club closed , Spector had persuaded her to accompany him home for a nightcap .
Little more than two hours later she was dead .
When police arrived , alerted by the chauffeur , they found her body slumped in a fake Louis XIV chair in the vestibule to the 30-room mansion , a gun under her left leg , her bag over her right shoulder .
Prosecutors suggested Spector , emboldened by alcohol , had done something he had threatened on other past occasions : he had shot a woman who tried to leave his company .
The prosecution produced a succession of women to testify how the normally polite and charming Spector would become a monster , waving guns in their faces and threatening to blow their brains out .
Clarkson 's death , prosecutors suggested , was an accident waiting to happen .
Spector 's defence countered with science leavened with gossip about Clarkson .
The science centred on the contention that the blood spatter on his white jacket confirmed he could not have been standing close enough to her to have fired the fatal shot .
A string of Clarkson 's friends attested to her instability , as well as her penchant for guns and liquor .
But the defence assertion that the prosecutors were looking to get a celebrity conviction was undone by the absence of public interest in the plight of the man who once had carried the title of "" tycoon of teen "" .
Struggles of a would - be starlet Two images of
Lana Clarkson endure after the trial .
In photograph after photograph displayed on an overhead projector in the courtroom , the actor , children 's entertainer and nightclub hostess was shown in a series of coquettish poses : smiling at awards ceremonies or with friends at parties , she was the embodiment of the blonde , leggy starlet she dreamed of being .
The other image , shown almost as frequently during the trial , was of her dead body slumped at an awkward angle in an ornate chair in the lobby of Spector 's mansion , handbag hanging from her shoulder .
Despite the graphic images , the real Clarkson remained an obscure figure during the trial .
She was depressed , she took pharmaceutical drugs , she liked to drink , she knew how to ride horses , she had handled firearms .
She was also desperate for success , looking for ways to relaunch her career as she entered her 40s .
Did all this make her likely to commit suicide as the defence insisted ?
Or was she the determined professional the prosecution sought to depict ?
Ultimately the jury could not decide .
Now a retrial looms , and a civil case brought by Clarkson 's family ."
2007-10-08,"A call comes into Big Bertha Towers from one Dominic Brown , son of the much - respected music writer and Phil Spector biographer , Mick Brown .
Brown Jr has set up his own label , Dancing Turtle , and he wants to compare notes .
"" I do it on the back of my day job , "" he explains .
"" I do everything from writing press releases to mastering the recordings myself and use the office equipment in the process .
In terms of making money from the label , I ca n't really see it happening .
"" It 's a Saturday afternoon , and a visit to Chener Books on Lordship Lane , East Dulwich leads to a conversation with the friendly man behind the counter , who alongside playing in various indie bands has decided to set up Tome Records . ""
The only way I can do this is by putting on nights that the bands play at , and all the proceeds go into funding the next release , "" says Kevin Hendrick , who has just put out an album by a project called Sleeping States .
"" I do n't know why I do it , really .
I suppose I just get excited about giving a platform for these strange bands that I like for one reason or another . ""
A few days later , I 'm cycling along the South Bank of the Thames when I crash into a headband - clad jogger , who turns out to be the prodigiously talented film and television soundtrack composer Daniel Pemberton .
"" My own label is proving to be even less successful than yours , "" says Pemberton , who set up 1812 Recordings in order to give his television soundtracks a life beyond the small screen .
"" It 's funny .
Making money from doing scores is straightforward , but making money from putting out records and CDs appears to be almost impossible .
"" It is .
So why do so many people start a label , especially when they do n't have much in the way of a disposable income ?
There is always the possibility of lucking out further down the line -- as Ian Ballard of the punk - rock label Damaged Goods stressed when I embarked on the project , labels survive on having a back catalogue of discs ready to send out whenever an order comes in -- but you ca n't bank on that .
The answer is that running a label , while an admin - filled headache that generally makes you poorer , is fun .
Dealing with strange and intriguing people like Big Bertha artists Teddy Paige , Thistletown and Pete Molinari ensures that life is never dull .
But the thought that Big Bertha Records might get these people a wider audience is the real inspiration .
Starting a label brings out the musical evangelist in all of us .
Rather like the annoying person that insists on sticking their mix tape onto the stereo at the party they 've just crashed , the label owner wants to inflict their world onto other people , just as so many religious zealots do .
It 's healthy way of channeling an unhealthy human urge to spread your seed all over the world ."
2007-10-11,"Record producers are a famously volatile breed .
When the 1960s garage band the Electric Prunes hired the producer and arranger David Axelrod to beef up their psychedelic sound , little did they know that Axelrod would come back with a pseudo - religious epic called Mass in F Minor , sung in Latin , on which the band themselves only made fleeting appearances .
Phil Spector 's habit of waving guns around - sometimes at artists who 've disagreed with his decisions - ended up with him on trial for murder .
As for Joe Meek , the legendary pioneer of British rock in the early 60s , shooting your landlady and then yourself is one way of dealing with repressed lust for the young men whose records you are producing .
It was always going to be a gamble enticing Michael Tyack , the leader of the medieval rock group Circulus , into producing an album by boat - dwelling Cornish five - piece Thistletown , which is to be Big Bertha Records ' first full - length release .
Tyack 's mastery of Renaissance - era instruments such as the lute and the cittern , weakness for Tudor fashions and belief in the existence of pixies has enraged and baffled significant swathes of the music industry .
A review of Circulus in this very paper even claimed that they were an elaborate hoax cooked up with the help of a couple of bored journalists ( and I was probably one of the suspects ) .
But Tyack has a strong feeling for what he calls "" the ancient spirit "" and Thistletown have a lot of respect for him .
He is the man for the job .
The problem is that , rather like the 12th - century wandering minstrels he considers his forebears , Tyack is in a state of near poverty .
Big Bertha has no budget to pay for his services and recording the album in and around a cottage in Cornwall has ended up taking the entire summer rather than the few days we had envisioned .
The situation has forced him to move back into his family home , thankfully only half an hour away from the cottage .
"" It 's all very well staying with your parents when you 're young , "" says Tyack , "" but when you 're 42 and they still have no idea what you 're doing with your life , it gets a bit embarrassing .
The other day my mother suggested I return to London and get a job stacking shelves .
She simply does n't realise that I 'm pouring everything I have into this project . ""
Tyack played lute , saz ( a member of the lute family ) and electric guitar on the album ; built recording booths out of cardboard boxes ; and made Thistletown 's Tiffany sing in the pouring rain at midnight while swinging a microphone above her head .
He considered forcing the band to record a song at the bottom of a well in his parents ' garden but decided against it after a terrifying pre - session recce convinced him the well was haunted .
And he has done it all for free on the agreement that he will get a percentage of the master recording rights - which will only bring a profit if the album is a hit .
While Tyack is brimming over with musical ideas and quasi - spiritual theories , technical expertise is needed to turn the cottage sessions into a professional - sounding record .
Enter Benet Walsh , a multi - instrumentalist , habitué of the British electronica scene and self - taught studio wizard .
Walsh has set up a studio at his house in Ludlow , Shropshire and Tyack has decamped there for a week , sleeping on the sofa between lengthy mixing sessions .
I arrive at the house to find the production team hunched over a computer screen , staring at what looks like a series of crude landscape drawings ( they 're called sound waves ) as Thistletown 's song Glowworm glides out of the speakers .
"" This is a sequencer , "" says Walsh , pointing at the screen .
"" It allows us to treat the sound accurately .
You can play each track of the recording - the bongos , for example - by itself , chopping out any bum notes or spreading the sound over the stereo .
Using computers to produce and mix records gives you a huge amount of freedom . ""
Suffering from the Luddites ' fear of things they can not understand , I suggest that the soul of an organic band like Thistletown can not possibly be captured through this faceless machinery .
"" If you 're recording in a rustic situation , musicians can easily go out of time , "" counters Walsh . ""
With digital technology , we can fix that .
And while it costs £ 1,000 a day to hire a professional studio , you can now make an album yourself and get a pretty decent sound out of this home technology . ""
Walsh plays Thistletown 's album to prove his point .
It sounds like a polished , expansive record filled with rich harmonies , strong melodies and every conceivable instrument , but also markedly different from recordings of the songs I heard only a month earlier .
And here is where the problems start .
Like most good producers Tyack and Walsh have a vision for the songs that might not necessarily chime with that of the band .
For a potential hit single called Rosemarie , Tyack has removed guitarist Ben 's parts entirely and replaced them with a saz .
On Under The Trees , a monk - like chorus chants behind Tiffany and Lydia 's angelic vocals .
For the band 's previously acoustic version of the ancient French ballad La Pernette , Tyack has modernised the sound with a distorted electric guitar . ""
The electricity takes you to another corner of the forest , "" says Tyack excitedly , before adding , somewhat unnecessarily : "" It makes me want to take my clothes off .
""
News comes from Cornwall that the band has received the finished version of the album with a mix of joy and despair .
"" It 's great , "" says Ben , who could n't care less that his guitar has been removed from Rosemarie .
"" It sounds like a hit . ""
The women in the band are not so sure .
Lydia is upset that her vocals have been played down in the final mix , while Tiffany is distressed at the presence of the electric guitar in La Pernette , although given the alarming effect it has on Tyack , you can hardly blame her .
She also objects to her boyfriend Jarvis 's processed melodica at the beginning of Rosemarie , feeling that it is too "" pop "" .
She suggests a recorder replace it .
Tyack suggests that Lydia rerecord some of her vocals , and after a period of doubt she comes back with the strongest takes she has ever performed .
"" She was dispirited and then she rose to the challenge , "" he says , "" which is the sign of a professional .
And when Tiffany realised that I 'm not going to back down she eventually conceded to my changes , too .
"" It seems that the production process is a battle of wills as much as it is a creative collaboration .
Working entirely on trust , Tyack and Walsh have taken the raw materials of a pastoral folk - rock band and turned them into something unique .
"" We 're having to relearn Rosemarie to play it the way Michael and Benet have recorded it , "" says Ben , "" but we 're becoming a better band for that .
If we can get this album heard by the kind of people that will appreciate it I really think it might do well .
"" I do , too - if Thistletown can get out on the road to promote it .
The band 's members have the very common worries of having to earn a living somehow and , for a small band , touring costs more money than it brings in .
Lydia certainly has no interest in being a rock star - she wants to be a university lecturer - but having written most of the album 's beautifully poetic lyrics and provided one half of the kind of harmonised vocals our troubled age needs more of , I think she can be convinced to hang on in there for a while .
Then there is the fact that having two couples in one band - Ben and Lydia and Jarvis and Tiffany -exacerbates problems .
"" It quadruples the normal amount of friction you have , "" says Tyack .
""
Rather than argue with each other they simply do n't communicate , which is frustrating since all four of them are so fantastically talented and creative . ""
The extended production process has meant that the release date for Thistletown 's debut has been pushed back from November to January .
In the meantime I hope to be writing about the band 's London debut in this column next month .
As long as we can keep the producer - artist relationship at an even keel until then , not to mention the myriad and complex relationships within the band itself , my dream of launching the Folk Abba onto the world stage might still happen .
Keep it rural Being a typically myopic Londoner
I 've long assumed that there is n't anywhere worth living beyond our capital .
So what if property is agonisingly expensive , the Underground is appalling and there 's a junkie who injects heroin into his eyeball on your stairwell ?
London is still the place people come to when they want to make things happen .
Running Big Bertha Records has taught me that now , with technology meaning artists need no longer be alienated from the means of production , they may well have a better chance of doing something on their own terms in places that are quieter and less expensive .
Pete Molinari has chosen to stay in the Medway town of Chatham , Kent , despite having to run very fast in his Cuban - heeled boots every time the hoodlums take offence at his slick black pompadour , because with nine brothers and sisters nearby he can continue to furrow his singular plough of country blues without fear of going hungry .
The Chatham - based musician , painter and poet Billy Childish is one of Molinari 's inspirations : he 's been putting out records and publishing books from his house near the railway station for two decades .
Thistletown have set up a functioning cottage industry from their boat in Penryn , Cornwall .
Alongside day jobs and , in Ben 's and Lydia 's cases , MA degrees to study for , they put on their own folk nights in pubs and organise miniature festivals in the garden of the cottage in Mabe , Cornwall , where the album was recorded .
The bands playing at one I attended spanned the styles from early music to free noise .
There was nothing parochial about them .
Two years previously I travelled to the fishing village of Anstruther in Fife , Scotland where a group of musicians had set up the Fence Collective .
After being picked up in a van driven by a man who performed as the Pictish Trail , we went to the local museum .
The woman who worked there was a solo singer called HMS Ginafore .
They both put out releases on the Fence label run by Kenny Anderson , who is now quite well known as King Creosote .
"" Who needs half a million copies of the new Robbie Williams album ? "" asked Anderson .
"" If you make the numbers significantly smaller it 's possible to release your own music while continuing with a normal life . ""
Thistletown 's album was recorded in Cornwall and produced in Shropshire .
It 's possible that a major label realises Thistletown 's potential and whisks them off to the Big Smoke for a big career - as happened with former Fence associate KT Tunstall - but for the time being it seems that the countryside is inspiring them more than the excitement and hardship of London ever could ."
2007-10-22,"Phil Spector with his defence lawyers during the trial for the murder of actress Lana Clarkson .
Photographer : Gabriel Bouys / AP Jack Straw is keen to permit cameras to broadcast high - profile appeals from the new supreme court when it opens in October 2009 .
The justice minister is said to have the support of many senior judges in his bid to make the courts more transparent .
Appeals held by law lords , currently based in small committee rooms in the House of Lords , are officially open to the public but rarely seen due to logistical difficulties .
Decisions on whether appeals are upheld or rejected are already broadcast when they are read out in the House of Lords , but this move would mean that judgments and hearings would also be shown .
There has been some resistance to the move to allow the filming of court proceedings due to fears that it could lead to American - style justice with cameras broadcasting even jury trials .
In the states televised high - profile cases such as the Phil Spector and OJ Simpson murder trials have generated a great deal of public interest .
It is thought that such media attention could damage the nature of court proceedings .
Such cautious discussion also preceded the decision to televise proceedings in the House of Lords in 1985 and the House of Commons in 1989 , but now it seems unthinkable not to broadcast parliamentary debates .
Is this a positive step towards modernisation , or could this exposure damage our justice system if it were allowed to extend throughout the courts ?"
2007-10-23,"Hometown : Miami , Manhattan , Malibu .
The lineup :
Sarabeth Tucek ( vocals , guitar ) .
The background : Yesterday 's new band expressed their love for their hero Phil Spector by constructing a musical homage in his honour .
Today 's act got to perform live with hers .
And not just any hero - the most hero - worshipped hero of them all : Bob Dylan .
One Tuesday night in June 2007 , Sarabeth Tucek , an American singer - songwriter and a virtual unknown , got to support Dylan at the Pines Theatre in Look Park , just outside Northampton , Massachusetts .
It was a dream come true for the Miami - born musician , and it came about quite simply : Dylan 's people were sent a copy of Tucek 's eponymous debut album of sombre , solemn , spartan , spooked confessionals , and they liked it enough for them to invite her to open for him , which she did , to a mixed reaction from the crowd ( see below ) .
His Bobness even deigned to speak to her after the show .
"" It was a surreal experience , "" said Tucek as a clock melted over a tree on the horizon .
"" I do n't think I was ever so excited about anything in my life .
My whole life is wrapped up in his songs .
He is wholly original .
There will never be anyone like him again . ""
The feeling was n't quite reciprocated by Dylan 's audience .
One blogger , reviewing the concert , referred to "" the morose and derivative warblings of one Sarabeth Tucek on Tuesday , the worst Dylan opener I 'd heard since the metalloid version of Mercury Rev bounded off the walls of Woolsey Hall in Yale in 1991 .
Artists of the finest calibre would clamber to open for Dylan for the honour , never mind the money .
So there 's no reason for sub - par performers . ""
For someone so soft - singing , small and unassuming , Tucek gets great big loud reactions .
Released last February on the Sonic Cathedral label , her debut single Something For You , with its B - side remix by Tim Holmes of Death
In Vegas , moved one journalist to write , "" If you do n't think this is the most beautiful record released this year , then you might as well fuck off and die . ""
And the mere slip of a singer - songwriter has some heavyweight supporters .
In 2002 , after relocating to Los Angeles , she sang backing vocals on a record by EZT ( aka Will Oldham associate Colin Gagon ) which was produced by Bill Callahan who , impressed , invited her to Chicago to sing on Smog 's 2003 album Supper .
Around the same time she hooked up with Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and collaborated on a few songs that ended up on the band 's 2005 mini - album
We Are The Radio , after which she appeared in their infamous documentary Dig !
Over two weeks in 2006 , she entered the studio with Ethan Johns ( Kings Of Leon ) and Luther Russell ( Richmond Fontaine ) to record the 11 tracks that make up her debut album .
And she is currently on tour with Ray Lamontagne , with a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club support slot in November .
The buzz : "" Her darkly cryptic words are reminiscent of the sinister ' flipside of Hollywood ' atmosphere of
Neil Young 's On The Beach .
""
The truth : Her songs do aspire to the sinister simplicity of Young 's so - called Doom Trilogy and Big Star 's Sister Lovers , but they do n't quite capture their creepy essence .
Most likely to : Start a Hope Sandoval / William Reid - style affair with one of the BRMC boys .
Least likely to : Start an affair with Craig or Charlie Reid of the Proclaimers .
File next to :
Hope Sandoval , Neil Young , Judy Collins , Natalie Merchant .
What to buy : The single Something For You is out now on Sonic Cathedral .
The self - titled debut album is released by Echo on December 10 .

2008-01-06,"Noise has had a long and distinguished pop career .
These days , Phil Spector is best known as a bewigged eccentric whose retrial for murder is due to begin later this year .
In the early Sixties , however , as a producer he upended pop music with his Wall of Sound technique , swamping the pretty vocals of girl groups like the Ronettes with a saturated instrumental roar .
No one had ever heard anything like it .
Distortion fed back again in the late Seventies , with punk .
In 1984 , sulky Scots the Jesus and Mary Chain took the butterfly - in - treacle rush of girl - group Spector and added more feedback to create haiku - like squalls .
Happily , they 're touring again , as are their peers My Bloody Valentine .
Enter wry New Yorker Stephin Merritt , Mr Magnetic Field .
Merritt is a pop auteur of great distinction , if not wide renown ; he probably earns more comparisons to Cole Porter than royalties .
He might be best known for his songs accompanying the Lemony Snicket series of children 's books rather than the Magnetic Fields ' triple album of 1999 , 69 Love Songs .
( But was ' Girls in Their Summer Clothes ' , on Bruce Springsteen 's Magic album , a Merritt tribute ? )
Merritt also suffers from hyperacusis , an over - sensitivity to sound , a poignant side - note to this album .
Because on Distortion , the Magnetic Fields set out to out - Jesus the Mary Chain and out - Spector Phil , encasing his pithy melodies in the sort of whistles and groans that usually prefigure an eye - watering bill for the boiler .
Every instrument purposely feeds back , including the cello , accordion and even the piano , which Merritt hopes is a first .
If all this sounds like a studio experiment , rest assured : the melodies speak louder than the din .
Merritt 's lady - like foil Shirley Simms is at the fore , hawking the tunes hard .
But the finest moments are Merritt 's .
Normally , he sings like a depressed bloodhound , but on ' Too Drunk to Dream ' , he chirrups away , rhapsodising the perils and succour of being ' shit - faced ' .
A lovely addition to the noisy canon and a barbed new year tonic ."
2008-02-11,"Former Creation boss Alan McGee is such a martyr to hyperbole that it is advisable to exercise caution when he calls his latest crush "" the best band from Glasgow since the Jesus and Mary Chain "" .
Not too much caution , though .
The two bands share more than a hometown and an all - black wardrobe : both cover Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound with art - punk scrawl .
But whereas the Mary Chain emanate a dazed , narcotic cool , Glasvegas frontman James Allan , who has stern self - possession of a young Joe Strummer , sings with a sobbing intensity and a thick accent .
Rather than melt into the blur of guitars that envelops him , he roars in with a sense of melodrama that Spector might applaud .
Daddy 's Gone , a rebuke to an absent father , and the widescreen lip - trembler
It 's My Own Cheating Heart
That Makes Me Cry display a heroic grandeur quite unlike anything else around .
This stems in part from the addition of terrace - chant energy to the girl - group melodies and the androgynous whoosh of shoegazing .
If you have ever pondered what might happen in the unlikely event that My Bloody Valentine were commissioned to produce an anthem for Celtic , just listen to Go Square
Go !
's
weirdly moving , reverb - blasted cry of "" Here we fuckin ' go ! ""
But the crowd thins out towards the end of the half - hour set , and it 's not just because the band went on stage at 1 am .
While bassist Paul Donoghue thoughtfully shares his bottle of wine with the front row , Allen is disappointingly diffident , unable to translate the forceful charisma of his vocals into audience rapport .
They are gauche enough , too , to cover the Ronettes ' Be My Baby in a thumpingly obvious nod to their influences .
Too much expectation right now will do Glasvegas no favours .
Time in which to do justice to the colossal power of their songs , however , could make them unstoppable .
· At the Jericho , Oxford ( 0871 220 0260 ) , tomorrow .
Then touring"
2008-02-17,"Phil Spector , the American music producer who faces a second murder trial later this year , is about to break his media silence to talk on British television about the case against him and about his extraordinary career .
In his first screen interview , the recluse , who is charged with having shot a nightclub hostess dead in his Hollywood home five years ago this month , will pledge to clear his name when he is retried this autumn .
He will speak , too , about the musical instincts that led him to create some of the most enduring hit records of all time , from ' You 've Lost that Lovin' Feelin ' to ' River Deep , Mountain High ' and The Beatles album Let it Be The programme - Phil Spector : The Agony and The Ecstasy - has been made by the BBC2 arts programme Arena and is due to be broadcast in mid - April .
The programme - makers argue that Spector , who has made a huge impact on modern culture , should be considered innocent until proved guilty and that anyone charged with a serious crime deserves a fair public hearing .
The director , Vikram Jayanti , said : ' An interview with Spector has been the Holy Grail for arts documentary makers for many years and I think he agreed to speak to us because he felt that we were inspired by a sense of empathy , though not of sympathy .
We intend no disrespect to the dead woman .
The whole thing was clearly tragic . '
In the film , the 67-year - old inventor of the Wall of Sound in 1960s Los Angeles , suggests he faced public prejudice when he stood in front of a judge during an inconclusive first trial last year . '
On the jury selection questionnaire , 45 per cent of the jury pool said I was guilty based on pre - trial publicity and 20 per cent said I was insane , ' Spector tells Jayanti .
In September last year , a mistrial was declared when the jurors were unable to reach a verdict .
Spector was then released on £ 500,000 bail while the Los Angeles district attorney , who had brought the case against him , sought a retrial .
If Spector is found guilty of second - degree murder this year , he may spend the rest of his life in prison .
The murder case arose from the death of Lana Clarkson , a 40-year - old actress and waitress , who was killed by a single gunshot to the mouth and found slumped in the entrance hall of Spector 's 30-room mansion .
Spector 's chauffeur , Adriano de Souza , claimed he had heard a gunshot ring out and then saw Spector emerge from the front door with a gun , saying : ' I think I killed somebody . '
During last year 's trial , Spector 's legal team attempted to discredit the driver 's memory and emphasised the forensic evidence , claiming that the blood on Spector 's white jacket proved he could not have been close to the victim at the time of the fatal shot .
Prosecution witnesses argued that Spector was often violent when he had been drinking .
In the Arena film , the music producer will talk candidly about the part anger has played in his creative life . '
It is the anger and the rage that make you do better , ' he says .
Spector goes on to suggest that the talents of the great black jazz musicians Count Basie and Duke Ellington were spurred on by their angry resistance to discrimination . '
They said , "" You have got to treat me with respect , because you have always pissed on me "" , ' he says .
The former ' tycoon of teen ' also talks about the envy he felt from other musicians , including the Beach Boys , who tried to replicate his unique arrangements . '
I wish I had a nickel for every joint Brian Wilson smoked trying to work out how to get my "" Be My Baby "" sound , ' he jokes ."
2008-02-28,"From the symphonic wall of sound created by Phil Spector 's casts of thousands to the guitar - in - the - bathroom twang of the late Joe Meek , the contributions of great record producers have made them pop stars in their own right for more than half a century .
But the jazz record producer who took the interventionist line and still gained an artist 's stature was almost unheard - of until recently .
The American producer Teo Macero , who has died aged 82 , occupied that podium virtually alone for 30 years .
He produced two of the most famous jazz albums of all time - Miles Davis 's Kind of Blue and Dave Brubeck 's Time Out ( both 1959 ) - but he also worked on Broadway show recordings , film soundtracks and collaborations with everyone from Mahalia Jackson to Johnny Mathis , and jazz stars including Duke Ellington , Ella Fitzgerald , Thelonious Monk , Count Basie and Stan Getz .
He also worked on the score for the The Graduate , the 1968 movie starring Dustin Hoffman .
Macero embraced everything from delicately nuanced acoustic sounds to pitch - bending electronics , from live performance to improvisations reshuffled and reinvented as new narratives in the studio , from a pop - song hook to a circuitous postbop melody .
Subsequent producer - musicians including Bill Laswell , Jon Brion and David Torn have shown how fruitful the approach can be , and Brian Eno , in particular , has marvelled at the editing innovations Macero made with little more than a tape - splicing razor blade to help him .
A saxophone player himself ( who had worked in Charles Mingus 's famous jazz composers ' workshops ) , Macero thought as a creative musician , not a record company technician .
He understood the power of an inspired , improvised performance from the inside , but he was pragmatic enough to believe that if the improvisation had the seeds of a more revealing story within it , which a little splicing and reordering could bring out , then it was worth doing .
Davis , a lifelong champion of spontaneous playing , occasionally balked at this , but in the end always accepted the virtues of Macero 's methods .
On albums including the bestselling Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way ( both 1969 ) and A Tribute to Jack Johnson ( 1970 ) , Davis and Macero appeared to merge into a single composer - but one operating in a post - performance world , recomposing with frequently brilliant improvised music already on the tape .
On In a Silent Way , Macero picked up a casually improvised Davis trumpet motif , pasted it at the beginning and end of a long , spontaneous ensemble section , and ended up with Shhh / Peaceful , a theme and variation that had never been intended .
Macero was born and raised in Glens Falls , New York state .
His parents ran a nightclub called Macero 's Tavern , and the experience encouraged him to learn the tenor saxophone and attempt to compose .
After serving in the navy , he studied composition at the Juilliard School of Music from 1948 , and in 1953 he became a founder - member of Mingus 's jazz composers workshop cooperative .
Macero worked with Mingus on both tenor and baritone saxes and also with vibraphonist Teddy Charles , a fellow Mingus associate .
He won Guggenheim fellowships in 1957 and 1958 , and though he was a good saxophonist ( with a Lester Young - like langour to his sound ) , composition increasingly took precedence over playing .
He wrote more than 1,000 pieces in his career , for film , television and ballet as well as jazz , and with Mingus , Charles and musicologist Gunther Schuller , he became more deeply involved in the late-1950s jazz / contemporary classical crossover explorations known as the third stream .
He was also fascinated by the early electronic explorations of expat French composer Edgard Varèse , who he would visit at his New York home .
Macero said later that Varèse 's Poem Électronique ( 1958 ) inspired his use of tone generators on Davis 's Jack Johnson album .
Macero had joined Columbia Records as a music editor in 1957 , and became a producer two years later .
He signed Mingus to Columbia , but his close association with the notoriously difficult Davis - in a period in which the trumpeter changed styles at least three times in moving from acoustic jazz to electric fusion - was the supreme achievement of his time at the company .
He left Columbia in 1975 to start his own company , Teo Productions , but he remained Davis 's producer until 1983 .
In his later career he worked with Tony Bennett and Robert Palmer , the Lounge Lizards , Vernon Reid and DJ Logic , among others .
He took up the saxophone again in the 1980s , and in 1983 directed a big - band album of his own compositions , Impressions of Charles Mingus .
In 1988 he came to London at the invitation of the eclectic British big band Loose Tubes ( the membership included Django Bates , Julian Arguelles , Iain Ballamy and Polar Bear 's Mark Lockheart ) to produce the ensemble 's final album , Open Letter .
He is survived by his wife Jeanne , his sister Lydia Edwards , and his stepdaughter Suzie Lightbourn .
Daragh McCarthy writes : I first met Teo Macero five years ago at his apartment in New York when I filmed the first of many interviews about his life and work .
It was a tiny apartment filled with photographs of himself and his friend Edgard Varèse , and several of the effects machines specially designed for him by the engineering department at CBS records .
I once asked him what the key to his studio technique was .
He struggled to find an answer before finally saying : "" It 's like E = mc squared .
It 's very simple really ...
and then I use my ears .
"" In his last years Teo wrote music prolifically .
He said the pain from his illness disappeared when he wrote .
In his apartment , he would play every day on his Fender Rhodes electric piano .
At his house in the Hamptons on Long Island , he played on his full - sized grand .
He approached writing with urgency , determined to get stuff out and laid down for posterity .
The first and only time I watched him in the studio was at his final session in February 2007 .
The studio seemed like his real home .
When he arrived , the cantankerous professional emerged .
He always said that he had no friends in the studio - and this session had its share of fraught moments .
Even some of his old friends were subjected to harsh criticism if they failed to come up with the goods .
But at 81 , despite being in great pain , his concentration was remarkable and inspiring .
The resulting album , Teo Macero Presents the Inner World Band : Study in Contrast
( Teo Productions / NYU ) is a fantastic big band record with David Schroeder 's New York University jazz students appearing along with Teo 's friends and colleagues from throughout his career .
After a lifetime working with musicians trying to achieve perfection , Teo hated the exploitation of old recordings in the CD era .
He told me Miles Davis would have hated their remixes , remastering and the use of additional tracks , which were , in reality , just the rejected tracks .
He felt releasing these rejects undermined the art and the work .
In cafes , restaurants and cabs , Teo always paid the tab .
He was unwilling to accept the generosity of others in case it would compromise him when the real work needed to be done .

2008-03-26,"Judge Larry Paul Fidler , who presided over Phil Spector 's first murder trial , has rejected a defence motion accusing him of bias .
In court papers released this week , Fidler signed a declaration saying he is not prejudiced against any party - scuppering the defence 's hopes of having a new judge appointed for the retrial .
Spector , 68 , was accused of killing actress Lana Clarkson at his California home on February 3 2003 .
He is , of course , the rock producer famous for his Wall of Sound technique .
Clarkson , meanwhile , was the star of films such as Deathstalker , Barbarian Queen , and Amazon Women
On The Moon .
Somehow her acting career never quite took flight : she was working as a nightclub hostess when she went home with Spector .
She was later found shot .
The first Spector trial was hotly contested .
On the one hand there was Spector 's statement to police , saying , "" I think I killed somebody . ""
Spector 's defence , on the other hand , insisted that Clarkson had shot herself and that the producer 's comment was brought on by prescription drug withdrawal .
The fashion magazines , meanwhile , commented that Spector had very large hair .
In a 44-page motion , Spector 's lawyers accused Fidler of numerous acts of bias , including the imposition of a gag order on Spector 's wife and a potential witness .
They also said Fidler was obsessed with countering the public 's perception that celebrities receive special treatment in court .
Fidler 's response , signed March 19 , asserts that he is perfectly neutral thank - you - very - much and that the motion ought to have been filed during the initial trial ."
2008-04-06,"' This is an age of producers , ' wrote the New Yorker 's pop critic Sasha Frere - Jones recently , and he has a point .
It 's not the first time the humble producer sheds his studio pallor ( for he is almost certainly a man ) and rises to prominence , defining the sound of an era .
The Sixties had Phil Spector and George Martin .
Today , alongside established names such as Timbaland and Rick Rubin , a whole new generation of producers is reshaping music .
It 's still an overwhelmingly male occupation but a great deal has changed , not only the sounds but also the way music is being made .
Thanks to new technologies , a track can be built on a laptop in a hotel room just as easily as in a studio .
The parameters of the profession are shifting too .
Of the six highly talented producers we 've singled out , each one is doing something distinctive beyond the studio walls .
Some DJ at parties or champion new music scenes from Baltimore to Brazil ; others remix other artists or have successful solo careers in their own right ; and most co - write or perform on the songs they produce .
Some are comfortable with being called a producer and prefer to keep the artist in the spotlight .
Others are ambivalent about the term and feel they deserve equal pegging .
You may not be familiar with all the people profiled here , but you have almost certainly heard their work .
We believe you 'll be hearing a lot more from them in the future .
Greg Kurstin Key song : ' Everything 's Just Wonderful ' by Lily Allen Greg Kurstin has worked with a lot of starry female artists of late - Kylie , Pink , Sophie Ellis - Bextor and Natasha Bedingfield , to name but a few - but the one who particularly stood out for the 38-year - old producer was Lily Allen . '
It was really easy working with Lily , and so fast .
We 'd have the spark of an idea and I would build up a track while she scribbled down some lyrics .
We did "" Alfie "" in just a few hours .
It was pretty crazy . '
Describing his favourite of the three tracks he produced for Allen 's debut album , Kurstin neatly characterises his production style . '
"" Everything 's Just Wonderful "" is simple in a way but has some complex elements to it , chord - wise , and that 's what I 've always strived to do .
It 's pop music with something unusual about it . '
Kurstin was playing piano aged five and gigging around LA in his teens , before going to study jazz in Manhattan 's prestigious New School .
So it 's surprising when he says : ' It 's better when it happens fast , not overthinking anything , putting three or four weird sounds together and getting something interesting out of them . '
Does he modify his approach when working with megastars such as Kylie [ on her last album , X ] ? '
I had to do a little more preparation , ' he admits . '
But the whole point was to do something organic with a home - recording feel .
We went into the studio ,
I gave them a few ideas and built up a few tracks .
It was all very natural .
The same as working with anybody . '
For Kurstin , producing is not a background role but a collaboration , with the advantage that ' it 's the artist , not the producer , who has to go off for three years promoting the record ' .
Recently , though , he started up his own band , the Bird and the Bee , with singer Inara George ( pictured above ) .
They are currently at work on their second album .
Adding to his tally of female collaborators , Kurstin has also been spending studio time with Peaches and Shirley Manson , and he 's back working with Lily Allen on her follow - up .
Switch Key song : ' Creator ' by Santogold '
The most exciting thing for me is finding an artist worth producing , ' says Dave Taylor , aka Switch , an established DJ and remixer on the London club scene who only recently started working with other artists .
He was the key figure on M.I.A. 's acclaimed second album , Kala - his first proper gig as a producer .
Then he hooked up with new Brooklyn star Santogold , whose debut album is out next month .
Now everyone from Missy Elliott to Tricky is clamouring to work with him .
He may be one of the hottest producers going , but 34-year - old Taylor , who grew up in Essex listening to house and hip hop , wants none of the attention . '
Some of the big hitters like Pharrell and Timbaland come across as celebrities but I prefer to see myself as supporting the artist .
Let the artist be the superstar , not the producer . '
The most important thing , ' he says , ' is to make the artist comfortable so they can express what it is they want to do .
They should n't worry about making mistakes in front of you .
And it 's a good thing not to start off in the studio , which can be daunting and sterile .
The M.I.A. record was recorded in streets in India , in hotel rooms , on balconies ... '
A ' technological revolution ' is changing the way music is made - and , he says , how it sounds .
The elastic synths and startling vocal effects on Santogold 's ' Creator ' show how Taylor is big on sonic innovation . '
Everyone 's had their fill of processed pop bands , ' he says .
' There 's a general leaning towards more creative input .
The Black Eyed Peas [ with whom Taylor is also working ] seem pretty representative : they get excited about anything that has a little bit of edge to it , or some weird twist . '
Danger Mouse Key song : ' Crazy ' by Gnarls Barkley ' Give me anything
and I 'll make a beat out of it , ' says Brian Burton , who , until late 2005 , was best known as the guy who controversially fused vocals from Jay - Z 's Black Album with backing tracks from the Beatles ' White Album to create The Grey Album , under his pseudonym Danger Mouse .
Now he is better known as the guy who produced Gnarls Barkley 's ' Crazy ' , the best - selling UK single of 2006 . '
That came together pretty quick , ' he recalls .
' I 'd done the chords on this crappy laptop programme but could n't figure out how to finish it .
Then I heard this spaghetti western song [ ' Nel Cimitero di Tucson ' by Gianfranco Reverberi ] and transposed it .
It was a really cool combination . '
Now one of the most in - demand producers around - with work on the second Gorillaz album , Demon Days , also on his CV - the 30-year - old New Yorker is just as comfortable working with rockers as rappers , and he 's even recorded an album in Italy with a group of elderly soundtrack composers .
There is a caveat : ' This is going to sound bad , but I 'm not really out to help a band find their vision for a record .
I 'm out to make a record that I would like .
I want musicians to enter my world when they work with me .
I look at myself as artist first , producer second . '
You can hear his influence on the latest offering from blues - rockers the Black Keys , and his fingerprints will be all over albums by Martina Topley - Bird , the Shortwave Set and , it has just been announced , Beck .
There 's the new Gnarls Barkley record , and the project he 's working on with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse , not to mention the songs he made with Ike Turner before he died .
A busy man , Mr Burton . '
What else am I going to do ?
Although , ' he confesses , ' this year I am starting to take weekends off . '
Gonzalez Key song : ' My Moon My Man ' by Feist He has been credited on albums by Jane Birkin and British soul wonder Jamie Lidell and is working on the new Peaches record , but Gonzales ( born Jason Beck ) is n't comfortable with the term ' producer ' .
Nor is the Paris - dwelling Canadian , who releases his fifth solo album this month , at ease with being called an artist . '
My main gig is entertainer .
I 'm more of a song - and - dance man , an applause - chaser .
Yes , I 've participated in the production of people 's albums , but "" producer "" can mean so many different things . '
A true producer , ' he believes , ' has to adjust to the fascist taste of other people .
An artist comes in and says , "" I 'm doing a futuristic salsa album with banjos "" , and the producer has to suppress the urge to vomit and say , "" OK "" .
I ca n't really suppress that regurgitatory instinct . '
Nonetheless , Gonzales , 36 , whose career has traced an unlikely route from rap to minimalist classical music , set aside his prejudices last year to work on Feist 's hit album , The Reminder . '
It was in large part a psychological management exercise , ' he says .
Songs such as ' My Moon My Man ' , which he produced , emerged ' pretty quickly and effortlessly ' , although he admits to urging Feist not to include her biggest hit ' 1234 ' on the album because it took so long to get it right . '
Which goes to show that my vision does n't extend to mastermind of commercial strategy . '
Gonzales will be performing at London 's ICA on 28 April as part of the Stage of the Art series .
Diplo Key song : ' Paper Planes ' by M.I.A. Wesley Pentz - better known as Diplo , maverick DJ , global ambassador for baile funk , erstwhile inamorato of M.I.A. - has a simple approach to music production . '
Major labels have teams of 15 people working on one track .
When I produce , it 's just me and a collaborator in a room .
We get drunk , sit around a laptop and see what happens . '
This does n't always work , he admits , ' but every once in a while something does happen and it 's like , wow ' .
As was the case with ' Paper Planes ' , the standout track on M.I.A. 's last album . '
That song represents her more than anything because it 's got her punk attitude .
It has an amazing Clash loop I sampled [ from the song ' Straight to Hell ' ] .
If I put a loop on repeat for 10 minutes and do n't get bored of it
I know it 's going to work .
Then I play with the drums underneath and add the hook . '
No one liked the song at first , he says .
' It was buried on the record .
Then people started picking up on it . '
The 28-year - old , who released a solo album in 2004 named after his native state , Florida , is building up his own label , Mad Decent , and working with artists from happening scenes in Philadelphia and Baltimore , Jamaica and Angola .
He helped unleash baile funk from Rio 's favelas on to an unsuspecting world after a Brazil visit in 2004 , and has since championed successful acts such as Bonde do Role .
Like Switch , he has been producing tracks for the upcoming debut album from Santogold , the eagerly awaited Brooklyn singer who has been likened to M.I.A. '
She hates everything I do to begin with , ' he laughs .
' I 'm walking around on eggshells , she 's so picky .
But we work really well together . '
Erol Alkan Key song : ' Young Love ' by Mystery Jets
When Erol Alkan closed down his celebrated London club night Trash last year , he referred to ' new commitments ' which are now bearing fruit .
Mystery Jets ' second album , Twenty One , which Alkan produced , was greeted with high praise when it came out last month .
Tomorrow sees the release of Couples , the second album from the Long Blondes , produced by Alkan in ' about five weeks ' .
The third album with his name at the top of the credits , the as - yet - untitled debut from Late of the Pier , will be on the shelves in August .
Alkan , 33 , was brought up by Turkish parents in north London , and got into producing via a hectic remixing career , but the catalyst was his interest in the Long Blondes . '
They had an incredible lo - fi quality that I was hoping would n't get distorted .
I wanted to make sure they 'd carry on the same way . '
He cites what he calls the ' Quincy Jones approach ' : ' If a car 's going in the right direction , you do n't need to steer it .
Sometimes , as a producer , having no input is just as important . '
He insists he does n't want people to see his thumbprint in the music , but on Mystery Jets ' much more focused second album , which Alkan worked on for more than a year , his influence is evident . '
I 've always tried to tap into the root of what a band is doing and enhance it , and help them realise what they want to say .
It 's about making sure the songs are as direct and brilliant as they can be . '"
2008-06-06,"If Phil Spector was the architect of the Wall of Sound , Larry Levine was the bricklayer .
Spector 's records were created in the studio , and had no life outside the grooves of a seven - inch 45rpm single .
Levine , who has died at the age of 80 , was Spector 's studio engineer during the brief golden age that ran from the Crystals ' He 's a Rebel in 1962 through
the Ronettes ' Be My Baby and the Righteous Brothers '
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' to Ike and Tina Turner 's River Deep - Mountain High in 1966 .
It was he who devised the techniques that allowed the brilliant young producer to turn the sounds in his head into Top 40 masterpieces .
There are bootleg recordings of the whole elaborate and infinitely painstaking process whereby Spector and Levine would subject dozens of musicians and singers to every trick of recording technology in order to create the celebrated "" little symphonies for the kids "" .
The Crystals ' Da Doo Ron Ron is among those tracks whose gestation has been preserved .
As the session continues , Spector can be heard ensuring that the tempo is exactly right and that the dynamics rise and fall exactly in accordance with his wishes .
His interjections are constant , admonishing the pianists or telling the drummer to move his snare two inches to the left .
Time and again his voice breaks through on the talkback microphone , halting a take . ""
No ! "" he shouts .
"" Nothing happened !
Nothing happened !
It 's supposed to be ' one two three Da doo ron BAAAAAHH ! '
What happened ?
One guy played it right and one guy played it wrong ! ""
And from behind the mixing desk , the patient voice of Levine comes through : "" Take 25 ... ""
Among Spector 's favourite techniques was the lavish use of echo , which he slathered over everything to blur the distinctions between individual instruments , making the finished record sound even bigger .
Levine was the one who explored the many possibilities of various forms of echo , before presenting them for the producer 's use .
Born in New York , Levine grew up in Los Angeles and served in the US army during the Korean war .
After demobilisation , he began working for his cousin , Stan Ross , the co - owner of a Hollywood recording studio called Gold Star .
Located at 6252 Santa Monica Boulevard , near the corner of Vine Street , the studio had quickly become famous for its concrete - lined echo chambers , designed by Ross 's partner , David Gold .
Eddie Cochran 's big hits - C'mon Everybody , Summertime Blues and Three Steps to Heaven - were recorded there , with Levine assisting , between 1958 and the singer 's death in 1960 .
And when Spector grew tired of the cynicism of New York 's session musicians and relocated to Los Angeles , he headed for Gold Star .
For his first session for his Philles record label in Hollywood , on July 13 1962 , he scheduled a song by Gene Pitney called He 's a Rebel .
Spector had expected Ross to be the engineer , and was disconcerted to discover that he was on holiday and Levine had been assigned to the session instead . ""
When I walked into a session of that magnitude , I was a little nervous , "" Levine said a few years later .
"" I thought I was going to blow it .
I was a little frightened by the new sound , and I did n't get a good feeling from Phil .
He looked like a creepy kid to me .
But eventually we worked up an understanding . ""
Spector discovered that , like the LA musicians , the young engineer was not contemptuous of music aimed at teenagers and was unafraid to experiment with sound . ""
You really needed somebody good alongside of you , "" Spector remembered , "" and Larry was really helpful .
In those days , for what I was doing , he was invaluable .
We were breaking every rule there was to break . ""
After He 's a Rebel , Levine engineered every record Spector made for the next eight years .
The brief golden age closed with the commercial failure of River Deep - Mountain High , possibly as a result of distributors and disc jockeys taking a covert reprisal against what they saw as Spector 's arrogance .
It put an end to Philles records , but not to the partnership between Spector and Levine .
The latter had already enhanced his reputation by working with Herb Alpert 's Tijuana Brass , winning a Grammy for his contribution to their hit version of A Taste of Honey , and when Alpert formed his own label , A&amp;M , he invited Levine to be their staff engineer .
When Spector produced a group called the Checkmates Ltd for A&amp;M in 1969 , the two men were reunited .
"" Phil can do anything if he wants to do it bad enough , "" Levine said around that time , "" but I do n't think he 's hungry enough to try hard now .
He got hung up on the image that was built around him .
But if he ever wants to , he can make it back again .
"" Such optimism was misplaced .
Although they were to collaborate again , first in 1977 on Leonard Cohen 's unfairly maligned Death of a Ladies ' Man and then in 1980 on the Ramones ' End of the Century , both sessions were disrupted when an increasingly unstable Spector pulled a gun in the studio .
And , in any case , the Wall of Sound was already a museum piece .
Levine , who leaves a widow and three sons , died at his home in Encino , California , on his 80th birthday . ·
Larry Levine , recording engineer , born May 8 1928 ; died May 8 2008"
2008-06-14,"If , like me , you embrace the theory that the story of American pop music through the years has been told most persuasively using the simple medium of three or four voices singing in glorious harmony - think of the Beach Boys , the Byrds , the Band ( it 's also , incidentally , the story of the letter ' B ' ) and REM , not forgetting the Ink Spots - then Fleet Foxes already look well on their way to claiming a prime place in that exalted lineage .
The debut album from this widely touted five - piece from Washington state in the Pacific Northwest , who comprehensively stole the show at this year 's SXSW , often seems to consist of nothing but voices ; which is just fine and dandy , because lead singer Robin Pecknold possesses a wondrous one - rich , emotive , full of character - and when the rest of the band close in around him the results are truly spectacular :
' White Winter Hymnal ' , ' Meadowlarks ' and ' Oliver James ' all rise up into the air like great secular songs of devotion , emitting a soaring sense of grandeur and deep joy that can be felt viscerally but is almost impossible to convey through mere words .
This is music that travels from coast to coast ( the brilliant ' Ragged Wood ' actually sounds like a freight train rolling happily over the plains ) , pulling in at many of American music 's most significant stopping points : old Baptist hymns ; gospel ; the Beach Boys ' lysergic barber - shop ; field songs ; Phil Spector 's wall of sound ; twanging country shuffles ; Mo Tucker 's idiot - savant rhythmic heartbeat ; skipping backwoods folk ; balmy West Coast pop .
The ingredients are hardly revolutionary , but the results are spectacular .
The way Fleet Foxes takes the familiar and subtly reconfigures it , like looking at your home town through a heat haze , reminds me of REM 's Murmur - all those simple guitar shapes , sweetly naive melodies and mysterious voices , mixed together to make something quite profoundly beautiful , the appeal of which only intensifies the more you allow yourself to be dragged in .
There 's a pastoral purity , an age - old sense of wonder and reclaimed innocence running through this record which gives it a truly timeless feel .
It 's certainly not an album ideally suited to the shuffle - happy iPod age .
The song structures are often a little unorthodox : tracks bleed into one another , neither stopping nor starting , while '
Heard
Them Stirring ' is essentially just one long choral sigh .
And although there is almost an embarrassment of melodic riches on display - ' He Does n't Know Why ' practically staggers under the sheer weight of its tunefulness - there is nothing so gauche as a radio - friendly chorus to be heard .
Fleet Foxes is altogether too loose and elemental for that .
Its cumulative weight suggests a rich tapestry of music , each tiny stitch and daub of colour vital to the overall picture .
Perhaps this is the band 's greatest achievement , their ability to conjure up a remarkably unified sense of mood and hold it steady for over 40 minutes , utterly disregarding any claims on the intellect and , instead , opting for a sustained assault on the senses .
They achieve their aim so successfully that the beauty of much of this superb album simply leaves you reeling .
Fleet Foxes casts a bewitching , unfathomable musical spell that lingers long after the music stops .

2008-07-30,"Well , now we know how psephologists across the country will be spending the next few days : digesting the momentous news that Barack Obama has sewn up the crucial "" wig - wearing murder suspect "" demographic .
That 's right , America -- Phil Spector endorses Obama !
Meanwhile , one imagines the campaign will have slightly mixed feelings , also , about this endorsement from the rapper Ludacris , in which he is very unpleasant about Hillary Clinton , calls George Bush "" mentally handicapped "" , proposes himself as Obama 's vice - president , and theorises that because Obama likes his music , that means he 'd get a "" special pardon "" if he ever finds himself "" in the slammer "" ."
2008-09-10,"Master these production techniques and you could end up like Phil Spector ... or , er , perhaps Mark Ronson .

Increasingly , producers seem to be getting their dues ; Mark Ronson and Pharrell Williams are certainly bigger household names than Gus Dudgeon ever was .
But are they really the geniuses behind the pretty faces of performers , or glorified button - pushers riding on their coattails ?
I first became aware of the power of production after hearing Siouxsie and the Banshees ' Peep Show album .
I became fascinated with how the title track was made .
Before I had any idea of what a synthesiser was , the pop music I encountered as a child in the 80s sounded bland and faked .
This , however , was a record that sounded artificially constructed , but at the same time entirely organic .
There are many types of producer .
Some are intent on using technology to faithfully capture the "" real "" sound of a band , others are arrangers , shaping the structure of unpolished songs and leaving the technical nous to the poor , uncredited engineer .
However , for aspiring producers looking to become a Phil Spector or Brian Eno , here are some guidelines .
Be open to any idea When Mark Saunders 's was assigned to work with Tricky , he assumed his role would be that of an engineer working with a Massive Attack - affiliated producer .
I imagine his heart sank when he turned up Chez Tricky only to have records randomly thrown at him , regardless of time or key signature , and instructed to make them fit .
To his eternal credit , Saunders pitch - shifted and time - stretched beyond the limits of sense and , despite his hunch that the samples simply would not fit , often found gold after they had descended over an octave .
It 's believable that this is how Maxinquaye turned out to be such an enduring record .
Be a gentleman Bless John Leckie - he has worked with various Beatles , Pink Floyd , the Fall , and Public Image Ltd , and never stoops to bad - mouthing a single Stone Rose .
Did Leckie get Ian Brown to sing quietly , improving his tuning , and then layer double - tracks and harmonies to cover a weak vocalist ?
The guitars on their debut album are also toned to a lithe shimmer – and the overall effect is of a jangly , hazy pop record played with restraint by musicians with real muscle .
The only song I really ca n't abide is Do n't Stop .
The Banshees ' Peek a Boo turned out to be a previous recording reversed and then reconstructed using the backwards track as a foundation .
Do n't Stop uses Waterfall to attempt a similar trick , but sounds uninventive .
Experimentation alone can not cover a lack of ideas – the song still has to be there .
Which leads us to … Do n't leave out the song
Whether Amerie 's 1 Thing will survive remains to be seen .
It is an immense sounding record , but are there enough guts within the production skeleton ?
It 's a fine balance , especially when you are at the cutting - edge pop / R&amp;B interface .
A producer can be brought in to make the song sound current , and this is often enough to propel it chartwards .
But anything that is all production and no song generally fails to linger in the collective consciousness .
The extreme Vocodered vocals and electro - throb du jour of Britney Spears ' Piece of Me I am willing to bet cash will be forgotten long after Toxic , which has the same production team ( Bloodshy and Avant ) but relies less on sonic gimmickry because the tune carries the song .
Let us hear the joins in the production Finally , I believe in exposing the artifice in the production .
I talked about this in relation to hip - hop ; when samples do n't quite match or are intentionally distressed .
The recent spate of bootlegs - mashing together two familiar tracks - is evidence of the delight we feel in making the familiar unfamiliar .
Take Portishead 's Strangers , for example .
A sample of a soprano sax , complete with jazz - snob vinyl crackles , descends from a neon - lit 40s barfly world into a pure 90s trip - hop discordant loop .
Then this gives way to a completely different aural space where the guitar and vocal are EQ'd to sound delicate and set far back in the mix using reverb .
There is no possibility that this piece of music occurred in a single location .
Then the discordant loop signals yet another change and the vocals are shot back to the front of the mix .
The effect jettisons any pretence of a credible performance and instead takes us on an aural journey through different eras and qualities of recording .
This is more than just a technical exercise - it is an effective way to manipulate the emotional tone .
Inventive production , from George Martin to Timbaland , has always been celebrated behind the glittery facade , so let 's nominate those producers who deserve the most credit and applaud their creations ."
2008-10-24,"He is among the biggest influences on modern popular music and has spent five years at the heart of an unresolved media firestorm over whether he is guilty of murder , but he has never given a lengthy television interview until now .
Questioned at length for the first time for a BBC2 documentary , eccentric record producer Phil Spector reveals the demons and insecurity that drove him , argues that he has never received the recognition his art deserves , and protests his innocence .
Spector , 68 , changed the course of music with his run of 1960s "" wall of sound "" hits such as Be My Baby before going on to work with the Beatles , John Lennon and the Ramones .
He was interviewed for the film , to be shown tonight , for more than three - and - a - half hours at his Los Angeles castle by the film 's director , Vikram Jayanti , in March 2007 .
Anthony Wall , the series producer who previously oversaw Martin Scorsese 's No Direction Home film on Bob Dylan , said Spector 's troubled childhood held the key to his genius and his torment .
In the film he talks about the impact of his father 's suicide when he was eight and the death of his own son , Philip , from leukaemia at the age of 10 in 1993 .
Of his first hit , To Know Him Is To Love Him , he says : "" Nobody knew it was about my father and nobody knew it was about death
and it was a love song to somebody up beyond .
"" Spector , almost as well - known now for his murder charge , bouffant hair and eccentricity as his musical legacy , will shortly face a retrial over the death of out of work actor Lana Clarkson .
In February 2003 she was found by police slumped dead in a chair at his house , killed by a single gunshot to the mouth .
A chauffeur , who drove them to Spector 's mansion , has told of hearing a gunshot and seeing Spector emerge from the house holding a gun and declaring : "" I think I killed somebody . ""
In an email to friends Spector called the death "" an accidental suicide "" .
The jury in the first trial failed to reach a verdict in September last year .
In the film he calls the judge in the first trial "" a mean son of a bitch who does n't like me "" .
The film dissects his songs , as Spector explains their genesis for the first time and betrays his deep - seated bitterness that his work has not been accorded the respect he believes it deserves .
"" Depression is a wasted emotion to me , like pity , it 's a wasted emotion .
I 'm concerned with the fact that I have not been made a doctor at any college and Bill Cosby has , even Dylan has , "" he says .
"" I think I 've offered more to the American culture or music or at least as much than they and a lot of people that have been given them - Mrs Bush and people like that . ""
He compares his work in the studio - which produced hits such as You 've Lost That Lovin' Feeling , Da Doo Ron Ron and River
Deep Mountain High - with that of Leonardo da Vinci .
"" I always considered it not rock'n'roll , I considered it art , "" he says .
"" I was just a loner and was always treated with contempt ; they [ the establishment ] never considered me with the same respect they considered Berlin or Gershwin ... but that just builds up the anger and the rage which made you do better , made you do a lot better . ""

The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector is on BBC2 tonight at 9.40pm"
2008-11-14,"Who are they ?
The Vivian Girls are yet another achingly hip Brooklyn band , who are currently surfing a furious wave of hype thanks to their studiously lo - fi grrl group sound , which has pitched itself somewhere between the teeny - bopping soul that scaled Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound , and the fuzz - bucketing clatter of the Jesus and Mary Chain .
Is n't hype a bad thing , though ?
When it 's unjustified , yes , but this trio have a certain something - their secondhand dresses , ironed hair and poker faces make them appear as if they 've been invented by John Waters .
Which can only ever be a good thing .
Who 's in the band , then ?
There 's Kickball Katy ( bass ) , Cassie Ramone ( guitar ) and Ali Koehler , who replaced original drummer Frankie Rose , now a member of fellow Brooklynites Crystal Stilts , another first - rate band you 'll probably be seeing more of soon .
Where can I hear them ?
The Vivian Girls ' short , sharp shock of a self - titled debut album was released here in October .
The band put out 500 copies themselves but they sold out faster than a book of el Bulli raffle tickets .
They 're in the UK for a string of dates , kicking off at the Brixton Windmill , London on December 2 .

2008-11-28,"If Glasvegas try any harder to emulate Phil Spector , they 'll end up in court for murder .
This stocking - filler Christmas album , with its punning title and three - hankie melodrama , is an unabashed homage to the erstwhile tycoon of teen .
While US indie bands favour wry , tender Christmas songs , Glasvegas come bearing choirs , bells , a blunt - to - a - fault song about homelessness and a solemn Silent Night , all wreathed in snowstorms of reverb .
Mostly , James Allan sounds like someone standing beneath his ex - girlfriend 's window on Christmas Eve , trying to woo her back by singing drunkenly until a neighbour throws a shoe at him .

Not so .
The reason why Donnelly is one of the highest - rated emerging stars on the UK circuit is his incredible ability to turn the seemingly mundane existence of the 21st - century slacker into gripping , unmissable stand - up .

2008-12-09,"The last great Glasgow band boasted music that could "" make girls dance "" but Glasvegas were a different proposition altogether
: their tunes could make grown men cry .
Emerging from the rough east ( rather than the artsy west ) end of the city , the Dalmarnock four - piece started their year unsigned and ended it with a Top 2 debut album in thrall to Phil Spector 's neat way with sonic bricks and mortar ( although this was less wall of sound , more towering fortress ) .
Simple 1960s chord progressions , "" ooh ooh "" backing vocals and the beat from Be
My Baby were all present and correct .
What stopped the whole thing from descending into pastiche , though , were the open - heart lyrics of James Allan .
Forget stopping in the name of love , or falling for the leader of the pack –
these were songs brave enough to tackle social work ( Geraldine ) , absent fathers ( Daddy 's Gone ) and sectarian violence ( Stabbed ) .
Only if they came spread across your front drive could they be more gritty .
It was on
It 's My Own Cheating Heart
That Makes Me Cry that Allan peered deepest into his soul , an introspective tour de force that put his own drinking , drugging and philandering habits in the firing line .
And all of this sung in a thick Glaswegian accent – think Sam Cooke singing ""
I was born by the river Clyde "" – that touched many a raw nerve .
Put simply , it was n't just the burly blokes in Celtic shirts who had "" something in their eye "" this year ."
2008-12-12,"The end of the year is upon us ; its short days drawing themselves in to a soundtrack of choirs on TV and Phil Spector in supermarket aisles .
With this mood in mind , I have been listening , rather obsessively , to Sounds in the Night by Russ Garcia 's Vocal Choir and Orchestra , an album reissued this month by El Records .
Recorded 50 years ago , it may not be about Christmas , but it is full of beautiful voices weaving themselves brightly together .
And oddly , instead of sounding like a blast from the past , it sounds timely , because rather than simply summoning the spirit of the festive season , it also echoes the mood of the year that has passed .
In 2008 , something weird has happened : the alternative music fan has fallen hook , line and sinker for the human voice , and its soft , hymnal qualities .
For proof , look at the Rough Trade Albums of the Year list , the ultimate barometer of independent - minded cool .
At No 1 is Bon Iver , whose debut album , For Emma , Forever Ago , is built on layers of harmony , each one a recording of Justin Vernon 's soft descant vocal .
As well as his album gaining an impressive 88 marks out of 100 on Metacritic.com , the website that compiles every review from the UK and the US , his songs have also captivated festival crowds , with many of them being encouraged , by Vernon , to join in with his songs .
At No 2 , we find Fleet Foxes , and a self - titled debut full of a cappella harmonies , canons and rounds .
Seven months on , it still sounds less like an album from the 21st century than a mesmerising message from medieval times .
Nevertheless , it has connected with the modern man , and it has sold well , too , going gold in the UK with over - the - counter sales of 110,000 .
At a time when many records are struggling to sell , this is impressive business .
So why has vocal harmony hit such a nerve ?
First of all , we can blame the ongoing folk revival .
When it started five years ago , it was all about Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom reaching for the high notes .
The music inspired by artists like them soon became less peculiar , and while Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes ' records still share their strange beauty , their more obvious emotions are much simpler to grasp .
Then there 's the way music lovers got bored of cool bands .
After the Strokes and the Libertines , every band that slinked into our consciousness in spray - on jeans and skinny ties soon sounded very weary .
But an alternative beckoned : acts who did n't rely on the cult of the ego , but the ego - free wonder of voices coming together .
Remember the first time you heard the rousing rally - cries of Arcade Fire ; the honeyed harmonies of Midlake ; the beautiful sounds made by Band of Horses .
These bands were n't embarrassed about their influences either .
They not only reminded us of the greatness of acts we had forgotten , but also helped to destroy the idea of the guilty musical pleasure .
Many alternative heroes have spoken out loud about the power of the voice this year .
Take Bill Drummond 's well - documented wish to replace recorded music with impromptu choirs , effectively taking music - making back to its physical roots .
Last month , Brian Eno made a much - publicised programme on National Public Radio in the US , in which we were told how singing together could open our lungs , our eyes , and our hearts , and forge new unions .
All of this togetherness has seeped into our collective consciousness .
And all this togetherness brings me back to December .
As I sit here , listening to Russ Garcia 's long - forgotten choir , I think of the many bands from this year that pay their respects to the idea of melody and harmony , both literal and metaphorical .
I also think about the collective spirit that comes from singing carols , and how we share the warm spirit of Phil Spector 's festive singers .
Most of all , I get lost in the wonder that comes from voices pulling together .
After all , humanity is for life , and not just for Christmas ."
2008-12-27,"Rather than simply ringing out the old , and in the new , Glasvegas are a band with a pretty odd take on the festive season .
Like their idol Phil Spector , the group has recently written what is in name a Christmas album - the six - song A Snowflake Fell (
And It Felt Like A Kiss ) - but which in fact bears more relation to the EastEnders Christmas special .
OK , so there 's a tree and some tinsel about the place , but essentially the same emotional dramas are still taking place .
As grim as their general subject matter is , however ( theirs is a band - as - Ken - Loach film approach ) , it need n't necessarily mean they put a dampener on proceedings .
Having first hit the airwaves in 2007 with Daddy 's Gone , 2008 has been a year of triumphs for this occasionally impressive group .
Tears - in - the - beer anthems are their general mode ; at least one of those ingredients should be available at Edinburgh 's Hogmanay celebrations .

2009-01-21,"From Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound to Chinese Democracy 's jungle of production , there 's always room for some overblown extravagance in our lives .
So I thought I 'd over - analyse Bonnie Tyler to prove it .
With belts all over the world being tightened , surely now is the best time to vicariously enjoy some aural decadence ?
You 're not likely to get an opulent sound from the homespun rusticity of Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes , so here is a celebration of how to do OTT in style .
Call a locksmith and change that key The most familiar device , which even the least musically literate are often aware , is the key change at the end of a song .
This can often take a track from being overblown to downright crass .
The most discussed recent case is the final verse of Alexandra Burke 's Hallelujah , ruining many people 's favourite song with a "" Westlife moment "" .
And yes , it is a gratuitous overstepping of the mark .
But it 's worth remembering that Leonard Cohen 's original was hardly a model of restraint with its gospel choir and reverb - soaked production .
Who would ever have thought Rufus Wainwright was capable of the least overblown version of a song ?
Total eclipse of the art
So if that is bad , how should we improve ?
Sometimes you 've just got to take it so far the folly becomes monumental .
The crude musical language of the final key change is nothing compared to the masterful manipulative journey to an emotional climax that is Bonnie Tyler 's Total Eclipse of the Heart .
Beginning with stark , broken B minor piano chords falling into A major , the melody rises through D and C major before the male voice is allowed to complete his sentence –
"" Turn around bright eyes "" – and we are in the more comforting F major .
These are completely unrelated chords to the opening sequence and despite Bonnie 's "" Every now and then I fall apart "" there is the feeling of hope .
This really is a model of climactic songwriting genius .
The second time , the verse resolves back into A major for the "" And I need you now tonight "" bridge
and we have a little respite from the growing tension .
In many hands , this section would have done for a chorus , but Jim Steinman had more up his sleeve .
The last rhyme of this section ( "" together "" ) is turned into the first line of a second bridge : We 'll be holding on forever
And we 'll only be making it right
Cause we 'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time This second bridge resumes another ascending chord sequence , ramping up the excitement until we finally arrive at the devastating chorus .
An A major first inversion with C # in the bass causes us to teeter over the brink , holding off the eventual perfect cadence into A where we land for the exhausted "" Once upon a time I was falling in love "" .
Phew .
And then it all happens again .
Or be a little cooler
If that 's a little too far up the scale of stratospheric excess for you ( and the video really does tip it over the edge ) , do n't think that the more critically acclaimed are too cool for a bit of overindulgence .
I 've criticised Mercury Rev in the past for revelling in an excess that does n't do justice to the music , but on the new album , they 've gone back to the best of their See
You
On the Other Side - style psychedelia .
In People Are So Unpredictable Jonathan Donahue 's "" Woken up by a stranger at an uncertain hour , you opened yourself like a curious flower "" blossoms into arpeggiated synths , choruses of "" aahs "" and then thunderous drums , sinister moans and , finally at 2:42 , an explosion of bells , distorted guitars and all of the above .
If this is n't proof enough , then the Flaming Lips have been doing the same for years and Arcade Fire are only just catching up .
At least two reviews of Guns N ' Roses ' intensely overblown album Chinese Democracy referred to its appropriate timing , with Axl 's opus summing up the OTT Bush administration that has now come to an end .
But with our dreams of wealth crumbling around us , surely we 'll need opulent fantasies to get us through ?

2009-02-13,"Estelle Bennett , former singer with the Ronettes and sister of Ronnie Spector , has died aged 67 .
As a member of the Ronettes , Estelle sang backing vocals on the 1963 hit Be My Baby , considered by many , including the Beach Boys ' Brian Wilson , to be the greatest pop song of all time .
The song was written by Phil Spector ( with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich ) , whose work with the group helped forge his trademark "" wall of sound "" technique .
Spector went on to marry Ronnie , but the marriage ended in divorce and the Ronettes launched an unsuccessful case to sue Spector over unpaid royalties .
The Ronettes – whose lineup consisted of sisters Estelle and Ronnie , along with their cousin Nedra Talley – formed in 1959 , going on to record a string of hit singles including Baby I Love You , Walkin '
In the Rain and ( The Best Part of ) Breakin ' Up .
The group split in 1966 , after which Estelle remained mostly out of the spotlight .
Bennett was found dead at her New Jersey home on Wednesday .
The cause of death is not yet known .
Ronnie Spector has posted a tribute to her sister on her website , which reads : "" To my beloved sister , rest in peace , you deserve it .
I love you , Ronnie . ""
In 2007 the group were inducted into the Rock'n'Roll
Hall of Fame , although Estelle refused to perform .
Instead , she delivered a two - line acceptance speech : "" I would just like to say thank you very much for giving us this award .
I 'm Estelle of the Ronettes , thank you .
"" Bennett is survived by her sister , a daughter and three grandsons ."
2009-04-13,"Phil Spector is likely to die in prison after the legendary music producer was convicted of murder for shooting the actor Lana Clarkson in a drunken and "" sadistic "" bout of Russian roulette .
The Los Angeles jury spent nearly nine days deliberating over the case in which the prosecution portrayed Spector , 68 , as a misogynist with a history of pulling guns and "" playing Russian roulette with the lives of women "" while drunk .
Prosecutors said it was only by a miracle that Clarkson , star of the cult film Barbarian Queen , was the first to die .
Spector was taken to prison to await a sentence next month of at least 18 years following his conviction for second - degree murder at his mansion six years ago .
However long he remains in prison , the trial has destroyed the reputation of one of the most influential music producers of the 60s , who pioneered the "" wall of sound "" with groups such as the Ronettes and went on to work closely with some of the most renowned musicians of the next two decades , from the Beatles to the Ramones .
Spector 's wife , Rachelle , sobbed as the decision was announced .
The defence contended that Clarkson , 40 , killed herself because she was depressed over her failing career and financial worries .
But the jury at Spector 's second trial – the first ended in deadlock – was persuaded by the prosecution 's claim that the killing was malicious and that the music producer was a "" demonic maniac "" who on other occasions had pointed loaded guns at five women and pulled the trigger , although the hammer hit an empty chamber every time . ""
By the grace of God , five other women got the empty chamber and lived to tell , "" said the prosecutor , Truc Do .
"" Lana just happened to be the sixth woman who got the bullet , "" Do told the court that Spector was used to tormenting women without suffering any consequences because he existed "" in a world where money and fame buys you the VIP treatment . ""
"" Behind the VIP was a very dangerous man , a man who believed that all women ... deserve a bullet in their head .
In every single one of these incidents , Mr Spector demonstrates conscious disregard for human life .
Her death was a death waiting to happen in his world . ""
For the final prosecution statement , deputy district attorney Alan Jackson repeated a theme he had struck in the first trial , taking jurors back to the night of Clarkson 's death and asking them to imagine what they might have said to her before she got in Spector 's car .
"" You are all thinking the same thing , "" Jackson said .
"" You 'd say , ' Lana , whatever you do , do n't go . ' ""
In his closing statement , Spector 's lawyer , Doron Weinberg , attempted to dispel the notion of the "" demonic maniac "" , focusing on the forensic evidence which he said demonstrated that Clarkson had been holding the gun .
Weinberg even showed jurors the gun that killed Clarkson , pointing it toward his own head as he argued that the blood stains on the handle proved it had been in her hands when it was fired . ""
Phil Spector 's DNA was nowhere on that gun , "" Weinberg said .
"" Every single fact says this is a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
How do you ignore it ?
How do you say this could have been a homicide ? ""
Wienberg also attacked the testimony of Spector 's chauffeur , who alleged that the producer came out of his house and said , "" I think I killed somebody . ""
The driver , Weinberg said , was tired and hungry , his English was not great and there a fountain was running next to the car .
"" How do you know [ what he said ] was n't ' Call somebody ' ? ""
Spector , who did not take the witness stand in either trial , sat with his hands shaking , looking down at the table before him .
Clarkson 's mother , Donna , is expected to press ahead with a wrongful death suit against Spector , whose fortune was once estimated in the tens of millions of dollars but has been greatly depleted by the cost of his two murder trials ."
2009-04-13,"Phil Spector 's first trial for murder ended with a hung jury .
After deliberating for 43 hours over 12 days in September 2007 , the jury returned to tell the judge that it could not progress from a 10 - 2 majority in favour of a guilty verdict to unanimity .
Judge Larry Fidler declared a mistrial , laying the ground for a second trial .
Spector 's first trial offered an overview of the Los Angeles criminal justice system , a system steeped in celebrity and money .
Prosecutors , having learned the mistakes of the OJ Simpson murder trial , were happy to take their time and make sure they would not be surprised in court .
It took four years from Lana Clarkson 's death before her alleged killer was brought to trial .
Spector 's defence , meanwhile , was in disarray .
He chopped and changed expensive lawyers , eventually settling on a team of five who would represent him at trial , headed by the New York lawyer Bruce Cutler .
But Cutler was out of place in California , and disappeared from view soon after his disastrous opening statement .
Yet despite his fumblings , the first trial ended with a hung jury .
While prosecutors had wanted to move quickly to a retrial , Spector had other plans .
He changed legal teams , with his new lawyer telling the judge he would need six months to familiarise himself with the thousands of pages of paperwork attached to the case .
The wait dragged on , with Spector all the time free on bail , residing in his opulent mansion , making occasional forays into the public world and even receiving TV crews at his home .
Yet as time elapsed , so public interest in the trial waned .
By the time the second trial finally got underway , it seemed that nobody cared .
Attendance was light , it was not televised and the press largely stayed away .
The job of chronicling the trial fell largely to bloggers , independent – and amateur – trial enthusiasts who found time to update their websites between doing the housework ."
2009-04-13,"The second trial of Harvey Phillip Spector for the murder of Lana Clarkson was dominated by one phrase : "" I think I killed someone . ""
The 69-year - old record producer , creator of pop 's "" wall of sound "" , was said to have uttered that phrase as he emerged from his home in the small hours of Monday , 3 February 2003 .
Behind him , slumped in a fake Louis XIV chair , lay the body of Clarkson , a 40-year - old actor he had met earlier that night when she was working at the House of Blues venue on the Sunset Strip
The full force of Los Angeles 's celebrity crime armada descended : news helicopters hovered overhead , high - priced lawyers – celebrities in their own right – were summoned , news crews and the idly curious gathered to peer through the iron railings of Spector 's home .
Spector , too , played the part , seeming to revel in a return to the spotlight .
He provided other staples of the Hollywood justice story : the tirade on the steps of the courthouse , the elaborate and downright weird hairdo , the rococo attire , the trophy wife , the phalanx of bodyguards . ""
She kissed the gun , "" he told one interviewer .
While the first trial was dominated by forensics and the finer points on how blood spatters , the rerun came down to an elaborate game of did he , did n't he , involving meditations on memory , suggestibility and English language proficiency .
At the centre of the dispute was Spector 's stand - in chauffeur on the night of Clarkson 's death , Adriano de Souza , a Brazilian student who proved an unflappable witness .
Despite his occasional awkwardness with English , De Souza recounted how he had collected Spector for an evening out that had seen him visit a clutch of Hollywood haunts , Trader Vic 's and Dan Tana 's , imbibe a huge amount of alcohol – "" navy grog "" , 150-proof tequila – and share his evening with two dates before ending at the House of Blues .
There , Spector met Clarkson , an actor whose role , far removed from the showbusiness recognition she craved , was to guard the VIP area .
Initially she took the freakishly coiffed Spector for a woman , before being corrected by the management and told to treat him "" like gold "" .
After some persuasion she agreed to go home with Spector for a nightcap , watching Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye in the back of the Mercedes S430 limousine driven by De Souza on the way to "" Phil Spector 's Pyrenees castle "" , a 33-room turreted mansion perched on a hill in the unprepossessing Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra .
Two hours later , she was dead .
For the second trial , almost six years after Clarkson 's death , Spector downsized .
Gone was the retinue of heavies that had marched into court with him every day the first time around .
He was accompanied by just one bodyguard , and his young wife , Rachelle .
His legal team was reduced to a single lawyer , Doron Weinberg .
Facing him was the same lead prosecutor from the first trial , Alan Jackson .
Without the theatrics of that trial , Weinberg 's speciality was studied doubt .
De Souza , he noted , had been through eight variations of the phrase "" I think I killed someone "" in recounting events to investigators .
Surely that suggested sufficient doubt to acquit , Weinberg argued .
But ultimately , Spector came up against a barrage of evidence .
Clarkson had given no indication that she was suicidal , the defence 's proffered explanation .
Why would someone who was just about to shoot themselves go out and buy multiple pairs of shoes ?
The trial heard expert testimony that people rarely kill themselves on the spur of the moment , and almost never at the home of a stranger .
More damning for the defence was the judge 's decision in both trials to allow evidence of prior acts by Spector involving women and guns .
A parade of women at both trials described how Spector had turned from charm to menace , often fuelled by alcohol and medication .
His penchant for waving guns in people 's faces , they recounted , suggested an accident waiting to happen .
The gruesome imagery from the crime scene also made an impression the defence found hard to dispel .
The dead actor , a cult success for her incarnation of the Barbarian Queen in the eponymous film , was reduced to a film noir cliche : the blonde starlet sprawled on a chair , the bottom of her mouth blown off , a 36 Colt under her left leg .
Spector 's assertions to interviewers before the first trial that she was the victim of accidental suicide never seemed more ridiculous . ""
If this were not Phil Spector , with a lot of money to spend , a trial like this would never have gone on for so long , "" said Jean Rosenbluth , a law professor at the University of Southern California .
"" Cases do n't usually go to trial when there is this much evidence against the defendant . """
2009-04-14,"The man who occasionally pulled guns on his artists , who retreated to his hilltop chateau for years on end and was last night found guilty of murdering a Hollywood actor , is what we would have called , in the days of seven - inch 45 rpm singles , the B - side of Phil Spector .
Flip the disc and you get the A - side , the man John Lennon invited me to meet in the autumn of 1971 when the two of them were recording a new single during the former Beatle 's first week of residence in New York .
Spector , a spindly figure no more than 5 ft 6 in tall , arrived at the Record Plant studio on West 44th Street in a black limousine , wearing aviator shades and a neatly pressed denim jacket with a "" Back to Mono "" button on the lapel .
Lennon and Yoko Ono were already waiting inside .
"" I want five rhythm guitarists , "" Spector had demanded when told that the Plastic Ono Band consisted of only four musicians plus Ono . ""
Get me some percussion !
Bells !
Celeste !
Chimes ! ""
His high voice had taken on a light scouse inflection , slightly camp .
Earlier I had asked Spector 's colleagues from the golden years how he went about constructing the Wall of Sound .
Among them was Jeff Barry , the co - writer of Da Doo Ron Ron , Then He Kissed Me and Be My Baby .
"" It was basically a formula , "" Barry said .
"" You 're going to have four or five guitars lined up , gut - string guitars , and they 're going to follow the chords , nothing tricky .
You 're going to use two basses in fifths , with the same type of line , and strings .
There would be six or seven horns , adding the little punches , and there would be the formula percussion instruments – the little bells , the shakers , the tambourines . ""
Then Phil used his own formula for echo , and some overtone effects with the strings .
But by and large there was a formula arrangement to create a formula sound . ""
But now it was five years since Spector 's last big hit , five years since he retired in disgust after the American record industry took revenge on his refusal to play the payola game .
He was 26 years old then , already a multimillionaire , and he walked away .
So it was big news when The Beatles brought him back .
To Lennon and George Harrison , working with Spector was like washing themselves in the stream of pure pop music .
Like Lennon and Harrison , Spector had grown up with his ears full of Eddie Cochran and the Del - Vikings .
He was one of them .
Watching Lennon and Spector work together , it was fascinating to see how readily The Beatle ceded control to pop music 's ultimate control freak .
Spector 's authority was absolute and his precision unyielding .
When he heard something he liked , his enthusiasm blazed . ""
More echo on the piano , "" he would shout to the engineer , leaping to his feet , his arms windmilling . ""
More echo .
More ... more ... more !
That 's it .
Beautiful . ""
His mind running at a different speed from that of anyone else in the room , Spector took a minute to transform the happy hootenanny - style strumming into a brilliant wash of colour .
As the engineers played it back , Lennon and Spector danced round the control room , arms around each other 's shoulders .
Already Spector was thinking not just of sound , but of arrangement .
Inside his head , he was taking those guitar chords and moulding , blending and transforming them into the subliminal basis of the record .
He called his records "" little symphonies for the kids "" . ""
Making something good was always more important than success , "" he told me . ""
The fact that it was successful was just the icing on the cake .
Because if I did n't make anything that was better , I might as well have left it to Fats Domino . ""
Weeks later , in London , there were glimpses of a different Spector .
On a couple of long evenings in his hotel suite , as darkness fell over Park Lane , an outrageous fantasist emerged .
This was the mask of a lonely and insecure man for whom no degree of acclaim and material success could quite override the tragedy of his father 's suicide or the mental scars of humiliations at the hands of bigger and stronger boys during his school days .
Spector 's finest records – those tumultuous epics that attracted comparisons with Wagner – gave a generation of adolescents a soundtrack to their lives .
For him they were art , no question .
But also the best revenge .
Out of His Head , Richard Williams ' biography of Phil Spector , will be republished later this year"
2009-04-14,"Three years before his death , I interviewed the great Gene Pitney .
He was fantastic company . ""
Ya ever heard this one ?
"" he would bark , before launching into another tale from the heyday of the Brill Building , or his time hanging out with the Rolling Stones .
I had thought he might be circumspect when it came to discussing Phil Spector , for whom he 'd written the peerless
He 's a Rebel , and who had recently been arrested on the murder charge for which he 's just been convicted , but no .
He 'd seen Spector at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame not long before his arrest
- "" He was being directed by somebody behind him , someone was , like , aiming him in the right direction "" - and suggested some combination of anti - psychotic medication and alcohol might have been involved in the fateful night 's events : "" He probably does n't even know what 's happened , did n't even know he was there . ""
Spector had always been "" kinda screwy "" , he said , adding : "" I had dinner with him the first day he arrived in New York
and he said to me his sister was in an asylum , and she was the sane one in the family .
"" Pitney told me he 'd also worked with Joe Meek , which I did n't know - he 'd recorded Meek 's Lips Are Redder on You in 1964 - and had known Brian Wilson in the 60s .
As has often been noted , they were both deeply troubled individuals too .
"" Maybe there 's a flipside to all that stuff , "" Pitney mused . ""
Perhaps that 's what makes them different and allowed the records they made to be so unique .
"" You could certainly find plenty of evidence to support Pitney 's theory .
Between them , Spector , Wilson and Meek minted the notion of the record producer as madman - cum - genius , an idea that 's proved hugely pervasive ever since .
Rock history teems with tales of producers apparently wobbling along the line that divides brilliance from insanity : Guy Stevens throwing chairs around the studio and pouring wine into pianos during the sessions for the Clash 's London Calling , the various legends involving Martin Hannett - "" the Spector of the North "" , as Nick Kent once called him .
Despite the stories , I 've never been convinced that My Bloody Valentine 's Kevin Shields suffers from anything more serious than a cocktail of perfectionism and laziness , but in his later years , Lee ' Scratch ' Perry has turned his rather erratic behaviour into a big selling point .
He has n't made a record to match War ina Babylon or Super Ape in decades , but he can always pull a crowd live .
A few years back , I stood in the middle of one such crowd indulgently chortling their way through a Perry show at the Jazz Cafe , struck by the sinking feeling that most people had been drawn there not out of love for his musical legacy so much as the opportunity to watch some supremely odd behaviour .
If so , they certainly got what they came for : "" I am a gay !
I am an extraterrestrial ! ""
etc etc .
The question is : why ?
Why is the notion of the "" mad "" record producer so prevalent in rock and pop music ?
Why do people find it so perversely appealing ?
Is it just that three of the greatest producers of all time were , as the late Mr Pitney would have had it , "" kinda screwy "" , and that set a precedent ?
Was his theory
right –
something inherent in the art of record production lends itself to , maybe even causes , deeply eccentric behaviour ?
Or does the fascination the "" mad producer "" idea exerts just appeal to a disquietingly voyeuristic impulse ?"
2009-04-14,"The mugshot is rarely a flattering image .
But this photo of Phil Spector , taken by the Los Angeles sheriff 's department , is particularly unforgiving .
Moments after his conviction for the murder of struggling actor Lana Clarkson , Spector is pictured with wild , bug - like eyes , his mouth pursed , his electrified barnet unusually subdued .
It is the latest in a long line of celebrity mugshots that capture their subjects , unguarded and exposed , better than any budget - busting photoshoot .
For an exhaustive array , one needs look no further than The Smoking Gun website , which features hundreds of mugshots ranging from OJ Simpson to Mischa Barton .
Who can forget the oh - my - goodness - what - on - earth - will - Liz - say look of Hugh Grant , arrested in Hollywood in June 1995 after an unsavoury encounter with a prostitute , Divine Brown .
The hunched shoulders , the foppish English - posho glasses tucked into his scruffy T - shirt , the guilty , guilty eyes .
It 's a classic .
Other mugshots do a sterling job of tracking a former star 's inglorious descent into depravity .
Take these shots of former ex - heavyweight champion boxer Mike Tyson .
In 2004 , he was charged with criminal damage for drunkenly jumping on the bonnet of a stranger 's car after leaving the Pussycat Lounge , in Scottsdale , Arizona .
In 2006 he was snapped again , this time in Maricopa County Sheriff 's lockup where he was held for drunk - driving and cocaine possession .
In 2007 , he posed for Arizona deputies after reporting to serve a day in jail for the same offence .
Heavyweight is not the word .
Some celebrities do n't seem to understand that contrition is an essential mugshot attribute .
Take this snap of Mel Gibson , taken after he was caught drunk - driving in July 2006 .
Well , Mel , it 's all very well later lamenting doing "" a number of things that were very wrong and for which I am ashamed "" ( including , allegedly , anti - Semitic insults and claiming ownership the city of Malibu ) , but when your mugshot is more "" heh , heh , heh "" than "" oops , sorry "" , the impression left with the law - abiding public is not very favourable .
Others refuse to look suitably shoddy and unkempt in their close - ups .
David Bowie looks startlingly beautiful in this shot , taken after his arrest in New York in 1976 for possession of marijuana .
Paris Hilton , annoyingly , looks more fabulous after her September 2006 arrest for drunk - driving than in hundreds of photo spreads in the pages of glossy magazines .
In contrast to the lurid tales , guilty looks and celebrity shame of many modern mugshots , there are some pictures from police archives that reveal a quiet dignity lacking among today 's reprobates .
This picture of the civil rights legend Rosa Parks , taken by Alabama police after her 1956 arrest , was discovered in July 2004 by a deputy cleaning out a Montgomery county sheriff 's department storage room .
And this remarkable shot of a 27-year - old Martin Luther King , taken after he was arrested during the same Montgomery bus boycotts , captures something of the civil rights leader 's steely determination .
Do you have a favourite mugshot ?"
2009-04-14,"Phil Spector is likely to die in prison after the legendary music producer was convicted of murder for shooting the actor Lana Clarkson in a drunken and "" sadistic "" bout of Russian roulette .

Prosecutors said it was only by a miracle that Clarkson , star of the cult film Barbarian Queen , was the first to die .
Spector was taken to prison to await sentencing next month – he faces a minimum of 18 years in prison following his conviction for second - degree murder at his mansion six years ago .
His lawyer said he planned to appeal .
The trial has destroyed the reputation of one of the most influential music producers of the 1960s , who pioneered the "" wall of sound "" with groups such as the Ronettes .
He went on to work closely with some of the most renowned musicians of the next two decades , from the Beatles to the Ramones .
Spector 's wife , Rachelle , sobbed as the decision was announced .
Clarkson 's relatives were "" pleased "" with the verdict , their spokesman told reporters .
With the actor 's mother Donna standing by him , lawyer John Taylor said : "" The family is pleased the jury rejected the distortion and trashing of Lana Clarkson 's life . ""

Weinberg even showed jurors the gun that killed Clarkson , pointing it toward his own head as he argued that the bloodstains on the handle proved it had been in her hands when it was fired . ""
Phil Spector 's DNA was nowhere on that gun , "" Weinberg said .
"" Every single fact says this is a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
How do you ignore it ?
How do you say this could have been a homicide ? ""
Wienberg also attacked the testimony of Spector 's chauffeur , who alleged that the producer came out of his house and said : "" I think I killed somebody . ""
The driver , Weinberg said , was tired and hungry , his English was not great and a fountain was running next to the car .
"" How do you know [ what he said ] was n't ' Call somebody ' ? ""
Spector , who did not take the witness stand in either trial , sat with his hands shaking , looking down at the table before him .
Clarkson 's mother , Donna , is expected to press ahead with a wrongful death suit against Spector , whose fortune was once estimated to amount to tens of millions of dollars but has been greatly depleted by the cost of his two murder trials ."

2009-05-29,"The music producer Phil Spector has today been given a sentence of 19 years to life in prison for the murder of the Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson in 2003 .
Spector , 69 , credited with creating the key to the 60s pop music sound with his "" Wall of Sound "" production technique , was convicted in April of second - degree murder by a Los Angeles jury after a second trial .
Lana Clarkson , 40 , died of a shot to the mouth , fired from Spector 's gun in the lobby of his home near Los Angeles on 3 February 2003 .
During the second trial , the jury spent nearly nine days deliberating over the case in which the prosecution portrayed Spector as a misogynist with a history of pulling guns and "" playing Russian roulette with the lives of women "" while drunk .
Prosecutors said it was only by a miracle that Clarkson , star of the cult film Barbarian Queen , was the first to die ."
2009-05-30,"Phil Spector was yesterday sentenced to life in prison for murdering a woman he met at a Hollywood nightclub in 2003 .
The judge at Los Angeles superior court ordered that the music producer , aged 69 , serve a minimum of 19 years .
Lana Clarkson , 40 , met Spector while a hostess at the House of Blues on Sunset Strip .
Hours later her body was found slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector 's home , known as the "" Alhambra castle "" , with a bullet wound through her mouth .
A first jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict , as required by Californian law , in a five - month televised trial in 2007 .
A second jury this April unanimously found him guilty of second - degree murder .
The producer , famous for his "" ' wall of sound "" recording technique and bizarre behaviour , spared no expense on his defence , spending millions hiring and firing lawyers , at one point employing six .
In the trial his driver gave evidence of hearing a shot before Spector emerged from the house holding a gun , saying "" I think I killed somebody . ""
Spector 's defence argued that Clarkson , who had starred in such B - movies as the Barbarian Queen , committed suicide after complaining of being unable to find work .
But the trial heard testimony that Spector had on previous occasions threatened women with a gun when they tried to leave his company .
In pinstripe suit and red silk tie , Spector showed no emotion on hearing his sentence .
Clarkson 's mother , Donna , in a statement said : "" I 'm very proud of Lana … no one should suffer the loss of a child . ""
Spector 's wife , Rachelle , a singer , and son Louis attended yesterday 's hearing .
He said : "" I 'm torn about this .
I 'm losing my father who 's going to spend his life in jail .
At the same time , justice is served . ""
Spector 's lawyer , Doron Weinberg , said he would appeal : "" Mr Spector did not kill Lana Clarkson .
We hope by the time we 're through we 'll be able to prove that . """
2009-06-05,"Bringing a slice of 1960s Holloway Road slap bang into the centre of town comes Music From Meeksvile , a night in thrall to the squiggly sounds of Joe Meek , the cult music producer , who - had he not shot himself , after shooting his landlady , no less - back in 1967 , would have been 80 this year .
Essentially the lo - fi British Phil Spector - and that includes their unfortunate predilection for guns and paranoia - Meek recorded the likes of Tom Jones , Screaming Lord Sutch , the Tornados , Gene Vincent and Billy Fury in his unique , reverb - heavy way .
Worshipping at the feet of Meek this evening are DJs Phil Istine from The Acid Gallery and The Beatrocket and Stuart Freed from the Joe Meek RGM Appreciation Society , which formed the year Meek died .
In a couple of weeks , Telstar - the Nick Moran movie telling Meek 's sad story - is released ; do your pre - film research here ."
2009-06-08,"Phil Spector and his fellow inmates are "" treat[ed ] worse than animals "" , according to the legendary producer 's wife .
As Spector begins his 19-year sentence for the murder of Lana Clarkson , Rachelle Spector has condemned prison conditions – and continues to proclaim her husband 's innocence .
"" I did n't think he 'd last a week , "" she told the Los Angeles Times .
"" He 's a real small and fragile man . ""
Rachelle Spector is an unlikely wife for the 69-year old music mogul .
Just 28 years old , she had "" no idea who he was "" when they met , preferring Marilyn Manson to the Beatles or the Ronettes .
But despite the 41-year age difference , Rachelle insists she 's not a "" gold - digger "" .
"" I do n't take anything from my husband , and I never have , "" she said .
"" I 'm a good person , but people do n't see any of that or know how hard I work . ""
Rachelle Spector was a constant presence at both of her husband 's murder trials ( the first ended with a hung jury ) , and now regularly visits him in jail .
Indeed , the events of 3 February , 2003 have dominated their relationship .
Phil Spector had already been indicted for the murder of Lana Clarkson when he and Rachelle were married – and the ceremony took place in the foyer where Clarkson was shot .
"" Why would n't I ? ""
Rachelle said .
"" I sit in [ the ] chair [ where Clarkson died ] all the time . ""
Spector still lives in the heavily mortgaged Alhambra mansion and oversees both her husband 's accounts and his legal appeal .
"" I do n't believe any of it , "" she says of his crime .
Though five different women testified at trial that the producer had pulled guns on them while drunk , Rachelle insists "" that man could n't hurt a fly "" .
A prosecutor has pointed out that all of Spector 's guns were seized at the time of his arrest – before the marriage to Rachelle .
Now , she complains , Spector is "" locked in a five - by - nine cell , 23 1/2 hours a day "" .
She is counting down the days until 2028 , when her husband will become eligible for parole .
And she takes her hot pink Blackberry telephone everywhere .
"" Whenever he calls , I answer . """
2009-06-12,"Great record producers tend to be eccentric , if not outright demented .
Convicted murderer Phil Spector claimed the only sane member of his family was his sister , and she was in an asylum .
Brian Wilson believed his pioneering techniques during the making of the Beach Boys ' Smile resulted in an outbreak of forest fires in California .
But compared to Joe Meek , the maverick behind early-60s hits Telstar by the Tornados and Johnny
Remember Me by John Leyton , they seem merely quirky .
Telstar - Nick Moran 's long - gestating biopic of Meek - recreates with camp relish the world Meek belonged to : a postwar , pre - Swinging London in which rock stars travelled in battered Luton vans on package tours , musicians barely made a living , and homosexuality was illegal .
Meek , who graduated from tinkering with electronics in his parents ' shed to making No 1 hits from a flat on Holloway Road , was both a victim of this world and a part of it .
Brilliantly inventive but blinkered - he turned down the Beatles four times
- Meek was given to psychopathic rages .
Driven insane by paranoia , police persecution , declining sales and lust for his protege
Heinz , Meek killed his landlady then himself on 3 February , 1967 .
He was also behind with the rent .
Meek was the first to see the potential of turning the studio into an instrument .
Taking up songs written by a shy pianist called Geoff Goddard , he used anything from backwards tapes to speeded - up recordings to create a futuristic yet domestic sound , hinting at a new age while belonging to the old one .
Sessions might feature musicians dropping marbles into a toilet or being threatened at gunpoint - as happened to Jimi Hendrix drummer Mitch Mitchell - all fuelled by endless cups of tea .
As is the way with control freaks , his genius was his downfall .
He was incapable of seeing that Heinz was little more than a peroxide peacock of great vanity and little talent .
He made terrible business decisions out of a refusal to relinquish power over his empire .
Convinced he had psychic powers , Meek set up tape machines in graveyards and captured the miaows of a cat he believed was asking for help .
All the while , society was moving on , making his world of Buddy Holly obsessions and furtive encounters in toilets increasingly anachronistic .
By 1965 the writing was on the wall .
The Beatles were the biggest band on the planet and Bob Dylan turned the pop song into a subject of academic consideration .
Meek attempted to adapt , getting Heinz to record a chirpy version of Dylan 's
Do n't Think
Twice
It 's Alright , but the B - side to the Tornados ' final 1966 single showed where his interest really lay .
Do You Come Here Often ?
features a conversation between two men in what seems to be the toilet of a gay club .
Convicted of "" importuning for immoral purposes "" , blackmailed by rent boy acquaintances and bankrupt , Meek must have felt he had nothing to lose by making the first openly gay record .
A year later , homosexuality was decriminalised .
But Meek was already dead , a victim of both his own rage and the brief , repressive period in British history he captured in sound .

Telstar is out on Friday"
2009-07-28,"Convicted cult leader Charles Manson is reported to have reached out to convicted music producer Phil Spector , suggesting that the two jailbirds collaborate on pop songs .
Both men are serving life sentences in institutions in the central California city of Corcoran .
According to the New York Post , Manson , who is in Corcoran State Prison , is said to have contacted Spector shortly after the producer arrived last month at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran , dispatching a guard with a note . ""
[ Manson ] said he wanted him to come over to his [ cell ] , "" Spector 's wife , Rachelle , told the New York Post - an assertion later disputed by California 's department of corrections . ""
He said he considers Philip the greatest producer who ever lived . ""
Certainly Manson has a right to an opinion .
Though his clan , the Manson Family , are known as killers , they were also conceived as a music group .
Before launching the murder conspiracy that killed Sharon Tate , Manson and his followers recorded songs with the Beach Boys ' Dennis Wilson .
Terry Melcher , who produced the Byrds ' Turn , Turn , Turn , was another acquaintance – and a target – of the group .
Spector managed to avoid the Manson Family , mixing instead with the Supremes , Ike and Tina Turner , and Manson 's beloved Beatles .
"" I think Manson wants to glean some musical advice from Phil , who was a 60s music god with his ' Wall of Sound , ' "" Spector 's publicist Hal Lifson told the New York Post . ""
Phil 's like , ' I used to pick up the phone
and it was John Lennon or Celine Dion or Tina Turner , and now Charles Manson is trying to get a hold of me ! '
"" And even though Spector must serve at least 19 more years for the murder of Lana Clarkson , he is still not interested in a Manson team - up . ""
It was creepy , "" Rachelle Spector said .
"" Philip did n't respond . ""

40 Day Dream rolls in irresistibly , combining the Faces , Arcade Fire and Phil Spector in a marvellous , good - natured piece of what in the 80s was known as "" the Big Music "" .
It 's the one that will have crowds cheering and singing along when they play live - but there 's a risk those same crowds will be chatting away through the rest of the set .
It 's not that there 's anything badly wrong with Up from Below - Jade has the pleasing sound of a late 60s psychedelic band imagining what "" courtly "" music might be like ; Come In Please freewheels attractively ; a debt to Love 's Forever Changes is owed throughout .
The Magnetic Zeroes are keen to present themselves as some sort of psychedelic cult , spreading joy wherever they go .
They might recall that the Polyphonic Spree did something very similar - until the public cottoned on to the need for more and better songs .
It 's easy to imagine the Zeroes turning plenty of heads before a similar letdown follows ."
2009-08-20,"Phil Spector has expressed fears for his safety while serving a prison sentence for the murder of actress Lana Clarkson .
The record producer , who was convicted in April of shooting Clarkson , spoke of his worries in a letter to his friend and music journalist Steve Escobar .
Spector also expressed a desire to move to a different jail , claiming that his legal team were working "" to get a better prison with people more like myself in it ... instead of all these lowlife scumbags , gangsters and Manson types "" .
The 69-year - old is serving a minimum of 19 years at Corcoran State Prison in California .
As well as describing the place as a "" snake pit "" he also complained about having been sent to the same prison as notorious criminals such as cult leader Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan , who murdered Bobby Kennedy in 1968 .
Spector wrote : "" Imagine sending me to the same prison – shows how low they can go .
They 'd kill you in here for a 39-cent bag of soup ! ""
Spector remained upbeat on some issues , however , including the weekly visits from his wife Rachelle .
"" She 's a real trouper , "" Spector said of her 800-mile round - trips .
"" It 's like a dream come true having her by my side again . ""
He also mentioned how Rachelle brought him packages of food , which enabled him to avoid the prison dining rooms . ""

A pop concoction packed with twangy hooks and dreamy melodies , it sounds like a fantasy fusion of the Phil Spector - produced Ronettes and C86-era indie stars the Primitives .
Laden with echo , harmonies and guitar solos , you 'd never guess the songs carried slyly subversive sentiments such as Boys Who Rape ( Should Be Destroyed ) , or that Bang ! revels in a chorus of "" The kids wanna fuck out in the street "" .
They have clearly had a lot of fun making this record , and from the weirdly thrilling melancholy of Last Dance to the Jesus and Mary Chain - style remodel of the Rolling Stones ' Heart of Stone , it deserves to be widely heard ."

2010-02-25,"From Phil Spector to Arcade Fire , pop has often found much success in strapping a set of songs to a wind tunnel of sound , and the third Frightened Rabbit album repeats the trick again .
On the uplifting Swim Until You Ca n't See Land , Scott Hutchinson 's cry of "" All I am is a body adrift in water , salt and sky "" sounds like someone finding epiphany in waves of sound .
It helps that the songwriting is sharp throughout , and most of their songs – with themes of escape , freedom and reinvention – have huge impassioned choruses that are made to be shouted from the nearest available mountain .
With Selkirk man Hutchinson 's strong Scottish vocals raising similar goosepimples to Glasvegas 's James Allan , this is the sound of a band upping their game , almost a shoegazing Big Country , from the enormous Skip The Youth to the instantly memorable Nothing Like You .

2010-03-23,"Jailed producer Phil Spector is reportedly nursing his wounds after being beaten up by a fellow inmate .
Although the music legend 's wife maintains "" Phil was not assaulted "" , other sources say Spector was given a thrashing after cracking a joke at a "" big guy 's "" expense . ""
Phil has quite a mouth on him , "" long - time friend Steven Escobar told the New York Daily News . ""
Not everyone understands his humour .
He said the wrong thing to the wrong inmate in the yard . ""
Although Spector initially claimed "" he fell down a flight of stairs "" , Escobar said the producer finally admitted what had happened .
The result of his wisecrack ?
A bruised nose , a black eye and the loss of two dental caps .
A representative for Rachelle Spector , the producer 's 29-year - old wife , reportedly confirmed the incident .
"" There are still safety concerns , "" the spokesperson said .
"" We do n't want the people who put him in this position to retaliate . ""
But Rachelle later insisted that her husband was "" absolutely not "" attacked .
"" My husband 's safety is the prison 's number one priority , "" she said .
"" They have him segregated in a sensitive - needs ward .
All his health concerns are being taken care of . ""
A spokesperon for California 's Corcoran prison said officials had no reports of any "" altercations "" involving Spector .
Escobar suggests Spector 's wife is simply protecting him .
After the producer criticised the jail in a letter to Escobar last year , describing his neighbours as "" lowlife scumbag gangsters "" , Spector reportedly suffered retaliation .
There are indeed records of a dental visit in December , but Rachelle Spector said it was because "" he had an abscess and issues with crowns and implants "" .
"" Anyone who meets Phil loves him , "" she insisted .
"" He 's so freakin ' funny .
He 's an idol to the other inmates .

Conversely , her vocals are elegant , and she never wastes a note , whether the song is a trip - hop weepie ( Page Unfolds ) or a Motown - influenced dance item (

These full - figured songs have ambitiously big arrangements that reference Phil Spector , and , on a love song to his daughter called Fears of a Father , a sliver of Roy Orbison 's stately melancholy .
Wife Gita 's band , the Langley Sisters , contribute yet another texture to what 's already a rich mix ; their girl - pop vocals are delicious on the jaunty Do as I Say , Not as I Do .

2010-10-12,"Al Pacino will reportedly take on the role of Phil Spector in a film about the music producer 's life .
According to the New York Times , HBO Films plans to capture Spector 's life in an as yet untitled movie , with Rain Man director Barry Levinson and writer David Mamet at the helm .
Spector was behind some of the biggest pop songs of the 1960s , notably the Ronettes ' Be My Baby and the Righteous Brothers '
You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' .
However , the producer , now aged 70 , was found guilty in 2009 of murdering actress Lana Clarkson , for which he is serving a sentence of 19 years to life .
Clarkson was shot and killed at Spector 's Los Angeles mansion in 2003 .
The producer was charged with her murder but a mistrial followed before he was eventually found guilty and sentenced last year .
During the 2009 trial , Spector racked up column inches for his outlandish choice of wigs and propensity for offering controversial soundbites , allegedly telling one reporter "" she ( Clarkson ) kissed the gun "" .
Al Pacino , also 70 , is perhaps best known for roles such as Michael Corleone in the Godfather trilogy and Tony Montana in Scarface .
Asked about his attraction to playing Spector , Pacino 's agent John L Burnham told the New York Times : "" He just saw a very interesting character to play , and he likes the sensibility of David and Barry . ""
Burnham also represents Mamet and Levinson .
The film is said to be in development stages and no projected release date has been given ."

2011-04-01,"Dum Dum Girls , On tour
Rather than a place , US indie bands of 2011 are united by time : 1986 , a moment of innocently jangling guitar and heavy reverb , and the last instance groups tried to copy the grandeur of Phil Spector 's productions using the most ramshackle of ingredients .
As with Crystal Stilts or Best Coast , Dum Dum Girls – in essence
the project of singer - guitarist Dee Dee – are all about candour and spontaneity .
This extends to the content and playing of their music .
Their debut album I Will Be ( released on Sub Pop , home also to the Vaselines ) has a coy charm , but live , they surge into the 1990s .
Whether they 're aiming for girl - group insouciance is a moot point ; they sound , refreshingly , like Ride or Lush .

A young British songwriter who has enjoyed US success with songs for Chris Brown and Miley Cyrus , now that she 's emerged with her own material , she 's done so with an eye to the world stage .
Rather than the parochial stylings of , say , Lily Allen , Jessie J has kept some of the strong language , but ramped up the volume and presentation .
At this stage , it 's the sensory assault of
Do It Like A Dude and the rather less aggressive Price Tag
( you 're right : it does sound a bit like Torn by Natalie Imbruglia ) that we know her for best .
With the release of her debut album , however , Jessie Cornish reveals more of her backstory , and a sensitive side .

As her Aphrodite : Les Folies tour arrives in the UK , so does the news that it 's the most expensive tour Kylie Minogue has ever attempted .
As if you can put a price on a golden winged horse , or a group of synchronised swimmers on a water wheel !
If the show is glamorously elaborate , however , it 's worth noting that the album that it 's nominally promoting –
2010 's Aphrodite – is really as near as Minogue is ever going to come to a back - to - basics record .
Of course , she can make a go of her torch singer persona when she 's on Later …
With Jools .
But a heartland record for Kylie is a dance record , and that – launched in Ibiza , produced by Madonna 's stalwart musical director Stuart Price , with no slow ones – is assuredly what Aphrodite is .
Of course , the hits will get an outing here .
But listen particularly for a heavy metal take on Ca n't Get You Out Of My Head .

2011-07-26,"It was often noted that Amy Winehouse 's music harked back to another age — to the heydays of Motown and soul , R&amp;B , jazz , girl groups and Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound ; it was there in the brass , in the impeccable period production and the sublime smoke and burnish of her voice .
But it was a quality that seeped into her words too , into the lyrics that nodded not to her contemporaries , but to the work of early female blues singers such as Big Mama Thornton and Ma Rainey , Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith .
These were songs sometimes written by the blueswomen themselves and occasionally contributed by male songwriters ( JC Johnson for example , who wrote Smith 's Empty Bed Blues and Waters 's You
Ca n't Do What My Last Man Did ) , but that took a female perspective – tales of hound dogs and backdoor men , coffee grinders , deep sea divers , and of love lost , deserted , thrown out and taken back again .
Pop music had often cast women as sweet , bright creatures , but Winehouse 's lyrics revealed something mulchier , messier .
Here was a woman who refused to conform – not in the eccentric mad woman in the attic mould of Kate Bush or Björk , but a woman who chose to live a little wild , follow her heart and sing of the simple stew of being female .
Her songs were filled with broad talk , cussing , drink and drugs and dicks , songs that could hinge on one magnificent , unladylike question : "" What kind of fuckery is this ?
"" She sang openly of female desire – not the squawky , shrill sexuality of Sex and the City and Ann Summers , but something truer , more physical , more serious .
She sang about the ache of the body , the need for emotion , the distracting allure of a man 's shoulders , shirt , underwear .
"" When he comes to me , I drip for him tonight , "" she sang on I
Wake Up Alone .
"" Drowned in me , we bathe under blue light . ""
She frequently gave her songs a familiar , almost domestic setting , a world of kitchen floors , chips and pitta , Tanqueray and Stella .
"" I 'm in the tub , you on the seat , "" she sang on You
Know
I 'm No Good . ""
Lick your lips as I soak my feet/
Then you notice likkle carpet burn/
My stomach drops and my guts churn .
"" It was a verse that started off like a Degas painting , naked and intimate and warmly erotic , but swiftly dissembled into something sad and messy and ruined .
And this , too , was key to Winehouse 's lyrics –
she gave you an image and then quickly swiped it away , a honeyed love scene soon dissolved into wretchedness ; over the course of an album it gave the impression of a life of instability , lived from one ramshackle lurch to the next .
But there were constants – namely addiction and passion , the flaming five - storey fire of love she always returned to in Love
Is a Losing Game , the ferocious , proprietorial female strength of Some Unholy War , the mind fogged by drugs and love and desire .
In Back to Black 's great tangle of pride and neediness we found a melding of the two : "" You love blow and I love puff , "" she sang . ""
And life is like a pipe/
And I 'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside .
"" The other constant presence was of self - recrimination and remorse .
In her lyrics Winehouse seemed to show how she screwed things up – how she should never have played the "" game "" of love in the first place , of "" teasing "" her self - esteem , and of "" this regret I got accustomed to "" .
In Tears Dry on Their Own she gives herself a stern talking - to : "" I can not play myself again , I should be my own best friend , "" she warns .
"" Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men . ""
She had a special knack in her lyrics , a trick , a twist that made her songs often startlingly truthful ; each composition would contain at least a line , an image , a turn of phrase that seems to shuck the song open .
Often that line was one which seemed to reveal something about womanhood – our obsessions , our sexuality , our needs and own wild oats : "" Even if she 's content in his warmth , "" she sang in He
Can Only Hold Her . ""
She is plagued with urgency/ Searching kisses , the miss misses/
The man that he longs to be .
"" I remember seeing Winehouse backstage at Glastonbury in 2008 – a tiny Olive Oyl tottering about between Jay - Z and Beyoncé and Jack White .
She was a little wild that night , a little precarious , and when she went to perform we all stood by the stage to watch .
At times the performance teetered on shambolic ( there was the infamous punching incident ) , but the voice was there and the swagger , and so indeed were the lyrics .
Beneath all the pantomime of the event , beneath the cocktail umbrellas in her beehive , the references to her husband , and the emaciated frame in sequins , stood a woman singing of a suffering that seemed deeply , achingly female : "" Now I take a troubled track , my odds are stacked , "" she sang as if largely to herself and her love , "" Now Blakey , I 'll go back to black . """
2011-10-28,"Singing with her friends on the stoop of a Brooklyn apartment block in the 1950s , seven - year - old Dolores "" LaLa "" Brooks could n't have imagined how her teenage years would unfold .
By 13 she was singing in an after - school programme , where she was discovered and asked to be part of a new girl group , the Crystals .
When LaLa joined the band , producer Phil Spector â€ “ currently serving a 19-year sentence for murder â€ “ used her voice to his full advantage .
And what a voice : it was like a wave breaking over the wall of sound he was creating with the band .
She sang lead on their biggest hits , Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me , and her tone is one of the most distinctive of all the girl group singers .
LaLa , now 64 , looks back fondly at the early years of recording with Spector in New York . ""
He was a sweetheart to me then , "" she drawls . ""
And a vision in all his cool clothes .
But I was a teenager , and easily impressed .
"" She was n't so impressed , though , when he left his mother , Bertha , sitting outside the studio every day . ""
She 'd sit on this crate holding a sandwich for Phil , "" she recalls , "" and he just would n't let her in .
I should have seen that as a warning : a man who does n't respect his mother does n't respect women .
"" Things turned sour when Spector relocated to Los Angeles . ""
He totally changed , "" says LaLa . ""
He lost all perspective .
I 'd be flown out to LA by myself , as a teenager , to record my vocals .
He 'd pull in different singers â€ “ including Cher â€ “ to do background vocals , and forgot about all the other young girls who had got him the praise he was now getting .
And that was just the beginning . ""
Beginning of what ?
""
Well , he 's been stealing from me , from us , since then .
Yes , he 's a genius , but he 's a thief , too .
"" She 's referring to the millions of dollars ' worth of royalties LaLa and the rest of the Crystals say they are owed by Spector .
At 19 , when LaLa had two small children , she says she would "" call up his secretary to ask for the royalty cheques we 'd been promised "" and just be "" fluffed off "" .
Spector never called back .
She could n't fight legally because she could n't afford it .
"" I have to laugh , even though his case is big , dark and horrible , because when he had to pay a million dollars to get out of jail on bail
I thought , I must be the first black woman who , from doing those songs as a teenager , has paid for a white man to get out of prison . ""
She cackles wildly .
What would she do if she saw him now ?
"" I 'd give him a hug .
I 'm not a judge , and , if he 's innocent , I do n't want him to suffer .
But you reap what you sow . ""
How so ?
"" I 'm free , you know ?
He 's stuck in a cell .
And if that ai n't karma , I do n't know what is .

Phil Spector Presents
The Philles Album Collection is out on Monday"
2012-02-04,"The mother of the actress murdered by Phil Spector has settled her wrongful death case against the legendary music producer , her lawyer has confirmed .
Donna Clarkson is "" pleased and relieved "" the civil action is over and will not be disclosing the terms of the settlement , John Taylor told the Los Angeles Times .
Lana Clarkson was shot and killed in the foyer of Spector 's mansion in Alhambra , California , nine years ago .
Her mother attended the 2009 trial every day , and testified that her daughter was upbeat and not at all suicidal , as Spector 's defence team had suggested .
Spector was convicted of murder and is serving a 19 years - to - life sentence .
His insurance company hired a lawyer to fight the civil suit , but Spector has now signed the settlement , Taylor said .
Spector , 72 , worked with some of the biggest names in the music business , including The Beatles and Ike and Tina Turner .
He produced hits including You 've Lost That Lovin' Feelin ' by the Righteous Brothers and the Ronettes ' Be My Baby .
But for all his musical genius , Spector had a dark side .
He was often described as being a bully in the studio , a man with a liking for guns and an eccentric personality .
During the five - month retrial , five female acquaintances testified that Spector had threatened them at gunpoint in incidents dating back to the 1970s ."
2012-02-22,"Phil Spector 's fight to clear his name has ended .
The US supreme court yesterday declined to hear an appeal against the legendary music producer 's murder conviction in 2009 .
The court let stand a California appeals court ruling last May that upheld Spector 's conviction for the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2003 .
The court offered no comment on the case .
Spector 's attorneys had previously claimed his constitutional right to due process was violated when a trial judge responded to remarks by an expert witness .
They argued that this had in effect transformed the judge into a witness for the prosecution .
Spector , 72 , is serving a 19-year sentence for the second - degree murder of Clarkson , an actor and waitress .
He was sentenced for shooting Clarkson at his home in Los Angeles in 2003 , although he claimed she "" kissed the gun "" and "" killed herself "" .
Earlier this month , Spector resolved a civil suit with the victim 's mother .
Donna Clarkson 's lawyer said she was "" pleased and relieved "" after Spector signed off the settlement .
Details of the deal were not revealed .
Spector â€ “ who called himself the "" tycoon of teen
"" â€ “ was one of the most important producers in pop in the early 1960s , thanks to his Wall of Sound recording technique , which he deployed on hits by the Crystals , the Ronettes , the Righteous Brothers , Darlene Love and more .
He later worked with the Beatles , as well as on solo records by John Lennon and George Harrison , and produced Leonard Cohen and the Ramones ."
2012-03-02,"The American guitarist , songwriter and arranger Billy Strange , who has died aged 81 , collaborated with many of the major figures in pop music , including Elvis Presley , the Beach Boys , Phil Spector , the Sinatra family , the Everly Brothers , Jan and Dean , Lee Hazlewood , Duane Eddy and Love .
A main player in the Hollywood session world of the 1960s , he co - wrote A Little Less Conversation for Presley and arranged These Boots Are Made for Walking for Nancy Sinatra .
He played on the Beach Boys ' Good Vibrations and Sloop John B , and on Love 's Forever Changes , one of the landmark albums of the early psychedelic era .
One of his most distinctive contributions came about when he arrived for a Spector session at Gold Star studios in Hollywood in August 1962 and found himself playing lead guitar on an extraordinary version of Zip - a - Dee - Doo - Dah , a song written for the Walt Disney film Song of the South ( 1946 ) .
Spector had turned a children 's song into a dark , pounding lament , and while the backing track was being recorded , it turned even stranger .
Unhappy with the balance of the instruments during a typical marathon session with a host of pianists , bassists , drummers and guitarists , Spector 's young recording engineer , Larry Levine , decided to turn off all the individual microphones and then bring them back up , one by one , as the musicians played .
"" We 'd spent two and a half hours recording it , and my dials were jumping all over the place , "" Levine told me in 1970 . ""
So I switched everything off .
Phil said , ' What are you doing ? '
I told him I had to start again , right from scratch . ""
Gradually the sound was reassembled , until only a single microphone remained off â€
“ the one in front of Strange 's amplifier .
By that time , however , the sound of his fuzz - tone guitar was already clearly audible , leaking into the open mics directed at the other instruments . ""
That 's it ! ""
Spector shouted , and Strange 's distant , distorted , vaguely menacing guitar solo became , along with fine lead vocals by Darlene Love and Bobby Sheen , one of the most striking features of a record that , when released under the name of Bob B Soxx and the Blue Jeans , gave Spector 's new Philles label one of its early hits , reaching the US top 10 .
Strange was born in Long Beach , California , and began his professional life as a session guitarist in the 1950s , recording country and western music for the Hollywood - based Capitol Records .
In 1962 he wrote an instrumental , Limbo Rock , to capitalise on the popularity of the Champs ' Tequila .
With words added by the producer Kal Mann , it became a hit for Chubby Checker , whose career was riding the crest of the Twist craze .
Strange became one of the busiest members of a coterie of Hollywood musicians later known as the Wrecking Crew .
Among his most enduring achievements was an arrangement for the Hazlewood song
Some Velvet Morning , which Hazlewood recorded in 1967 with Nancy Sinatra .
Strange found the perfect textures to underscore the gravelly , mysterious verses , sung by Hazlewood , and the ethereal interludes , delivered by Sinatra .
Largely ignored in its time , the record would later become a hipsters ' favourite .
He also arranged Somethin' Stupid , for Nancy and her father , Frank .
A Little Less Conversation was written with Mac Davis for the Presley film Live a Little , Love a Little ( 1968 ) .
Released as a single to coincide with the film , at a time when the singer 's popularity was on the wane , it reached No 69 in the US .
The song was later used in the film Ocean 's Eleven ( 2001 ) and a remix by the DJ Junkie XL ( Tom Holkenborg ) became a No 1 hit in 20 countries , including the UK , Japan and Australia .
At a time when instrumentals were popular , Strange recorded many albums , including Great Western Themes , English Hits of 65 , Secret Agent File , Billy Strange Plays Roger Miller , 12-String Guitar and Mr Guitar .
He appeared as an actor in Coal Miner 's Daughter ( 1980 ) , starring Sissy Spacek as the singer Loretta Lynn .
In the 1970s , he settled in Nashville to open a publishing company for the Sinatra family .
Strange was married three times â€ “ to the actor Joan O'Brien , Betty Jo Conrad and the country singer Jeanne Black .
Jeanne survives him , along with two sons and a daughter .

2012-05-11,"When Best Coast first got people 's attention , in 2010 , they smoked a lot of weed and talked about singer Bethany Cosentino 's cat , Snacks , with some frequency .
Bethany and old friend Bobb Bruno had formed a band after she returned home to LA following an aborted year at college in New York .
Their debut album , 2010 's Crazy For You , mixed Phil Spector dynamics with scuzzy lo - fi guitars , and one of its breakout hits , Our Deal , provided Drew Barrymore with her first gig as a music video director , with an extended clip starring Chloë Moretz in a pulpy gang wars tale .
Back then , their hope was that people would be "" making out to Best Coast in their cars or something .
Or smoking weed in their cars listening to it "" .
Two years on
and that 's all changed .
I meet up with Bethany at Whole Foods in Austin , Texas , where the band are about to start promoting their glossier second album , The Only Place .
She is in search of yoghurt to mix with her chia seeds , which her nutritionist has recommended she takes , owing to their health properties .
She says she does n't want people to smoke weed to Best Coast any more . ""
I hope they make out to it , "" she says , "" but they can smoke weed to Snoop Dogg instead .
I want babies to be created to this music .
I want people to have their yoghurt while listening to this record . ""
The Only Place is a summery , jangly love letter to California , bigger in sound and scope than Crazy
For You .
The title track and opener is a straight - up homage to LA .
"" We 've got the ocean , got the babes / Got the sun , we 've got the waves "" , it breezes , over Bangles - ey guitars .
It could easily be adopted by the tourist board .
"" That 's our plan , "" says Bethany .
"" We want it to be the new California Girls .
Why would you live anywhere else ?
California is the place that fixes bad moods , bad feelings , you know ?
The weather is great , the food is good , the people are nice .
The more we leave , the more we fall in love with it . ""
But there 's an introspective gloominess on the album , too .
"" You know , I think the layout of the record is more mature , "" she reflects .
"" The insert has lots of black and white photos of us .
We wanted to make this record a bit more serious , so we put a bear instead of a cat on the cover .
"" I 'm not sure she 's joking .
How does Snacks feel about that ?
"" That cat could n't care less .
As long as he has food , he 's fine .
"" ' I 'm always going to write personal music , and I do n't really care …
When you 're honest , the listener can better relate to you ' This new - found gravity comes , in part , from the upheaval caused by Crazy
For You 's unexpected success . ""
This whole record , "" Bethany explains , "" is a reflection of how things changed for me and how emotionally , my life went from not existing , in a way ...
We 're not used to spending so much time away from home . ""
The songs on The Only Place address this directly , with very literal titles : My Life , Why I Cry and Let 's Go Home among them .
The lyrics do seem more personal this time .
"" They 're personal for me and my life and what I 've been through .
I 'm always going to write personal music , and I do n't really care .
People start asking me , ' Do you feel like you 're giving away too much ? '
And I 'm like , ' No , because I do n't care .
I want to be honest . '
When you 're honest , the listener can better relate to you . ""
Both Bethany and Bobb admit to being much happier when they are n't going anywhere than they are on the road .
"" We 'll text each other from our houses , like , ' Are you watching Cops ?
Are you watching Behind The Music :
NWA ? '
I enjoy going out every once in a while , but I prefer to just be at home watching a movie and drinking some wine and hanging out .
"" I 'm not trying to dissuade you , I say , but do you ever wonder if you 've picked the wrong job ?
""
Definitely , "" Bethany nods . ""
But it 's like , I love doing this .
At the end of the day , regardless of how anxious or stressed I get , being up onstage and performing and writing and recording music , and having people come up to you and say , ' Your music has saved me ' , it 's all worth it . "" Do people say that ? ""
Young girls will say to me all the time , ' You write my life .
You write songs about the things that I go through , that I ca n't talk to people about because I 'm embarrassed
or I 'm shy or whatever . '
So it 's like I get to be the voice of a generation .
The stress is worth it . ""
' I like to be in that position , where I can literally say to people : Shut up .
I have the microphone and you do n't ! '
The day before we met , I saw some of that stress in action .
The band were playing a daytime showcase where free beer had mixed with the Texan heat to encourage a lairy and vocal crowd .
"" Play the hits ! "" shouted one drunken punter . ""
Suck my dick , "" Bethany spat back , adding , "" It 's our show , we 'll play what the fuck we want .
"" The tension was palpable .
After our Whole Foods trip , we talk about that performance ; the band abruptly left the venue , meaning our planned interview was moved to the next day .
"" That was n't the real me , "" she says , by way of explanation . ""
Whole Foods is the real me . ""
Later , Bobb joins us , and there 's a chance to get into it in more detail .
"" I was just really hot and pissed , "" says Bethany , "" so I had a Courtney Love moment .
I like to be in that position , where I can literally say to people , ' Shut up .
I have the microphone and you do n't . '
A lot of people just keep their mouths shut , but that 's not my style .
Obviously I 'm upfront and very honest . ""
At the very least , it seemed to fire up the show .
"" It definitely makes us rage harder .
Bobb pulled out a bottle of whiskey .
It 's hard to play to a crowd that does n't seem to care whether they 're seeing you .
There are some [ gigs ] where we get offstage and say , ' That crowd fucking sucked .
Er , whatever .
Let 's go have a good time together . ' ""
"" We 're not used to performing in the middle of the day , "" says Bobb , more tactfully ."

Also on the bill : a number from the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about osteopath to the stars , Steven Ward ; songs from the West End hit Charlie And The Chocolate Factory ; and Torvill and Dean celebrating the 30th anniversary of their Bolero moment .
The event will be hosted by actor / comedian John Bishop .

December Boxing Day Test , 10 am , Channel 9 With secular festivities out of the way and holidays beckoning , we can get down to the serious business of religious indulgence â€ “ namely the traditional Boxing Day test match at the MCG .
The rivalry between England and Australia is as intense as ever â€ “ even if one side are dominating proceedings
â€ “ which is just the ticket for 100,000 fans at the G and viewers willing to endure the barrage of commercials lobbed down the wicket between overs by the broadcaster .
We might not have snow and reindeer here , but the tradition of the Boxing Day test is far more significant than the furious department store sales or the Sydney / Hobart yacht race .
The Time of the Doctor , 7.30pm , ABC1 A Dr
Who Christmas special in which Matt Smith regenerates as Peter Capaldi during a 300 year - long war on the planet Trenzalore .
The conflict involves Cybermen , Daleks , Weeping Angels and Sontarans .
It would be sacrilege to say more but itâ€ ™ s a well - comported transition with Jenna Coleman along for the ride as Clara .
Call the Midwife , 8.30pm , ABC1 More time travels â€ “ this time back to the year 1958 for a Call The Midwife christmas special .
The snow lies round about Nonnatus House , deep and crisp and even but danger lurks in the form of an unexploded wartime bomb .

The President Vs The Pirates , 10 pm , SBS One
What prompted the spate of hijackings and kidnappings in waters off the horn of Africa begin ?
This doco , telling the story to date of Abdirahman Farole , the president of Puntland in the coastal north of Somalia , explains a lot that has been largely ignored in international efforts to stamp out piracy .
Farole , who had fled to Australia as a refugee , returned to Puntland after 20 years and was , against the odds , elected president on a platform of curtailing piracy and constraining jihadists of the Al - Shabaab movement .
This program focuses on the presidentâ€ ™ s vision for democracy in the region but ends on a cautionary note : two weeks after filming , the countryâ€ ™ s most senior cleric , Abdulkadir Nur Fareh was shot dead during evening prayers at his mosque .
Doors Open , 8.30pm , ABC1 Stephen Fry features as a disgruntled art curator in this cheerful caper written by Ian Rankin .
As Professor Robert Gissing , Fry curates a significant collection of Scottish artworks for a major bank .
He is appalled when bean counters decide to liquidate the precious asset .
Supervising the inventory and sale catalogue is Laura Stanton , former squeeze of
Gissingâ€ ™ s
millionaire friend , IT entrepreneur Mike McKenzie ( Douglas Henshall ) .
Central to the scam that emerges when Gissing , McKenzie and a disgruntled former bank employee , Allan Cruikshank , decide to nick some of the artworks , is a portrait McKenzie had given Laura as a gift some years earlier , and which she has since flogged .
His wounded yet on - going affection for her plays a key part in a light - hearted drama with just the right amount of comic counterpoint .
Old fashioned holiday material , itâ€ ™ s relaxed if not involving or challenging viewing .
Monday 30 December Edinburgh Military Tattoo , 8.30pm ,
ABC1 The term silly season could have been coined to describe the annual knees - up at Edinburgh Castle : marching bands , massed pipes and drums , precision drill teams and fragrant dancers in a reverent reinforcement of Celtic military traditions .
This is about spit and polish , and close - order drill â€ “ a Show - Us - Yer - Tatts spectacular conducted each August since 1950 and which attracts a global TV audience numbering 100 million .
Long - time viewers while appreciating Bill Patersonâ€ ™ s narration of the annual telecast will still yearn for the familiar tones of Alasdair Hutton who refined the curious mixture of the solemn and the sublime and who remains the voice of the event for many .
Tuesday 31 December New Yearâ€ ™ s Eve Fireworks , 9 pm and 11.55pm ,
Nine Fireworks on television are like Leunigâ€ ™ s memorable cartoon of a family watching a glorious sunrise on the telly while the real thing occurs , in full view , right outside .
True , it shares the occasion with viewers outside the Sydney metropolitan area but thereâ€ ™ s nothing like the visual actuality combined with the sensation of shock waves from maroons and the gasps of incredulous observers as clouds of cordite and gunpowder waft across the city .
Incredulity that between $ 4 m and $ 6 m has just gone up in smoke .
Watching this annual frivolity on TV means negotiating the anodyne commentary offered by network â€œpersonalitiesâ€ � who struggle to say anything more than the bleeding obvious .
There IS nothing to say and if there was , you wouldnâ€ ™ t call upon these drones with expensive dentistry to enunciate it .
Thursday 2 January Bad Education , 9 pm , ABC 2 Forget Gonski , Pyne and the venerable marshmallow twizz of To Sir With Love .
The new year kicks off with a timely and long - overdue education revolution .
Classroom dramas and comedies are nothing new of course but this series , revolving around the worst teacher ever to grace the British education system is a giant leap in the right direction .
Meet Alfie Wickers ( Jack Whitehall ) , a self - styled maverick educator at Abbey Grove Public School .
Just 23 and fresh out of teacher training heâ€
™ s completely slew - footed , naff and way less mature than most of his pupils .
Itâ€ ™ s sharp , quick and beguiling comedy , and after the ABCâ€ ™ s recent capers involving Jaâ€ ™ mie and the forthcoming return of Chris Lilleyâ€ ™ s other enfant terrible , Jonah Takalua , this is something to savour ."
2014-03-10,"The one thing Beyond the Beehive does n't offer is the hairdo Ronnie Spector made famous : the beehive of 1964 was long ago replaced by a tousled rock - star haystack .
But then the point of this audiovisual show is that the Spector of 50 years ago was a very different person .
She was Ronnie Bennett then
â€ “ ""
the rose of Spanish Harlem "" , which does n't do justice to her punky sensuality
â€ “ and her Ronettes had just met the producer Phil Spector .
What happened from there is related through music , video and anecdote , all of it bleakly dominated by the spectre of her ex - husband .
First , though , a good chunk of the show qualifies as pure joy .
Spector is a drily witty narrator , and has astonishing stories , with images to back them up .
Here are the Ronettes with Dusty Springfield , who borrowed their strong - hold hairspray ; there they are dancing in skin - tight dresses , posing a threat to the Beatles ' morals ( there was an encounter with John Lennon , but she "" stayed loyal to Phil "" , as she regretfully puts it ) .
Her singing , once the embodiment of street - urchin heartbreak , is raspier , but her versions of Walking in the Rain and ( The Best Part of )
Breakin '
Up are serviceably sassy .
So this is where Amy Winehouse â€ “ whose mother is in the audience
â€ “ got her groove .
But she ca n't sing the Ronettes ' signature hits ,
Be My Baby and Baby
, I Love
You
â€
“ Phil , she tells us balefully , has withheld permission .
And it 's their ongoing mutual rancour that forms the meat of the show .
The first photo we see of him is his prison mugshot ; henceforth , Ronnie does n't miss a chance to malign him .
His attempts to control her even extended to trying to keep the Ronettes from being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 ( "" You 'd think he 'd have been more worried about his murder trial "" ) , and she 's never forgiven him .
The stories of him imprisoning her in his mansion and her escaping barefoot are well known , but hearing them directly from her is mesmerising .
Spector teeters between justifiable wrath and a depressing inability to move on , but the show is meant to be taken as a survivor 's guide .
"" You can go through hell and still survive , "" she says , just before clearing the stage and returning for Be My Baby .
She 's allowed to perform it outside the "" theatrical "" part of the show , and rips into it as if she 's tearing off a certain someone 's head .

2014-04-11,"Fans of BBC fantasy series Merlin will remember Colin Morgan as the boy wizard who headed up the young Camelot mob , looking ever so slightly Hobbitish as he went about his business .
Over a year since the series finale and , a National TV Award later , the Northern Irish actor has landed his next big TV gig : a lead role in the second series of BBC thriller The Fall , co - starring Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan .
Confirmed to join the series from episode three , Morgan will play DS Tom Anderson , an officer who is drafted in to help hunt down Phil Spector ( Dornan ) , the serial killer who managed to bypass the police investigation headed up by DS Stella Gibson ( Anderson ) at the end of series one .
He will be joined by another newcomer , Bronagh Taggart ( London Irish ) , who will also play a main role .
The crime thriller , currently filming in Belfast , was a hit with critics when it debuted last May on BBC2 and marked the channel 's biggest drama launch in eight years .
Dornan , currently appearing in Channel 4 's historical drama New Worlds , has gone on to land the role of Christian Grey in Sam Taylor Wood 's film adaptation of E L James ' novel Fifty Shades of Grey .
Anderson will next appear in a sold - out Young Vic production of A Streetcar Named Desire starting in July .
Morgan , who began his career in theatre , was last year voted the person TV viewers would most like to see play Doctor
Who in a Radio Times poll .
On being signed up for The Fall , he said : "" I 'm delighted to be joining the cast of The Fall for what is going to be an exciting and gripping second series .
Allan Cubitt has written some exceptional material . """
2014-06-28,"Self - styled "" street beat "" exponents , Phantogram are Brooklyn 's Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter , whose debut album , Eyelid Movies , was compared to Portishead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs .
Five years on , they 're still a giddy blend of clanging electro and Barthel 's aching voice , though Phantogram are stranger than most post - xx acts .
Nothing
But Trouble echoes uber - goths Bauhaus , while Never Going Home is the soundtrack to Twin Peaks
had Phil Spector been commissioned to write it .
Occasionally , , mostly when Carter sings , Voices falls flat , but Phantogram 's audacity is commendable ."
2014-09-12,"Hometown : Madrid .
The lineup : Ana Garcia Perrote , Carlotta Cosials , Ade Martin and Amber Grimbergen .
The background : Itâ€ ™ s such a shame that Phil Spectorâ€ ™ s last production job was Starsailor .
Thatâ€ ™ s a bit like â€ ¦ hold on , there isnâ€ ™ t a more apt example of bathos in pop history than Phil Spector ending his producing career not with a bang from his Wall of Soundâ€
™ s timpani but with the whimper of James Walsh ( unless you count George Martin producing Midge Ure or Trevor Horn doing Robbie ) .
Deers would have been a more fitting final blowout .
Only formed last year , theyâ€ ™ re a duo â€ “ Ana Garcia Perrote and Carlotta Cosials
â€ “ who expand to a four - piece for gigs , like the one they did this week when they appeared ( or rather â€œruffled the spirits of everyoneâ€ � ) at Corsica Studios in London and charmed the attendees with their pidgin English and fidgety Spanish version of lo - fi garage rock with hints of 60s girl - group pop .
You can hear their amateurishly enthusiastic take on the classics on their single Barn , which follows their summer debut single , Demo .
Everything they do sounds like a demo , which for some will be the whole point .
Barn was recorded in Berlin â€ “ funny , because apparently they record using their mobile phones , so they could have done it anywhere .
None of that cityâ€ ™ s
legendary atmospheres
â€ “ the ruined grandeur of Bowie by the Wall , the shiny pummel of Tresor â€
“ has remotely affected what Deers do .
Itâ€ ™ s as rickety as if it had been made in a cupboard in Madrid .
The first CD Perrote and Cosials listened to was Room on Fire , which makes sense : they sound like kids bashing away at the Strokesâ€ ™ back catalogue with more passion than finesse .
Lead track Bamboo moves at the pace of the Velvets in morphine blues mode .
Lou Reed would have loved it .
Mike Read wouldnâ€ ™ t .
Itâ€ ™ s one of those rock ballads that sounds more seedy than weepy .
It has an edge , an undertone .
It twangs with tinny , trebly tremolo as the ladies complain about their geeky boyfriend poring â€ “ as geeky boyfriends tend to do , even in Spain â€ “ over their precious C86 collection .
â€œI need you to feel like a man when I give you all I am , â€ � they sing (
term used advisedly for vocals that approximate Veruca Salt â€ “ the spoiled brat , not the band â€ “ doing an impression of Nico doing an impression of Ronnie Spector ) .
â€œI
know youâ€ ™ re not hungover today
, you are classifying your cassettes.â€
�
Castigadas en el Granero translates as â€œPunished in the Barnâ€ � â€ “ one imagines they werenâ€ ™ t baling hay in there .
This one is faster , more Roadrunner than Pale Blue Eyes , all chugging repetition , because thatâ€ ™ s how to build intensity and thatâ€ ™ s what rockâ€ ™ nâ€ ™ roll does .
Trippy Gum revisits the squalid splendour of Dion / Spectorâ€ ™ s Born to Be with You , only lacking the grandiose production , although there are intimations of epicness : with time , and money , they could go that way .
There is also an extended fuzzy guitar solo that appears to have been played by someone wearing gloves .
Finally , Holograma , a cover of a track by Los Nastys , is 80 seconds short , acoustic , raw , simple , crude â€ “ all the stuff that gives rock critics the bends .
The buzz : â€œEffortless knack for crafting charming , infectiously ramshackle garage pop
jamsâ€ �
â€ “ Gorilla vs Bear .
The truth : They give ramshackle a good name .
Most likely to : Get caught in a barn .
Least likely to : Get caught in a chocolate factory .
What to buy : Barn is released as a limited 7â€ � vinyl and download by Lucky Number on November 3 .

2015-12-02,"The voice startles first : almost exactly the mixture of sand and honey , innocence and wantonness , that entranced Phil Spector into producing some of the greatest pop singles of the 60s with the Ronettes .
Then thereâ€ ™ s the hair : now a more relaxed version of the famous beehive beloved of Amy Winehouse , but still big enough to house a family of small animals .
Itâ€ ™
s hard to believe that this extraordinary woman with a teenagerâ€ ™ s physique and the audience hanging on her every word is 72 .
She was 17 when she left her native New York for Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles .
Decades later , her only concession to age comes when she sits between songs .
But that is when we get the stories : how the young Ronettes stuffed Kleenex in their bras , shared a bus with the â€œscragglyâ€ � Rolling Stones , and gave Dusty Springfield a Ronette beehive .
Spector wipes something from her eyes as she mentions her late sister and fellow Ronette Estelle , but this is a feel good show .
The top - drawer setlist stretches from Ronettes hits to Winehouseâ€ ™ s Back to Black .
Before Johnny Thundersâ€ ™ You Canâ€ ™ t
Put Your Arms Around a Memory
, Spector reveals that she found the ill - fated New York Doll weeping through one of her shows , and later recorded his song with Joey Ramone .
The famous drum beat kicks off
Be My Baby ,
the signature wall of sound that remains
Brian Wilsonâ€ ™ s favourite song and typifies perfect pop .
By Frosty the Snowman and I Can Hear Music , the audience are on their feet .
Thereâ€ ™ s no mention of Spectorâ€
™ s ex - husband Phil , currently serving a life sentence for murder , but having long fled his clutches sheâ€ ™ s finally reminding the world that Ronnie Spector is a legend too .

2015-12-06,"Albums of covers are usually a stopgap in pop careers , but this third offering from the South Carolina duo proves a delightful exception , providing a showcase for their gutsy Americana and the talents of assorted southern friends .
Itâ€ ™ s a mixed bag that includes favourites from their teenage years
â€ “ they go psychobilly with Nine Inch Nailsâ€ ™
Last , while the Milk Carton Kids coo Guns Nâ€ ™ Rosesâ€ ™ Patience â€ “ alongside country standards like Emmylou Harrisâ€ ™
s Leaving Louisiana and Neil Youngâ€ ™ s Unknown Legend .
Everything comes with S&amp;Râ€ ™ s clattering production
â€ “ think home studio Phil Spector â€ “ and soaring harmonies , though
itâ€ ™ s fellow travellers Shakey Graves and JD McPherson who steal the vocal honours .
Clearly it was fun for all ."
2016-06-14,"When Chicago - based hairstylist Margaret Vinci Heldt , who has died at age 98 , invented the beehive in 1960
itâ€ ™ s unlikely she thought weâ€ ™ d still be discussing it almost 60 years later
â€ “
but here we are .
Inspired by the shape of a fez - style hat , popularised in the 1960s by people like Jackie Onassis , she developed the beehive to slot into the hollow to , you know , avoid the accursed hat hair .
The hairstyle might be synonymous with the sixties and Phil Spector ( see The Ronettes , Dusty Springfield , Aretha Franklin ,
The B52s , all early adopters ) but itâ€ ™ s endured , via Amy Winehouse , Adele , Marge Simpson , John - Paul Gaultierâ€ ™ s SS12 Couture collection and Moschino earlier this year .
Still , onwards and upwards , and if her death says anything about this high , round conical look , itâ€ ™ s that itâ€ ™ s one of the remaining styles immune to evolution , modernisation and , well , trends , almost bypassing fashion altogether .
Brigitte Bardotâ€ ™ s dishevelled take on the beehive â€ “ low , done / undone â€
“ was nicknamed the choucroute and arguably has had as much longevity as her namesake Bardot top .
Of all the beehives , Margeâ€ ™ s is the most off - piste ( unsurprisingly , given that sheâ€ ™ s a cartoon ) .
Yet she often referenced its origins by shoehorning it , tardis - like , into a hat .
Along with leopardprint and ballet flats , Amy Winehouseâ€ ™ s beehive became her trademark look , but was laden with symbolism : â€œThe more insecure I feel , the bigger my hair has to be ,
â€ � she once said .
Jeremy Scottâ€ ™ s
tenure at Moschino has seen a happy mash - up of retro and femininity so that his SS16 collection was heavy on the demi - beehives was no accident ."
